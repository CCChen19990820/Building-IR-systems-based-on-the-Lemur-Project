The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations report 200 forest
fires, affecting over 9,500 hectares in the eastern Siberian
Irkutsk Region and Krasnoyarsk Territory. Forest fires are also
ablaze in Moscow, Murmansk and Vologda.  ("Russia: forest fires
registered even in the Moscow region",  Novecon, 9 August
1994).<P>

Note: In August 1992, wildfires raged through southern Siberia
during the worst drought in the region this century.  Thousands
of fires destroyed millions of hectares of forests and crops.<P>

<H3><B>WARMER TEMPERATURES MEANS BIGGER WAVES IN NORTH ATLANTIC?
</B></H3><P>

Average wave heights in the northeast Atlantic have increased in
the last 30 years, according to Britain's Institute of
Oceanographic Science.  Global warming is considered one of the
possible causes.  With no corresponding increase in wind speed,
North Atlantic waves are showing a clear increase in average
height, and storms have also increased in frequency in northern
waters.  Norway in particular has seen some very turbulent
conditions with waves between 1989 and 1993 reaching
unprecedented levels. In 1989, record low atmospheric pressures
saw wave heights up to 13 metres, and the three months following
December 1992 broke all records, with waves in mid-Norway
averaging 5.2 metres for the whole period, peaking at 13.6 and
record waves of 14 and 16 metres off the north coast.  ("Monster
waves invade North  Atlantic puzzling experts, endangering
sailors: researchers look at global warming as possible cause", 
The Ottawa Citizen, 6 August 1994).<P>

<H3><B>MALE REPTILES LOSE OUT IN A GLOBAL WARMING WORLD?
</B></H3><P>

Reptile species such as lizards, crocodilians and most turtles
may face a survival test next century as a consequence of rising
air temperatures.  Sex determination for these species is
temperature dependent and recent research suggests that warmer
air temperatures favour the hatching of females over males. A
study of painted turtles on the Mississippi River  found that
nearly 100 percent of hatchings were female during the warmest
summers. While a male shortage is unlikely to endanger painted
turtles, warmer temperatures may be a problem for already
threatened reptile species such as the Galapagos tortoise or the
American alligator. ("Global warming could make males scarce in
reptile circles", The Toronto Star, 27 August 1994).<P>

Note: A five year study of loggerhead turtles in Florida also
shos that temperature increases skew hatchings towards females,
up to 99.9 percent of the population.  According to Canadian
researchers: "Demonstrations of sex-ratio evolution in faster
maturing species do not make it safe to assume that turtles will
survive rapid global warming.  Indeed one conceivable explanation
of the skewed sex rations in our study is that the climate at
Cape Canaveral has already started to change, and the sand
temperatures for 1986-1990 were above the average recorded over
the last few hundred years."  (N. Mrosvovsky & J. Provancha, "Sex
ration of hatching loggerhead sea turtles: data and estimates of
a five year study", "Canadian Jnl of Zoology, v.70, p.530-538,
1992).<P>

An insect-borne fungus, believed to be originally from Mexico is
devastating California's fast growing Monterey pines and could
soon threaten other valuable conifers. Symptoms of the disease
include bark lesions and wilting or shed needles. The disease was
first noticed in Monterey pines in 1986 and since then has spread
rapidly with nearly 85 percent of the species in Santa Cruz and
Monterey affected. ("Monterey pines", Associated Press, 30

<H3><B>CORAL BLEACHING LINKED TO GLOBAL WARMING </B></H3><P>

Greenpeace warns Pacific nations at the South Pacific Forum that
mass coral reef bleaching occurring in their region could be an
early sign of global warming.  Greenpeace consultant, Dr Ove
Hoegh-Guldberg, a coral expert from the University of Sydney,
investigated reports  of bleaching around Tahiti and concluded:
"the bleaching was linked to unusually high sea temperatures". A
French team based in Tahiti tracked unusually warm water
enveloping the reefs just ahead of the bleaching event, and noted
that the same warm water appears to have caused bleaching in the
Cook Islands and American and West Samoa at the same time. So
serious have these reports been considered by US marine
scientists that Vice President Gore has agreed to fund an
immediate research project on Pacific coral reef bleaching.

Polynesia", Greenpeace International, 1994).<P>

Typhoon Doug follows hot on the heels of Typhoon Caitlin which
rips through eastern and central Taiwan, killing eight people,
cutting major roads, and setting off floods and landslides.  Doug
kills more than 20 people, brings the heaviest rains in 30 years,
maroons 15,000 people in the central mountains region and floods 
large areas of the southern port city of Kaohsiung. More than
12,000 hectares of crops are damaged.  Typhoon Gladys follows,
killing more people, flooding the northeast and sinking an Indian
cargo ship.  Total losses from August's typhoons reach
NT$9.39billion, with Typhoon Doug ringing in at NT$6.1billion.

Most of Europe swelters in a heat wave that  starts in July and
lasts more than six weeks. Germany, Netherlands, Hungary and
Poland all report record temperatures in the high thirties.  The
heatwave is caused by a series of high pressure systems from the
Atlantic and North Sea, pushing up warm, humid air from the
Mediterranean and blocking cooler air. Water levels in all Polish
rivers are dangerously low. After two scorching months, Hungary
is suffering from drought which threatens crops worth millions of
dollars.  Railway lines in the Czech Republic are bent in the hot
conditions while warm sea temperatures in the Baltic cause a
poisonous bloom of red and blue algae. Albania experiences its
hottest temperatures of the century with a top of 41ÉC, ("Records

Five centimetres of rain fall within 12 hours on the English
capital, more than the total rainfall for June and July combined.
These months had been particularly dry, receiving only a quarter
of their usual rainfall. The torrential rains force the closure
of nearly 30 underground stations and cause traffic chaos. The
London Weather Centre reports that while such storms are typical
in the English summer, they do not usually strike London.

away buildings and spread oil, sewage and rubbish throughout the
flooded towns. Damage is estimated at $22 million. ("Alaskan
floods displace residents, pollute villages", Reuter, 1 September
1994; "Damage estimate boosted for Alaska flood", Reuter, 2

Sustained heavy rain and the release of flood water from the
Farakka dam in India cause major floods in northern Bangladesh,
and diseases such as dysentery spread rapidly via contaminated
water and food supplies.  70,000 are made homeless and nearly
300,000 marooned, and  50,000 hectares of rice and paddy crops
destroyed.  Heavy seas and high winds sink 14 coastal fishing
boats and kill at least 10 people.  At the same time, lack of
rain threatens crops in much of the rest of the country.  
Weather officials report the June-August monsoon rainfall was
260mm less than average.   ("Floods kill two, drought burns crops
in Bangladesh", Reuter, 15 August 1994; "Floods kill 22
Bangladeshis, over 250,000 marooned", Reuter, 19 August 1994;

<H3><B>RECORD HEAT THEN FLOODS FOR JAPAN </B></H3><P>

The worst drought in recent memory and record high temperatures
reduce water reservoirs to dangerously low levels. Tokyo records
a new high of 39.1 degrees celsius.   Doctors blame high
temperatures and humidity for skyrocketing sudden deaths, which
so far number 704, the highest number in 10 years.  Over 30
people drown as millions flock to the coast to escape the
oppressive heat.  Relief comes in the form of violent
thunderstorms which flood homes and streets and set off
landslides in the Tokyo region.  263mm of rain falls in Yokohama.
Unfortunately the drenching is insufficient to break the drought
or prevent drought-induced economic losses from the agricultural,
fishery and forestry industries. currently estimated at US$597
million. ("In Japan, too, the weather creates unwelcome records",

After several weeks of record-breaking heat, violent storms
batter northern and western France. Lightning kills two people,
injures ten others and sets several houses alight.  The fierce
winds rip roofs off houses in Rostrenen, Brittany and Laignes. 
The storms cut power lines and damage crops; several campsites 
are evacuated.  Power supplies to the Paris Stock Exchange are
cut, bringing transactions to a standstill for almost an hour.

Prolonged drought, high winds and elevated temperatures are the
main reasons presented for one of the worst fire seasons Spain
has ever experienced, according to the country's Agriculture and
Fisheries Minister.<P>

Forest fires have killed 23 people and devastated 280,000
hectares of forest and brush in eastern and southern Spain, with
the regions of Catalonia, Valencia and Andalusia the worst
affected.  Spain has suffered record high temperatures this
summer, with average temperatures 2.7 degrees higher than the
average for the past three decades. ("Forest fires cost Spain

Italy's heatwave, with almost daily temperatures of 40 oC in the
south, encourages fierce fires across Tuscany, Abruzzi, Umbria,
Calabria and Sardinia. A 40km fire front destroys 6,000 hectares
of bushland on the Italian holiday island of Sardinia.   Hot and
windy conditions on nearby Corsica ignite fires that destroy
7,000 hectares of bushland.  In France, blazes break out on the
Cote d'Azur as well as near the Italian border and the city of
Nice.  Outbreaks continue into the month, consuming  750 hectares
of forests and farmland on Crete and killing one person in
Sicily. ("Forest fires rage in Sardinia and elsewhere", Agence

While floods besiege the north, and droughts devastate the south
and central regions of China, the eastern province of Zhejiang is
devastated by Typhoon Fred, the region's worst storm in 160
years.  The typhoon leaves 1,000 dead in the city of Wenzhou, and
a further 2 million stranded by floods.  Damage to farmland,
buildings, power lines and roads, and thousands of factory
closures, leaves Zhejiang facing an estimated economic loss of
US$1 billion.  The State Flood and Drought Prevention
Headquarters report that nine typhoons have hit China thus far
this year, compared to a yearly average of five or six. Nearby in
Taiwan, Typhoon Fred inundates hundreds of households in the
island's northeast. ("Relief work continues after killer typhoon

Floods in Liaoning and Inner Mongolia in China's northeast
besiege thousands of villages, affecting over two and a half
million people and killing fifteen.  About 770,000 hectares of
farmland and over 360,000 houses are damaged in Liaoning, 
Economic losses in agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and
fisheries total 3.39 billion yuan.  Flood damage to postal and
telecommunications infrastructure and hundreds of industrial and
mining projects,  including 1900 oil wells,  will cost China a
total of 1.59 billion yuan. After suffering a succession of dry
spells, floods, fires, insect plagues and windstorms since the
beginning of the year, Inner Mongolia province has been struck
again by floods, possibly the worst in decades.  Forty-nine
thousand people are homeless, 3 million kg of grain has been
washed away, and over half a million hectares of farmland is
damaged, with total financial losses from the disaster placed at
2.4 billion yuan. ("Liaoning Ribao", BBC Summary of World
Broadcasts, 24 August, 1994; "Neimenggu Ribao",  BBC Summary of
World Broadcasts, 24 August, 1994). And after the floods comes
cholera. Zhejiang, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces now face a
severe  outbreak of cholera and other diseases including
hepatitis and dysentery. ("Cholera breaks out in China's flood",
Kyodo News Service, 11 August, 1994).<P>

Meanwhile, the drought in central and southern China continues.
The provinces affected now include Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan,
Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi.  Brought on by unusually dry and hot
August conditions the drought now covers 16.2 million hectares of
cropland.  At the same time, drought-besieged areas in the south
are continuing to experience temperatures above 35ÉC, with peaks
up to 38 or 39ÉC, affecting some 26.53 million people and 18.4
million livestock.  Reports from two of the seven provinces
affected by the dry spell say the drought is the worst seen in 60
years.  Rains brought to the drought-stricken south by Typhoon
Fred, which battered the eastern province  of Zhejiang, were
insufficient to relieve the drought. ("Drought worsening in six
central provinces", New China News Agency, 15 August, 1994;

Thai farmers devastated by the July floods again find themselves
fleeing from floods. 1,700 people are homeless and crops
destroyed across fifteen provinces in the region near Chiang Mai
city, after the worst floods in ten years. At least nine people
are confirmed drowned or buried by landslides in central and
northern Thailand.  Officials report that the severe storms which
brought the rain are uncharacteristic for this  season and are
associated with a low pressure system named Amy that has
persisted over this part of the country since late July. 
Thousands of hectares of agricultural land, most of it in rice,
are damaged and officials are calling for emergency funds of 200
million baht to relieve stricken farmers.   ("Thailand: Weather

<H3><B>RECORD RAINS FLOOD SUDAN AND ETHIOPIA </B></H3><P>

Heavy rains in Sudan swell the Blue Nile and Atbara Rivers beyond
levels reached in the record 1988 flood that killed scores of
people and made half a million homeless.  The affected area
stretches from the northern town of Dongola to the Blue Nile
province near the Ethiopian border.  Dongola is inundated when
the Nile bursts its banks, forcing thousands to flee their homes,
and at least one village in the province of Northern Kordofan is
swept away by the torrents. In Ethiopia, flood waters kill over
80 people and leave another 3,000 homeless, destroying 7,770
hectares of farmland and sweeping away nearly 6,000 head of
livestock. ("Disaster threatens as the Nile swells", IPS, 16
August, 1994; "Over 80 killed and more than 3,000 left homeless

Possibly the worst drought on record currently extends  over 80
percent of the state of New South Wales, including  major farming
and growing areas. Wheat producers project losses of Aus$600m,
cotton growers stand to lose Aus$400m and wool farmers face a
Aus$100m downturn in production.  The Treasury department
announces that the drought will cost the country billions of
dollars and will adversely affect anticipated growth in
Australia's already recessed economy. The Bureau of Meteorology
forecasts an even chance that the dry spell will stretch well
into 1995 as a consequence of the El Nino. ("Bone dry: drought
grips 83pc of NSW", Telegraph Mirror, 31 August, 1994; "Worsening
drought costs State 'billions'", Sydney Morning Herald, 2 August,

Recent research suggests that the El Nino-linked periodic dry
spells experienced in the West Kalimantan region of  Indonesia
have been growing in intensity during the past 30 years, with
associated economic losses, especially in small villages.  (N.
Salafsky, "Drought in the rain forest: effects of the 1991 El
Nino-Southern Oscillation event on a rural community in West
Kalimantan, Indonesia", Climatic Change, v.27, p.373-396, August
1994).<P>

 Note: Rainforests in Australia have also suffered from the
unprecedented drought conditions of recent times.  In 1991, the
first recorded case of Australian rainforests dying in drought
was reported by Dr Michael Olsen from the University of
Queensland.  The absence of effective rain for eight months
severely dehydrated many vegetation species, many possibly beyond
recovery.  Normally fire-resistant species became vulnerable to
fire, and weeds such as lantana took hold in the warm and dry
conditions.  Fruit-eating birds were reported to be declining
while platypus communities starved as their habitats dried up.
(Sydney Morning Herald, 19 November 1991).<P>

<H3><B>CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN </B></H3><P>

Using a General Climate Model (GCM) and supposing a doubling of
atmospheric CO2,  M. Segal of the University of Kansas and
colleagues have predicted modifications to the climate of the
eastern Mediterranean region, and in particular to its water
balance. They predict that rainfall will decline in the southern
parts of the region, while it will increase in the northeast.
Snowfall in the southeast Mediterranean will be replaced by
rainfall, and snowfall in the northern parts will be reduced.
This tendency will increase the amount of water lost to runoff.
Overall, the desert line is predicted to shift north, as a net
deficit in the water balance occurs in the southern part of the
region. (M. Segal, P. Alpert, U. Stein, M. Mandel and M.J.
Mitchell, "Some assessments of the potential 2 x CO2  climatic
effects on water balance components in the eastern
Mediterranean", Climatic Change, v.27, p.351-371, August
1994).<P>

Note: Recent climate trends in the region may be harbingers of
worse to come.  By November 1993, Greece was in the grips of its
worst drought in 100 years.  Greek religious leaders asked people
to pray for rain, farms were threatened and five million
residents of Athens faced the prospect of no drinking water
within a month.  The drought ended late in November with the
worst rains in the city's history, but rainfall trends over the
past forty years show a 10-30 percent decrease around the
country.  (IPS, 1 November 1993: AP, 9 November 1993: G.T.
Amanatidis et al., "The spatial distribution of precipitation
trends in Greece", [in Greek], and G.T. Amanatidis et al., 
"Decreasing precipitation trend in the Narathon area, Greece",

<H3><B>CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE BOREAL FORESTS </B></H3><P>

Greenpeace International has released a report which examines the
possible effects of global warming on the boreal forests. These
forests range across 15 million square kilometres of Canada, the
United States, Russia, Scandinavia, Korea, China, Mongolia and
Japan, and constitute a third of  the earth's forest cover. A
doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
may result in the demise of 50 to 90 percent of these forests.<P>

Higher temperatures since 1976 have sparked larger and more
frequent fires, and there has been a concurrent increase in
storms and insect outbreaks. Large-scale logging is also
increasing the stress on the forests, reducing their capacity to
withstand disturbance, and releasing more greenhouse gases. The
boreal forests are thought to be a major sink for carbon dioxide,
and if burning and rotting of the forests continues, as much as
225 billion tonnes of carbon could be released into the
atmosphere, increasing current levels by a third. This would in
turn accelerate the rate of climate change. The forest has
already started to disappear at its southern fringes, and there
is doubt that it would be able to expand northwards into the
tundra zone to compensate. Apart from the loss of plant and
animal diversity in the region, such as the already endangered
Siberian tiger, there are also one million indigenous people
whose lives are closely linked to the forest. (Greenpeace
International, The Carbon Bomb : Climate Change and the Fate of
the Northern Boreal Forests, August 1994).<P>

<H3><B>CLIMATE THREAT TO SOUTHERN ASIA </B></H3><P>

According to a co-operative study organised by the Climate
Institute in Washington DC and funded by the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), and the governments of Australia, Japan and Norway,
the Asian nations of Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines are threatened
with severe environmental and economic disruption over the next
80 years as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change.<P>

In India, 5700 square km  of coastal land  is at risk of
inundation, with the subsequent displacement of 7.1 million
people.  In Vietnam, where coastal inundation would displace 6.9
million, the report suggests that flood damage could be minimised
by the construction or upgrading of 4700 km of dykes, at a cost
of $1 billion. In coastal regions of Indonesia, 3.3 million
people could be displaced from 3.4 million hectares lost along
81,000 kilometres of coast by 2070, with urban housing, offices,
ports, roads and railways destroyed. Fishing communities,
agriculture and tourism could also be seriously affected. Parts
of Jakarta are already subsiding due to removal of ground water
and tectonic movement. In Bangladesh, about 15 percent of the
population and 20 percent of the nation's land surface will be
inundated, with an annual loss of GDP of $5 billion by the year
2070. In Malaysia, the sea is predicted to advance 2.5 km inland
in some areas, disrupting coastal tourism, mangrove products and
fisheries.  Heavy flooding is expected in Pakistan, impacting
heavily on agricultural crops such as cotton, while in the
Philippines, typhoons, storms, floods and droughts are expected
to increase. Increased flooding and storm damage are also
expected in Sari Lank.<P>

Rapid economic and population growth means this region will also
become the largest source of greenhouse emissions on earth,
according to At Qureshi of the Climate Institute.  India and
China in particular are proposing vast energy generation
programmes. The report  recommends that governments in the region
take account of the environmental costs of development, by moving
rapidly towards use of cleaner fuels and energy-efficient
technology. (Climate Alert, v.7(4), July-August 1994; Wall Street
Journal, 22 August 1994; New Scientist, p. 6, 27 August 1994;
Australian Financial Review, 28 August 1994).<P>

The severe fires which have burnt through the western US during
the 1994 summer have raised questions about the Clinton
Administration's reliance on carbon sequestration in forests as
part of its plans to curb greenhouse emissions.  The  very high
fire danger has resulted from a build-up of ground fuel after a
century of fire suppression measures in conjunction with a drier
climate. The Report of the National Commission on Wildfire
Disasters warns that "dangerous conditions exist ... compared to
historic fires, these wildfires attain intensities and impact
levels that cause...globally significant emissions of carbon and
other greenhouse gases". (Cutter Information Corp, 5 August
1994). More than two million hectares of forest are projected to
be lost during the 1994 summer, despite the US$1 billion spent on
firefighting efforts. Research now suggests that wildfires and
fires set by native Americans  probably maintained forests in the
past, but disagreements between foresters and environmentalists
have produced an impasse as to the most appropriate methods for
forestry management in a drier climate. ("Western inferno
provokes a lot of finger-pointing, but little action", Nature,
v.370, p. 585,  25 August 1994).<P>

The 1982-83 El Nino phenomenon was the strongest on record, with
effects being experienced from the west coast of South America to
the African Sahel. While it was previously thought that long-
range effects of El Nino were transmitted through the atmosphere,
G.A. Jacobs and co-workers from the Naval Research Laboratory in
Mississippi report evidence that shallow-water waves from the
1982-83 El Nino crossed the North Pacific and caused a
disturbance to the Kuroshio Extension, a warm-water current off
Japan, a decade later. (G.A. Jacobs et al, "Decade-scale trans-
Pacific propagation and warming effects of an El Nino anomaly",
Science, v. 370, p. 360-363, 4 August 1994).<P>

The alarming  decline of frogs, toads, salamanders and other
amphibians across six continents has led The Declining Amphibian
Populations Task Force to institute a special working group to
investigate the possible role of climate change in their decline,
and the potential of using amphibians as indicators of climate
change. (Froglog, IUCN/SSC Declining Amphibians Task Force,
August 1994). <P>

Note: Frogs have been on the Earth for 200 million years.
Drought, salinisation, pesticides, acid rain, super-viruses,
ozone depletion and altered rainfall patterns have all been put
forward as contributory causes for their  decline.  Dr David Wake
from the University of California says: "I am a  relatively
cautious  scientist but I am very alarmed about this decline. 
Frogs are tough survivors but they are also delicate, responsive
to the immediate environment, so they act as  a symbol.  It is
clear their decline is our fault.  There is no doubt that this is
very, very serious." ("Farewell to the frog", The Guardian, 15
January 1993).<P>

A report commissioned by Greenpeace UK concludes that global

UK. There have already been reports of increases in aphid, moth,
slug and rat numbers. Continuing warming is likely to see
increases in sandfly, spider, mosquito, cockroach, housefly,
flea, mite, midge and rat populations as threats to human health;
and aphid, moth, cutworm, Colorado beetle, cabbage root fly, and
carabid beetle populations as threats to agriculture and
horticulture. ("Climate change and pests in the UK", Greenpeace

Greenpeace reveals details of a secret Government report which
suggests that plague, malaria and leishmaniasis could become
established in the UK as a result of climate change. The report
notes that plague could present a "permanent threat to farm and
forestry workers and to walkers, campers and holiday makers in
Britain", while a rise in temperature in association "with hot
summers, might well allow some transmission of malaria in
Britain". Other worrying possibilities mooted for a climatically
warmer UK include an increase in asthma cases with greater
survival of house dust mites, an increase in toxic blue-green
algae episodes, and an increase in water-borne diseases such as
cryptosporidiosis and dysentery. ("Plague and pestilence could

In the last 15 years Italy has endured at least 8 heat waves,
with acute and prolonged periods of high temperatures followed by
decreasing numbers of rainy days coupled with much more
destructive storms. (Corriere della Sera, 10 July 1994).<P>

<H3><B>DROUGHT-INDUCED FIRES FOR SWEDEN </B></H3><P>

The long hot summer has fuelled several forest fires in Sweden. 
This month Sweden experiences some of its hottest July
temperatures, drought, thunderstorms, tornadoes and then fires.
Stockholm reports its hottest July since 1756, as did many other
districts, although the far north of the country has a cold
summer. Dry conditions have produced forest fires and
agricultural drought; low hay production means that there might
be a tough winter ahead for livestock producers. Fierce
electrical storms and a tornado have felled power lines, injured
several people and destroyed large areas of forest by fire.
Several fires have blazed through forests in the south while
salmon farmers have resorted to pumping cool water into their
fishfarms to lower high water temperatures.  The heat is expected
to continue well into August. (TT News Telegram, July 1994;
"Forest fires, sweating fish hit Sweden",  Reuter, 22 July
1994).<P>

<H3><B>HEATWAVE CONTINUES THROUGHOUT EUROPE </B></H3><P>

Hot and dry conditions continue across most of Europe.   Germany
records temperatures 10 oC above normal and speed limits are
placed on the autobahns in an effort to reduce smog. July is the
warmest July month in Belgium since 1833, when records began.
Hamburg reports the sunniest July since records began with 337
sunshine hours, 14 days defined by the German Weather Service as
hot (above 30oC) and 21 days above 25oC, and a mean air
temperature of 22.9 oC, 5.3 oC above the July average.  (Climate
Analysis Center, "Major Climatic Events and Anomalies as of July
2, 1994", Climate System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, no. 6-94,
World Climate Programme, June 1994; Climate Analysis Center,
"Major Climatic Events and Anomalies as of 30 July 1994", Climate
System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, no.7-94, World Climate
Programme, July 1994; "Air pollution warning issued as
temperatures soar to record", The Guardian, 12 July 1994; 
"Heatwave brings new warning of air pollution",  The Daily
Telegraph, 12 July 1994; De Standaard [Belgium], 2 August 1994;
Hamburger Abendblatt, 6/7 August 1994).<P>

With temperatures over 45 oC during the day, Spanish officials
are grappling with the consequences of the heatwave. Grain
production has been devastated, heat stress-related health
problems are on the rise and water supplies are threatened. (El
Mundo, 15 July 1994; Diario de Avisos, 10 July 1994; El Pais, 17
July 1994).<P>

The heatwave conditions spark almost 3,000 fires across the
country. Already several people are dead and more than 150,000
hectares burned, including the ecologically sensitive forest in
the Maestrazgo. The Madrid-Cartagena rail route is cut by fire
and heat. The director of ICONA (Nature Conservation Institute)
blames the fire on strong winds and extreme drought conditions:
"...this year, meteorological conditions have been very adverse
and the extreme danger index has come forward one month". (El
Pais, 6 July 1994; El Mundo, 6 July 1994; Diario 16, 7 July 1994;
ABC, 10 July 1994; Tiempo, 18 July 1994). <P>

Note: Spain also suffered severe fires in August 1991. The period
1991-93 has been the driest this century for much of central and
southern Spain, resulting in water restrictions and considerable
losses in  agricultural production.<P>

Fires raging through 21,000 hectares of plantation stands in
June/July cost the industry 60 million rand. According to Mike
Edwards, the Executive Director of the Forest Owners Association,
the damage is unprecedented: "Preliminary assessments reveal an
extremely bleak picture and one which could have a devastating
effect on the industry...Compared with previous years, the fire
losses already experienced in 1994 are two-and-a-half times
higher than the yearly average (of 8,700 ha) over the past 12
years." ("Timber industry loses 60 million rand in fires",

streets are flooded with mud and sewage. South African President
Nelson Mandela declares a state of disaster as more than 20,000
people line up for immediate assistance. The strong winds sink
the Chinese bulk carrier Apollo Sea, causing a massive oil spill
and killing thousands of endangered Jackass penguins. ("Mandela

<H3><B>30 MILLION AFRICANS WILL NEED EMERGENCY FOOD RELIEF IN
1994 SAYS UNITED NATIONS </B></H3> <P>

Poor or erratic rainfall combined with civil strife may lead to
the need for UN relief supplies in up to 20 countries across sub-
Saharan Africa, suggests the UN's Food and Agricultural
Organisation.  FAO also predicts that the necessary food may not
actually be available because of a projected decline in available
food aid and competing demands from other parts of the world such
as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Areas at greatest
risk include Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan. Uganda
is also suffering from severe drought as well as the influx of
refugees from Sudan and Rwanda. Ethnic violence, civil war, and
locust plagues are causing severe food problems in Rwanda,
Burundi and Zaire. Poor agricultural production will lead to a
413,000 tonne shortfall in basic foodstuffs in Tanzania. Southern
Zimbabwe has been hit by the second drought in three years;
already 375,000 people have registered for drought relief as
harvests fail.  ("Africa: Natural disasters and unnatural horrors

Fires have burned through 6,000 hectares of forest in British
Columbia.  Forest Service Officials describe the fires as the
worst they have seen in many years. Temperatures have<P>

averaged as much as 6 oC above the norm over western North
America in recent weeks.  Arizona records 47 oC while British
Columbia reaches 40 oC.  (Climate Analysis Center, "Major
Climatic Events and Anomalies as of 30 July 1994", Climate System
Monitoring Monthy Bulletin, no. 7-94, World Climate Programme,
July 1994; "Forest fires rage in Canada's British Columbia", 
Reuter, 24 July 1994; "Thousands evacuated as Canada forest fires
worsen", Reuter, 26 July 1994).<P>

Note: In 1990, Canadian Government officials expressed concern
about the recurrence of the severe 1989 forest fires as drought
conditions persisted. By 1991, global warming was being blamed
for the dramatic increase in Canadian forest fires. More than
11,000 fires had burned through 6.4 million hectares since 1989.
Canadian Forest Fire expert, Brian Stocks, warned that 'with the
projected trend towards gradually warmer temperatures, and the
influence this would have on fuel moisture, water levels, and
fire season length, the impact  on the forest fire business in
Canada would be dramatic...' Aside from gradual warming, GCM's
(Global Circulation Models) also indicate an increase in the
occurrence of extreme events, such as extended droughts, and any
disturbance that interrupts regular precipitation patterns means
major forest fire  problems.  (See The Climate Time Bomb and
references therein.)<P>

The extreme drought is expected to extend the West's fire season.
Over 10,000 hectares have  been burned in California and over
70,000 hectares have been burned in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada,
Utah, Colorado and Idaho. Drier than normal logs and trees are
expected to fuel further fires as the heatwave conditions
continue. ("Wildfires rage in southern California palm desert", 
Reuter, 4 July 1994; "Wildfires rage across western US",  Reuter,
5 July 1994;  "At least 13 firefighters dead in Colorado blaze",
Reuter, 7 July 1994; Associated Press, 16 July 1994).<P>

Note: Major bushfires swept through California's Oakland Hills in
1991, five years into severe drought conditions. It was the third
biggest fire in US history.  70,000 wildfires raged through
drought-stricken California in the long hot summer of 1992. More
than 0.6 million hectares of forest was consumed. The fires were
aided by the many dead trees  which had been attacked by
infestations of Bark Beetles. October 1993 saw the five-county
disaster in California after brushfires burnt out of control
across 35,600 hectares  from the Mexican border to the northern
suburbs of Los Angeles. (See The Climate Time Bomb and references
therein.)<P>

"It's not an intermittent disaster. It's coming now quite
regularly with climate change effects", says Australia's Prime
Minister, the Hon Paul Keating, when addressing the issue of the
drought recently. The El Nino-related drought is now heading into
an unprecedented fourth season.  Research scientist for the
Queensland Department of Primary Industries, Ken Brooks states:
"We are literally searching the records for something that
compares".  The Bureau of Meteorology has reported that rainfall
in parts of central Queensland and northern New South Wales was
the lowest on record over April, May and June. The drought is now
affecting production of wheat, canola, barley, cotton, oilseeds
and sorghum across New South Wales and Queensland, prompting dire
warnings of huge economic losses.  As farm foreclosures become
more common, fears are also being expressed about the loss of
lucrative wheat and cotton export markets. Wool production is
also expected to fall by 20% if the dry conditions continue over
the next three months and farmers in the north of the state are
suffering from severe pasture degradation, lost production and
increased costs due to land feeding.  Sydney water supplies are
now being supplemented from storage lakes in the south. Long-
range forecasts suggest relief is not yet in sight. ("Drought to
cost farmers $700m", Daily Telegraph Mirror, 4 July 1994; "El
Nino crushes wheat hopes", West Australian, 16-17 July 1994;

</B></H3><P>

According to a senior National Institute of Water and Atmosphere
Research (NIWA) scientist, Dr Jim Salinger, dry soils in the
parched Auckland region are soaking up the rain, leaving little
runoff to replenish the reservoirs. The government Treasury has
warned that the current economic recovery is being slowed by the
water crisis. Manufacturing and construction industries in
Auckland have already reported reduced production of around 20
percent over the last three months. Treasury predicts that the
100-year drought could cost NZ$800 million in real terms. NIWA's
long term weather outlook remains unhelpfully dry. ("Land soaking
it up", NZ Herald (Auckland, New Zealand), 9 July 1994; "New
Zealand: Auckland's drought threatens $800 million drain on
economy",  National Business Review (Reuter textline), 8 July
1994).<P>

<H3><B>FLOOD AND DROUGHT ARE THREATENING ECONOMIC REFORM IN CHINA
</B></H3><P>

A special commission has been established to investigate the
economic damage caused by recent catastrophes in China. Beijing
government officials have also expressed concern about the
potential political fallout and social instability caused by the
displacement of millions of Chinese during recent floods.
According to the respected China News Analysis, "(floods) could
not come at a worst time as the inflation of food prices since
last December, the performance of agriculture, food supplies and
income of farmers have become sensitive issues...Floods in the
southern and central parts combined with the extreme heat and
drought in the north and north east present a serious challenge
to the strategies developed by the central government - that food
prices and supply will not jeopardise the social stability the
government needs to carry through its economic reforms later this
year and in 1995." In south China, the worst flooding this
century left more than 1,400 dead. Floods have affected over 8.5
million people in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang
and Fujian, and caused economic losses in excess of 53.6 billion
yuan (US$ 6.23 billion). Drinking water is polluted and more than
10,000 cases of gastro-enteritis, dysentery, hepatitis and
cholera have been reported.  At the same time, the  parched
northern cities and provinces of Beijing, Hebei, Shaanxi, Inner
Mongolia, Gansu and west of Heilongjiang also received heavy
rains and floods, with the worst storm in 35 years causing flash
flooding in Beijing.  Then the heatwaves returned.  40ÉC
temperatures in Shanghai were blamed for heat stress and riots in
the streets. Drought and high temperatures continued in the
northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui, where drought has devastated
2.6 million hectares of farmland. ("Rain brings relief to parched
north China", The Xinhua News Agency, 8 July 1994; "Floods on

<H3><B>RECORD LOW RAIN SEASON LEADS TO WATER RESTRICTIONS IN
JAPAN </B></H3> <P>

The worst drought in 20 years has led to severe water
restrictions across 150 towns in Japan. According to the National
Meteorological Agency, rainfall over northern Japan had not been
lower since records began in 1951 while the rainy season
throughout Japan was 30-50% below average. Water levels in Tokyo
dams were down to 63% of preferred level prompting voluntary
controls for Tokyo residents. Heatwaves have compounded the water
shortage; record temperatures were recently recorded in Shikoku,
Tokushima, Takamatsu, Yokkaichi and Okayama. ("Dry rainy season
aggravates water shortages", Reuter, 13 July 1994; "Heatwave
covers Japanese archipelago",  Japan Economic Newswire, 15 July
1994; "Typhoon Walt inching towards southern Japan", Reuter World
Service, 24 July 1994; "Typhoon  Walt", Lloyds List, 25 July
1994; "Land of the rising sun thirsty for rain", Sydney Morning
Herald, 30 July 1994).<P>

Note: 1993 Japanese Environment Agency states: "...The period
from 1960 to the present is considered to be a small rainfall
period and in the past several years, historically severe
droughts have occurred. In 1967, 1973, 1977-78, 1984, 1986-87,
the amount of rainfall was below the average. The amount recorded
in 1984 was the lowest on the record in the past 90 years...the
coldest decade was identified as the period from 1904 to 1913,
and warmest decade as the period from 1978 to 1987...The annual
precipitation in the warmest decade was lower than in the coldest
decade. Considering the greater variation of the annual
precipitation and higher probability of prolonged periods of
drought in the warmest decade, it is estimated that with global
warming, most regions in Japan would suffer severe drought
condition...  ." (See The Climate Time Bomb and references

<H3><B>WARMING OCEAN LEADS TO PENGUIN POPULATION DECLINE
</B></H3><P>

Rockhopper penguin numbers at sub-Antarctic Campbell Island have 
declined by 94% since the early 1940s, from an estimated 1.6
million to 103,000 breeding pairs in 1985. Many breeding colonies
have  disappeared altogether. The decline appears to have been
greatest during the 1950s coinciding with substantial changes in
sea temperatures.  The mean December - February sea surface
temperature rose from 9.1 oC in 1944 to peaks of 9.7 oC in
1948-49 and 9.6 oC in 1953-54, declined to 8.6 oC by 1965,  rose
rapidly to 10.2oC by 1970, and has averaged 9.7 oC since then. 
Scientists believe that the rising sea temperatures  may be
associated with changes in the food supply and thus responsible
for the population decline. (D.M. Cunningham et al., "The decline
of Rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome at Campbell  Island,
Southern ocean and the influence of rising sea temperatures",
Emu, v.94, 1994). <P>

Note: New Zealand scientists have reported a recent increase in
Adelie penguin breeding pairs in the Ross Sea region.  The
increase in chick numbers and decrease in adult mortality has
been linked to atmospheric warming and a reduction in sea ice
during the breeding season. Further evidence of climate warming
has been found at several Antarctic lakes, thought to represent a
sensitive indicator of short term climatic change.  Lake Vanda,
which is entirely fed by glacial meltwater, has been rising
rapidly in recent years. Another study of six Antarctic lakes has
shown that the surface ice has thinned by up to 40% over the last
decade. (See The Climate Time Bomb and references therein.)<P>

<H3><B>AEROSOL POLLUTANTS CAUSE REGIONAL COOLING </B></H3><P>

Dust and tiny aerosol particles emitted by power stations,
biomass burning and drought-induced dust storms appear to be
directly blocking incoming solar radiation and cancelling out the
effect of increased greenhouse gas warming in some regions, at
least in the short term.  New data from Thomas Karl at the US
National Climate Centre reveals that aerosols over most of the
northern hemisphere land masses and over parts of the southern
hemisphere have increased over the last 100 years. Aerosols also
assist in the formation of clouds which can have a cooling
effect. This is consistent with the observed global warming
occurring at night and in winter - clouds shade the earth during
the summer days and act as a blanket to keep the  Earth warm
during winter nights.  This feedback process makes prediction of
climate change more difficult, pulling the atmosphere in two
different directions. Because the summer daytime  cooling is
concentrated mostly at middle and high latitudes in the northern
hemisphere it increases the temperature gradient between the
poles and the tropics thereby increasing storminess at middle
latitudes. Such storminess has been observed across the Atlantic
and in Britain.<P>

A recent meeting of climate experts held in Berlin in April,
concluded that the cooling effect of aerosols is regional,
affecting primarily the Northern Hemisphere, and occurs on a
completely different timescale to that of greenhouse gases.
Aerosols have atmospheric lifetimes measured in days where as the
effect of greenhouse gases lasts up to centuries. ("Not warming,
but cooling", New Scientist, p. 37-41, 9 July 1994). <P>

Note: Greenpeace believes that the partial - and temporary -
suppression of  global-warming fever  by aerosols emitted by acid
rain involves using a  drug  of such toxicity that to contemplate
continuing to apply them to the patient is immoral.<P>

Just one month after confidently proclaiming the demise of El
Nino, scientists are now suggesting that the unprecedented
1991-93 event may be returning. In addition to the continuing
negative values of the Southern Oscillation Index, recorded since
March this year, Pacific ocean temperatures are now beginning to
show   El Nino-like characteristics. ("Dry weather likely to

Recent research suggests that under doubled atmospheric CO2
conditions, increased primary production in wetlands
significantly increases methane production. Methane production in
CO2-enriched sites was observed to be 80% higher than in control
sites. The researchers suggest that recent observed increases in
atmospheric methane may be in part explained by this feedback
between CO2 and wetland biota. (J.W.H. Dacey, B.G. Drake & M.J.
Klug, "Stimulation of methane emission by carbon dioxide
enrichment of march vegetation", Nature, v.370, p. 47-49, 7 July

<H3><B>CO2 EXCHANGE BETWEEN OCEAN AND ATMOSPHERE </B></H3><P>

Exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the ocean and the
atmosphere is largely mediated by phytoplankton, or microscopic
marine plants. They are believed to absorb more than half of the
global atmospheric carbon budget, and sequester it in the ocean.
How they do so is poorly understood, but it appears that their
habit of vertical migration  is of vital importance. Plankton are
patchy in distribution, their distribution being influenced by
wind, waves and predators as well as vertical mixing.<P>

The effects of changing concentrations of atmospheric gases on
phytoplankton are not yet known. There is evidence from this
study that some plankton may be attracted to oxygen near the
ocean surface, and it is possible that enhanced CO2 levels may
inhibit their vertical migration. It is extremely important to
understand the linkages between atmospheric changes  and
phytoplankton. (D.A. Noever, H.C. Matsos, R.J. Cronise, L.L.
Looger and R.A. Relwani, "ocean - atmosphere CO2 exchange: an
accessible lab simulation for considering biological effects",

Recent land-use methods have seen an increase in ammonium in
agricultural soils. Gary M. King and Sylvia Schnell of the
University of Maine have shown that ammonium inhibits methane
uptake by the soil, and that "the extent of ammonium inhibition
increases with increasing methane concentration".  King and
Schnell conclude that "this mechanism could ... provide a
positive feedback mechanism on future atmospheric methane
concentrations". (G.M. King & S. Schnell, "Effect of increasing
atmospheric methane concentration on ammonium inhibition of soil

The fourth week of South Korea's worst heatwave in memory causes
huge demands on power supplies and  forces the temporary closure
of some major  industrial plants. Heat and drought also causes
widespread crop damage, damaging rice fields, killing chickens,
pigs and sheep and forcing up vegetable prices. The Seoul city
government has ordered energy conservation measures. (Jakarta

<H3><B>HEAT AFFECTS HUMAN BEHAVIOUR </B></H3><P>

Recent heatwaves in the northern hemisphere have highlighted the
seeming inability of humans to adapt to hot weather. Unusually
hot weather this year has been accentuated by the disappearance
of the cooling volcanic debris from the 1991 Mt Pinatubo
eruption. Heat can cause irrational behaviour, dehydration and
heatstroke, and is believed to be responsible for regular summer
crime waves in New York City, and generally volatile behaviour.
(Sunday Times, 24 July 1994).<P>

Note: The increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves in
a global warming world is expected to increase heat related
illness and death from cardiovascular failure and heat stroke.
Heat stress occurs when temperatures rise above threshold levels
that appear to be relative (to average climate) rather than
absolute. Individuals and societies with low adaptive capacity
such as populations in developing countries, the young, the
disabled and the elderly are considered especially vulnerable.
One US study showed that even with a degree of acclimatisation,
heat-related illness increased fourfold in the US after a
temperature increase of between 2-4 oC. (W.J. McTegart, G.W.

Researchers  at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in New

fluctuations in the Pacific ocean, caused by El Nino, and 
rainfall and associated maize yields in Zimbabwe, well distant
from the Pacific. Although the linkage between El Nino and
African weather is poorly understood, it is possible to
"nevertheless predict the maize crop with pretty astonishing
skill", according to Gidon Eshel, one of the research team.

drought threatening food production in Indonesia prompts a
recommendation by the Meteorological and Geophysics Agency to
initiate cloud seeding. The drought has already devastated 16,400
hectares of rice, with a loss of 82,000 tonnes of the crop. A
rice shortage is avoided by rice "paybacks" from neighbouring
nations. The drought has also affected rubber production in
Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, prompting global rubber price
hikes. (Jakarta Post, 9 July 1994, 11 July 1994; "Extended
drought hurting Indonesia's Rice Production", AP Worldstream
[Associated Press], 19 July 1994; "Drought hits Indonesian
rubber", United Press International, 25 July 1994). <P>

Note: Indonesia suffered its worst ever drought-induced fires in
October 1991, when 20 people were killed and 50,000 hectares of
tropical rainforest and crops on the islands of Sumatra and
Borneo destroyed.  In May 1992, UNESCO reported that the 124-year
long Indonesian temperature records show an increase of 1.66 oC
in the mean monthly temperature between 1866 and 1990. The
average number of dry months has also increased from 4.4 per year
in 1900 to 5.4 today. (Dry months are defined as a month with
less than 100 mm of rain or the amount need to sustain rice 
production on the island). (See The Climate Time Bomb and
references therein.)<P>

Thunderstorms with winds exceeding 100kph struck Washington and
Maryland leaving 5000 homes without power, after the second
successive day of temperatures over 37.7 ÉC. Three residents of
Philadelphia died of heat-related complications. The heatwave
continued into the following day prior to storms which destroyed
property and caused power blackouts in New York City. 
(Washington  Post, 7 July 1994; New York Times, 9 July 1994;
Philadelphia Inquirer, 9 July 1994).<P>

Meanwhile, flooding associated with tropical storm Alberto in
southwest Georgia kills 30 people, closes 1500 bridges and
hundreds of roads, cuts water supplies to 175,000 people and
causes $110 million damage. Florida reports $40 million flood-
related damage while Alabama's peanut crop is destroyed.  In
Georgia, 181,000 hectares  of crops are flood affected. (Los
Angeles Times, 13 July 1994; Reuter, 14 July 1994; PR Newswire,
14 July 1994; Washington Post, 15 July 1994). After the floods
recede, new problems emerge, with significant downstream
contamination from silt, sewage, petroleum and other toxic
substances.   Oyster harvesting is halted in Apalachicola Bay.
Forty-three counties in Georgia, five counties in Florida and
several in Alabama are declared disaster areas. (The Atlanta
Journal and Constitution, 15 July 1994; The National Underwriter
Company, 18 July 1994; Facts on File World Digest, 21 July 1994).
In an unusual twist to the flooding, nearly a quarter of a
million bats are drowned when floodwaters inundate a maternity
cave near the Apalachicola River in Florida. (Associated Press, 
9 September 1994).<P>

<H3><B>THE ROLE OF PEAT IN THE ICE AGES </B></H3><P>

According to Lars Franzen of Sweden's Goteborg University, the
uptake of CO2 from peat growth reduces the natural greenhouse
effect, causes cooling, and then initiates an ice age. Franzen's
theory that we are currently in a warming period of peat growth 
implies that peat may be of prime importance in the global
warming stakes, given that we are currently in a warming period
of peat growth.  A recent study in the UK suggests that peat
contains 75% of Britain's carbon stored in soils and vegetation,
but that it is being destroyed by forest plantations and peat
cutting at an unprecedented rate. (Lars G. Franzen, "Are wetlands
the key to the ice-age cycle enigma?",Ambio, v. 23(4-5), July
1994; "Peat bogs hold bulk of Britain's carbon",New Scientist, p.
6, 19 November 1994).<P>

June 1994 was the hottest June ever for the United States as a
whole, the National Climatic Data Centre reports. The temperature
averaged 22.05oC, whereas the normal average is 20.55oC.  In
addition, the month ranked as the 22nd driest year during 100
years of record keeping, with an average of 64mm compared to
72.1mm in a normal year.  (AP  [Washington Post], 27 July

Research by Scott Stine of California State University at Harvard
indicates that California might find itself dry again with even a
modest climate shift.  New Scientist reports  that the state has
suffered major droughts lasting hundreds of years in the past,
and that the consequences for the state would be "profound" if
global warming led to prolonged periods of dry weather.  (New

Although the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) fell to -10 in
March, to -19 in April and to -12 in May, consistent with El Nino
conditions, Australian experts do not expect a redevelopment of
the event. They point to the stronger than normal trade winds and
below-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific
during March and April  - conditions opposite to those generally
associated with El Nino. ("April to June Rainfall Outlook",

<H3><B>RECORD HEATWAVE SIZZLES US SOUTHWEST </B></H3><P>

June 1994 is the second hottest US June since 1895, with
temperatures 3 oC to 8 oC above average across the southwest, the
central and southern Rockies and the High Plains. 51oC is
recorded in southeastern California and nearly 54oC  at Lake
Havasu City, Arizona.  Colorado has its hottest June since
records commenced in 1895. Several cities in Texas and Arizona
also record near/record maximum temperatures. In some states,
such as Nevada and Utah, June is also the driest ever, and
rainfall was sparse elsewhere. (National Climatic Data Center,
"United States June 1994 Climate in Historical Perspective",
Climate System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, no. 6-94, World
Climate Programme, June 1994; Climate Analysis Center, "Major
Climatic Events and Anomalies as of July 2, 1994",  Climate
System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, no. 6-94, World Climate
Programme, June 1994; "Sweltering US temperatures boost natgas
prices",  Reuter, 10 June 1994; "If we win this match, it's out
of the frying pan, into the fire", The Irish Times, 1 July 1994; 
Weatherwatch, "Heat at Lake Havasu",  The Guardian, 5 July
1994).<P>

Note: Rainfall across North America has increased by around 8
percent over the last hundred years, primarily because of
increases in eastern Canada and USA. Precipitation trends in the
Gulf Coast region are less clear, although there is some evidence
of an increase since the droughts of the 1950s.<P>

Average snowfall has decreased with average winter snowfall in
the 1980s and 1990s being  two-thirds of that which fell in the
post-World War II decade. The periodic weather pattern El Nino
has been blamed for May 1991's major floods along the Gulf of
Mexico and for the repeated record flooding experienced in Texas
from December 1991 to March 1992.  The latter left hundreds
homeless, killed several people and caused over $50 million
damage. The 'Great Nor-easter of 1992' swept through New England
in December 1992, closing down the New York subway for the first
time in its history.  The hurricane-force winds, heavy rains,
river and tidal flooding, and massive snowfalls caused  $650
million in insured losses. Total insured losses reached $1.6
billion from  the  'storm of the century' which wreaked havoc
from Canada to Cuba in March 1993.  This  'snowicane'  killed 270
people. In July 1993, the 'flood of the century'  devastated the
Midwest, inundating more than 8 million hectares of America's
most fertile farmland. In March 1994, the fifteenth storm to hit
the eastern US  in the nastiest winter in recent memory  promoted
a fresh burst of concern from reinsurers. President of the
Reinsurance Association of America, Franklin Nutter, professed
that  the insurance business is first in line to be affected by
climate change. Time magazine's correspondent, Eugene Linden,
wrote: "These risks and the crucial role played by the $1.41
trillion insurance industry in the global economy could change
the dynamics of the debate about global warming." (P. Ya.

<H3><B>NEW DELHI RECORDS HOTTEST DAY IN 50 YEARS </B></H3><P>

400 heat-related deaths are recorded as temperatures soar several
degrees above the average across northern India. New Delhi
records a record  46 oC. The sudden arrival of the monsoon
abruptly cools temperatures and dumps nearly 2,000mm of rain on
the southwest, nearly twice the monthly average in just two
weeks. Double the normal values are also recorded across southern
Pakistan and eastwards towards Bangladesh. The rain brings cold
temperatures averaging 1 oC to 3 oC below average. Heavy monsoon
rainfall continues into July across most of India with some areas
recording up to 670mm above average. Desert areas in the state of
Rajasthan had their first rainfalls in 47 years. (Climate
Analysis Center, "Major Climatic Events and Anomalies as of 2
July 1994",  Climate System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, no.
6-94, World Climate Programme, June 1994; Climate Analysis
Center, "Major Climatic Events and Anomalies as of 30 July 1994",

Climate System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, no.7-94, World
Climate Programme, July 1994; "Deadly heatwave scorches India", 
The Australian, 1 June 1994;  "Heatwave kills 18 on New Delhi
roads",  United Press International, 11 June 1994; Weatherwatch,
"Heat at Lake Havasu",  The Guardian, 5 July 1994).<P>

 Note: Temperatures have increased by 0.4 oC over India since
1901, with the warming trend being greatest on the west coast,
interior Peninsula, north central region and  northeast. This
temperature trend does not show the post-1940 cooling observed
elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.  India's annual and
monsoonal rainfall does not show any discernible trend, but it
does exhibit great variability. Periods of increasing trends in
rainfall were identified between 1876 and 1894, 1904 and 1962,
and from 1973 onwards; during the intervening periods of 1895 to
1903 and 1963 to 1972 rainfall showed decreasing trends. (V.
Thapliyal & S.M. Kulshrestha, "Recent Climate Changes and Trends
Over India", in Proceedings of the Asian workshop, New Delhi,
India, 11-15 February, 1991, IGBP Report no.18:2).  While no long
term trend is evident in the annual rainfall record, droughts
were more frequent between 1965 and 1984 (and also between 1896
and 1920).  This follows the period of more frequent flooding
between 1933 and 1964. The area of country affected by drought
has also increased since 1950. During the most recent 20 years
covered of the study (1965 to 1984) India experienced five
drought and three flood years of a large-scale nature, the only
other similar period being between 1899 and 1920. (B.

<TITLE>NAMIBIA'S WARM WINTER BLAMED FOR CAPE FUR SEAL

<H3><B>NAMIBIA'S WARM WINTER BLAMED FOR CAPE FUR SEAL DEATHS
</B></H3><P>

Red tides  of plankton are thought to have driven away the fish
which the fur seals rely on during breeding.  More than 90
percent of this season's seal pups are expected to starve.
Biologist Grant Pitcher from the Sea Fisheries Department in Cape
Town explains  that warm winter had produced ideal conditions for
the development of the algal blooms. The blooms leave the water
oxygen-starved, forcing other marine life to migrate or
suffocate.  ( "Are Namibia's seals starving to death?",  New
Scientist, v.142(1930), p.5, 18 June 1994).<P>

Note: In 1988, 17,000 harbour seals died along the Scandinavian
and European coasts. The ultimate cause of the "seal plague" was
a previously unknown disease now called phocine distemper virus
(PDV). However, American researchers suggest that high
temperatures in association with high seal densities triggered
the plague, rather than invading harp seals, marine pollution and
suppressed immune systems as previously suggested. The
researchers re-investigated the documented seal plagues that
occurred this century (1918, 1955, 1978, 1979/80, 1987/88 and
1988) and found that in the majority of cases above average
temperatures preceded the outbreaks. They suggest that the seals
haul out on to the beaches as temperatures increase,  which
"set[s] the stage for the rapid invasion of an opportunistic
pathogen by increasing the availability of potential hosts".  It
is also suggested that the mass-deaths of bottlenose dolphins
(1987-88) and humpback whales (1987) along the east coast of the
USA may have been the result of high temperatures simulating the
growth of toxic algae. The authors conclude: "...If we are indeed
entering a period of global warming...we would predict that the
incidence of mass mortalities in pinnipeds will increase, at
least in those species that exhibit marked changes in density in
response to relatively small changes in environmental
temperatures. Consistently, four of the six documented mass
mortalities of pinnipeds have occurred since 1978, a period that
includes some of the warmest years in the 20th century...". (D.M.
Lavigne & O.J. Schmitz, "Global Warming and Increased Population
Densities: a Prescription for Seal Plagues", Marine Pollution
Bulletin, v.21(6), p.280-284, 1990).<P>

<H3><B>100-YEAR FLOODS IN CHINA CLAIM 800 LIVES AND AFFECT
MILLIONS </B></H3> <P>

Rains from Tropical Storms Russ and Sharon have flooded several
southern Chinese provinces, affecting more than 11 million people
and destroying entire villages.  Guangzhoa's Bei Jiang River
peaked at a record 10.39 metres.   The rain has brought some
relief to the drought-stricken northeast, where high temperatures
averaging 4 oC to 9 oC above the norm have persisted over the
last two months. (Climate Analysis Center, "Major Climatic Events
and Anomalies as of July 2, 1994", Climate System Monitoring
Monthly Bulletin, no.6-94, World Climate Programme, June 1994;
"China flood toll rises to 58",  Reuter, 14 June 1994;  "Cholera
threatens flood victims in China",  Reuter, 23 June 1994;  "Flood
report says water levels falling but warns of floods in Pearl
River Delta",  BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 23 June 1993;
"Rain continues to bring misery to flood-stricken people of south
China; Guangdong's deadly downpour",  South China Post, 26 June
1994).<P>

Note: Floods such as these create ideal situations for the spread
of cholera and other water-borne diseases, which develop when
human or animal excreta infected by pathogenic viruses or
bacteria occur in the presence of water. Currently, water-borne
diseases are the single largest category of communicable diseases
contributing to infant mortality in the developing world. Over
one and a half billion episodes of diarrhoea and around four
million deaths are recorded every year. The indirect effects of
changing climate patterns, such as large migrations of people and
reductions in safe drinking water, are likely to overshadow any
direct effects on water-borne disease. However, the impacts could
be devastating in regions already affected by frequent flooding
(such as southern China).  Projected climate changes would extend
areas suitable for endemic cholera, favour the development of new
strains, such as those that have recently emerged in Asia, and
enhance the survival rate of current strains introduced by sewage
pollution.  Marine environmental reservoirs  for Vibrio cholerae,
such as algae, are also susceptible to environmental changes.
Paul Epstein from Havard Medical School has suggested that the
resurgence of cholera in the Americas, which has resulted in
hundreds of thousands of cases, may be among the first human
health impacts of climate change. (WHO Task Group, Potential
health effects of climate change, World Health Organisation,

<H3><B>AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE FACE EXTINCTION IN A GLOBAL WARMING
WORLD </B></H3> <P>

Government research suggests that a one degree increase in
temperature could eliminate the current climate range of seven of
Australia's most endangered species. Dr Elsa Dexter, of the
Australian Nature Conservation Authority (ANCA), reports that
another 67 vulnerable species of birds, marsupials and reptiles
would probably suffer range reductions due to changes in
temperature and rainfall. The predictions are based on the
results of the ANCA bioclim model and IPCC and CSIRO projections.
According to Dr Dexter:  "The results are based on a one-degree
average increase in global temperature, which is really at the
lowest end of the current climate predictions, so we have been
very conservative...A two-degree average increase could have a
dramatic impact on species distribution - possibly many times
greater than a one- degree rise."  ( "Global warming threatens
wildlife",  The Australian, 23 June 1994).<P>

<H3><B>AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST RIVER SYSTEM DRIES UP </B></H3><P>

The 100-year drought affecting much of the state of New South
Wales has caused more than 1,000 kilometres of the Darling River
system to completely dry up.  After yet another dry month  - much
of NSW experienced the lowest May rainfall on record -  more than
60 percent of the State is drought-declared, and unless there is
rain in the next few<P>

months much larger sections are expected to become completely
dry.  More water supply problems can be expected as farmers
increasingly draw on dwindling ground water supplies normally
recharged by rain. The drought-related cloudless skies and dry
air are also thought to have contributed to Australia' s coldest
ever temperature of -22.2 degrees celsius recorded  at Charlotte
Pass on 22 June. ("Lack of rain threatens the Darling", Sydney
Morning Herald, 18 June 1994;  "Critical water shortages cost
State $480m so far", Sydney Morning Herald, 18 June 1994; 
Drought spreads further,  Media Release, Minister for Agriculture
and Fisheries and Minister for Mines, 28 June 1994;  "Charlotte
Pass cracks the record for coldest night",  The Australian, 30
June 1994).<P>

Note: Eastern Australia has become progressively hotter and drier
in recent years. Drought conditions have dominated New South
Wales and southwestern Queensland over the past ten years.  This
period of dryness since the early 1980s may be a reversal of the
previously observed trend towards wetter conditions in the east. 
Bureau of Meteorology figures show that Australia's 11 warmest
years have occurred since 1979. The warming is consistent with
predicted global warming. Bill Kininmonth, Head of the National
Climate Centre, has cited increased concentrations of carbon
dioxide as one possible cause for the increase.  ("Why it keeps
getting hotter",  The Daily Telegraph Mirror [Australia], 17
February 1994; "Yes, it really is getting warmer", Sydney Morning
Herald, 17 February 1994; see also N. Nicholls & B. Lavery,

Much of Europe experiences temperatures 3 oC to 6 oC above
average throughout June, with some parts of Spain and Austria
recording temperatures 8 oC higher than normal. Record daily
temperatures lead to London's sunniest  June in 18 years.  The
high temperatures and  sunshine have  increased ground-level
ozone and prompted air quality warnings. A record 30 oC is
recorded in Lakenheath, Suffolk, on 11th June; a few kilometres
away in Midenhall a half-mile (0.8 km) stretch of tar road
melted.
Several animals at the London Zoo are reported to be stressed by
the heatwave and pollution conditions.<P>

<H3><B>ALPINE PLANTS ARE MIGRATING UP THE MOUNTAINS </B></H3><P>

According to researchers from the University of Vienna, regional
warming is forcing alpine plants to higher altitudes in the
middle Alps of western Austria and eastern Switzerland.  Local
climate data suggests a warming of 0.7 oC over the last 90 years.

The researchers conclude:  "...there is no doubt that even
moderate warming induces migration processes, and that this
process is underway. The example from the limits of plants at
high alpine summits is of general importance and suggests that
global warming is already having a significant effect on alpine
plant ecology. Even in situations where plants must move upwards,
the warming is sufficient to simulate migration, and may cause
disastrous extinctions in these environments." (G. Grabherr, M.
Gottfried & H. Pauli (Department of Vegetation, Ecology  and
Conservation Biology, University of Vienna), "Climate effects on
mountains planets", Nature, v.369 (6480), 9 June 1994).<P>

Records at the British Faraday Base on the Antarctic Peninsula
have shown an increase of 0.5 oC per decade since 1947 (when
measurements began), the fastest sustained atmospheric warming
since worldwide temperature records began 130 years ago. The Head
of the British Antarctic Survey' s meteorological group, Dr David
King, stated:  "The rise is the fastest we have on
record...people should be looking to the future ... the
consequences could be quite dire". ("Scientists say Antarctica is
warming",Reuter", 24 June 1994).<P>

Note: Temperature increases and sea ice retreat have also been
reported at other Antarctic coastal bases:  dramatic increases in
mean summer air temperatures and an associated reduction in snow
cover on sub-Antarctic Signey Island since 1951, a 1.5 o C
increase over the last 20 years on Kuegelen Island, a similar
increase for Heard Island, and  exceptionally warm recent summers
on Livingstone Island.   In 1991, the  British Antarctic Survey
published satellite images of the rapid disintegration of the
Wordie Ice Shelf which is thought to be associated with the
recent warm temperatures. More than 1,300 square kilometres of
the Wordie Ice Shelf has disappeared since 1966. (See The Climate
Time Bomb and the references therein.)<P>

particularly hard-hit,  is estimated at US$50 million. ( "21
bodies of Thai fisherman wash ashore; cyclone toll is 285", AP
Worldstream, 10 May 1994; "Bangladesh cyclone hits forest
wealth",  Agence France Presse, 6 May 1994;  "Cyclone toll rises

Note: Bangladesh suffered its worst ever flooding in 1988, when
62 percent of the country was inundated. The previous record
flood in 1987 saw 40 percent of the country under water. In May
1991, the strongest cyclone in a century left 139,000 dead and
more than a million homes damaged or destroyed.  The winds, up to
270 kph, were stronger than those of  a 1970 cyclone which killed
100,000 people.  Monsoonal floods in 1993 left millions homeless
as half the country was submerged.<P>

The floods inundate 23 districts and over 67,500 hectares of
farmland in the Rostov region, causing tens of billions of
roubles damage.  30,000 hectares of winter wheat, 8,000 hectares
of pastureland and 200 hectares of orchards are destroyed. Floods
in the neighbouring West Kazakhstan  cause similar damage. (ITAR-

Note: The former USSr has experienced rising temperatures and a
nine percent increase in rainfall over this century. While annual
rainfall levels have increased, summer aridity  in the grain
growing region has also increased, with 1991 being the driest
year on record. These rainfall trends are consistent with those
from GCM experiments of increased greenhouse gas concentrations,
but are of a larger magnitude than the models suggest.  (P.Ya.

<H3><B>STORMS DEVASTATE WESTERN AUSTRALIA </B></H3><P>

While the  rains brought relief to drought-stricken farmers, the
accompanying 140 km/hour winds black out 250,000 buildings and
damage at least 600 homes in the state's capital, Perth. Just one
week earlier, severe dust-storms caused an estimated Aus$15
million damage to wheat fields after hundreds of tonnes of
topsoil was swept away in high winds. The last seven months have
been Western Australia's driest and dustiest on record.  ("Storms
leave $15m damage repair bill",  The Australian, 25 May 1994;
"Storms prove boon to WA grain farmers",  Australian Financial
Review, 26 May 1994).<P>

Note: Winter rainfall in Western Australia has become steadily
drier since 1930.  Regional water supplies may be at risk; the
state's capital city, Perth, already has a precarious supply. Dr
Robert Allan from CSIRO's Climate Impact Group suggests the
decline in rainfall may be explained by  natural long term
variations in the climate system governing rainfall in the region
and/or  a  random fluctuation in rainfall patterns and/or
climatic changes resulting from global warming or the enhanced
greenhouse effect. ("Getting drier in the WEST," ECOS, v.72,
Winter 1992).<P>

Strong winds accompanying a severe storm strip off between 20 and
30 million tonnes of valuable topsoil and carry it east across
the country and out to sea. According to CSIRO experts, the
recent high temperatures, drought and mice plagues combined to
loosen  the soil. The storm hit drought-stricken farmers in South
Australia and northwest Victoria.  Meanwhile, Sydney experiences
its hottest May day in more than 30 years, a record 27.9 degrees
celsius.  ( "Dust disaster to cost hundreds of millions", Daily
Telegraph Mirror [Australia], 27 May 1994; "City chokes on tonnes
of dust",  Daily Telegraph Mirror, 27 May 1994;  "Of mice and men
and a mighty blow",  Sydney Morning Herald, 28 May 1994;  "Season
of earth, wind and fire",  Herald Sun [Australia], 31 May 1994; 
"Low pressure spells heavy weather", The Age, 26 May 1994).<P>

Note: A global review of dust storm frequency over this century
by researchers from the University of Oxford indicates that dust
storms are increasing in some regions, such as in the Sahel and
Mongolia, and decreasing in others, such as over Mexico City.
Different regions, including Australia, China, the former Soviet
Union, the Middle East and the US show no trends or exhibit
cyclical patterns. It is clear from the study that rainfall, snow
cover and wind strength are the main determinants of yearly dust
storm frequency, however, human activities such as agricultural
practices have had a major impact in some areas. (A.S. Goudie &
N.J. Middleton, "The Changing Frequency of Dust Storms Through
Time," Climatic Change, v.20, p.197-225, 1992).<P>

<H3><B>FLOODS NOW HIT SOMALI REFUGEES IN SOUTHEAST KENYA
</B></H3><P>

The severe floods end the drought but displace 2,000 Somali
refugees on the border of Kenya and destroy relief food. (
"Earthweek: Diary of a Planet",  The Age [Melbourne], 23 May
1993;  "Floods have displaced over 2,000 Somali refugees in
Kenya",  The Xinhua News Agency, 16 May 1994).<P>

Note: The 1990 IPCC Report stated that one of the gravest impacts
of climate change may be human migration "as millions are
uprooted by shoreline erosion, coastal flooding and agricultural
disruption".   Several studies have suggested  that large numbers
of people will be displaced as a result of climatic change and
sea level rise, prompting large-scale migration of 'environmental
refugees'.  Communities located in low-lying areas will be
particularly vulnerable to storm surges, inundation  of  land and
water tables while agricultural patterns and thus food
availability may be severely disrupted in some regions.  One
study estimates that within forty years over 150 million people
in developing countries may become displaced by climate change
and sea level rise. The arrival of large groups of environmental
refugees would place  strains on infrastructure, water resources,
food supplies and health services in the host countries.  Dr.
Norman Myers, of Oxford University, warns that the resettlement
of refugees is generally difficult, and full assimilation is
rare: economic and social upheavals may result and cultural and
ethnic problems would increase. Myers and others suggest that the
resultant political instability may lead to national and
international conflicts. (WHO Task Group, Potential health
effects of climate change, World Health Organisation, Geneva,

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>MORE DROUGHT FOR CALIFORNIA? </B></H3><P>

The State's primary watershed, the Sacramento River Basin, is
expected to produce less runoff  this year than in any year of
the severe 1987-1992 drought, and less than 50 percent of the 
average  runoff.  ( "U.S. to cut water supply for Central Valley
farms", San Francisco Chronicle, 10 May 1994) .<P>

Meanwhile, researchers from the California State University
believe they have found further evidence that small changes in
global climate can have dramatic regional impacts. Radiocarbon
data suggest that California suffered two periods of extended
severe drought during the  Medieval Warm Period between AD 900 to
AD 1400. These droughts which lasted 220 years and 140 years
respectively, were even more severe than the 1987-1992 drought
and the   Dust Bowl  drought of the 1930s.  Richard Madole from
the US Geological Survey suggests that this different climate,
with temperatures not much higher than current temperatures but
with  very much lowered water tables, could mean that California
may already be  near the threshold  of desertification.  The
study prompted researcher, S. Stine, to state:  "We can't predict
when  (another such) drought will come, but the consequences
would be profound...The mind boggles about what would happen to
California s agriculture , should global warming tip the Local
climate towards another drought period.  ( "California's climate
poised on a knife edge",  New Scientist, p.10, 25 June 1994; S.
Stine,  "Extreme and persistent drought in California and

Note: California has been subjected to a tempest of drought, fire
and flood in recent years.  The state began to ration water in
February 1991 after five years of below normal rainfall.  By
September 1992, the persistent drought and long hot summer
sparked 70,000 wildfires  that consumed more than 600,000
hectares of forest across  California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington
and Utah.  The fires were fuelled  by the many dead trees which
had been weakened by drought and attacked by Bark Beetle
infestations and by exposed hillsides, normally still snow-
covered.  The six year drought was eventually broken by severe
storms in December 1992 and again in February 1993.  The February
floods, the worst in 60 years,  caused mudslides, dam overflows
and devastated vegetable crops. In October 1993 brushfires swept
from the Mexican border to the northern suburbs of Los Angeles. 
Further fires in November 1993 took the total insurance bill to
close to a billion dollars. (See The Climate Time Bomb and

The worst drought in 100 years has now reached crisis levels in
Auckland city.  The city's 1 million citizens have been told to
reduce weekly water consumption by 25 percent - or face severe
water restrictions. Meteorologists warn that  70 days of solid
rain is  required to replenish water reservoirs. (New Zealand

<H3><B>EXPERTS SAY GLOBAL WARMING MAY EXACERBATE WORLD FOOD
SHORTAGES </B></H3><P>

The IPCC Working Group III Subgroup on Agriculture, Forestry and
Other Systems (AFOS) report concludes: The anticipated rise in
global average temperature of about 2 to 3 oC over the next
century will most likely lead to severe impacts on agriculture
and forestry such as:<P>

- a shift of the climatic zones by several hundred kilometres
towards the poles, enlarging  the arid zones in the tropical and
subtropical regions, and reducing the land available for
agriculture.<P>

- a rise in sea level of about 0.3 metres, inundating valuable
land in coastal areas, especially in tropical and subtropical
zones.<P>

- a gradual breakdown of many ecosystems like forests in
temperate and boreal regions, leading to additional CO2 emissions
and thus to further greenhouse warming.<P>

- potentially increased effects from pests and weeds.<P>

Marine and land food species may also be affected by the
increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth as
a result of unavoidable ongoing depletion of stratospheric ozone.
This could lead to a reduced production of biomass and
photosynthesis, thus again enhancing the CO2 content of the
atmosphere.<P>

The Group concludes  that  "it is likely to be enormously
difficult task for mankind, not only to limit climate change to a
tolerable level, but also to simultaneously achieve sufficient
food production for a still rising world  population..."  (K.
Heinloth (Physikalisches Institut des Universit t Bonn) & R.P.
Karimanzira,  "Outcomes and policy recommendations from the
IPCC/AFOS working group on climate change response strategies and
emission reductions",  Climatic Change, v.27(1), p. 139-146, May
1994).<P>

Eminent US scientists, Henry Kendall and David Pimental,   agree
with the conclusions of the IPCC workshop.  In modelling food
supply requirements for various population levels, they conclude
that global warming and ozone depletion may have catastrophic
effects on global food production.   While most countries were
food self-sufficient in the early 1960s, few remain so. The
increasing reliance on fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation,
increasing spread of soil erosion, ground  and surface water
pollution, salinisation,  and rapid degradation of productive
land has contributed to significantly reduced food production. In
Africa, per capita grain production has decreased by 22 percent
since 1967. Simultaneously, global population is projected to
double in 40 years,  necessitating   a  tripling of current food
production to maintain all peoples above the poverty line.  Water
is considered the major limiting factor, but the problems
associated with irrigation suggest that this is not the answer. 
Their study finds that while global warming may  benefit some
crops, it may also benefit pests,  insects and weeds. But the
primary concern relates to availability of water supply and the
expected increased variability of rainfall and drying of many
continental interiors in a global warming world.<P>

In their most optimistic scenario, Kendall and Pimental project a
near doubling of today's grain production to feed a world
population stabilised at 7.8 billion, and suggest that this could
be achieved with strict soil and water conservation programmes
and a redistribution of available food.  However, the huge
associated increase in energy intensiveness would have adverse
greenhouse consequences , and the 20 percent increase in
irrigation might not be feasible.  They conclude  that the future
is bleach unless there are major commitments from all governments
to  both reduce population growth and fund sustainable
agricultural production which protects the resource base.
(H.W.Kendall and D. Pimental, "Constraints on the expansion of
the global food supply", Ambio, v.23(3),  p.198-205,  May
1994).<P>

<H3><B>DEEP OCEAN WARMING REPORTED ALONG COLUMBUS ROUTE
</B></H3><P>

American and Spanish researchers report that the deep ocean along
the 24 oN meridian in   the sub-tropical Atlantic has warmed at a
rate of 1 oC per century in the last 35 years. Detailed data
collected from three transatlantic studies in 1957, 1981 and 1992
show a consistent warming at between 800 and 2,500 metres depth
during this time. Ocean circulation patterns do not appear to
have changed.  The warming is surprisingly deep, in comparison
with the surface warming projected by some ocean climate models,
but consistent with other models.  The observed cooling in
subpolar North Atlantic deep ocean is also consistent with these
latter models.  (G. Parrilla, A. Lavin, H. Bryden, M. Garcia & R.
Millard,  "Rising temperatures in the subtropical North Atlantic
Ocean over the past 35 years",  Nature, v.369(6475), p. 48-51, 5
May 1994).<P>

Note: Warming ocean temperatures have also been reported in deep
Mediterranean waters, in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New
Zealand and off  southern California. (see The Climate Time Bomb
and references therein.)<P>

<H3><B>OCEAN  "HOT SPOTS"  ARE LINKED TO MASS CORAL BLEACHING
EVENTS </B></H3> <P>

American coral experts Thomas Goreau and Raymond Hayes confirm
that coral bleaching events have become more frequent, widespread
and severe since the early 1980s. Major bleaching events have
occurred in all the major reef communities. Goreau and Hayes
suggest that the recent  El Nino events can only partly explain
this  global pattern.  Using satellite information of ocean
temperatures from NOAA and published bleaching reports they
identified  hot spot  areas where sea surface temperatures
exceeded long term means by more than  1 oC before reported
bleaching episodes.  All the events reported since 1983 were in
or on the edge of such  hot spots .<P>

The researchers express concern about the future of reef
ecosystems if episodic high temperature stress continues:<P>

"Increased mass coral bleaching would seriously impact marine
biodiversity, fisheries, tourism, on-shore protection, and the
ability to adapt to rising sea level in the over 100 countries
where coral reefs are major natural and economic resources."@@

A conference on natural disaster reduction held in Yokohama,
Japan,  looked at natural disasters in 179 countries over the
past 30 years,  and  concluded that, worldwide, natural disasters
are on the increase. In particular, the incidence and impacts
from of droughts and tropical storms appear to be worsening.  The
regions of the globe worst affected are, in decreasing order: the
Caribbean, South America, southern Asia, the Pacific, western
Africa, Central America and southern Africa. ("Disasters around

A major Japanese Meteorological Agency report  suggests
unprecedented increases in global temperatures in recent decades.
A 0.5 oC increase per decade since 1970 was recorded across areas
between southwestern Canada and the central northern US, and
Russian Siberia. A  0.9 oC increase in the last 90 years over
Japan prompted a Meteorological Agency official to state: "It
illustrates that environmental damage is progressing at an
alarming speed in Japan". ("Unprecedented rise in Earth's

<H3><B>MOUNTAIN GLACIER RETREAT SUPPORTS OBSERVED GLOBAL WARMING
</B></H3><P>

Johannes Oerlemans, a researcher at Utrecht University,
Netherlands, studied glacier length data from 48 valley glaciers
from between 1850 and 1990 and found all had retreated at average
rates of between .86 and 1.3 metres per year. The application of
models of climate sensitivity of glaciers to the data suggests
that the observed retreat can be explained by a warming trend of
around 0.66 oC per century, in line with the observed atmospheric
temperature trend during the past 100 years.<P>

        SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS:<P>

(J. Oerlemans (Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research,
Utrecht University), "Quantifying Global Warming from the Retreat
of Glaciers", Science, v.264, p.243-245, 8 April 1994).<P>

Note: Swiss scientist Wilfried Haeberli, has suggested that the
retreat of glaciers and the warming of the tundra's permafrost
gives a clear signal that the climate is changing: glacier and
permafrost signals of the twentieth century warming are coherent:
warming of polar firn and permafrost is pronounced and mass
loss/retreat of mountain glaciers is striking all over the world.
@@"...so far the length reduction of mountain glaciers still
remains the most easily detectable, unequivocal proof from cold
regions that fast and worldwide secular climatic change is taking
place. "@@ (emphasis added)(W. Haeberli,  "Glacier and permafrost
signals of the 20th-century warming",  Annals of Glaciology,
v.14, 1990).<P>

A massive coral bleaching event has been reported around French
Polynesia in association with warm soupy seas.  Investigating the
reports, Dr Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, from the University of Sydney,
found extensive mass-bleaching across all species down to 25
metres at all three sites studied, and some bleaching even at
depths of 40 metres.  Satellite measurements show warmer than
normal sea temperatures extending across the region. Hoegh-
Guldberg  concludes that the event was likely to be worse than
the 1991 event and the impact on the reef community is likely to
include the mortality of at least 50 percent of the current
living coral cover:<P>

"The connection between elevated temperature and mass-bleaching
events is now well established. The current association between
elevated seawater temperatures and the 1994 mass-bleaching event
strongly confirms this association. ...it is clear from studies
such as this one that small increases in sea temperature appear
to have potentially devastating consequences for coral reef
ecosystems. Given the temperature increase expected in a global
warming scenario (from the IPCC), it is abundantly clear that
coral reef ecosystems may be the first among a series of
casualties of global climate change. The estimated economic,
social and strategic impact of changes of this magnitude to
ecosystems as important  as those of coral reefs cannot be
underestimated..." (O. Hoegh- Guldberg (School of Biological
Sciences and Institute of Marine Ecology, University of Sydney), 
Mass-bleaching of coral reefs in French Polynesia,  Report
prepared for Greenpeace International, April 1994).<P>

The meteorological record suggests that global air temperatures
have risen by around 0.50 C in the past 100 years, with stronger
warming recorded in arctic regions and little or no warming
recorded in low latitudes. Now borehole measurements taken in
Alaska support that record. These measurements indicate a ground
temperature increase of between 2 and 5 oC this century,
consistent with tree-ring and ice core data collected from the
Canadian Arctic, which suggest a 3 oC warming. And measurements
taken from boreholes across central and eastern Canada show  a 1
to 2 oC warming, also broadly consistent with tree-ring and Local
weather station data (although up to half of this may be due to
the climate rebounding from the Little Ice Age which ended in the
1800's). (H. Beltrami (McGill University, Canada) & D. Chapman

Scientist, v.142(1922), p. 36-40, 23 April 1994).<P>

<H3><B>BIODIVERSITY LOSS MAY ACCELERATE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 INCREASE
</B></H3><P>

Researchers from UK's National Environment Research Council
(NERC) Centre for Population Biology have discovered that highly
diverse ecosystems consume more CO2 than lower diversity
communities. Using fourteen terrestrial microcosm models and
manipulating the communities to produce loss of biodiversity
analogous to that currently observed in the natural environment,
NERC reported  that, in addition to loss of genetic resources,
loss of productivity and loss of the buffering  against
ecological perturbation, loss of biodiversity may also lead to an
alteration or reduction in the  services that ecosystems
provide.<P>

The NERC team concluded that to the extent that loss of plant
diversity in the real world means a reduction of ecosystems to
fix CO2, we [also] tentatively conclude that the loss of
diversity may reduce the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to
absorb anthropogenic CO2. (S. Naeem, L.J. Thompson, S.P. Lawler,

Even bigger than last year's plague, southeast Australia's rodent
infestation has been blamed on recent mild winters (which have
extended the breeding season) and the wet summers and long, dry
autumns (which have increased food supply).  The mice destroyed
an estimated Aus$100 million worth of crops in 1993; already in
1994, more than 50 percent of cereal and bean crops in NSW have
been damaged. Favourable weather is also aiding an increase in
rat numbers. ("Australia: Huge plague of mice set to march on
farmlands", Sydney Morning Herald, 6 April 1994;  "Mice Bring a
Plague on All Their Farms", Time Australia, 2 May 1994).<P>

Note: Mild weather conditions and excellent grain harvests
combined to provide exceptional breeding conditions for mice in
mid-winter 1993. 100,000 hectares of pasture land were devastated
in South Australia, causing an estimated Aus$20 million damage.
Warm weather has contributed to other rodent plagues in Australia
in recent years - in 1987, central New South Wales was struck by
a mice infestation which caused Aus$1.2 million damage to grain
harvests, while a prime wheat growing area, Darling Downs,
Queensland,  lost 30 percent of the summer crop to mice in
1989.<P>

Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly. This small butterfly has
adapted to the cold and snowy winters of the southern Rocky

<TITLE>FOSSIL EVIDENCE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STABILITY OF
THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET</TITLE>

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>FOSSIL EVIDENCE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STABILITY OF
THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET </B></H3> <P>

Dr Barrie McKelvey from the University of New England, Australia,
has found fossil evidence that suggests that the Antarctic may be
more dynamic than previously thought. Recent discoveries of
fossil leaves from woody shrubs together with evidence from
marine fossils, suggest a relatively warm Antarctic climate
around three million years ago. Previously, it had been thought
that the continent was covered in ice - and thus without flora -
at such a time. The Southern Beech fossils indicate temperatures
15-20 oC warmer than current Antarctic temperatures and suggest
that a large part of the Antarctic ice sheet was ice-free.
Perhaps up to two-thirds of the continent was covered by sea.<P>

Researcher Barrie McKelvey asks:  Was the Pliocene warming an
earlier greenhouse event and, if so, how did it come about?... No
one knows yet. However we do know that globally the climate was
only a few degrees warmer than today. Is there then the prospect
of the ice sheet shrinking again in the response to climatic
warming, this time caused by increased concentrations of
industrial anthropogenic carbon dioxide, with at the very least a
calamitous global rise in sea-level?  (B. McKelvey (Department of
Geology and Geophysics, University of New England),  "Cold War
Over Warm Ice", Australian Natural History Magazine, v.24(8),
Autumn 1994).<P>

Note: This research is important for our understanding of what
might happen to the Antarctic ice-sheet in a global warming
world. NASA glaciologists have already raised concerns about
possible instability in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Five active
ice streams feeding ice from the interior of West Antarctica into
the Ross Ice Shelf, and other ice streams draining other portions
of West Antarctica into the Ronne Ice Shelf and separate
peripheral ice shelves on the northern boundary of the ice sheet,
may be manifestations of collapse already underway.  The question
facing us is whether the atmosphere and ocean system is coupled
to the ice sheets in such a way that a climatic warming from
present conditions is likely to trigger, or has already
triggered, the marine ice-sheet instability in the West Antarctic
ice sheet, or in certain parts of the Greenland or East Antarctic
ice sheets that are marine in character. Answering this question
requires a better understanding of the interactions between the
marine ice sheets and the global environment than has yet been
developed.<P>

</B></H3><P>

The fires rage through more than 50,000 hectares of  the
country's largest pine forest, in Inner Mongolia.  After sixteen
months of drought, severe water restrictions  now affect more
than 5.8 million  people across 17  cities and provinces in
northern China.  Following a very dry 1993, Beijing has only
received 2.1 mm of  rain this year. Water levels have dropped
sharply in  the city's two biggest dams and other reservoirs have
dried up. Earlier this month a huge dust storm swept through the 
Daxing anling mountains, causing 20 million yuan damage (US$2.3.
million) and killing 50,000 livestock. Korea and Japan have also
received little rainfall over the last two months.<P>

High temperatures, up to 6 oC above average, made conditions
worse in Korea and northeast China. ("Inner Mongolia recovering
from forest fire, dust storm", Agence France Presse, 25 April
1994; "China drought continues", United Press International, 25
April 1994;  "Forest fire burns 123,500 acres, five arrested",

Note: Rainfall over east Asia (defined as the whole of the
Peoples Republic of China and surrounding territories) has
generally increased since 1880, though only very slightly. The
region has also experienced more dry years since the early 1960s.
The winters between 1988 and 1991 were very warm across most of
China with temperatures up to 5ÉC above the average in the north.
China has experienced many severe droughts and floods in recent
years: <P>

1988-89: Severe drought in northern China. Liaoning and
Jilin provinces suffered under the worst droughts in 40 years.<P>

1991: March: The drought across northeastern China damaged much
of the country's yearly wheat harvest, dried up water reservoirs
and forced tens of thousands of people to travel for miles in
search of drinking water. <P>

1991: June: The Yangtze River's worst
flood this century  leaves 10 million homeless and 1,000 dead. 
Chinese  scientists blame the floods on global warming. <P>

1991: July/August: While violent storms renew flooding in the
already devastated northeast province of Heilongjiang, the
drought in Hunan continued to worsen as rivers, lakes and dams
ran dry.<P>

1992: February:  The Assistant Director of the National
Meteorological Institute, Luo Jibin, reports average temperatures
around two to four degrees C above normal values.  Above normal
temperatures have been reported over the past six winters and a
severe drought continues in the north of the country.  Luo Jibin
suggests that this could be the result of global warming. 

1992: June: Over 220 people died in Fujian province when the Min
River reached its highest level in 50 years. June floods caused
losses of three billion yuan ($520,000) and affected over nine
million people. <P>

1993: July: The Civil Affairs Ministry estimates that a
rarely seen period of climate disasters has caused 33.2 billion
yuan ($5.8 billion) of damage, injured over 51,000 people and
destroyed 3.1 million hectares of crops. Summer flooding that
began in June has claimed more than 400 lives, the worst
sandstorm in 40 years killed over 70 in May and drought in the
north and northeast has hammered six of China's most important
grain producing provinces. Record rainfall in western China's
Guangxi Zhuangzu region has flooded nearly 65,000 hectares of
farmland and killed 32. <P>

has moved 120 km north during the last 26 years. This shift has
been correlated with temperature records for the area, which show
a warming trend between 1949 and 1989.  (Y.T.J. Kwong and T.Y.

<H3><B>CHANGE PREDICTED FOR ARID WATERSHEDS </B></H3><P>

US researchers have utilised a model to simulate the effects of
changes in climate and CO2 concentrations on arid and semiarid
watersheds. They found that while some plants will be favoured by
higher temperatures, others would be favoured by higher CO2
levels; therefore plant species composition may remain roughly
the same. In some areas plants will start to grow earlier in the
season, and thus deplete soil moisture earlier. Snow will melt
earlier and plants will utilise the meltwater earlier, again
depleting soil moisture content. Therefore, while increased
temperatures and CO2 may enhance plant growth, water is likely to
be a major  limiting factor. Overall, precipitation is predicted
to decrease in these areas. (J.W.Skiles and J.D. Hanson, "Arid
and semiarid watersheds, increasing carbon dioxide and climate
change", Climatic Change, v.26, p.377-397, April 1994).<P>

<H3><B>INSECTS MAY BENEFIT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE </B></H3><P>

Researchers from the state University of New York at Binghamton
suggest that as day and night temperatures become more uniform in
a climate changing world, plants may lose the ability to defend
themselves against plant pests. Nancy E. Stamp conducted
experiments to test the effect of rutin, a plant toxin, on
caterpillars. At more uniform temperatures caterpillars seemed to
be less affected by rutin than when temperatures were alternated
to simulate diurnal oscillations. While no firm conclusions can
be drawn, Stamp cautions that decreasing temperature ranges "may
interfere with the plants' ability to defend themselves."
("Climate change may make insects winners",  Science News, 9
April 1994).<P>

Note: Modelling work undertaken within the Australian Co-
operative Research Centre for Tropical Pest Management tends to
support the conclusion that pests will benefit from climate
change. Estimates from the climate-matching model, CLIMAX, which
integrates plant and animal population response to temperature,
moisture, climate extremes and day-length, suggest that species
such as the buffalo fly Haematobia irritans exigua may spread as
the climate changes. Buffalo fly has already expanded its range
400km south in eastern Australia since the mid-1970's and if the
CLIMAX results prove accurate Culicoides wadia (a vector of
bluetongue virus in Australia), cattle tick Boophilus microplus,
Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni, the introduced cane toad
Bufo marinus and sheep blowfly may all increase causing greater
problems in Australia in the future. In New Zealand, the bush
tick Haemaphysalis longicornis which causes livestock death and
loss of production, may spread across the entire South Island and
become more prevalent in the North Island. New Zealand would also
face increased risks from Queensland Fruit Fly and other
Australian and Pacific species. While some temperate species are
expected to decline, the introduced tropical pests would be far
more damaging. (R.W. Sutherst, "Impact of Climate Change on Pests
and Diseases in Australasia", Search, v.21(7), p.230-232,
October/November 1990; R.W. Sutherst, "Climate Change and

<H3><B>WINDSTORMS CONTINUE TO BLAST INSURANCE INDUSTRY
</B></H3><P>

The world insurance industry continues to express alarm at the
recent  unprecedented levels of windstorm losses. In response,
Munich Reinsurance have suggested some countermeasures which can
be taken to minimise losses, including taking concrete action to
curb the greenhouse effect. ("Stormy weather: the mounting
windstorm risk  and consequences for the insurance industry", 
Ecodecision, April 1994).<P>

Note: Insurer losses from climate extremes has risen dramatically
in recent years. In 1990, Munich Re, the world's largest
reinsurance company, stated that: "For the first time in the
history of our planet, mankind is about to change the climate
significantly and possibly irreversibly, without having any idea
of the consequences that will have. ...With economic and insured
losses increasing in volume by a factor of 3 and 5 respectively
since the 1960s, we definitely have a trend which, without
exaggeration, may be regarded as dramatic".  Two years later,
Swiss Re's specialist Greenhouse Effect Project Team, further
elaborated the risks posed by climate change to the insurance
industry. They suggested that increased intensity and frequency
of windstorms, floods, thunderstorms, tornadoes, landslides and
storm surges could all cause significant problems for the
industry. 1992's catastrophe losses reached a record $27.1
billion, a global record and an increase of 87 percent on 1991.
Swiss Re found that both the size and frequency of catastrophes
seemed to be increasing. In April 1993, Munich Re, in publishing
its analysis of the 1992 catastrophe statistics stated: "Action
is now required first and foremost from politics and business:
the imminent change in our climate makes speedy, radical
countermeasures unavoidable". ("Windstorm", Munich Re Special
Publication, 1990; Greenhouse Effect Project Team, "Greenhouse
effect scenarios for Swiss Re", Swiss Re internal report, April
1992; Swiss Re, Sigma 2/93, "Naturkatastrophen und Grossschaeden

April 1993; "Munich Re plea for catastrophe action", Lloyd's

<H3><B>CONTROVERSY OVER PAST WARMING IN ANTARCTICA </B></H3><P>

The recent discovery of Nothofagus fossil leaves in glacial
deposits only 500 km from the South Pole has caused a controversy
in Antarctic palaeontology circles.  The fossils have been dated
at 3 million years old, a time when the Antarctic continent was
presumed to have been deeply glaciated. The prevailing view had
held that Antarctica's climate supported vegetation until 14
million years ago when a period of cooling began.  If the age of
the fossils is correct, and surrounding marine fossils provide
some corroborative evidence, the region was much warmer then than
it is now. (Nothofagus currently grows in cool temperate areas
such as Tierra del Fuego.)<P>

The researchers pose the question : "Is the present period of
warming, brought about by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
agents, likely to result in a similar change to the Antarctic
climate?". (Barrie McKelvey, "Cold war over warm ice", Australian
Natural History, Autumn 1994).<P>

Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, southern Kentucky, the western
Carolinas, Alabama, Georgia and the northern Mississippi have
been drenched by between 100 and 215mm of rain. Flash-flooding
was reported in the mid-Atlantic and tornadoes hit the southeast.
Conditions did not improve in April: Tornadoes hit the eastern
Plains and the Midwest, one in Lancaster (near Dallas) alone
causing damage around [US] $250 million.  Above average
temperatures, between 3 oC and 7 oC above normal, were also
recorded across most of the eastern US and the Canadian Maritime
Provinces in April. (Climate Analysis Centre, "Major Climatic

<H3><B>HIGHER TEMPERATURES PROMOTE INCREASED MALARIA INCIDENCE IN
RWANDA </B></H3> <P>

Significant temperature increases and record rainfalls in Rwanda
between 1961 and 1990 appear to correspond with an increased
incidence and geographic spread of malaria. Between 1984 and
1988, cases rose by 266 percent; in the study area of Butare
prefecture, malaria cases increased by 337 percent in the three
year period of 1985-87. The greatest increases in incidence and
in associated deaths were among non-immune populations, such as
high altitude communities and children. Anecdotal evidence
suggests malaria was not endemic in high latitude communities
prior to the early 1980's. A study of malaria incidence suggests
that it is particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, and
especially minimum temperature. While non-climate factors have
been implicated in epidemics elsewhere, in the study area this
was not the case. (M.E. Loevinsohn, "Climatic warming and
increased malaria incidence in Rwanda", The Lancet, v.343,
p.714-718, 19 March 1994). <P>

Note: The author notes that in the late 1980's epidemics
associated with high rainfall and increased drug resistance
occurred in Botswana, Madagascar, Swaziland and Zambia. An
unprecedented malaria epidemic occurred in Madagascar's highlands
in 1988, when more than 100,000 malaria-related deaths were
recorded. While many factors, such as the reintroduction of
malaria vectors, and lack or high cost of anti-malaria medicine
contributed greatly to the outbreak, the researcher believes that
increased temperatures may have contributed to the problem:
"...The "greenhouse" effect contributing to a rise in temperature
of the earth is visible in the highlands, where an increase of
0.8 oC has been recorded, and could have an effect on the
malaria, allowing it to extend the time for transmission".  (J.
de
Julueta, "Rapport de mission effectue a Madagascar", 28 Juillet -
13 Septembre 1988, unpublished travel report for WHO. Thanks to

<H3><B>EL NINO IS IMPORTANT CLIMATIC INFLUENCE   </B></H3><P>

Henry Diaz and Roger Pulwarty of the University of Colorado
analysed seven climate indices which are sensitive to El Nino,
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, to look for links with
climatic variability. The researchers utilised historical records
(such as Chinese rainfall records and Nile floods), tree rings
records and oxygen levels from a Peruvian glacier, and examined
the data for variability on a 2-10 year scale (which covers most
variability seen in the modern ENSO record) and on a longer
11-150 year scale.<P>

Their research suggests that events on a scale of 2-6 years were
persistent throughout the sampled data, implying that ENSO has
been an important influence on climatic variability in the
circum-Pacific region for the past 1000 years. (H.F. Diaz and
R.S. Pulwarty, "An analysis of the time scales of variability in
centuries-long ENSO-sensitive records in the last 1000 years",
Climatic Change, v.26, p.317-342, March 1994).<P>

Note: Historical data such as this suggests that intensity and
frequency of ENSO events may be unaffected by climate change,
because most studies report that variability has remained fairly
constant in both warm and cold climate periods (such as the
Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age). However, instrumental
data from this century shows that the strength of ENSO's impacts
in different regions (such as El Nino events causing droughts in
Australasia and floods southeast Brazil) is variable. A period of
weak "teleconnections" occurred from around 1920 to 1940 and
strong teleconnections occurred at the beginning of the century
and from 1950 to the present. Since the late 1970's there have
also been more El Nino events than La Nina events. Isotope data
from coral reefs in the central Pacific suggests that this period
is unlike any other that has occurred over the last century. Some
have suggested that this "semi-permanent" El Nino event may be
the result of the rapid global warming that has occurred over
this period. (W.H. Quinn & V.T. Neal, "The historical record of

<H3><B>THE "MEDIEVAL WARM PERIOD" </B></H3><P>

Evidence from a variety of sources, such as tree rings, ice
cores, historical documents, glaciers, geology, and borehole
temperatures, suggests that there may have been a period of
climatic warming between the ninth and fourteenth centuries, when
temperatures were higher than at the start of the 20th century,
at least in some parts of the globe. These include Scandinavia,
China, the Sierra Nevada in California, the Canadian Rockies and
Tasmania.  Evidence from other regions, such as the south eastern
United States, Mediterranean Europe, and parts of South America,
shows that during the same period temperatures were little
different from later times. This postulated period has been
called the Medieval Warm Period, and is widely believed to have
been followed by the Little Ice Age.<P>

Climate reconstructions from tree rings show little evidence for
a sustained warm period during the last 1000 years, except in the
Sierra Nevada, the Great Basin, and the Polar Urals. However,
consistent features are a cooling tendency in the early and mid-
17th century, and a warm period between the mid-12th and early
14th centuries. Ice core evidence is being treated with caution,
although it suggests warming during the early centuries of the
second millennium. Historical evidence is largely  based on
records of crop planting in more northern latitudes than the
present, and on archaeological evidence from settlements in
Iceland and Greenland. Glacial evidence appears stronger, with
glacial retreats in Europe and elsewhere before AD 900 and after
1250, but not between these dates. Borehole temperature records
are too coarse at present to give accurate indications, but it
appears that sometime between late in the first millennium and
the middle of the second, there was a period of undetermined
length with above average temperatures.<P>

The evidence is not conclusive. Warmer conditions may have
prevailed in some seasons in some regions during the period of
interest. Much of the data that had been formerly used to present
a more conclusive picture of the Medieval Warm Period, and of the
Little Ice Age, have now been superseded or discarded.  What the
current data does show is that variability in climate on a
decadal scale is apparent over the last 1000 years, but because
the data is so incomplete, it is very difficult to use it to
predict future climate trends. (M.K. Hughes and H.F. Diaz, "Was
there a 'Medieval Warm Period?", Climatic Change, v.26,
p.109-142, March 1994).<P>

<TITLE>SLOW-DOWN OF GREENHOUSE-GAS BUILDUP SINCE 1991 RELATED TO

<H3><B>SLOW-DOWN OF GREENHOUSE-GAS BUILDUP SINCE 1991 RELATED TO
PINATUBO? </B></H3>
<P>

A number of recent papers have documented the slowdown or
plateauing of the rate of accumulation of carbon dioxide,
methane, and nitrous oxide since 1991.  At the same time oxygen
has been shown to be increasing, and carbon monoxide to be
decreasing. With five gases showing unusual trends, the
possibility of a common cause is being seriously considered. The
rise in carbon dioxide began to slow dramatically in July 1991,
immediately after the Mount Pinatubo eruption. (See September
1993 of The Climate Time Bomb for an account of the announcement
of the new carbon dioxide trend.) It didn't start returning to
its normal pace until mid-1993. Methane and nitrous oxide also
sharply slowed or stopped just after the June 1991 eruption, and
are now also returning to their normal rate of buildup. A recent
Science report concludes that "the clearest candidate for a
single driving force is the cloud of debris from the volcano." 

There is now much speculation about how this could be working.
Other explanations, or compound explanations, are possible. The
scientists reporting the slowing and then plateauing of methane,
speculate that improvements in the repairing of gas pipelines in
Russia might be in largely responsible. (R. A. Kerr, "Did
Pinatubo send climate warming gases into a dither?", Science,
v.263, p.1562, 18 March 1994). Where carbon dioxide is concerned,
one idea is that the cooling effect of the eruption altered the
balance between photosynthesis and respiration on land, and
increased the net uptake of  carbon dioxide in the oceans. NOAA's
Pieter Tans comments that this "could cause a big, short-term
jolt to the carbon balance. In 1994, if the temperature comes
back to normal, we should get normal carbon dioxide growth
again."  Ralph Keeling of Scripps, the originator of monitoring
of atmospheric carbon dioxide, agrees that the slowing of the
rate of the buildup is temporary. ("No global warming?"
Scientific American, v. 270(2), p.12-13, February 1994).<P>

<H3><B>DEVASTATING CORAL BLEACHING IN FRENCH POLYNESIA
</B></H3><P>

Some local observers predict that the reef will be 100 percent
bleached by May.  Tahitian newspaper, La Depeche, reports: "The
bleaching of coral on our coasts has unfortunately gone from
orange to red (alert) everywhere,  on the ocean side of the
barrier reef as well as on the lagoon side, the coral wear their
"fluorescent" and white livery, proof that the stress they face,
linked very probably with too high water temperature, is doing
its work, a deadly work."  One of the best placed people for
observing this phenomenon and comparing it with the previous 15
years is local diver and biologist, Henri Pouliquen.  Henri
observed the bleaching episodes in 1983 (light), 1984 (very
strong) and 1991 (also very strong) and believes that this year
holds all the ingredients of a new ecological disaster: "by the
month of May, if there hasn't been a dramatic drop in water
temperature, I think that 100 percent of coral in our lagoons
will be destroyed".  This, sadly, is all too possible. In the
warm waters of the 1983 El Nino event, reefs suffered 50 percent
mortality off Panama, and over 90 percent of the coral died in
areas of the Galapagos. (La Depeche, 15 March 1994).<P>

Note: Coral bleaching occurs as a result of the microscopic algae
which live in symbiosis within the coral tissue - zooxanthellae -
being expelled from the tissue as a result of ecological stress.
A variety of stresses can produce this effect, including hot
water, cold water, excessive UV radiation, or pollution. Corals
are highly temperature-sensitive: stable at 25 to 29ÉC, depending
on geographic location, but stressed if they encounter
temperatures of just a few degrees celsius higher even for a
matter of days. Recent severe episodes have been associated with
El Nino years. During the 1982-83 El Nino, mortality reached 50
percent off the coast of Panama, and 70 to 80 percent in the
Galapagos. According to reef biologists Barbara Brown and John
Ogden, the episodes of the past decade have consistently been
correlated with high seawater temperatures.   ...The narrow
temperature range of healthy coral is very close to its upper
lethal temperature: an increase of one to two degrees celsius
above the usual summer maximum can be deadly.  (See The Climate
Time Bomb and references therein.)<P>

The 15th storm to hit the eastern US "in the nastiest winter in
recent memory" promotes a fresh burst of concern from reinsurers.

The concern expressed is not limited to windstorm activity.
According to Stephen Leatherman, Director of the University of
Maryland's Laboratory for Coastal Research, sea level along the
eastern US coast has risen by one foot over the last century,
causing beaches to recede an average of 60-90 metres, and is
expected to rise an additional 14-19 cm during the next 20 years,
further threatening the $2 trillion [US] worth of insured
property along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Franklin Nutter,
President of the Reinsurance Association of America, professes
that "the insurance business is first in line to be affected by
climate change... it could bankrupt the industry". Time
magazine's correspondent, Eugene Linden, writes: "These risks and
the crucial role played by the [US] $1.41 trillion insurance
industry in the global economy could change the dynamics of the
debate about global warming. Last fall Nutter told an industry
conference that climate change is an issue in which it may prove
to be in the industry's interest to assume an advocacy role.
...Insurers have already had an impact on climate change through
their actions in the marketplace. Soaring premiums and insurance
cancellations alert residents of coastal areas that changes in
weather patterns can have profound economic consequences. With 50
percent of the US population living within 50 miles [80 km] of a
coastline, ordinary people may also begin to draw a similar
connection between climate change and their own well-being,
should the windstorms continue." ("Burned by warming", Time
Magazine, 14 March 1994).<P>

Dr Peter Wadhams of the Scott Polar Research Institute tells the
Oceanology International '94 conference of "disturbing and
surprising" evidence that "convection in the Greenland Sea has
virtually stopped in the last decade".  He describes the results
of several cruises over a ten year period to the Odden Ice
Feature, a prominent tongue on the fringe of the Arctic ice cap
where ice formation causes dense salty water to form, which in
turn sinks and drives ocean circulation. When ice forms, salt is
excluded, making the residual seawater saltier than normal. This
ice-related density-driven circulation operates in only three
small areas of ocean: in the Greenland Sea, and in the Labrador
and Weddell Seas. A fourth area of density-driven circulation,
related to evaporation rather than ice, operates where the
Mediterranean joins the Atlantic. The reduced convection in the
Greenland Sea reduces the amount of carbon dioxide that can be
taken down into deep water - normally about 25 percent of the
global total is sequestered in this way, Wadhams estimates -  and
so will boost global warming. "It is a process that has been
going on for several thousand years, and when you see it decline
sharply over a decade it gets you worried", says Wadhams. That
less ice is forming in the region is something which Wadhams
thinks "is probably a function of global warming". Ten years ago
convection was down to the sea floor 3660 metres below. Five
years ago it was down to 1830 metres. Last year, it reached  to
only 900 metres. ("Sea fails to soak up greenhouse gases", Daily
Telegraph, 10 March 1994; "Is broken ocean pump a global
warning?", New Scientist, p.4, 19 March 1994).<P>

<H3><B>OIL INDUSTRY EXPERIENCES SHARP END OF CLIMATE CHANGE

A German insurance chief says that the oil industry is confirming
changes in weather underlying the upward trend in insured and
economic losses.  At the Allianz Sachgruppe annual press
conference, the CEO, Dr Uwe Haasen, says: "this development is
confirmed by the oil industry, which tells us of a noticeable
increase in wave height and force, which results in new demands
on the strength of the platforms' anchor systems". Haasen says
action must be taken to counter rising losses. He suggests that
storm and flood warnings and building design must be improved,
but would not be drawn on the question of whether global warming
might be responsible for the weather changes. ("Munich and
Allianz plan for catastrophes", Lloyd's List, 8 March 1994).<P>

<H3><B>UN REPORT LISTS EVIDENCE FOR ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE
</B></H3><P>

The 400 page UNEP biennial Environmental Data Report cites
evidence of shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, and unusually
high average temperatures of the 1980s and 1990s. The retreat of
mountain glaciers "provides some of the clearest evidence for a
change in energy balance at the Earth's surface since the turn of
the century".  But the report cautions that "although the above
findings are broadly in line with model predictions for climate
change, it must be stressed that it is still not possible to
attribute the observed global warming specifically to increased
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases". (UNEP
Environmental Data Report 1993-94, Blackwell Publishers, Oxford,
1994; "Global warming taking place", Independent, 2 March 1994).
According to UNEP Deputy Director, Dr Noel Brown, "There are now
very definite signals that the earth's climate is indeed
changing." ("No place on earth for more consumers", The
Australian, 8 March 1994).<P>

Princeton University scientists use a 1,000- year time series of
global mean temperature in their GCM to investigate natural
climate variability. They find that at no time during the model's
1,000 year simulation does the temperature increase to the extent
observed this century. Stouffer et al report: 'Assuming that the
model is realistic, these results suggest that the observed trend
is not a natural feature of the interaction between the
atmosphere and oceans. Instead, it may have been induced by a
sustained change in the thermal forcing, such as that resulting
from changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and
aerosol loading.' (R.J. Stouffer, S. Manabe & K.Ya. Vinnikov,
"Model assessment of the role of natural variability in recent
global warming", Nature, v. 367(6464), p.634-637, 17 February
1994). <P>

CO2 induced extinction of tree species would affect forests 
supposedly remote from human impacts.  Atmospheric concentrations
of the major greenhouse gas methane, which were rapidly
increasing until 1991, have suddenly stopped rising.
Interpretations vary: reduced fossil fuel use in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union; plugging of  leaks in the huge
Siberian gasfields;  a slowing of one of the major natural
sources, such as digestion by termites or cattle, or
decomposition of landfills;  less intensive burning in tropical
areas during 1992.   Other possible explanations  include the
cooling effect of the Mt Pinatubo eruption, which may have
inhibited methane emissions from wetlands or some unknown
atmospheric process in play.  ("Methane increase put on pause",
Science, v. 263, p. 751, 11 February 1994; J. Rudolph, "Anomalous
methane", Nature, v. 368, p. 19, 3 March 1994).<P>

<H3><B>CARBON BALANCE CHANGES IN NORTHERN FORESTS </B></H3><P>

The significance of the northern forests as a carbon sink is now
generally accepted.  The recent increase in incidence of boreal
forest fires, in combination with logging, dieback from acid rain
and insect attack,  seriously reduces the ability of the forests
to store carbon,  and is therefore a worrying occurrence. While
tropical forest fires release about 10 times more CO2 than fires
in the northern forests, the breakdown of residual wood after
fires in the north releases CO2  for about 10 times longer - so
the net effect is almost the same. Fires, dieback and insect
attack are believed to be related to warmer weather since the
1970s. ("The northern forests: imperilled ecosystems vital to
atmospheric balance", No Sweat News, no.7, Winter 94, 17 February
1994).<P>

<H3><B>FLUCTUATION IN NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP WATER </B></H3><P>

The North Atlantic Deep Water current, which carries warm water
north from the tropics to Europe, may have experienced rapid
fluctuations  in flow- rate in the past, according to Andrew J.
Weaver and Tertia M.C. Hughes of the University of Victoria in
British Columbia, and these fluctuations may have had major
effects on global climate. Currently it is stable, running at
what Weaver and Hughes consider to be medium speed.  However,
when they simulated a warmer climate in a modelling experiment,
stability broke down and the current oscillated wildly in speed. 
The researchers suggest that climatic change may explain apparent
rapid climate oscillations during the Eemian stage (130,000 years
ago), prior to the last ice age, though the existence of these
fluctuations has been questioned. ("Atlantic current gives
climate the shakes", Science News, 5 February 1994; "An unstable
superconveyer", Nature, v. 367, p.414-415, 3 February 1994).<P>

<H3><B>DO SULPHATE AEROSOLS REDUCE THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT?
</B></H3><P>

Recent research suggests that industrial emissions of sulfur
dioxide may have a significant impact on  the greenhouse effect. 

It is already known that  sulfate aerosols react with water to
produce acid rain, and if they reach the stratosphere, may, under
certain circumstances,  contribute to the destruction of the
ozone layer.  But now there is also evidence that they may
contribute some of the greenhouse effect directly, by reflecting
sunlight, or indirectly, by seeding more clouds, which reflect
sunlight.<P>

While natural aerosols such as dust, sea salt or volcanic
particles have always been present in the atmosphere, aerosols
caused by human activities have increased dramatically,
particularly since 1950, as a consequence of fossil fuel
combustions. The action of aerosols may explain the lower than
expected warming over such heavily industrialised areas as parts
of North America. (R.J. Charlson and T.M.L. Wigley, "Sulfate
aerosol and climatic change", Scientific American, v. 270(2),
p.28-33, February 1994).  As the IPCC has noted, however, the
lifetime of aerosols is quite short - months - and that of CO2
over a century.  Sulfur emission reductions, which are now being
introduced for other environmental reasons, will lead to a rapid
reduction in the offset-effect, leaving the full strength of
greenhouse effect of the Co2 for many centuries.<P>

Researchers from the International Rice Research Institute based
in the Philippines suggest that environmental degradation and
changing climate conditions are threatening the genetic diversity
of rice, a major food source across the world. ("Warning over
rice shortages", The Australian, 22 February 1994).<P>

Loss of biological diversity is a major threat to global
agriculture.  Rapidly changing climate conditions and exponential
population growth will increase the pressure on agricultural
scientists to produce new varieties of crops that give high
yields under increasingly adverse environmental conditions -
droughts, floods, pest and disease outbreaks, and diminished top
soil and water resources. To achieve this researchers will need
healthy and diverse gene reserves from wild crop varieties, but
the gene reserves of crops are already being depleted at
unprecedented rates and will be further threatened by climate
changes and accelerated environmental deterioration. This leaves
us dependent on a critically reduced genetic resource base and
limits the ability of agriculture to adapt to climate changes.

The President of  the Insurance Association of the Caribbean

particularly affects northern Caribbean countries: the Bahamas,
Jamaica, Antigua, the Virgin Islands, St Kitts, and Puerto Rico. 
Governments fear that the weakness of companies in the region
"could hinder economic development, including the all important
hotel industry".  The IAC is conducting a campaign for mandatory
building standards, hoping to save millions of dollars in damage
claims in the medium to long term. ("Crisis call from insurers in

Both major roads in the country were cut, food supplies to Lima
disrupted and 30,000 hectares of crops ruined. The flooding
affected Peru from the base of the Andes to the coastal towns. 25
regions were declared "in emergency". (Reuter, 24 February 1994;
Lloyd's Agents 25 February 1994). Heavy rain had lasted for much
of February, causing at least 63 deaths and making 12,000
homeless. (UPI, 16 February 1994).<P>

Another unusually severe winter storm in the disaster-hit state
caused tons of mud to crash into million-dollar mansions and
knocked out power to thousands of homes. Worst affected again was
Malibu, where electricity was cut to 3,000 homes. (Reuter, 20
February 1994; "3 die as 'storm from hell' shatters LA", Standard

<H3><B>TROPICAL FORESTS BIODIVERSITY THREATENED BY RISING CARBON
DIOXIDE LEVELS </B></H3> <P>

World renowned ecologists  O.L. Phillips and A.H. Gentry,  from
the Missouri Botanical Gardens, report that increased carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere could cause extinctions in
tropical rainforest ecosystems and may even  lead to emissions of
carbon dioxide from these forests. Based on site studies in South
America, southeast Asia, Australia and Africa, the researchers
found that 'turnover' rates in tropical forests have increased
since the 1950s and  have been 'accelerating since 1980'. 
Phillips and Gentry argue  that this 'may have profound effects
on biological  diversity' and link this to the 'accelerating
build up of CO2'. CO2-induced increased turnover in tropical
forest would  encourage species that are light tolerant and
opportunistic, such as liane, and those that have a lower carbon
density than the more shade-tolerant tree species.  This trend
'has  implications for global change, with likely effects on 
tropical biodiversity and possible unexpected links between the
global carbon cycle and tropical forests.  ...  Accelerating
dynamics in Western Amazonia ... indicate that  even the largest
areas of tropical forests could become inadequate to conserve
samples of the biome without the rapid reduction of carbon
emissions. ... large scale biodiversity levels could decline'. 
They point out that '(E)ventually, extinctions are possible
amongst the slowest growing shade-tolerant tree species and among
tropical organisms with life cycles tied to these trees'. And
'... primary tropical forests may increasingly  become a net
carbon source, rather than a sink assumed in  most recent general
circulation models.  Such a process would constitute  an
unexpected synergism between CO2  emissions from industrialized
and tropical countries.' (O.L. Phillips, and A. H. Gentry,
"Increasing turnover through time in tropical forests", Science,
v. 263, p. 954-958, 18 February 1994). (Sadly, Gentry and some of
his co-workers were killed in a plane crash in Ecuador before
this paper was published.) <P>

Note: Tropical rainforests are believed to contain more than half
of all the species on earth, although they occupy only 6% of the
land area.   In the tropical forest many species of insects are
often dependent on only one tree species - if that becomes
extinct then so do the dependent species.  For example one tree
species found in Panama has 163 species of beetles that are
dependent on it. CO2 induced extinction of tree species would
affect forests supposedly remote from human impacts.  (E.O.
Wilson, The Diversity of Life, W.W.Norton, N.Y., 1992).<P>

The Asia-Pacific region faces massive problems unless looming
land and water degradation problems can be overcome, according to
Dr Marc Latham, Director-General of the International Board for
Soil Research and Management.  Consequences could include water
shortages in cities, food shortages, floods of refugees,
political destabilisation and even war.  After two dry seasons in
Thailand, there is already concern about water supply.  An
international panel headed by Dr Latham is attempting to draw up
a worldwide research strategy for water, soil and nutrient
management. (The Australian, 18 February 1994).<P>

1993 was the fourth warmest year since 1930.  Increasingly cloudy
nights are partly blamed for the warming. (Telegraph Mirror

A winter storm sweeping through the Los Angeles area caused more
than usual damage to the region still devastated from last year's
wildfires. The fires left soil devoid of vegetation. (Reuter, 7
February 1994). The UK based Daily Telegraph reported  'the joke
is that there are four seasons in Malibu: Flood, Fire, Earthquake
and Mudslides. The town has had all four in the last few months'.

The snowstorm  stranded travellers from Baltimore to Boston, and

Tennessee alone. (Reuter, 12 and 14 February 1994). Steel power
line towers in Mississippi collapsed under the weight of more

of snow fell over the north-central and northeast of the US,
national temperatures averaged only slightly below the average.

Records suggest that floods and droughts have been more frequent 
in Italy over the past 50 years. In the 1950-75 period there
have been 60 floods in Italy; in relative terms this figure
increased  by  50 percent  in the 1976-93 period with 66 events. 
Since 1950 there have been seven severe droughts,  of which four
were concentrated in the 1980s (1983-84; 1986-87; 1988-89;
1989-90). The latest has been the most intense and prolonged in
the last 250 years. Since 1950, eight extremely high summer
temperature events were recorded, four of which were in the last
12 years (1981, 1983, 1988, 1991);  this period has been the
hottest and driest of the last 130 years. July 1983 and January
1985 were respectively the hottest and the coldest month in the
last 50 years. (Il Corriere della Sera, 13 February 1994).<P>

The destruction compounds the effects of the worst  drought on
record.  Scientists from CSIRO believe the plague has probably
resulted from favourable winters, increased survival of juvenile
grasshoppers, dry conditions which reduced the impact of the
parasites and fungi which normally control pests, and a shortage
of feed forcing them to concentrate on trees. The plague has been
particularly bad for the wool industry, already devastated by
drought and a market slump; the grasshoppers are eating the
native vegetation graziers were relying on to see them though the
dry. ("Grasshoppers ravage mulga country", The Weekend
Australian, 5 February 1994).<P>

Cyclone "Geralda", gusting at up to 350 kph, destroyed 95% of the
main commercial port of Toamasina and ruined 70% of the island's
rice fields.  Cutting "a swathe of destruction 800 km wide", it
crippled the only oil refinery, sank at least seven boats and
killed more than 200 people. Rivers burst their banks, causing
widespread flooding and crop damage.  The government declared a
national emergency, and sought emergency aid from the
international community.  (Reuter, 4 and 7 February 1994).<P>

Note: Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988, the strongest
hurricane ever seen, killed 300 and left one million homeless.
Hurricane Hugo of 1989, which caused $5.8 billion on insured
losses and the worst cyclone to hit Charleston in 30 years, was
at that time the most expensive disaster in US history. July 1990
saw Hurricane Hernan, with intensity matching that of Hurricane
Max in 1987, become one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded
in the eastern Pacific. Hernan and Max were outstripped by
Hurricane Trudy two months later. September 1990, was also a bad
year of East Asia, with Typhoon Abe, China's worst in decades,
causing $743 million damage and Typhoon Flo, Japan's worst in
three decades, killing 30. One of the worst disasters in recent
times, the strongest cyclone in 100 years hits Bangladesh and
killed 139,000 in May 1991. In September of that year, Typhoon
Mireille, the strongest to hit Japan in 30 years, caused $2.21
billion damage. Cyclone Val, named 'the storm of the century',
pounded Samoa and caused $300 million damage in December 1991.
Eighteen months before, Cyclone Ofa, the worst in 20 years,
caused $200 million damage. In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew,
devastated Florida and Louisiana and set a new world record of
insured losses - $16.5 billion. In the same month, Guam's
strongest cyclone in 16 years caused $500 million damage. Cyclone
Iniki hit Hawaii in September 1992, causing $1.6 billion in
damage and was the strongest cyclone ever recorded on the island.

In November 1992, Guam was hit again. At its full strength, this
storm (Cyclone Gay) was one of the fiercest cyclones recorded
anywhere this century.  Fiji suffered in January 1993 as Nina,
the most powerful storm in 20 years, caused $135 million damage.
The next month, Cyclone Oliver, the most powerful cyclone to
threaten the Australian east coast this century, luckily failed
to make landfall. Japan was hit by a typhoon of comparable
strength to Mireille of 1991 in September 1993. Yancy, killed 42
people and destroyed hundreds of homes.<P>

Cyclone Sadie dumps more than 600mm of rain in northern
Australian coastal towns, causing an estimated Aus$300,000
damage.  Several northern Queensland towns  received record
rainfalls for a 24- hour period.  Unfortunately there were no
significant rain falls in the worst drought- afflicted region
around Mackay.  Thus far the drought is estimated to have cost
Aus$1 billion in lost production. ("Smiles and curses as rain
falls on the fortunate", The Australian, 2 February 1994). The
drought, which began in 1991, is considered by locals to be the
worst this century. Hundreds of graziers have had to destroy
their cattle, and many are now also fighting severe outbreaks of
botulism, a consequence of hungry cattle  feeding on dead stock
or decaying vegetable matter.  ("Cruel rain in the distance",
Courier Mail [Brisbane], 5 February 1994).<P>

<H3><B>STUDIES SUGGEST THAT WARMER CLIMATE IS UNSTABLE
</B></H3><P>

Research with an Ocean model supports the Greenland ice core
observations (the GRIP ice core reported in July 1993) that the
warmer Eemian period may have been more unstable than the present
climate period, the Holocene.  The Eemian was in the last
interglacial period about 115,000-135,000 years ago when the
climate was about as warm as climate is expected to become next
century (see Greenland ice-core report, July 1993 in The Climate
Time Bomb). The modelling suggests that the North Atlantic may
have three distinct circulation modes<P>

corresponding to different climate states. Increased variability
of the hydrological cycle thought to be associated with the
warmer Eemian climate may have caused transitions between these
modes and in turn may account for the apparent rapid variability
of the Eemian climate. The North Atlantic circulation is known as
the conveyor or thermohaline circulation because it is driven by
saline density and heat difference. Changes to its mode of
operation affect climate throughout North America and Europe, and
are associated with other global scale climate changes. Weaver
and Hughes argue that 'If the variability found in the GRIP ice-
core data is corroborated then the Eemian interglacial may offer
us a glimpse of the type of rapid  climate variability which we
might expect in a future climate warmed by means of anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions'. (A. J. Weaver, A. J. and T. M. C.
Hughes, "Rapid interglacial fluctuations driven by North Atlantic
Ocean circulation", Nature, v. 367, p. 447- 450, 3 February
1994). In the same issue of Nature the eminent oceanographer
Wallace Broecker cautioned that these modelling results should
not be accepted uncritically. Broecker  says this work  suggests
that  the stronger hydrological cycles which might be expected in
association with  the warmer climate of the last interglacial
could have induced instabilities in the Atlantic's circulation.
He says: 'Three stable states are possible in their model
involving a weak, medium and strong circulation, and the model
can move from the strong mode abruptly to the weak mode, which
Weaver and Hughes take to be an analogue of the abrupt climate
flips seen in the GRIP ice cores for the Eemian period'. However
Broecker raises two queries relating to this process: the
integrity of the GRIP ice core records and the sensitivity of the
models to its initial assumptions.  He also expresses concern
that the GRIP ice core is influenced by thrust faulting, which
would confuse the lower portion of the core, especially as the
climate flips seen in the GRIP core are not reflected in the
Atlantic marine sediments record or in the European pollen
records. Nevertheless he agrees that the models do 'suggest that
the stronger hydrological cycle brought about by this extra
warmth carries the seeds of instability...' meriting further
serioous attention. (W. S. Broecker, "An unstable superconveyor",
Nature,  v. 367, p.414-415, 3 February 1994).<P>

<H3><B>NORTH ATLANTIC COOLING KILLS COD </B></H3><P>

Stocks of northern cod have dropped 95 percent in the past four
years, 75 percent during the 1992-93 year when no fishing
occurred. Fisheries researcher George Rose believes that
unusually low sea temperatures may be to blame, by preventing
spawning in areas where there have been cold winters and heavy
ice in recent years. (Toronto Globe and Mail, 31 January
1994).<P>

The cod fishery of west Greenland has been influenced greatly by
sea surface temperatures (SST) over this century. Prior to the
1920's the cod were barely landed, but increased SST in the early
part of this century allowed cod in large numbers to enter the
area and larvae to survive those in increasing stock numbers.
Annual catches then rose until they peaked at 300,000 tonnes
between 1950-68. However, SST began to drop in the late 1960's
and combined with over- exploitation by the fishing industry led
to dramatic reductions in catch numbers and finally to the
collapse of the fishery. (Friis & Rasmussen, "The development of
Greenland's main industry - the fishing industry",  North
Atlantic Regional Studies, paper no.6, p.44; H. Hovgard, "The
Fluctuations in Cod Gadus morhua Fisheries off West Greenland in
the Twentieth Century",  NAFO Science Council Studies, v.18,
p.43-45, 1993; A.P. Baidalinov, "Influence of Long-term Changes
of Sea- Surface Temperature on the State of Some Fish Stocks in

<H3><B>MASSIVE STORM LOSSES IN GERMANY </B></H3><P>

Severe gales which hit western Europe on 27 and 28 January were
particularly bad in Germany. According to the property insurers
federation, Verbrand der Sachversichere, the ultimate loss from
these storms could exceed the record total losses in 1990, when
the industry faced Dm3,600 billion ($2.1 billion). ("German storm
costs set to exceed 1990 figures", Lloyd's List, 10 March 1994).
Six people were killed on the roads, a coastal cargo ship sank in
the North Sea and extensive damage to buildings was reported
across Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria as  winds
gusting to 170 km/hour raged through the region. (Marcus Kabel,
"Six die in West European storms", Reuter,  28 January 1994). The
storms prompted a Belgian TV report to ask whether the seemingly
increasing number of severe storms plaguing the region were a
sign of human-induced climate change. TV Weather reporter, Ron
Cornelissen, said: "while it is still too early to talk about
climate change, seven of the last 10 years have been warmer than
usual and it is likely that climate change will increase the
intensity of storms in the region."  (BRTN Broadcast, 30 January
1994). Concern has been expressed about the impact of the heavy
rains on winter wheat and rape crops.  Much of the country has
received more than 200 percent of the annual average in January, 
with western areas recording 250 percent of the annual average.
(Reuter, 17 January 1993).<P>

Note: These wet conditions end across most of Europe in February
as temperatures soar up to 6 oC above the norm in some regions.

75 million Americans, one in four, were affected by freezing
conditions as an arctic high pressure system sat over the area to
the east of the Rockies. (Reuter, 19 January 1994). All transport
systems were disrupted, including freight shipments. Schools and
many businesses closed. Federal government workers in Washington
were sent home early to conserve electricity. While demand for
power soared, power reductions were imposed in several eastern
states as fuel barges became immobilised and coal piles froze. At
least 87 deaths were blamed on the six-day cold snap, primarily
from ice-induced car accidents or snow shovelling-related heart
attacks. ("Cold snap kills 87 - power rationed in east", San
Francisco Chronicle, 20 January 1994; Don Terry, "Bitter cold
disrupts power, travel and life in general", The New York Times,
20 January 1994). Meanwhile temperatures averaged as much as 6ÉC
above the average in the Northwest. (Climate Analysis Centre,
"Major Climatic Events and Anomalies as of January 29, 1994",
Climate System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, Is.1-94, UNEP/WMO,
January 1994).<P>

Note: The previous winter in the US Northwest was also severe.
The region recorded its fourth coldest on record and snowcover in
Spokane lasted a record 113 days. While these temperatures pulled
down the national average, the rest of the US recorded generally
warm temperatures and the winter of 1991-92 was the hottest on
record. Winter temperatures across the US have in  fact been
rising since the late 1970's. This trend is the largest warming
to appear in the 100 year record but must be remembered that it
follows a very cold early 1970's. Four of the ten hottest winters
on the US record occurred in the 1980's and early 1990's -
1991-92 (1st), 1982-83 (5th), 1980-81 (8th) and 1986-87 (10th).

While scorching drought conditions prevailed in the North Island,
with water restrictions in place and temperatures over 4O oC in
some regions, severe floods in the south of the country swept
80,000 cubic metres of gravel into one of New Zealand's biggest
hydro-electric power stations, shutting it down for over three
weeks.  The flood sent water flowing through the Ohau River at
500 cubic metres per second, about 40 times faster than normal. 
National power supply was not affected however, as the floods
filled other hydro-lakes to overflowing. (New Zealand Herald, 11
January 1994, 31 January 1994).<P>

Note: According to Dr Jim Salinger (then) from the NZ Bureau of
Meteorology, New Zealand has warmed by 0.5 oC since 1950. 1971
was the warmest year on record, while 1985, 1988, 1989 and 1990
were well above average. This warming has caused a massive
retreat in all New Zealand's glaciers and little snow for the
lower altitude ski resorts. The Franz Josef glacier has retreated
by more than one kilometre. Rainfall patterns have also changed;
much of the North Island has become wetter while western South
Island has become drier. In September 1991, the worst snowstorms
since 1939 caused damage to the tune of NZ$100 million (US$53.7
million).(See The Climate Time Bomb and references therein.)<P>

<H3><B>FLOOD WARNINGS FOR 155 UK RIVERS </B></H3><P>

The January deluge came on top of the wettest December since
1979, with downpours persisting over five weeks throughout much
of northwest Europe. Damage bills are expected to exceed US$1
billion. ("Floods bring death and more warnings", The Times, 6
January 1994; "And weathermen say there's more to come",
Independent, 7 January 1994; "Flooding chaos is set to continue",
Sunday Times, 9 January 1994). However, authorities do not expect
the deluge to reduce the effects of the growing drought, as the
flood water has not reached underground reservoirs. ("Droughts
forecast in wake of floods", The Observer, 9 January 1994).<P>

Note: In 1990 Britain experienced perhaps its worst drought this
century; parts of the M1 motorway melted, rail-lines buckled and
heat-related health problems such as heart attacks, strokes and
smog-induced asthma increased dramatically.  As river levels
dropped in the southwest, farmers had water supplies cut off.  By
1992, parts of the UK were in their fifth year of drought,
despite wetter than normal weather in the west. Several areas
report infestations of non-native insects, encouraged by the
succession of hot and humid summers.(See The Climate Time Bomb
and references therein). <P>

Note: Many people do not yet understand that global warming will
result in changes in precipitation, including possible more
frequent and intense storms in some areas,  as well as warming
temperatures. A prominent British tabloid read by four million
people, responded to the flood with the headline: "Soggy Britain
got another soaking yesterday as fed-up families demanded "What
happened to all those theories about the greenhouse effect?" The 
editorial read "Trust the experts to get it wrong. Not long ago
they warned us about global warming. Britain would be drier than
the Sahara. What happened? It has rained like the clappers ever
since." ("Whatever happened to the greenhouse effect?", The Sun,
5 January 1994).<P>

While National Weather Service forecasters report that severe

September-October), they are unusual after October.  They have
blamed the unseasonal weather on an out of place jet stream,
apparently being kept north by above normal warming of the ocean
last summer. Its more usual winter position south of the gulf
generally keeps the storms out. (Anchorage Daily News, 5 January

<H3><B>LATEST IMPACTS MODELLING: THIRD WORLD THREATENED WITH
FAMINE </B></H3> <P>

Confirming the earlier IPCC assessment of the effect of projected
climate change on agriculture, research by Cynthia Rosenzweig and
Martin Parry indicates that 60-350 million more people could be
at risk of hunger as a consequence of climate change. These
people, who will be predominantly in developing countries, are
also likely to experience major increases in food prices. The
study by Rosenzweig and Parry estimates that, under very
optimistic assumptions, "the doubling of the atmospheric CO2
concentration will lead to only a small decrease in global crop
production, but developing countries are likely to bear the brunt
of the problem".  These assumptions include irrigation water
being available in unlimited supply. Crops respond to increased
CO2 by increasing yield in spite of other climate induced
stresses, which has not yet been demonstrated outside the
laboratory, technological crop yield improvements are realized in
practice, the additional arable land assumed to be available by
FAO is in practice available, and finally that the levels of
adaptation by farmers can be achieved in practice. "These
optimistic assumptions" for irrigation "imply that water ...would
be fully available at all locations under climate change
conditions", although it is acknowledged that "supplies may be
limited under climate change conditions not only for expanding
irrigation but for maintaining the current extent ... in some
areas".  Overall they conclude that there would be a "slight to
moderate negative effect on simulated world cereal production,
even when the beneficial direct effects of CO2, farm level
adaptation and future technological yield improvements were taken
into account."  However Rosenzweig and Parry point to the major
inequality of risk between developing and developed countries
concluding that "while some countries in the temperate zones may
reap some benefit from climate change, many countries in the
tropical and subtropical zones appear more vulnerable to the
potential impacts of global warming".  "When climate change is
considered without direct CO2 effects on crop growth and water
use, average national crop yields decline everywhere, although
reductions were less at middle and high latitudes."  Even with
direct CO2 effects the UK scenario reduced crop yield nearly
everywhere (up to 50 percent in Pakistan). In developing
countries at low latitudes, agriculture under the warming
scenarios suffered accelerated growing periods for crops, and
"greater heat and water stress, resulting in greater yield
decreases than at higher latitudes, despite beneficial direct CO2
effects". The study's conclusions are heavily dependent on
whether or not the carbon dioxide fertilization effect works in
practice. Without CO2 fertilization effects, global crop
production drops by 11-20 percent, whereas if it is included,
global production drops by only 1-8 percent.  Production of food
actually increases in developed countries for most scenarios, but
for developing countries all models show a 9-12 percent
production drop, even when the CO2 fertilization is factored into
the calculations. Price increases induced by the effects of
climate change would be largest in developing countries. With CO2
fertilization factored in cereal prices, increases range from
24-145 percent, being largest in developing countries. The
results indicate for most scenarios, and even with very high
levels of adaptation, the estimated negative effects of climate
change in terms of the number of people at risk of hunger, could
not be mitigated entirely. (C. Rosenzweig and M. Parry,
"Potential impact of climate change on world food supply",
Nature, v.367, p.133-138, 13 January 1994).<P>

Note: In correspondence to Nature, scientists from Australia's
CSIRO Climate Impact Group suggest that climate change may have
even greater impact on global food security. The climate factors
considered by Rosenzweig and Parry do not include changes and/or
the intensification of ENSO, tropical cyclones, floods, drought,
pests or diseases, all of which could have major impacts. (A.B.
Pittock, P. Whetton & Y. Wang, "Climate and food supply", Nature,
v.371, p.25, 1 September 1994).<P>

Further, assumptions about water security may be grossly
inaccurate.  Normam Myers, in reviewing a major study published
in 1993, (Peter H. Gleick, ed, Water in crisis: a guide to
World's Fresh Water, Oxford Science Publications) notes that
already around one person in three is affected by chronic water
shortages and within 20 years two-thirds of Africans can be
expected to be acutely short of water.  Water resources around
the world are already over-extended, leading to major ecological
problems, such as in the Aral sea, and to the draw down of ground
water resources.<P>

A meeting of European experts organised by the European School of
Climatology and Natural Resources suggests the Mediterranean will
suffer more fires and less regular rain but more torrential rain
and thus more erosion and desertification in a global warming
world.  More than 50 percent of Spain is already affected by
desertification, causing $200 million (30,000 million pesetas)
economic damages each year. (El Mundo, 13 October, 1993; La
Vanguardia, 7 January 1994).<P>

The very survival of 200-250 million people is directly
threatened by desertification according to researchers from the
University of East Anglia, UK. Expanding populations and
inappropriate agricultural management compounded by climate
events such as returning drought have made many dry lands
unstable and prone to desertification. "The recent 25-year period
of desiccation in the Sahel represents the most substantial and
sustained change in rainfall for any region of the world within
the period of instrumental measurements... Recent model
simulations of the effects of global warming indicate increased
rainfall in most areas. But, over the Mediterranean, northern
Africa and large part of the Sahel, annual rainfall decreases.
...If this is an accurate reflection of impact, the role of
greenhouse gas emissions in reduced rainfall in the Sahel could
become a major factor in the future". (WMO, World Climate News,
no.4. January 1994).<P>

<H3><B>WARM TEMPERATURES IMPLICATED IN MALARIA INCIDENCE
</B></H3><P>

An increase in the occurrence of malarial parasite Plasmodium
falciparum cases in Pakistan's North West Frontier province is
thought to be linked to an increase in annual mean temperature of
0.5 oC since 1978. Cases of P. falciparum swelled from a few
hundred in the early 1980's to 25,000 in 1990. The geographical
extent of the malarial parasite is thought to be temperature-
limited while the incidence of malaria is controlled by the
length of the warm season.  As air temperatures rise, health
experts project considerable mortality in previously unexposed
populations. (M.J. Bouma, H.E. Sondorp & H.J. van der Kaay,
correspondence, The Lancet, v.342, p.302, 29 January 1994).<P>

Note: The World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests that each
year, over two billion people are exposed to malaria, of  which
300-500 million become ill, and over a million die.  (WHO, A
global strategy for malaria control, World Health Organisation,
Geneva, 1993).  Ominously, a potential increase in vector- borne
diseases, such as malaria, is one of the most confidently
predicted results of climate change. Vector-borne disease
occurrence is largely determined by the prevalence of vectors,
such as mosquitos; intermediate and reservoir hosts; the
abundance of suitable disease causing parasites and pathogens;
and the immunity and behaviour of the human population. Changes
in climate can affect all of these factors and thus could alter
the prevalence of vector-borne disease at any given location. In
1990, a WHO task group on climate change suggested that because
of climate change, malaria, Chagas' disease, schistosomiasis,
lymphatic filariasis, river blindness, dengue fever, yellow fever
and Japanese encephalitis may all increase in incidence or be
introduced to many regions.  (WHO Task Group, Potential health
effects of climate change, World Health Organisation, Geneva,
1990).<P>

<H3><B>DOES CLIMATE CHANGE LEAVE "FINGERPRINTS"? </B></H3><P>

One of the great difficulties in defining the nature and
magnitude of human-caused climate change is in detecting the
"signal" that is evidence of such change against the "background
noise" or naturally occurring fluctuations in climate. This is
because both types of change may currently be happening at
approximately equivalent rates, in terms of our ability to
measure them. To solve this problem, climate researchers have
been seeking to locate a "fingerprint", a reliable indicator of
anthropogenic change. For instance, a century-long global warming
trend, such as we are presently experiencing, appears to be a
rare event over the past several thousand years, and may be such
a "fingerprint". Some researchers have suggested that this trend
is 80-89 percent likely not to be entirely natural.<P>

Single variables, such as mean air temperatures, have been used
as indices of climate change, but many researchers now argue that
more complex Global Circulation Models (GCM's), which incorporate
many other climatic variables, could be used as "fingerprints".
Stephen Schneider of Stanford University believes that these
GCM's are useful but limited in their value, and that what is
needed are "coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-biota-ice-
chemical models that include adequate resolutions of 3D
cloudiness distributions". Unfortunately, many of the variables
necessary to validate such models are still several years of
research away.<P>

Schneider warns against an insistance on waiting for a high
statistical certainty of anthropogenic climatic change, as the
"signal" might not be detectable against the "background noise"
until it is too late. In Schneider's words, how to act in the
face of global change possibilities "is not a question directly
answerable with technical analysis", it is "a value judgement
about risk management". (Stephen H. Schneider, "Detecting
climatic change signals: are there any fingerprints?", Science,
v.263, p.341-347, 21 January 1994).<P>

<H3><B>CLIMATE CHANGE LINK TO ARCTIC OZONE DEPLETION </B></H3><P>

Recent research suggests that the "sudden warmings" in  the
Arctic stratosphere associated with atmospheric circulation
changes between early December and mid-March, may have a
significant impact on the timing and magnitude of CO2-enhanced
ozone depletion.<P>

Earlier research by UK scientists had suggested that doubled CO2
concentrations may result in an Antarctic-like ozone hole over
the Arctic (see The Climate Time Bomb, p.87-88). The expected
warming in the troposphere could have the effect of further
cooling the stratosphere, already cooling in response to the loss
of stratospheric ozone.  Decreasing stratospheric ozone is
thought to mean less absorption of solar radiation in the
stratosphere, and thus less heating of the stratosphere. In the
models, the Arctic ozone hole appeared as the result of increased
CO2 concentrations and human-induced ozone loss interacting to
cool the stratosphere, thereby increasing the formation of polar
stratospheric clouds (PSC's), which rely on very cold
temperatures to form and create more surfaces for chemical
reactions to release the ozone-destroying chlorine from compounds
such as CFC's and HCFC's.<P>

In follow-up work, the researchers suggest that the "sudden
warmings" of the Arctic stratosphere that can occur at any time
from early December to mid-March as a result of atmospheric
circulation changes, could have a significant impact on the
timing and magnitude of CO2-enhanced ozone depletion. The
researchers found that enhanced stratospheric cooling delayed the
onset of late-winter warming events and thus promoted the
formation of an Arctic hole. However, enhanced cooling is
insufficient to permit a "hole" when warming events occur in
early or mid-winter.  This suggests that an Antarctic-like ozone
hole will only form in those winters when stratospheric warming
occurs late.  Drawing from these results in conjunction with
observational data, Austin and Butchart suggest that an ozone
hole can be expected in 10 percent of future winters. They also
note that other factors not included in their model could be
expected to also influence Arctic ozone depletion, such as
increased concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide and bromine.
Other complicating factors include changes in lower atmospheric
circulation and increased concentrations of water vapour and
sulphur aerosols.<P>

"It seems likely that a combination of high chlorine, bromine,
and significantly high CO2 will occur sometime in the next 50 to
100 years and give rise to a significant risk of an Arctic ozone
hole..." (J. Austin and N. Butchart). (J. Austin & N Butchart,
"The influence of climate change and the timing of stratospheric
warmings on Arctic ozone depletion",Journal of Geophysical
Research, v.99(1), p.1127-1145, 20 January 1994).<P>

<H3><B>CLOUDS "KEY" TO GLOBAL WARMING </B></H3><P>

George Tselioudis and colleagues at NASA have proposed an
explanation for the discrepancy between climate model projections
of higher greenhouse warming in polar regions and the observed
pattern of warming over the past century. The key, according to
Tselioudis, is the type of cloud resulting from rising
temperatures. Current models assume that the net effect of rising
temperatures would be an increase in cloud cover and a
corresponding uniform increase in the reflectivity of that cloud
cover, thus creating a negative feedback effect. Tselioudis'
research suggests, however, that higher temperatures may result
in different types of clouds and generally in a reduction of
cloud reflectivity depending on latitude, season and location. 
When run through a simple climate model, a stronger positive
feedback is recorded in lower latitudes.  This might be expected
to balance other effects expected to increase temperatures more
in high latitudes. Tselioudis suggests that while his study is
not conclusive, it may explain discrepancies between observed and
predicted warming. ("Clouds hold key to global warming theory",
New Scientist, p.16, 22 January 1994; G. Tselioudis, et.al.,
"Potential effects of cloud optical thickness on climate
warming", Nature, v.366, p.670-672, 16 December 1993).<P>

Note: Changes in cloudiness can have a significant influence on
other climatic changes, especially temperature. Clouds both warm
(by absorbing outgoing radiation) and cool the earth's surface
(by the absorption of incoming longwave radiation and scattering
of outgoing shortwave solar radiation); thus any changes in cloud
cover could act to further warm or cool the planet. The current
global net effect of clouds is to cool the surface. The impact of
any future changes is currently highly uncertain and will depend
not only on changes in total cloud cover but also on changes in
cloud type and distribution. Data from North America, Europe,
India and Australia suggests that continental cloudiness has
increased this century. Studies of North American cloudiness
support these findings and one suggests that both cloud cover and
sunshine hours have increased over this century, indicating a
possible increase in the amount of thin cirrus cloud which is
known to warm the surface. (A. Henderson-Sellers, "Continental
Cloudiness Changes this Century",  Geo Journal, v.27(3),
p.255-262, July 1992).<P>

"It is now possible to paddle across one of the world's great
rivers", reported one British newspaper which featured stunning
"before and after" photographs. ("Victoria Falls silent in
drought", The Mirror [UK], 4 January 1994).  The severe drought
has extended into Tanzania, where little or no rain has fallen in
northern areas during the current growing season. Coffee crops
are expected to be down 17 percent on the usual 59,000 tonnes as
a consequence of the drought coupled with a lack of pesticides
and fertilizers. ("Tanzania expects coffee crop slashed by 17
percent", Reuter, 6 January 1994).<P>

Note: Significant changes in Africa's rainfall have been noted
over the last century, especially in the last two decades. While
central eastern South Africa was very dry during the 1980's,
eastern Africa, including Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, and
northern Southern Africa, including parts of Botswana, South
Africa and Mozambique, experienced abnormally high rainfall. 
Drought dominated the semi-arid Sahel region of West Africa since
the late 1960's. (S.E. Nicholson, "Century-scale series of
standardised annual departures of African rainfall",  p.952-962,

<H3><B>WATER SUPPLY PROBLEMS BUILD IN THAILAND </B></H3><P>

Declining rainfall and shrinking rainforest in catchment areas in
Thailand resulted in severe water shortages in urban and dry
season agriculture areas. Forest areas have been reduced by 50
percent over the past 30 years, which has probably reduced
significantly the ability of forest areas to hold and release
water during the dry season. (Far Eastern Economic Review, 27
January 1994).<P>

Note: Globally, fresh water resources are being placed under ever
increasing pressure from population growth and increased demand
from agriculture and industry. One estimate suggests that the use
of fresh water has increased by a factor of 35 in the last three
decades. Further, the contamination of water supplies by toxic
pollution, radioactive materials and suspended particles pose
additional threats to water security. (GEMS Monitoring and
Assessment Research Centre, World Resources Institute & UK

Programme, Environment Data Report 1993-94, Blackwell Reference,

As Australia's El Nino-induced drought shows no sign of abating,
the new year began with more than 200 fires raging across New
South Wales. Prolonged hot and windy weather forced walls of
flame up to 40 metres high through Sydney suburbs.  Some 7,500
firefighters, backed by military units, were drawn into the
battles against the fires,  20,000 people were evacuated, and
more than 600,000 hectares of land were burnt out. Through hard
work and luck only 200 homes were lost; the estimated insurance
losses of $Aus150 million could have been far worse. (Reuter,
3,4,9 January 1994; "A$100m fire claims feared", Financial Times,

Queensland  suffered the worst heatwave in several years, the
northern city of Townsville recorded its hottest day on record,
and temperatures across the northeast averaged up to 6 oC above
normal. Several heat-related deaths were reported across the
state. ("Fears for elderly in heatwave", The Australian, 10
January 1994). Queensland farmers also suffered. Grain crop
output dropped 40 percent with sorghum being the hardest hit.
Maize, sunflower, cotton and livestock were also hard hit.  The
destructive heat came after three years of continuous drought.
("Heatwave threatens grain crops", Courier Mail [Brisbane], 8
January 1994).   Drought relief is also expected to "blow out" to
AUS$32.5 million in 1993-94, as compared to AUS$9.7 million in
1992-93. ("Big dry worse: De Lacy", Courier Mail, 14 January

<H3><B>FORECASTERS BEWILDERED AS EL NINO ENTERS ITS THIRD YEAR
</B></H3><P>

In 1985, Stephen Cane and Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University
predicted the 1986-87 El Nino one year in advance, using wind and
ocean measurements in the Pacific, but in the case of the present
El Nino, which began in 1991, "We're still learning", says Cane.
El Nino events usually only last one year (they occur every three
to seven years). This one, which weather experts are crediting
with torrential rainfall in Japan, the Mississippi basin, Peru
and England, plus droughts in southern Africa, Indonesia,
Australia, and Brazil, keeps reviving when it seems to be spent.
Its longevity is "unusual but not unprecedented", says Cane.
Similar three-year El Ninos took place in 1911-14 and 1939-42.
("Fire and flood greet El Nino's third year", New Scientist,
p.15, 15 January 1994).<P>

Note: The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climatic
phenomenon which influences the entire global climate system. The
term refers to two closely linked states, the classic ENSO,
commonly known as El Nino, associated with warm events, and the
opposite extreme, anti-ENSO, commonly called La Nina, associated
with cold events. ENSO events usually occur every two to ten
years and generally last up to 18 months. They are characterised
by a weakening or reversal of the easterly trade winds, a warming
of the waters of the eastern Pacific and the switching of the
see-sawing atmospheric pressure between the eastern and western
Pacific (called the Southern Oscillation). The return of the El
Nino so soon in May 1993 confounded scientists at the time. An El
Nino event usually lasts about 18 months,  but the episode which
began in 1990 while weakening as expected in mid-1992 began
increasing again in November 1992.   After waning in mid-1993, by
october 1993 it was strengthening again, before weakening in late
1993. Some researchers warn that El Nino events could become more
intense with global warming as the oceans warm.<P>

TEMPERATURES AND WILDFIRES<P>

Deciduous tree species, such as birch, Betula papyrifera, and
poplar, Populus balsamifera, are colonising burnt out areas which
previously supported coniferous species. They are also moving
into previously treeless tundra areas.  Canadian biologists,
Simon Landhausser and Ross Wein, suggest that "the deciduous
trees have extended their range as the growing season has become
slightly warmer and drier over recent years", and predict that
"global warming will allow deciduous trees ...to become more
abundant and to invade the tundra a little further after each
fire." (John Timson, "Leafy hordes invade the Arctic", New
Scientist, p.14, 29 January 1994).<P>

<H3><B>TUNDRA SOILS NOW A NET CARBON SOURCE </B></H3><P>

Walter C. Oechel of San Diego State University reports that
Arctic tundra soils in Alaska are now releasing CO2.   Studies in
the 1970's showed that these soils absorbed more carbon dioxide
than they produced. Now the balance seems to have shifted, and
the tundra is releasing CO2.  A Russian team has reported
wintertime CO2 emissions from Siberian tundra. Oechel believes
that as much as 190 million tonnes of CO2 may be released
annually if this shift is occurring right across the Arctic,
equivalent to 5 percent of current fossil fuel emissions. ("Soils
and global carbon cycle: have the microbes turned against us?",
No Sweat News, no.7, 17 February 1994). <P>

greenhouse warming."  Walter C. Oechel.<P>

Scientists report a recent dramatic warming of permafrost from
the Yukon River, south to the Gulf of Alaska.  In many areas
thawing has already begun and in others it is close to thawing
point.  Permafrost lies under 85 percent of Alaska, and under one
quarter of the earth's surface. In addition to releasing the
major greenhouse gas methane, the melting permafrost is causing
the ground to slump, damaging houses and roads. (Geophysical
Institute Quarterly, University of Alaska Fairbanks,

New research suggests that the retreat of snow cover over the
last 20 years has enhanced greenhouse warming over land areas in
the Northern Hemisphere. Russian scientist Pavel Groisman says
that warming temperatures initiated snow melt which in turn led
to further warming by reducing the heat-reflecting ability of the
land.  (P. Groisman, T. Karl, R. Knight, "Observed impact of snow
cover on the heat balance and the rise of continental spring
temperatures", Science, v.263, p.198-200, 14 January 1994).<P>

<H3><B>ANTARCTIC PENGUINS DISRUPTED BY SHRINKING SEA ICE
</B></H3><P>

American researchers have blamed the contracting winter sea ice
around the Antarctic Peninsula, observed since 1970, for a
decline in Adelie penguin populations. Rising sea and air
temperatures have also been reported during this time in this
region. According to William Fraser from Montana State
University,  studies of penguins on Torgerson Island show
declines in Adelie numbers and the establishment of a colony of
Chinstraps (decreasing Adelie numbers usually mean increased
Chinstrap penguin numbers because Chinstraps feed in the ice-free
seas). He believes that the presence of Chinstraps this far south
is a further indication of the warming trend. During the last
four years of unprecedented warm winters however, both
populations have plummeted. Since 1989, Chinstrap and Adelie
numbers have fallen by 35 percent and 40 percent respectively on
King George Island.  Wayne Trivelpiece, also from Montana,
relates these declines to declines in Antarctic krill, the
primary food source of the birds.  Researchers suspect that less
sea ice means less algae, the primary food source for larval
krill in winter. Trivelpiece has found "gaps" in the size range
of krill pumped from the stomachs of penguins, suggesting that
the krill may not be surviving or developing during the warm
winters.  It is not yet clear if the decline in krill extends
across the whole of the region. ("Penguins in Peril", The
Chronicle of Higher Education, v.40, 5 January 1994; see also
W.R. Fraser, W.Z. Trivelpiece, D.G. Ainley & S.G. Trivelpiece,
"Increases in Antarctic penguin populations: reduced competition
with whales or a loss of sea ice due to environmental warming?",
Polar Biology, v.11, p.525-531, 1992). <P>

"We think it's a harbinger of what's coming. The number of
winters in which there is extensive ice is declining." Wayne
Trivelpiece, Associate Professor Montana State University. <P>

Sea ice plays an important role in the Antarctic ecosystem,
particularly as habitat for sea ice algae, the primary food
supply for larval krill over winter. Researchers are concerned
that the warmer winters and resultant reduction in sea ice will
increase larval mortality and lessen larval development. The loss
of sea ice algae, which contributes an estimated 20 percent to
primary production in Antarctic waters, could result in severe
loss of production and krill.  Dependant species would be most
affected. Loss of ice would also expose organisms to greater
amounts of UV-B, and impact on ocean circulation and the
upwelling of nutrients from the deep ocean in the region.  The
increased temperatures may also have a significant impact on
krill.  In the Scotia Sea, just north of reported penguin
declines, Krill Euphausia superba are already at their thermal
limit (5ÉC) and any increase in temperatures may "squeeze" E.
Superba and other species such as E.crystallorophias populations
between their thermal limits and the continent. More insidious
impacts may result from reductions in nutrient upwellings due to
changes in circumpolar trade winds and ocean circulation. (J.R.

<H3><B>SATELLITE DETECTS WARMING TREND IN LOWER ATMOSPHERE.
</B></H3><P>

In a brief scientific communication to the journal Nature,
Christy and McNider report that satellite observations of
temperature trends in the lower atmosphere indicate a warming
rate of about 0.1 oC per decade since January 1979.  The
researchers used the Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) on the NOAA
Tiros-N Satellites to observe the lower atmosphere. After
removing the temperature effects of the El Nino phenomenon and
the El Chichon and Mt Pinatubo volcanic eruptions, they found a
trend of 0.09ÉC/decade upward in the lower 7km of the
troposphere. They note that this is in contrast to model
predictions of 0.3-0.4ÉC/decade but point out that the length of
the record is "relatively short for determining climate trends". 
(J. R. Christy and R. T. McNider, "Satellite greenhouse signal",
Nature, v.367, p.325, 27 January 1994). <P>

Note: Whilst Christy and McNider argue that the MSU observations
provide "perhaps the best opportunity for finding the greenhouse
signal in a single variable", the IPCC has noted a number of
limitations on the satellite observations. Notably these include
the fact that the observations are weighted over a substantial
thickness of the troposphere (and therefore do not measure
surface temperature) and are influenced by the stratosphere and
the nature of the surface.  As reported by the IPCC in their 1992
report, the satellite data corresponds quite closely with
radiosonde observations of the middle and upper troposphere but
not so well with the surface observations. Factors other than
greenhouse gases may also modify the observed trend.  However
only two are mentioned. That of solar variations and aerosols. In
addition there is the effect of ozone depletion which, on a
globally averaged basis, reduces or annuls the warming effects of
CFC's. In 1990 the IPCC calculated that the combined heating
effect of increases in greenhouse gases over the decade 1980-1990
was about 0.55 watts per square metre.  More recently, in 1992,
Ramaswamy, Scwarzkopf and Shine ("Radiative forcing of climate
from halocarbon induced Global stratospheric ozone loss", Nature,
v.355, p.810-812, 27 February 1992) calculated that this was
around 0.45 watts per square metre for the period 1979-1990.
Ozone depletion offsets this by about 0.08 watts per square
metre. In relation to aerosols, the IPCC 1992 Supplement reported
that the potential effects of sulphur aerosols was such as to
potentially offset the effects of the increase of carbon dioxide
since pre-industrial times.  Recently Kiehl and Briegleb (1993)
calculated that the July average forcing of increases in carbon
dioxide, methane, CFC-11 and CFC-12 from pre-industrial to
present (2.1 watts per square metre) is reduced by 0.3 watts per
square metre. Observations indicate the that aerosol
concentrations are increasing in the northern hemisphere at
least.  Aerosol increases over the 1980's may thus further offset
the effects of greenhouse gas increases over this period, perhaps
in the order of 0.05 watts per square metre. Overall the effects
of ozone depletion and aerosols reduce the effective warming
effect to the range of 0.3-0.4 watts per square metre. Taking
into account the lag effect reported by the IPCC in 1990 between
the addition of greenhouse gases and its temperature (where only
about 60% of the warming would be felt fairly quickly) and the
range of climate sensitivities assessed by the IPCC, the expected
warming rate over the 1980's would be in the range
0.07-0.20ÉC/decade at the surface. Thus the satellite
observations of Christy and McNider are within the range expected
from increased greenhouse gas levels for this period, ignoring
the effects of climate variability and the weaker association
between the satellite observations of the middle atmosphere and
that of surface temperature.<P>

<H3><B>WORLD WEATHER IN LATE JULY IS REPORTED TO BE "IN A STATE
OF CHAOS." </B></H3> <P>

Severe floods are affecting America, India, China, and Taipei.
The central desert of Saudi Arabia has been drenched;  an
unseasonal downpour in Riyadh dumped an inch of rain  less than
12 hours, an all-time record and more than usually falls in two
months. Storms dumped fist-sized hailstones on the Rhone Valley,
creating flash floods and sweeping three people to their
deaths.<P>

Normally, at this time of the year, anticyclonic systems move
north and stop the Atlantic depressions from moving across to
Europe. This year, the anticyclone has settled over the Alps, 200
miles to the south, creating a dry Mediterranean and a very wet
Europe. <P>

Northern Africa is breaking all the records. El Obeid in the
Sudan, an area afflicted by terrible drought in 1984-85, recently
received more than double the monthly rainfall in a single day. 
The Libyan desert has also recently recorded a single day's
rainfall of more than 100 times its usually monthly rainfall.<P>

The rain is not restricted to the north.  In the southern
Australia state of New South Wales, around double the average
february rainfall of 1.5 inches was recently recorded in two
days.  And in Taipei and southern China, torrential downpours
killed 78 people, damaged thousands of houses and crops and added
to the devastation left by recent floods.  Over the past five
weeks, 3,000 people have been killed in Bangladesh, northern
India and Nepal by flooding associated with particularly heavy
monsoonal rains.<P>

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>IPCC's 1992 SCENARIOS SHOW SLIGHTLY LESS GLOBAL WARMING.
</B></H3><P>

The revised scenarios lead to slightly lower temperature
increases and sea-level rise than the IPCC estimated in its 1990
report. The University of East Anglia runs models with new IPCC
1992 emissions scenarios, finding changes in temperature and sea
level "less severe than those estimated previously but still far
beyond the limits of natural variability." <P>

The "dampening" effects on warming of stratospheric ozone
depletion, sulphate aerosols, and also carbon fertilization, were
incorporated in the calculations, which were done for all 6 new
scenarios. (N.B. These scenarios, as the University of East
Anglia scientists observe,  all involve essentially a
continuation of business-as-usual emissions). <P>

The best-guess figures for scenario IS92a (the one closest to the
1990 "Business-as-usual" IPCC scenario) are a 2.5 oC temperature
increase by 2100 (five times the warming of the last century),
and a 48 cm sea-level rise by 2100 (four times the sea-level rise
of the last century). These estimates are about 20 to 30 percent
lower than the equivalent IPCC 1990 estimates, but as the UEA
scientists observe, "such changes are certain to present a
considerable challenge for humankind." <P>

(T.M. Wigley and S.C.B. Raper, Nature , v. 357, p. 293-300, 28
May 1992).<P>

NOTES: These new calculations clearly do not revise estimates
sufficiently to merit any relaxation of concern by governments.
The rates of change are still without precedent in human history,
still exceed the rates to which the geological record suggests
ecosystems can adapt, still risk catastrophic destabilization of
climate, and still lock low-lying nations into the prospect of
physical and cultural extinction within as little as a century or
less. Furthermore, such is the shaky nature of many of the
assumptions in the models, that there is still - as the IPCC
concludes in both 1990 and 1992 reports - "the scope for
surprises."<P>

Local forecasters are at a loss to explain the open water
extending up to five miles beyond the one mile shorefast ice off
the coast of Barrow. They suggest recent warm temperatures -
particularly in 1993 when most months except August experienced 
above normal temperatures,  on average 2 - 3 degrees (F) above
average - may be important. Higher than normal snow falls during
the winter insulating the ice from deep freezing and persistent
strong easterly winds pushing the ice seaward have also been
cited as possible influencing factors. <P>

<H3><B>WORST DROUGHT IN EUROPE FOR 100 YEARS. </B></H3><P>

People in the south and east of England prepare for the worst
drought since records began in the mid-eighteenth century. Much
of Europe is affected by the drought.  Many reservoirs are below
30 percent capacity. Water restrictions are in place, and a
year's rainfall is required in some areas to replace groundwater
supplies. <P>

The drought is affecting not only crop production, but oyster
production in Brittany has been threatened by the lack of fresh
water in estuaries. Some hydroelectric plants have been ordered
to cease production. Italian reservoirs are now so depleted as to
hold insufficient water if the drought continues.  <P>

<H3><B>RECORD RAINFALL IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA.
</B></H3><P>

It is very difficult to find sustainable evidence that something
is getting more severe or erratic, but we believe the greenhouse
effect would cause these changes."  Dr Tim Gibson Meteorologist,
University of Melbourne<P>

Melbourne is drenched by nine consecutive wet days, the most
since records began 130 years before. This after Melbourne had
received double the normal rainfall in December and Sydney
experienced its wettest December since 1970. Flooding along the
east coast has caused millions of dollars worth of damage. Dr Tim
Gibson, a senior lecturer in the Department of Meteorology at the
University of Melbourne says that the erratic weather are the
first signs that the greenhouse effect is making itself felt: "We
have a high pressure system that is a lot further south than
normal and a persistent low in the Tasman (Sea) that is leading
to Victoria's unusual weather." <P>

<H3><B> SATELLITE DETECTS WARMING TREND IN LOWER ATMOSPHERE.
</B></H3><P>

In a brief scientific communication to the journal Nature Christy
and McNider report that satellite observations of temperature
trends in the lower atmosphere indicate a  warming rate of about
0.1 oC per decade since January 1979. The researchers used the
Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) on the NOAA Tiros-N Satellites to
observe the lower atmosphere. After removing the temperature
effects of the El Nino phenomenon and the El Chichon and Mt
Pinatubo volcanic eruptions, they found a trend of 0.09ÉC/decade
upward in the lower 7km of the troposphere. They note that this
is in contrast to model predictions of 0.3-0.4ÉC/decade but point
out that the length of the record is "relatively short for
determining climate trends."  <P>

(J. R. Christy and R. T. McNider, "Satellite greenhouse signal,"
Nature, v. 367, p. 325).<P>

NOTES: Whilst Christy and McNider argue that the MSU observations
provide "perhaps the best opportunity for finding the  greenhouse
signal in a single variable" the IPCC has noted a number of
limitations on the satellite observations. Notably these include
the observations are weighted over a  substantial thickness of
the troposphere (and therefore do  not measure surface
temperature) and are influenced by the  stratosphere and the
nature of the surface.<P>

As reported by the IPCC in their 1992 report, the satellite data
correspond quite closely with  radiosonde observations of the
middle and upper troposphere but not so well with the surface
observations. Factors other than greenhouse gases may also modify
the observed trend, however only two are mentioned, that of solar
variations and aerosols. In addition there is the effect of ozone
depletion which, on a globally averaged basis, reduces or annuls
the warming effects of CFCs. <P>

In 1990 the IPCC calculated that the combined heating effect  of
increases in greenhouse gases over the decade 1980-1990 was about
0.55 Watts per square metre.  More recently, in  1992, Ramaswamy,
Scwarzkopf and Shine ("Radiative forcing of climate from
halocarbon induced global stratospheric ozone  loss," Nature,v. 
355, p. 810-812) calculate that this was around 0.45 Watts per
square metre for the period 1979-1990. Ozone depletion offsets
this by about 0.08 Watts per square metre.<P>

In relation to aerosols, the IPCC 1992 Supplement reported that
the potential effects of sulphur aerosols was such as to
potentially offset the effects of the increase of CO2 since pre-
industrial times.  Recently Kiehl and Briegleb (1993) calculated
that the July average forcing of increases in CO2, CH4, CFC-11,
CFC-12 from pre-industrial to present 2.1Wm-2) is reduced by
0.3Wm-2. <P>

Observations indicate the aerosol concentrations in the northern
hemisphere at least are increasing.  Aerosol increases over the
1980's may thus further offset the effects of greenhouse gas
increases over this period, perhaps of the order of 0.05 Watts
per square metre.<P>

Overall the effect of ozone depletion and aerosols reduce the
effective warming effect to the range of 0.3-0.4 Watts per square
metre. Taking into account the lag effect reported by the IPCC in
1990 between the addition of greenhouse gases and its temperature
(where only about 60% of the warming would be felt fairly
quickly) and the range of climate sensitivities assessed by the
IPCC, the expected warming rate over the 1980s would be in the
range 0.07-0.20ÉC/decade at the surface. Thus the satellite
observations of Christy and McNider, are within the range
expected from increased greenhouse gas levels for this period,
ignoring the effects of climate variability and the weaker
association between the satellite observations of the middle
atmosphere and that of surface temperature.<P>

STORM AND OTHER LOSSES. </B></H3><P>

"The company ran into problems soon after it began writing
business in 1989," Lloyd's List says. Most of its losses were due
to Hurricane Hugo, the European storms, and other catastrophes
natural and man-made. Bristol Re, a small company, has assets of
$23 million, and liabilities not much higher than that.<P>

("Bermuda's Bristol Re goes into liquidation," Lloyd's List, 11
December 1993).<P>

NOTES: And meanwhile, more bad news at Lloyd's. The independent
analyst, Chatset, announces that the future cost of unreserved
run-off to members of Lloyd's will now reach £8.6 billion ($12.8
billion) over the next 10-20 years, a significant increase on the
estimate of £5 billion given a year ago.  One of the main reasons
is the stream of new potential claims advices received by Lloyd's
in 1992 in respect of pollution and asbestos. ("Lloyd's will face
£8.6 bn run-off bill says Chatset," Lloyd's List, 11 December
1993).  The latest estimate for Lloyd's 1991 losses is $2.6
billion (#1.8 billion). This one comes from the Association of
Lloyd's Members (Lloyd's 1991 losses could reach £1.8bn',"

<H3><B>MILD WEATHER IS LINKED WITH CHANGING WILDLIFE PATTERNS IN
THE UK. </B></H3> <P>

The recent extended summers have apparently encouraged many birds
to delay their autumn migration. Several German and Austrian
birds, like the blackcap warbler, are now choosing Britain over
the Mediterranean for their Britain winter home. Some species,
such as European thrushes, have stopped migrating altogether.
Some British birds are nesting up to three weeks earlier than
usual, providing more time for fledglings to learn to fly and
fend for themselves before winter arrives.<P>

Spectacular changes in butterfly populations, who are
particularly sensitive to temperature changes during breeding,
have also been noted. Southern species have suddenly started
migrating north, while rare species are being reported in
increasing numbers.<P>

European wasps are also spreading through parts of southern
England. And populations of pests, such as aphids, are spreading
after mild winters.<P>

<H3><B>DATA FROM SECOND GREENLAND ICE CORE CONFLICT WITH EARLIER
</B></H3>
RESULTS.<P>

Analysis of the US Greenland Ice-Sheet Project or GISP 2, which
is located 28 km West of the European GRIP project at an altitude
of 3,208 above sea level, reveals big differences between the two
cores from a depth of 2,700 m down to bed-rock at about 3,000 m
depth.  This disagreement raises concerns over whether the abrupt
and severe climate flips in the warm Eemian period
115,000-135,000 years ago reported by the GRIP Project Team in
July 1993 are "real" or reflect distortion of the ice- sheet
close to bed-rock.<P>

In his commentary in the journal Nature on the new findings, Dr
Boulton of Edinburgh University points out that this question is
relevant to policy because of the fact that the previous
interglacial (the Eemian) was warmer than the present and "such
instability may be in store in a modern world threatened by
greenhouse warming." (G. S. Boulton, "Two cores better than one."
Nature, v. 366, p. 507-508, 9 December 1993).<P>

Two international teams reported on the inter-comparison of the
two ice-cores in the same issue of Nature.  The first, led by
K.C. Taylor of the University of Nevada  with researchers from
Denmark, Germany, Finland, the UK and USA concluded that "At
present we are unable to say  which if either core contains a
more complete climate record". <P>

The second international team led by Grootes of the University of
Washington concludes that geological analysis of the GRIP core
fits predictions "and suggests that the GRIP record can be
interpreted climatologically to a greater depth than the GISP2
record." Both conclude that further work  is needed to resolve
the issue. <P>

In commenting on these findings Boulton notes that the rapid
fluctuations in the last glacial in the period 80,000 to 20,000
years ago, wherein abrupt warmings occurred of 5-8 oC for a few
hundred years are confirmed in the GISP2 core and corroborated by
Atlantic marine sediments. Boulton concludes that the
intercomparison between the two cores is inconclusive as to which
core is affected by folding or sheer effects towards the bed-rock
region below 2,700m depth. The GISP2 core "could itself be the
one strongly influenced by shear folding." <P>

As reported by Grootes and co-workers the top 1,500 m of both
cores show clearly the remarkable climate stability of the
Holocene, the 10-12,000 years since the last glacial ended. <P>

Jouzel, "Comparison of oxygen isotope  records from the GISP2 and
GRIP Greenland ice cores," Nature, v. 366,p. 552-554, 9 December
1993; K. C. Taylor, C. U. Hammer, R. B. Alley, H. B. Clausen, D.

It becomes the first Caribbean government to do so in response to
the withdrawal of reinsurance cover. The 1994 budget address
included the announcement that local insurance companies will be
allowed to set aside 20 percent of premium income, tax free, for
five years. In this way, they can generate reserves which might
go some way to replacing the estimated 30 percent of reinsurance
capacity which has been withdrawn from Caribbean insurers over
the last two years. The plan is voluntary, unlike another
proposal for dealing with the crisis: a compulsory Caribbean
Catastrophe Reinsurance Pool, made by a leading Jamaican
insurance executive. <P>

<H3><B>MODELLING STUDY FOR ASIA PREDICTS MUCH MORE WARMING AND
HIGHER RAINFALL TO COME. </B></H3> <P>

M. Lai, from the Indian Centre for Atmospheric Sciences,
presented the results of a coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM developed
at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology applied to tropical
climate in the year 2080. <P>

Lai suggests that average temperature may increase by 2.34ÉC
throughout the tropics. Mean annual rainfall is projected to
increase by about 0.12 mm/day. Changes in rainfall show seasonal
and regional differences, with increases of more than 0.5 mm/day
expected over western south America, central east Africa, central
India, Malaysia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, while declines
in summer rainfall over south China, Venezuela and Caribbean
Islands are likely. <P>

Lai also suggests a significant increase in surface runoff over
the flood prone areas of China and India during June- September. 
The mean annual soil moisture over the tropics is not expected to
change significantly, although regional changes are likely.
Increases in soil wetness are expected over western south America
and west central Africa; decreases could be expected over south
China, Gulf countries, Brazil and Australia. <P>

Lai also suggests that tropical cyclone activity may increase and
drought may also become more frequent in and around arid
regions.<P>

(M. Lai, "Implications of greenhouse warming on the tropical
climate as inferred from a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate
model", in Proceedings of International Conference on Regional
Environmental and Climate Changes in East Asia, November 30 -
December 3 1993, Global Change Centre, National Taiwan
University).  <P>

NOTES: Climatic changes in the tropics will have special
significance because one hundred and eighteen primarily
developing countries are located within the tropics.<P>

These countries are already suffering under explosive population
growth, worsening health problems such as malaria and chorea
epidemics, malnutrition and regional environmental problems
caused by deforestation and toxic pollution. These problems are
of course not limited to the developing tropical countries and to
large extent are caused by developed country policies.<P>

Changes in temperature, rainfall and soil moisture have
implications for regional agricultural and disease distribution
and as Lai points out these pressures will place additional
stresses on already strained populations and ecosystems.<P>

Bringing together representatives from throughout Asia, the
Pacific, Australia and USA, a conference in Taiwan discusses
climate changes in the Asian region. Chinese researchers studying
the relative importance of greenhouse gases, volcanic activity
and solar radiation on determining recent climate change suggest
that greenhouse gases have dominated over the last century and
will continue to do so in the future. (G.Y. Shi, J.D. Guo, X.B.
Fan, B. Wang and L.X. Wang, "Climate Change and Its Causes," in
Proceedings of International Conference on Regional Environmental
and Climate Changes in East Asia, November 30 - December 3 1993,
Global Change Centre, National Taiwan University).<P>

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology,
report that over the highly populated areas of India, Pakistan,
Nepal, Sri Lanka and Burma, annual precipitation is increasing
significantly (by more than 5 percent) since the middle of last
century. They also show that temperature has increased but not by
a significant amount. (K. Krishna Kumar, K. Rupa Kumer and G.B.
Pant, "Long- term variations in precipitation and temperature
over South Asia from instrumental records," in Proceedings of
International Conference on Regional Environmental and Climate
Changes in East Asia, November 30 - December 3 1993, Global
Change Centre, National Taiwan University). <P>

Temperatures may also be on the increase in Taiwan. According to
researchers from Tunghai University in Taiwan, increases of
between 0.56 oC to 1.43 oC has been observed at weather stations
throughout the Taiwanese region. No significant precipitation
change has been observed. The authors conclude, "depending on the
severity of the (future) temperature and precipitation changes,
Taiwan could experience summer heat waves and devastating
droughts. These, in turn, would have ramifications beyond the
environmental impact for they would also have an impact on the
economy and human livelihood". (Wan-Li Cheng, Kenneth J.E. Berger
and Lin-Yi Hsiao, "Temperature and Precipitation Patterns in East
Asia", in Proceedings of International Conference on Regional
Environmental and Climate Changes in East Asia, November 30 -
December 3 1993, Global Change Centre, National Taiwan
University).<P>

<H3><B>ARCTIC TEMPERATURE TRENDS HINT AT ENHANCEMENT OF THE

The US Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Centre reports in
its Winter 1993 newsletter that surface temperatures at nine
stations north of the Arctic circles have increased by about
5.5 oC since 1968.  In commenting on these observations CDIAC
said that :<P>

"Although the observed increases in surface temperatures ...
cannot at present be unequivocally related to increases in
greenhouse gases, these data indicate that the boundary layer
structure in polar regions may be especially sensitive to
changes" in these gases. <P>

Surface temperature inversions in the Arctic were studied by R.S.
Bradley, F.T. Keimig and H.Diaz from the US National
Oceanographic and Atmosphere Administration from observations at
nine stations north of Arctic circle. These show that surface
temps have increased by 0.244 oC per year  and that surface
inversion depths have declined by 21m/year between 1968 to 1990.
Longer records at at a station at Barrow in Alaska confirm
this.<P>

CDIAC observed that possible causes include increased greenhouse
gases, warm air advection, increased low clouds, increased
turbidity and increases in water vapour (which have been observed
over past 20 years).  Similar trends are observed at McMurdo in
Antarctica but not at the South Pole.<P>

("Changes in Arctic Temperature Inversions." CDIAC Communications
(1993) 19:1,3, November 1993) <P>

Side bar: The IPCC 1990 Science Assessment observed that although
temperature effects of global warming are expected to be greater
in high latitude areas, particularly in the winter half of the
year, the high natural variability of the Arctic region means
that a warming trend such as that described here cannot easily be
attributed to increases in greenhouse gases.  The IPCC 1992
Supplement observed that the 1981-90 December to February average
temperatures at high latitudes in the continental areas exhibited
"very large areas of positive anomalies exceeding 1ÉC...with
centres over 2ÉC" compared to the 1951-1980 average. This
assessment also referred to an 8% reduction on snow cover in the
northern hemisphere from mid 1970s to the early 1990s.<P>

Following Hurricane "Bora" of 10 November, the port of
Novorossisk on the Black Sea has been closed for 20 consecutive
days. By 30 November, 21 tankers are waiting offshore.  Bora
kills five, and sinks at least seven ships. The State Emergency
Situations Committee reports winds of 180 kph. (Reuter, 11
November 1993). A local source says "the people of Novorossisk
say they have not known such conditions in November for many
years." <P>

Normally, severe weather is not a problem for Novorossisk until
February or March. The port was closed for 45 days between
November 1992 and the end of March 1993. ("Hurricane closes
Novorossisk," Lloyd's List, 30 November 1993). The total loss of
exports from the closure of the Black Sea port reaches more than
1.5 million tonnes. Deputy fuel and energy minister Anatoly Fomin
says  "Novorossisk has been hit by storms the like of which we
have not seen since 1964." (Lloyd's List, 3 December 1993).<P>

<H3><B>EXPERTS AGREE THAT DESERTIFICATION, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND 
DROUGHT ARE INTERLINKED. </B></H3><P>

A UN meeting on the future Convention on Desertification,
organized by the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) in Geneva, agrees that the
climate convention and the desertification convention should
include improved and intensified national and international
monitoring, assessment, and data collection programs. <P>

The meeting considers a report on the subject prepared by
Professor Martin A. Williams, of the University of Adelaide,
South Australia, and Prof. Robert C. Balling Jr., of Arizona
State University.<P>

According to Williams, over 250 million people worldwide are
directly under threat by desertification, and around 700 million
indirectly affected by it. 36 percent of the land area of the
globe is arid, semi-arid or dry sub-humid, and 18 percent of the
world's population live in these areas. Over 100 countries around
the world have experienced dry land degradation, or continue to
have long periods of drought with severe consequences on their
social and economic development.<P>

<H3><B>GENERAL DECLINE OF THE OCEANS SET TO COMPOUND IMPACTS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE. </B></H3><P>

A Worldwatch Institute report says that the oceans' critical role
in human survival is in peril from over-fishing, coastal
development and land-based pollution. "The catastrophic spills of
oil tankers, the fouling of beaches and the killing of whales ...
are not the largest problems," concludes the report, "Abandoned
Seas: Reversing the Decline of the Oceans." <P>

Less dramatic, but more destructive, it says, are "the slow,
persistent incursions of coastal habitat destruction, the
relentless push to increase the global fish catch, and the
dispersed sources of pollution that ultimately end up in the
sea." Coastal population is growing faster than inland
population. The $1.9 trillion tourism industry draws half the
travellers to coastal resorts. Of the world's ten largest cities,
only Mexico City is not on or near the coast. <P>

The report says the global fish catch rose from under 5 million
tons in 1900 to 80 million tons today. The U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization estimates "that all 17 of the world's
major fishing areas have either reached or exceeded their natural
limits and that nine of the areas are in serious decline." <P>

"Even if the meteorologists talk about normal variations over the
centuries, a company cannot reason that way."  Ake Munkhammar,
Scandia<P>

The company, one of Sweden's biggest insurers, lost money on the
frequent storms of 1992. The number of storm days have doubled
four times in the last fifteen years. Ake Munkhammar, Scandias
expert on storms and natural catastrophes, points out that while
climatologists have the luxury of delaying their decision on
whether the bounds of natural variance are being exceeded,
insurance companies cannot afford that luxury.<P>

<H3><B>ATLANTIC HIGH TIDES BREACH SEA DEFENCES IN GUYANA.
</B></H3><P>

Three days of heavy rains and unusually high tides cause
widespread flooding in the major east coast farming community of
Lusignan, and a national disaster is declared. A break in a 200
foot section of Guyana's Atlantic sea defences system leaves the
village, and large areas of surrounding farmland, under 10 inches
of water. An estimated 8,000 people are affected.<P>

President Cheddi Jagan says it will take millions of dollars to 
repair the damage, calls out the army, and appeals for able-
bodied citizens to fill sandbags to keep the incoming Atlantic at
bay until a more permanent solution can be found. The Agriculture
Minister calls the flooding a national disaster, and says the
government will approach a visiting World Bank team for emergency
aid to repair the sea defences.<P>

Georgetown and most parts of the coast are up to six feet below
sea level. Seventeenth century Dutch explorers built revetments
to keep out the sea, but through the years it has proven an
uphill task for local officials to adequately maintain them.<P>

The first of the season's rainstorms, little more than showers,
arrive two weeks after the fires. The earth literally flows off
the barren hillsides, causing still further disasters for
residents and others attempting to clean up. Fire has denuded
these of vegetation, and changed the composition of the soil,
making it more impervious. The mudslides block roads, damage
houses and turn rivers muddy and black. "Fire is the major
triggering device of mud flows in Southern California,"" says a
Los Angeles County flood control expert. "You can get major
mudslides with only one or two inches of rain." <P>

An outbreak of mosquito- borne dengue fever has spread from the
Costa Rican countryside into the capital. Health Ministry
official announces that three cases of dengue had been reported
in the poor and crowded Pavas neighbourhood in San Jose. The
government warns people to fumigate porches and patios and
eliminate standing water which may serve as a breeding ground for
the mosquitoes that carry the disease. WHO officials have noted
that global warming may exacerbate the spread of dengue fever,
which is spread by mosquitos. <P>

<H3><B>ITALIAN SCIENTISTS CONFIRM CLIMATE CHANGE SIGNALS IN
ITALY. </B></H3> <P>

At the Florence national meeting on climate, attended by 300
Italian  climate  scientists,  recent  data appear to confirm
that Italy is undergoing  a "climate  partitioning" into a wet
northern region and a southern  semi- arid  region.  <P>

In Northern Italy  impressive rainfall levels have been reported:
525 mm in Genoa in 4 days compared to a annual average level of
250 mm, for example. In Italy during the period September-October
1993, the total economic damage due to floods was 6,000  billion
Lira. Drought frequency increased at the same time, especially in
Southern Italy. ("Soffocati  come  in  una serra," Il Messaggero 
23  September  1993;  "L'Italia  verso  la scissione' climatica,"
Corriere della  Sera,  10  November  1993). <P>

Giampiero Maracchi, University of Florence climatologist,
explains: "The  energy  budget of the planet is changing and with
this Italy too. Just looking at the rainfall level, we can see an
increasing  persistence and a growing number of extreme events,
great floods and great droughts:  that trend is expected to
increase in the next century." <P>

Vincenzo  Ferrara,  climatologist at ENEA, says: "the 'climatic
splitting' of Italy could be inferred from the general
circulation models elaborated by the IPCC between 1990 and 1992.
According to the computer models, the average temperature
increase, due to the increasing  concentration of  GHGs - mainly
carbon dioxide - will not be homogeneous. It will be more
pronounced at the poles than at the equator.  Besides, the
rainfall trend should go toward extreme events, in the sense that
wherever there is a rainy climate it will rain more and more, and
vice versa."  (Travolti  da  November 10, 1993).<P>

Government declares a state of emergency in the north of the
country. More than 11,000 people are forced from their homes by
heavy flooding in Honduras and parts of neighbouring Nicaragua.
The floods follow heavy rain over deforested mountains, and
affect mountain and coastal plain (on the Caribbean side) alike.

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING SEEMS TO BE OCCURRING MOSTLY AT NIGHT.
</B></H3><P>

Over the last 40 years nights have been heating up three times
faster than the days, due mainly to the blanketing effect of
clouds. According to data presented at an international workshop,
arranged by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the US Department of Energy, global night time
temperatures have increased 0.84 oC and global day time
temperatures by 0.28 oC. <P>

Professor Ann Henderson-Sellers, Director of the Climatic Impacts
Centre in Australia and key speaker at the conference, is
convinced the increasing night time temperatures has been caused
by the greenhouse effect. She has been studying global cloud
cover for the last 15 years and has found that continental cloud
cover has been increasing over the last 100 years. If it is
cloudy at night it is not so cold because clouds acted as a
blanket that stopped the world from cooling. <P>

Professor Henderson-Sellers said global warming could increase
evaporation, create more cloud cover, trap more heat and raise
night time temperatures. <P>

("We're getting hotter at night," The Sydney Morning Herald, 9
November 1993).  <P>

NOTES: Increasing night-time temperatures may have serious
economic and social impacts. Energy demand could increase because
people are more likely to run fans and air-conditioners over
night. Agricultural growing season could increase but so would
pests. Human health would also be affected, especially in the
old, sick and young. As conditions got hotter, people would loss
sleep and health would be impaired.<P>

Lloyd's List reports that "Oil major Conoco has launched a strong
attack on the inability of insurers to meet its insurance
requirements." The company warns that should insurance capacity
continue to shrink, future projects such as the North Sea
Britannia field could be affected. The net value of the
properties and other insured categories Conono and its parent
company DuPont owns comes to $14.8 billion, with annual premiums
of £28.2 m. "Finding insurance markets capable of handling these
mind-boggling sums has become an increasing problem over recent
years. The main market still remains Lloyd's, which has been
badly - and publicly - hit by major claims including the Piper
Alpha tragedy," Conoco says"  <P>

("Conoco attack on level of cover," Lloyd's List, 9 November
1993).<P>

NOTES: In the article, there is no mention of the fact that
damage from windstorms has been a far greater drain on insurance
capacity than have man-made catastrophes such as Piper Alpha. Or
of the growing suspicions of some insurers that at least a
component of the windstorm damage can be ascribed to human
enhancement of the greenhouse cause, caused in very large part by
the burning of oil.<P>

<H3><B>BREEDING RATE OF ADELIE PENGUINS LINKED TO CLIMATIC
WARMING? </B></H3> <P>

An increase of 400,000 breeding pairs (to one million breeding
pairs) has been measured in the last 12 years in the Ross Sea
region. NZ scientist Dr Wilson said "the large increase in
penguin numbers, due to decreasing adult mortality and increasing
chick survival is probably related to environmental warming and a
reduction in the sea ice during breeding." ("Global warming suits
the penguins," New Scientist, Science and Education in Australia
and New Zealand supplement, v. 139, 24 July 1993; "Penguins add
weight to global warming research," The Independent, 28 March
1991). <P>

Further evidence of climate warming comes from studies at nearby
Lake Vanda. Fed entirely by glacial melt water, it has been
rising rapidly in recent years. Another study of six Antarctic
lakes has shown that the surface ice has thinned by up to 40
percent over the last decade. The authors of the study point out
that "lake ice could represent a sensitive indicator of short
term (less than 100 years) climate change." (B.L. Linder, C.P.
McKay, G.D. Clow and R.A. Wharton, "Computational modelling on
Antarctic Lake ice; Advances in Ice Technology,"  in W. M.
Sackinger and P. Wadhams (eds), Proceedings of the Third
International Conference on Ice Technology, 1992).<P>

<H3><B>RENEWED WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA TAKES TOTAL INSURANCE LOSS
TO A BILLION DOLLARS. </B></H3> <P>

Fires on 3rd November add to the damage done on 27 October. All
told, 26 firestorms rage over 2 weeks. Police suspect arson in 19
of the fires. (Reuter, 9 November 1993). With some 1,241
structures destroyed in total, and 197,225 acres burned from
Mexican border to Los Angeles, the Office of Emergency Services
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimate the total
damage at around a billion dollars. <P>

The insurance industry's Property Claims Service gives a
preliminary estimate of $950 million. US catastrophe losses for
1993 had been running at $4.4 billion before the fires, 1.6
billion of which was due to the storm which hit 24 states in
March. <P>

<H3><B>SCIENTISTS CONCLUDE THAT COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT PLANS ARE
INADEQUATE. </B></H3>
<P>

Currently, 60 percent of the world population lives within 60
kilometres of the coastline, and while some 100 countries have a
coastal area, only a few of them have some form of coastal zone
management in place.<P>

The final statement of an international conference organized by
the IPCC and the Dutch government on problems in coastal areas
induced by climate change says that by the year 2000, all
countries with coastal areas should have made integrated coastal
zone management plans to address present and conceivable problems
in coastal zones.<P>

Scientists at the World Coast Conference 1993, held in Noordwijk,
the Netherlands, urged policy-makers to put coastal zone
management much higher on the environmental agenda. Integrated
coastal zone management (ICZM) is defined as the process of
pursuing sustainable development in coastal zones. <P>

ICZM should address both short- and long-term issues by focusing
on housing, industry, and tourism, as well as environmental
needs, the conference concluded. problems highlighted include:  
Loss Of wetlands: The current global loss of wetlands amounts to
3 million to 6 million hectares (7.4 million-14.8 million acres)
annually. There are about 300 million hectares (741 million
acres) of wetlands, including coral reefs, intertidal areas,
mangroves, and salt marshes, globally. They are being lost to
human development as well as sea-level rise, a cause for concern
because of the biodiversity implications. Professor Pier Vellinga
warns that the loss of biological diversity can in principle have
major impacts on  the global biogeochemical system.  <P>

Common Methodology for the Assessment of Vulnerability to
Accelerated Sea Level Rise: This was developed by the IPCC
Working Group on Coastal Zone Management in 1992, which defines
vulnerability as "a nation's ability to cope with the
consequences of an accelerated sea level rise and other impacts
of global  climate change." <P>

The Bureau of National Affairs writes that "according to a global
vulnerability assessment, an estimated 200 million to 250 million
people live in areas vulnerable to extra-high tide levels caused
by a storm. While many of these people are protected, such as
those living in the Netherlands, it is estimated that more than
40 million people are subject to annual coastal  floodings. 
These numbers might increase substantially if the mean sea level
rises and with the expected population growth in coastal areas."

2000," Bureau of National Affairs, 24 November Commentary on 1-5
November conference).<P>

The unusually cold wet summer and a number of severe typhoons has
wrecked havoc on crops in Japan during 1993.  The Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has estimated crop damage at
1.2 trillion yen (US$11 billion) since the beginning of the year,
a record since statistics have been gathered (1954).  The poor
harvest has led to an unprecedented import of 200,000 tonnes of
rice this year, with further imports likely next year.<P>

Since 1989, the encroaching sea has damaged 2,947 residential,
industrial and tourist units and completely destroyed 33,000
hectares of farm lands in the Caspian province of Mazandran. The
damage bill exceeds 600 billion rials. Encroachment of the sea
was first noticed in the early 1980s, but it caused little

cities are under threat, from Ramsar in the west to Bandar
Turkman in the east of the province.<P>

<H3><B>MISSISSIPPI FLOODWATERS MIGHT HARM ECOLOGY IN THE GULF OF
MEXICO. </B></H3> <P>

Record-breaking Mississippi flood waters finally start to recede,
raising questions about where all the water has gone. Scientists
at the University of Miami suggest the Gulf of Mexico received
the bulk of the floodwater, which then stayed around for about
two weeks.  They express concern about the possible effects of
such a volume of water on the marine life in the Gulf, especially
around the mouth of the river.  Normally a 'dead' zone covering
some 2.4 million acres exists around the mouth of river because
the ocean marine life can't survive in the sediment-rich fresh
water.  This year scientists estimate that the flood waters might
extend that 'dead' zone to twice its normal size. <P>

Other scientists suggest that the flood waters have diluted the
salinity of the seawater far beyond the river mouth and spread
freshwater micro-organisms throughout the Gulf. <P>

In September, some parts of the city of Brig were inundated by
two metres (six feet) of flood waters when the Saltina river
broke its banks, causing severe damage to buildings, the railway
line and roads, the sewerage system and some industries. A
preliminary damage bill of 60 million Swiss francs (US$40-45
million) is revised upwards to between 200 and 400 million
francs. The flood- prone Canton Ticino is also badly hit. <P>

Lake Maggioreon the Swiss/Italian border rose five metres above
normal. The lake overflows its banks in several places, and
steamer services are suspended. On 25th September a peak of
196.51 metres was measured. This was exceeded after further rains
on 11 October, with a record-breaking 197 metre level, the
second-highest level for this century. Several tourist towns are
inundated, power is cut and infrastructure damaged. Large
quantities of heating oil leak from central-heating storage
tanks.  The damage bill is SF 120 million.  <P>

<H3><B>WORST DROUGHT IN GREECE FOR 100 YEARS. </B></H3><P>

Greek religious leader asks Greek people to pray for rain.
Farmers are gravely threatened and five million in Athens are
facing the prospect of no drinking water by the end of the month.
"It is the worst drought in 100 years. If it doesn't rain soon
Athens could run out of water in a month," says Yannis Penis,
public relations officer for the city's water supply company. <P>

This October was the driest in 50 years. Athens has experienced
an unseasonably warm autumn, with temperatures in the 1970s.
According to Agriculture Ministry estimates, unless it rains in
the few days that remain of this year's planting season for
winter crops, farmers stand to lose more than one billion
dollars, representing 13 percent of their expected earnings.
Greece's agricultural sector employs a quarter of all workers and
contributes 13 percent to gross domestic product. <P>

Power supplies have also been affected in Athens, with power cuts
resulting from electrostatic charge associated with a buildup of
dust on power cables. Water bills have been increased by 400
percent, and as many as a third of all Greeks are reportedly
involved in drilling for underground water.<P>

Lake Iliki, 55 miles northeast of Athens, was once five miles
long, two miles wide and 262 feet deep. Today, it is less than
one-third that size. "We no longer take water from Iliki but
instead supply it with water ... so it won't completely dry up
and disrupt the local ecology," says Ioannis Stevis of the Athens
Water Company. The Government plans to replenish the main Athens
reservoir by diverting waters from a lake in western Greece, and
in the parched northern part of the country a huge EC-sponsored
project is aimed at diverting the Acheloos river so that it can
supply water to the dry farming areas around Thessalonika.<P>

("Drought threatens farmers' income," IPS, 1 November 1993;
"Athens faces acute water shortage as drought persists," AP, 9
November 1993).<P>

NOTES: The Greek drought compounds another dire environmental
problem, air pollution in Athens. In late October, the atmosphere
above Athens registered record levels of contamination. On
October 25th, with 1,200 people hospitalized due to respiratory
and heart problems caused by the pollution, the Environment
Ministry banned one million cars from the city centre. ("Drought

1990 had the largest number of tornados ever recorded. The

July 31, 1987, causing Can$250 million in damage, and killing 27
people.<P>

"If current trends in emissions of atmospheric greenhouse gases
continue, causing modest changes in climate, the frequency and
magnitude of floods [in the Mississippi Valley] could
increase."<P>

So says James Knox, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin,
speaking at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of
America (Boston, October 1993). Knox's studies suggest that even
a temperature increase of 1 oC and a 10-20 percent increase in
average annual rainfall could drastically alter flood
patterns.<P>

<H3><B>UNPRECEDENTED EL NINO CONTINUES TO STUMP SCIENTISTS.
</B></H3><P>

The ocean warming in the eastern Pacific, part of the current El
Nino, is into its third year and is getting stronger. "Things are
not going in the expected way," said Don Hansen, an oceanographer
at the University of Miami. "Scientists have been commenting on
what an unusual event this is. The longer it goes on, the more
unusual it becomes." <P>

Sea surface temperatures near the International Dateline last
month increased from 29 to 30ÉC, showing the El Nino is even
strengthening. Tim Barnett, research oceanographer at the Scipps
Institute in California believes that this warming may not be El
Nino after all, but of a general warming trend in the Pacific and
Indian Oceans. ("Nino breaks all the rules," Courier Mail
[Australia], 22 October 1993). <P>

Climatologist Chester Ropelewski of the US Weather Service's
Climate Analysis Centre (CAC) says, "This is really unprecedented
in the climate record. Clearly, we don't understand all that's
going on here." There has only been one similar period of
sustained warmth in the tropical Pacific - a shorter episode in
1939-41. Vernon Kousky, also from CAC, suggests that the one or
more of climate change, the climatic disruptions caused by the
eruption of Mt Pinatubo, variations in the ocean-atmosphere
system, may have maintained sea surface temperatures in the
tropical Pacific at warmer levels for so long. (R.A. Kerr. "El
Nino Metamorphosis Throws Forecasters," Science, v. 262, 29
October 1993). <P>

New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmosphere Research
(NIWAR) scientists say that this El Nino may become one of the
longest- ever El Nino periods. Typically El Nino warms the
tropical central and eastern Pacific but cools NZ, particularly
in the east and northwest. NIWAR experts suggest that the human-
induced greenhouse effect and El Nino could be linked. If
greenhouse emissions continue, huge climate changes are predicted
for NZ. ("What future for El Nino," New Zealand Sunday Times, 31
October 1993).  <P>

NOTES: This ENSO would come to an end by the beginning of 1994
(N. Nicholls, pers. comm., February 1994). Similar periods of El
Nino have occurred in the past, 1939-41 and also in 1911-13.
(Climate Analysis Centre, "El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
Diagnostic Advisory, April 1993", Climate System Monitoring
Monthly Bulletin, World Climate Programme, Issue No.4-1993, April
1993) The 1939-41 event occurred when ENSO seemed to be
strengthening after a weak period between the 1920s and 1940s.
Some researchers have suggested that this weak period may be
related to rapid global warming that occurred during the period
(N. Nicholls (ed), "Climate Change and the El Nino - Southern
Oscillation," Report of the Workshop on Climate Change and the El
Nino - Southern Oscillation held at the Bureau of Meteorology
Research Centre, Melbourne, Australia, 31 May and 4 June 1993,

<H3><B>OZONE DEPLETION CAN COMBINE WITH GLOBAL WARMING TO SPEED
CORAL BLEACHING. </B></H3> <P>

Daniel Gleason and Gerard Wellington (University of Houston)
publish results of their investigations into the increasingly
frequent episodes of coral bleaching over the past decade in the
tropics.<P>

It has generally been assumed that these episodes were associated
with increases in seawater temperatures, although temperature
increase alone could not explain the mass bleaching events in the
Caribbean during 1987 and 1990. Gleason and Gerard suggest that
an additional factor may have been UVB. <P>

Bleaching episodes in 1987 and 1990 occurred in areas
experiencing extremely calm waters and exceptionally clear water.

This permitted higher than average intensities of UVB to
penetrate the upper water column over several months.<P>

The authors conducted a field experiment which showed that,
irrespective of high water temperatures, short-term increases in
UVB radiation of a magnitude possible under calm, clear water
column conditions can readily induce bleaching in reef-building
corals. <P>

"Increases in UV intensity due to anthropogenic ozone depletion
will be minimal at low latitudes and should not be a factor in
bleaching, but an increase in the frequency or duration of
exceptionally calm and clear water conditions, which accompany
such large-scale climatic phenomena as El Nino/Southern
Oscillation, for example, could lead to greater penetration of UV
radiation on coral reefs and thus to an increased potential for
UV-induced bleaching."<P>

coral bleaching," Nature, v. 365, p. 836-838, 28 October
1993).<P>

<H3><B>FAO PREDICTS 1993 CEREAL PRODUCTION DECLINE. </B></H3><P>

The UN agency releases a report predicting a decline in global
cereal production as a consequence of a weather-affected poor
maize harvest in the USA. A three percent decline, corresponding
to 24 million tonnes, to 1.91 billion tonnes is expected. <P>

Smaller maize crops are also expected in Asia, although Canada,
the EC should fare better, and the west Africa harvest is also
expected to be good due to a diminished threat from locusts.
Wheat production is expected to be less affected, with an average
harvest in the US and perhaps a record crop in Asia. Drought-
affected north African harvests have been countered by good south
African crops. <P>

FAO forecasts a global cereal supply of 2,096 billion tonnes,
down 25 million tonnes from 1992.  This figure includes
stockpiles from the 1992/93 season. The report states that "this
level of supply is expected to be adequate to meet anticipated
global demand in 1993/94, but stocks will have to be drawn upon
after the substantial replenishment in 1992/93." <P>

<H3><B>MOZAMBIQUE'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, BEIRA, IS BEING STEADILY
INUNDATED. </B></H3>
<P>

Roads and some expensive homes have already been destroyed. Two
years ago, one the city's best known beach restaurants, 'the
sailing ship', was engulfed.  The city centre, currently two
kilometres from the coast, is already showing signs of coastal
erosion, with walls cracking and potholes forming in the roads.
<P>

Despite the steady inundation, there are no accurate estimates of
the rate at which Beira, built on a coastal swamp, is being
inundated. A recent Dutch study included Beira as one of the ten
cities in the world most threatened by sea level rise. The
erosion has probably been heightened by the recent removal of
protective mangrove forests and poor maintenance work on the sea
walls. <P>

<H3><B>EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS DAMAGE CHILE'S ECONOMY.
</B></H3><P>

Extreme climatic events, attributed to El Nino, have reportedly
caused significant problems to the national economy of Chile.
Damage to public infrastructure from floods and storms in the
first half of 1993 exceeded $48,661,800, 8 percent of the
national budget for public infrastructure work.<P>

<H3><B>US FLOOD CONTROL POLICY COMES UNDER QUESTION. </B></H3><P>

Over the past 60 years or so, US$25 billion has been spent on
dams and embankments nationally, and many people want to know
what for, since a federal task force report in 1992 said that
there has been no reduction in deaths from flooding, and economic
losses have doubled despite all the flood controls now in force.
<P>


The main reason for this is that there has been increased
development on floodplains.  To try to stop this (not only
because of the risk of damage to buildings due to flooding, but
also because these areas are usually environmentally sensitive),
the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) is campaigning for an end
to Federal flood insurance subsidies (which encourage people to
build). <P>

Over the last 200 years, around 475,000 square kilometres of
wetlands have been drained.  These wetlands traditionally formed
a buffer between the rivers and other low-lying lands, and their
loss has meant that flood waters became concentrated further
downstream causing the floods.  Public opinion is now leaning
towards allowing the ex-wetlands (now mainly crop land) to flood
again, so that area further downstream (with buildings etc) will
be protected.<P>

October 1993).<P>

Dr Norman Myers points to the scope for many millions to be
displaced from the deltas of the Ganges, Nile, Hwang Ho, Yangtze,
Mekong, Chao Phryay, Sawleen, Irrawaddy, Indus and Tigris
Euphrates, plus other rivers in Africa and South America. In
eastern China alone, he points out, 73 million live today in
coastal areas at risk.<P>

On top of those fleeing incursions of the sea, would come
millions of others arising from potential changes to the monsoon,
and impacts on the global grain harvest. Stanford University
biologist Paul Ehrlich offers an entirely plausible scenario
involving climate change, by early next century, reducing the
global grain harvest by 10% on average three times per decade.
Each such shortfall could result in an extra 50 to 400 million
starvation deaths, and would in sum be capable of triggering mass
migrations from affected areas.<P>

<H3><B>POLAR BIOLOGISTS CHART A GRIM FUTURE FOR POLAR BEARS.
</B></H3><P>

If climatic warming occurs, the first polar bears to feel its
impacts will be those at the southern limits of their
distribution _ at places like the southern parts of the Hudson
Bay. Bears in these areas are already forced to undergo a four
month fast while the ice melts during the summer. If this ice
free period is extended any longer, the bears will be unable to
cope with this enforced fast, and will be unable to store enough
fat to deal with the winter cold. The first visible problems will
be a decline in condition, lower reproductive rates, more chance
of cubs dying, and a move towards human settlements where food
can be scavenged.<P>

To a certain extent, most of these changes are already visible in
the western Hudson Bay region, but it is uncertain as to whether
this is due specifically to global warming.<P>

Further north, a decrease in sea ice will mean a decrease in seal
populations.  Seals are polar bears' main food resource, and so a
decline in seals will mean a decline in polar bears. Female polar
bears bear their young in dens, and rain in late winter may cause
the collapse of these dens killing the cubs and mothers
inside.<P>

As the polar bear population declines, so will quotas that native
peoples rely upon for trading. Eventually, quotas will have to be
eliminated.  Hudson Bay tourism based on the bears will
disappear. <P>

warming on polar bears," Arctic, v. 46, p. 240_245, September

"None of us is ever going to forget how the rains came in the
summer for the first time, out of nowhere. And we will never feel
the same about our place on earth." Victor Lespinasse, grain
analyst quoted in Time magazine<P>

Along the Mississippi, all bridges for 500 km are severed. Petrol
stations explode. The high waters build and build throughout
July. The damage bill passes the $10 billion mark, 30,000 people
are left temporarily homeless and 41,000 square kilometres of
farmland are inundated. The Mississippi is in flood as far north
as Wisconsin. A difficult cleanup task remains ahead; spilt
diesel fuel, rotting algae, human waste and animal carcasses, a
thick layer of mud, rusting appliances, and tonnes of
miscellaneous detritus.<P>

Time magazine notes that "it is an anomaly in the Mississippi
basin that it came in July, giving farmers less time to recover
than previous inundations, which almost always came in late
winter or early spring. Summers in the area are usually noted for
searing heat and Saharan drought rather than for rains on which
Noah's ark might float." ("Flood, sweat and tears," Time, 26 July
1993).<P>

The flood damage leads to a sharp cut in the forecast for  world
grain production in 1993-1994. In its monthly Grain Market
Report, the International Wheat Council revises its June figure
of 829 million tonnes to 811, and warns that "the figure could be
subject to further sizeable revisions pending assessment of crop
damage caused by flooding in the US mid-west." ("US flood damage
prompts sharp cut in world grain forecast," Financial Times, 30
July 1993).<P>

NOTES: WMO's explanation for the US floods. The summer began with
the jet stream, unusually strong at the time, occupying a SW-NE
quasi-stationary mean position over the northern Mississippi
basin. To the northwest lay a persistent low- pressure trough. To
the southeast, over the eastern USA, lay an unusually strong
anticlockwise circulation. At the boundary, a stationary surface
front involved the nearly continuous over- riding of cooler drier
air to the north by moisture laden air from the south. The
inevitable result was heavy and prolonged rain throughout much of
the central USA.<P>

Compounding the problem was the fact that there had been an
excessive winter snowpack in the Rocky Mountains. Result: the
worst flooding in the northern Mississippi basin in more than a
century.<P>

The WMO's "Climate News" commented that the floods could be
explained by global warming, the Pinatubo eruption, or both in
conjunction with natural variability, but all these mechanisms
seem less likely than a direct influence of the ENSO phenomenon.
("The American mid-west floods of summer 1993," Climate News,
WMO, no. 4, p. 10-11, January 1994).<P>

But, as has been noted in previous entries in this catalogue,
even if this WMO view is correct, can we be sure that the ENSO
phenomenon is not itself being strengthened by global warming?<P>

<H3><B>TOP AMERICAN INSURERS TALK OF THREAT TO INDUSTRY.
</B></H3><P>

The President of the US National Committee on Property Insurance
warns that climate change is one of the most important issues
facing the insurance industry. The President of the Reinsurance
Association of America warns that climate change could bankrupt
the industry.<P>

In New York City, Greenpeace, along with the US College of
Insurance and  insurance consultancy Environmental Technologies
and Telecommunications, co-sponsor a conference "Climate Change
and the Insurance Industry." Speakers include  Frank Nutter,
President of the Reinsurance Association of America, Eugene
Lecompte, President of the US National Committee on Property
Insurance, and Professor Pier Vellinga, Co-chair of the IPCC's
Coastal Zone Management subgroup. <P>

Nutter professes that "Greenpeace, it seems to me, makes a good
case that we have significant and, perhaps, permanent changes in
our climate in this country, and in the world.  We in the
insurance industry find that our economic interest is in fact
very much intertwined with that of the environment and the
climate.  It is the threat of natural catastrophes that drives
the demand for insurance products on property.  It's also clear
that climate change could bankrupt the industry." <P>

Lecompte spells out the risk: "climate change, regardless of its
cause, is causing the ocean levels to rise. If, in concert with
the rising of the ocean levels, we have more frequent storms,
windstorms and hurricanes and more intense storms, then we will
have more damage because more storms are going to drive an ever
expanding sea harder against our coast. There are areas along the
Atlantic coast in particular that I can think of that have
similar type problems where the roadways today are below sea
level. So, if sea level rises, or if there's a sufficient storm
surge, we're going to have major problems." <P>

Nutter points to the US Virgin islands for an example of how
badly an economy can be affected by the withdrawal of insurance
cover:<P>

"We've certainly seen the effect of natural catastrophes on
insurance markets that have caused economic activity to come to a
screeching halt. That's true in the United States Virgin Islands
in particular, where there are very few new home sales. New
construction has come to a halt.  A lot of that is a function of
lenders that require insurance protection being unwilling to make
loans without that insurance protection.  The concern is, of
course, that the same scenario would play out, as it has, in
part, in Hawaii, and in Florida and other coastal areas where the
industry is concerned about it's exposure and is seeking to
minimize potential loss. If you don't have insurance, there's a
lot of things you can't do." <P>

Lecompte spelt out the worst-case analysis: "Despite the fact
that the industry is financially healthy, and has some 160
billion in surplus, in two events you could take 70 billion, or
maybe 80 billion of that surplus away and you'd cripple the
industry. It wouldn't be able to take on new risks. It wouldn't
have the capacity to underwrite the business of the future.  We'd
have massive, massive availability problems." <P>

Lecompte ended his presentation with this conclusion: "Is climate
change one of the most important issues facing the insurance
industry today? Simply stated, yes."<P>

Prof, Vellinga, felt that the victims in the financial sector
could extend further than insurers alone: "So, the insurance
sector could well be the first victim of climate change.  As they
are a victim, this might affect the stock market.  That is the
kind of scenario that many of us fear, that through climate
change, that through the insurance sector, the whole financial
sector will be affected by climate change."<P>

industry," a Greenpeace USA production released December
1993).<P>

<H3><B>INCREASE OF CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS SLOWED DURING
1992. </B></H3> <P>

At the fourth international conference on carbon dioxide, held at
Carqueiranne, France, 13-17 September, Charles Keeling, the
scientist who orginated monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations, reveals that the gas last year increased at a
slower-than-normal rate. 1992 was in fact the the largest
negative anomaly record from the Mauna Loa (Hawaii) monitoring
station in 35 years of data. Reductions in fossil fuel burning
are clearly not the reason, Keeling says.  (J.Grace, Terrestrial
Initiative in Global Environmental Research, "An anomalous year
for carbon dioxide," Tiger Eye, no 7, p.5-6, Autumn 1993).<P>

NOTES: So where did the carbon go? It seems that the Pinatubo
eruption may well have played a role. Important clues come from
carbon isotopes in the gas. Photosynthesis takes up the the
lighter isotope preferentially, and so tends to force the ratio
of the heavier-to-lighter isotope up. Ocean uptake, however, has
an insignificant effect on the ratio. The fact that the 13C/12C
ratio does not show any anomaly, therefore, indicates that the
ocean was responsible for the additional uptake of carbon
dioxide.<P>

One possible explanation is that the fall out from the eruption
of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a rapid fertilization of the
oceans, leading a bloom in phytoplankton. Pinatubo erupted
material containing some 500 million tons of iron, whereas
fixation by phytoplankton of the 4 billion tonnes of carbon
estimated to have been "withdrawn" from the atmosphere between
the May 1991 and the end of 1992 would require only a fraction of
a million tonnes. <P>

Research, "An anomalous year for carbon dioxide," Tiger Eye, no
7, p.5-6, Autumn 1993).<P>

<H3><B>RIVERS CREST AGAIN IN MISSOURI. </B></H3><P>

Renewed flooding in the midwest come after heavy downpours that
soak Missouri and much of the upper midwest in late September.
Hydrologists are reported as saying that the ground in the region
is so saturated from the summer's record flooding that any
additional rain will simply run off into streams and rivers. At
St. Louis, the Mississippi River crests at 38.2 feet, 8.2 feet
above flood stage. The crest was more than 11 feet below the
record crest set on 1st August 1. The Missouri and Meramec rivers
also flood. <P>

<H3><B>RUINOUS FLOODING IN THE SWISS, FRENCH, AND ITALIAN ALPS.
</B></H3><P>

After three days of torrential rain, rivers overflow destroying
buildings and cars and causing wholesale evacuation of several
villages, and killing at least six people.  Mudslides cause the
closure of two tunnels between France and Italy. Officials said
the flooding in the Savoie region is the worst in 35 years.<P>

The southern Swiss town of Brig, an important junction for
international train services crossing Switzerland to and from
Italy, is declared a disaster area after a river bursts its banks
and floods the town centre. The town's centre is submerged under
ten feet of water and hundreds of rescue workers began clearing
away tons of debris and mud. Damage in the worst floods in
Switzerland for six years is estimated at more than 100 million
Swiss francs (nearly £50 million). Damage to transport systems
(train and roads) is expected to run into tens of millions of
dollars. (Lloyds List, September 27 1993).<P>

In Italy, towns are flooded all along the Ligurian coast and up
into Piedmont towards the Alps, "their streets turned into rivers
and parked cars ripped up by the  wind and blown on top of one
another in banks of mud." Worst hit is the port of Genoa, where
it rains non-stop for 22 hours. As strong winds sweep the town,
millions of pounds worth of damage is done and two die. ("Six are
killed in Italian floods," Guardian, 27 September 1993).  <P>

NOTES: The Italian ministry of the environment, and pressure
groups, blame incompetent maintenance of waterways and inadequate
damming and irrigation for the excessive damage caused by the
flooding in northern Italy. In the Trento mud avalanche disaster
of the  mid-1980s, when 35 people died, these factors may also
have exacerbated the impact of the inundations.<P>

At a meeting of glaciologists at Cambridge, British Antarctic
Survey scientist David Peel says "modelling studies show that the
polar regions are going to be among the first to detect changes
arising from greenhouse warming, but these changes are amplifying
even that". <P>

At the same meeting researchers from the Norwegian Polar Research
Institute reveal that iceberg data amassed from passing ships
indicate that Antarctic ice shelves were breaking up faster than
expected. There is some questioning, however, on whether these
results accurately take into account repeat observations.<P>

According to the US National Climatic Data Centre, in the last
year, four major weather events - Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane
Iniki, the March 1993 "Storm of the Century and  the Midwest
floods and Southeast drought, have caused huge losses and
preliminary estimations nearly reach US$45 billion. Since 1980,
11 weather disasters have caused in excess of US$1 billion and
placed strain on federal, state and local governments and the
insurance industry. (Neal Lott, "The Summer of 1993: Flooding in
the Midwest and Drought in the Southeast," National Climatic Data
Centre Research Customer Service Group, Technical Report 93-04,
16 September 1993).<P>

So says biodiversity expert, Alwyn Gentry. The rate of growth and
death of trees is accelerating, with the result that fast-
growing, light-loving trees may replace shade tolerant hardwoods.
Light trees absorb less carbon dioxide than hardwoods. These
changes may result in an overall loss of forest diversity over
large areas.<P>

<H3><B>TYPHOON YANCY CAUSES HUGE DAMAGE TO JAPANESE FARMS.
</B></H3><P>

Meteorological Agency officials call the season's thirteenth
typhoon "one of the most powerful storms to hit Japan in 50
years," similar in strength to the typhoon (Mireille) which
killed 62 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in
1991. (Japan Economic Newswire, 3 September 1993). <P>

Yancy hits the south island of Kyushu, with winds of up to 212
kph. It kills more 42 people, and destroys over 500 homes. 40 of
the victims die on Kyushu, where a team of about 500 policemen,
firefighters and Self-Defense Force troops search a major
landslide site in the town of Kimpo in Kagoshima prefecture after
20 people are buried alive. The storm destroys 572 homes, floods
1,500 structures, tears up roads at 64 locations and washes away
eight bridges. Five airlines cancel 202 domestic flights in one
day, stranding 20,000 passengers. Train services on Honshu are
also cancelled or delayed, affecting 245,000 passengers. 709,000
households suffer power failures. ("Death toll from typhoon
reaches 42," United Press International, 5 September 1993).<P>

The typhoon causes ten's of billions of yen worth of damage to
farms, including rice, vegetables, fruit, roads and other
infrastructure, according to the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry. ("Gov't estimates massive typhoon-caused farm
damage,"  Japan Economic Newswire, 6 September 1993).<P>

In Charleville, in the central west of the State, the drought
follows the worst flood in living memory.  In 1990, massive rains

With this could come significant forest loss, and amplification
of warming. Earlier models had suggested greater transpiration by
trees as temperatures rose, generating more cloud cover over
forests. But new studies as part of the UK government's
Terrestrial Initiative in Global Environmental Research, using
modifications of the UK Meterological Office's climate
simulations, suggest that trees will retain moisture, drying out
rainforest regions.<P>

<H3><B>AUSTRALIAN EXPERTS WARN OF SEVERE CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH
</B></H3>
IMPLICATIONS.<P>

Public health expert Professor Ewan from the University of
Wollongong suggests that those most at risk will be those already
suffering from health problems, including the populations of
developing countries, the elderly, the very young, indigenous
peoples and those whose livelihoods depend entirely on
agriculture.<P>

"Climate change will directly affect food production and food
availability, and indirectly affect social and economic
conditions...The fundamental issue to be considered when
discussing the impact of climate change on human health is the
need to meet the basic food requirements of the human
population." "The effects of climate change on the nutritional
health of populations will depend on the ability of that
population and its farming systems to adapt. Poverty, population
growth and debt burden already constrains the ability of
developing countries to take advantage in agricultural
development...Where rice is the staple crop and water management
and irrigation is poor the effects of climatic change may be
severe... Additionally warmer temperatures may increase the
incidence of pests...Since fish constitute 40  percent of all
animal protein consumed in Asia, significant disruption of the
marine ecosystem would dramatically increase protein deficiency
and malnutrition among millions of people".<P>

The report also notes that climate change induced drought may
lead to malnutrition and under-nutrition, placing countries
already identified as being "food unstable", such as India and
African states, in a particularly vulnerable position. Droughts
may also accelerate desertification leading to low crop yields,
poverty, loss of livelihood, diseases from unsanitary and
overcrowded environments, famine, and inadequate vitamin intake
leading to goitre, scurvy, respiratory infection, immune system
suppression and blindness. Food deprivation may also lead to
anti-social behaviour, violence and apathy.<P>

According to the authors, "Long- term climate changes will...pose
a significant challenge to water-borne disease control world-wide
and is potentially devastating in those regions whose water
resources are already subject to pollution and frequent
flooding".<P>

They also warn: "Conditions conducive to endemic cholera could
become more widespread if predicted global climatic changes
eventuate...It is clear that the pandemic will not subside unless
natural and human environments of contaminated areas are
improved. Obviously climatic changes will seriously affect
cholera distribution, and health professionals must be prepared
to react." And the range and distribution of insect-borne disease
will also change and may invade regions presently free of them as
climatic changes increase vector survival and disease
reproduction. In Australia, the population may be threatened by
an increasing incidence of Australian encephalitis, epidemic
polyarthris (polyarthritis?), dengue and malaria.<P>

So concludes Business Week, in an article on growing catastrophe
losses. The article analyses the growing belief of insurers in
Lloyd's, Swiss Re, and Munich Re that, as one Lloyd's source puts
it, they should "work on the assumption that the future will be
rougher." The article concludes as follows: "Some insurers
express frustration at the run of events. 'We're not
meteorologists, we're underwriters,' says Travellers' Hammond.
Nevertheless, now more than ever, the industry seems to be at the
mercy of Mother Nature." <P>

<H3><B>WEATHER-RELATED DISASTERS HAVE KILLED 1,600 CHINESE SO FAR
IN 1993. </B></H3> <P>

The Civil Affairs Ministry estimates that a "rarely seen" period
of climate disasters has caused 33.2 billion yuan ($ 5.8 billion)
of damage, injured over 51,000 people  and destroyed 3.1 million
hectares of crops.<P>

Summer flooding which began in June has claimed 463 lives, the
worst sandstorm in 40 years killed over 70 in May and drought in
the north and northeast has hammered six of China's most
important grain producing provinces. According to a department
official, "China has experienced a rarely seen period of disaster
over the last six months featuring various types of calamities,
large stricken-areas and worse damage than that in the
corresponding period of 1992." <P>

The disasters continue; record rainfall in western China's
Guangxi Zhuang region has flooded nearly 65,000 hectares of
farmland and killed 32. The floods that have destroyed thousands
of hectares of crops contrast the drought conditions being
experienced in the northwest of the country. Shandong province
was hit by serous flooding in early August. The floods led to the
evacuation of 2.1 million people, caused 1.1 billion yuan (HK$
1.34 billion) in crop damage and spread intestinal and stomach
disease. <P>

area, Roman holidaymakers flee by sea from "terrifying walls of

destroyed in Italy by fires, a European record. This year looks
like being twice as bad.<P>

British Petroleum publishes a full page ad which includes the
following startling statement: "1993 North slope temperatures
have been about 9 degrees (F) above the historical average. Gas
compressor turbines used in the oil production process operate
less efficiently at higher temperatures, and this has resulted in
an average daily production loss of 6,000 barrels at Prudhoe Bay.

Mid-summer production at Prudhoe is about 100,000 barrels per day
lower than mid-winter due to warmer temperatures." <P>

<H3><B>FOREST EXPERT WARNS THAT BOREAL FOREST CARBON SINK IS
DIMINISHING FAST. </B></H3> <P>

Dr Norman Myers observes that as much as 400 billion tons of
carbon could be sequestered in the 4.3 million square miles
(three Europes) of boreal forest, and these are being logged and
burnt apace. Some 70 percent of these forests are in Siberia,
where logging has reached 15,500 square miles per year, and where
some 4,000 square miles are being eliminated in forest fires each
year. "While most forest fires are being caused by humans, they
may well be overtaken by wildfires as global warming begins to
bite."<P>

Dr Valdislav Alexeyev of the Russian Academy of Sciences
estimates that as much as 10 percent of anthropogenic carbon
dioxide emissions are absorbed in Siberia's forests each year.
That sink is disappearing fast.<P>

<H3><B>1993 SUMMARY </B></H3><P>

1993 sixth to ninth hottest, and the hottest eight since records
began 140 years ago have all now been since 1980. The UK
Meteorological Office, giving the figures to the press, notes
that the cooling effect of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is now
weakening. ("Last year was hot stuff globally although a washout
in the Britain, says Met Office," The Guardian, 3 January 1993).
The global mean temperature for 1993 was 0.22 oC higher than the
average for the period 1951-80. (1992 was 0.18 oC above that
average.) Head Meteorologist David Parker says that the
anthropogenic greenhouse effect is a "very likely" explanation
for recent years' global warming, although it still  cannot be
regarded as proven that man's discharge of CO2 and other 
greenhouse gases are the cause. ("The planet gets hotter and
hotter," Information [Denmark], 28 January 1994).  <P>

     1993 was a very bad year for disasters, especially flooding.
Natural catastrophes in 1993 cost $50 billion in economic losses
worldwide, compared to the record of $62.5 billion in 1992.
Floods accounted for 63% of these losses worldwide, and
windstorms 31%. Insured losses were $10 billion in 1993 compared
to the record of $24.4 in 1992. Floods accounted for 27% of the
insured losses, and windstorms 60%. The seven biggest disasters
requiring national or international or supra-regional aid
together cost $23, of which only $6 billion was insured - a much
smaller proportion than recent years because heavy flooding was
prominent in the list of catastrophes. ("Insurers lucky in year
of disasters," Lloyd's List, 3 March 1994; "Munich and Allianz
plan for catastrophes," Lloyd's List 8 March 1994).<P>


        THE TEN BIGGEST NATURAL DISASTERS OF 1993 IN
        TERMS OF INSURED SUMS<P>

("Munich and Allianz plan for catastrophes", Lloyd's List, 8
March 1994)<P>

     The period 1991-93 has been the driest this century for much
of central and southern Spain. From March 1992, 800,000
inhabitants in Cadiz province, including big cities, suffered
cuts in domestic water supply for 10 hours a day; for them 1993
was the worst water-shortage year in the last 50 years;
irrigation lands had no water unless exceptions for tree
protection.<P>

     For the 6 first months of 1993, Seville inhabitants drank
11,000 million pesetas (almost $80 million) in bottled water.
Agriculture losses because of lack of water added up to more than
$400 million. The Castilla-La Mancha area by the Guadiana river
basin is entering its 3rd year in a row in which it has been
impossible to irrigate; in Ciudad Real, water supply restrictions
will go on.<P>

     1992 was the worst year in the history of Segura river's 
basin (South East Spain): its dams were at 9% of their capacity
in 1992, and in 1993 stayed at 8.8%; this basin currently has the
most negative global imbalance (350 Hm3/year); this basin's
internal resources are exhausted; in 1993, 10,000 hectares in
this basin couldn't be irrigated, and 400,000 tons of green
products were lost. (Revista del MOPT, January 1994).<P>

     Antonio Labajo, assistant director of the National
Meteorological Institute, says  Spain will receive less rain,
hotter summers and more desertification  in the coming decades
because of global warming.  Water reserves in  1993 reached a
record historical minimum, with dams in many regions at less than
20 percent capacity.  Agriculture is already severely affected -
with more than half the harvest being lost in some regions. (La
Vanguardia, 6 February 1994, El Pais, 21 March 1993, El Pais, 24
June 1993, La Voz de Galicia, 21 March 1993, La Voz de Galicia,
24 August 1993).<P>

     Drought also assails Greece during 1993. There was 
persistent country-wide  drought or several months. In the 
Athens  area,  where there is a shortage of water, it didn't rain
for more than five consecutive months which is a record for at
least the last 75  years. Water reserves in the Athens area have
fallen to the lowest levels ever. After this severe drought there
were heavy  rains  which led to floods in the city of Athens, the
worst in the city's history. The precipitation trends during the
last forty years show a 10-30 percent decrease around the
country. (G. T. Amanatidis et al,  "The spatial distribution  of 
precipitation trends in Greece," [in Greek], and  Amanatidis  et 
al,  1993, "Decreasing precipitation trend in  the  Marathon 
area, Greece,"  International Journal of Climatology, v. 13, 
191-201).   <P>

     Exceptional warmth in Alaskan winter. Warm early winter
temperatures delayed the  freeze-up of the Yukon and Kuskokwim
rivers preventing safe travel by the usual modes of snow machine
or dog sled.  The  slow freeze-up was followed by an
exceptionally early spring break-up and sunny summer. 1993 saw
the second latest freeze-up on the Kuskokwim River since
recording began 34 years ago.  The average temperature in
Anchorage between November 1 and December 26 this year was more
than 3oC (6F) above normal.  In the Alaskan Arctic, temperatures
have been about 1.66oC (3F) above average during most of 1993 and
more than 5oC (9.6F)  above average in October. ("Chukchi Sea's
Drifting Pack Ice Perplexes Experts," Anchorage Daily News, 9
January 1994; "Alaska Basks in Warmth," Anchorage Daily News, 28
December 1993).   <P>

     Record crop losses in Japan after a cold, wet summer summer
and a series of typhoons. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and fisheries reports crop damage estimated at $11 billion
through to November, the worst total since the Ministry began
taking statistics in 1954. (The Journal of Commerce, 5 November
1993).<P>

     The El Nino which began in 1991 continued through 1993. It
has brought lots of rain to central South America, northern
Mexico, and western Gulf states of the US, including the Midwest,
while southeastern Africa, the Philippines and  northern
Australia have suffered severe drought.  New Zealand authorities
report that 1993 was the third coldest year in 50 years,
temperatures being below average in eight months. They blame the
El Nino southern oscillation and volcanic ash from Mt Pinatubo.
1993 was also an exceptionally dry year for most northern areas. 
Record low rainfall (about half average) occurred in the Bay of
Plenty, the driest since records began in 1898.  (National
Climate Summary, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research, 10 January 1994).<P>

     Eastern Australia has become progressively hotter and drier
in recent years. Average temperatures in 1993 were 0.65 oC above
the average and drought conditions dominating New South Wales and
southwestern Queensland for the last ten years. Bill Kininmonth,
head of the National Climate Centre, said the trend became
apparent in the mid-1950s and had strengthened since the late
1970s. Bureau of Meteorology figures show that Australia's 11
warmest years have occurred since 1979. The warming is consistent
with predicted global warming and Mr Kininmonth cited increased
concentrations of carbon dioxide as one possible cause for the
increase. <P>

New South Wales and Queensland farmers have particularly felt the
impact of the changing climate. "There has been a change in
seasonal conditions in the last decade, causing a severe drought
in NSW and southwestern Queensland," said  National Farmers
Federation executive director Rick Farley said. "Before that
period, there was a more consistent weather pattern, but since
then everything has been disrupted for some reason.<P>

Thousands of farming families have been forced from the land by
such conditions." New South Wales Deputy Health Officer, Dr Gavin
Frost, also warned about the possibility of malaria spreading
south if the warm weather continued, "If northern Queensland
remained warm over a long enough period, then the disease would
have time to breed and be carried by mosquitoes - possibly
further south." <P>

February 1994; "Yes, it really is getting warmer", The Sydney
Morning Herald, 17 February 1994).<P>

<H3><B>HIGH ECONOMIC COST FOR IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN
GREECE. </B></H3> <P>

A University of Athens study attempts for the first time to
evaluate the cost of climatic changes in Greece in the case of
carbon dioxide doubling. Although the report is not in any sense 
exhaustive concerning the possible impacts of climate change,  it

gives the following interesting preliminary estimates:<P>

     *     a  36 percent decrease  of  agricultural  output. This
could  cost  Greek  agriculture $2.35-3.93 billion per year (base
year: 1990).<P>

     *     a cost for ameliorating the impacts of a sea-level
rise of  1m for the next 50-100 years of some $3.56 billion, or 
an equivalent of $35.6-71.2 million per year. <P>

     *     an expected death poll of almost 400 per year.
Assigning a price  to  human  life, the economic cost could be
viewed as  some $238-1,936 million per  year.<P>

     *     a minimum cost for the preservation of biodiversity 
at risk from climatic change of some $8.4  million per year
(although the authors mention that the real cost  is much
higher).<P>

Adding the above, including placing a value on human life, the
total economic cost for Greece is estimated to be $2.64 - 5.95 
billion per year.<P>

<TITLE>WARMING TO CAUSE 150 MILLION ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES BY
2050.</TITLE> </HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>WARMING TO CAUSE 150 MILLION ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES BY
2050. </B></H3> <P>

Dr Norman Myers, a visiting fellow at Oxford University suggests
that sea level rise and agricultural distribution caused by
climate changes may displace millions of people in developing
countries. His potentially conservative estimate of 150 million
refugees equates to 1.5 percent of 2050's  predicted global
population of 10 billion. This compares to the  estimated current
10 million environmental refugees or 0.2 percent of current
global population.  <P>

Myers concludes, "The consequences of large numbers of
environmental refugees would be among the most significant of all
upheavals entrained by global warming."  <P>


       <H4>TOTAL ENVIRONMENT REFUGEES FORSEEN</H4><P>

(N. Myers, BioScience, v. 43 (11), December 1993)<P>

In China, sea level rise coupled with local subsidence would
flood all of Shanghai and around 96 percent of the surrounding
province. The Chinese government calculates that 30 million
people may be displaced due global warming impacts. This is
considered a highly conservative estimate and alternative
calculations put the figure around 72 million.<P>

Myers estimates that 142 million people may inhabit coastal India
in 2050 and suggests,"...it seems appropriate to propose that
India's total of flood zone refugees alone could be anywhere
between 20 million and 60 million, with 30 million taken here as
a conservative working figure".<P>

Seven percent of Bangladesh could be permanently lost to sea
level rise coupled with land subsistence. Even if massive
engineering works were undertaken (long term costs are estimated
to be US$10 billion for a country with a present day GNP of US$24
billion), an estimated 15 million people would be displaced.
Problems may also be exacerbated by inland flooding; in September
1988 river flooding left three quarters of the country inundated
and 50 million people left homeless. Global warming may increase
river flow by at least a half again during the monsoons and
melting Himalayan glaciers may increase flooding further. Many
experts believe inland flooding may by a greater danger to
Bangladesh than coastal flooding. <P>

According to the latest detailed analysis, Egypt would lose
between 12 and 15 percent of its arable land. Given Egypt's
predicted population for 2050 it is realistic to anticipate that
sea level rise may displace more than 14 million people. Myers
cautions, "This prognosis, moreover, is cautious and
conservative. There would be additional problems, such as
intrusion of saltwater up the foreshortened Nile, that would
further reduce the irrigated lands supporting virtually the whole
of Egypt's agriculture". Egypt already imports well over half its
food. <P>

Other delta areas at risk include Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan,
Mozambique, Gambia, Senegal, and Suriname. A number of island
states are also at risk, such as the Maldives, Kiribati, Tuvalu,
the Marshalls plus dozens of states in the Caribbean. Around 1
million people are likely to have to evacuate permanently and as
many as 46 to 50 million may find their lives "critically
affected". <P>

Detailed analysis of the impact of climate change on agriculture
suggests that by the year 2060 global warming may decrease cereal
production in developing countries by 9-11 percent. Africa may be
particularly vulnerable to agricultural disruption caused by
global warming. <P>

Myers estimates that 50 million people globally may be displaced
due to climate change-induced famine. He also cites another
estimate that predicts that the figure may exceed 50 million in
Africa alone. Myers also warns that sea level rise and
agricultural disruption will not the only causes of human
migration. Severe water problems may affect three billion people
globally by 2015 and this would encourage mass migrations;
deforestation, soil erosion and desertification may also lead to
large movements of people.<P>

(N. Myers, "Environmental Refugees in a Globally Warmed World",
BioScience, v.43 (11), December 1993.)<P>

NOTES: Environmental refugees have significant economic, socio-
cultural and political consequences. Currently, developed nations
pay US$8 billion each year to accommodate refugees, one seventh
of the foreign aid supplied to developing countries. To quote a
former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Saddrudhin Aga
Khan,<P>

"People flee their homes in search of food and jobs...as the
victims move, they carry their famine with them, much as they
carry an infectious disease. They impose intolerable burdens in
terms of food requirements on the territory they enter. At the
same time, they flood the labour market, creating a slump in
wages, and endangering the economic security of the local
population. Fuse the two elements, and you have a perfect recipe
for widespread human suffering, social disorder and political
instability". <P>

Myers suggests that political tensions over land claims may lead
to significant political insecurity and possibly war.<P>

<H3><B>CLIMATE CHANGE WILL ACT SYNERGISTICALLY TO DAMAGE HUMAN
HEALTH. </B></H3> <P>

This, according to a new book, it will do either directly by
causing or enhancing disease patterns, or indirectly by affecting
food supplies.<P>

"The human species faces a new threat to its health _ perhaps to
its survival.  Our burgeoning numbers, technology and consumption
are overloading Earth's capacity to absorb, replenish and repair.

These global environmental problems pose health risks, not just
from localised pollution, but from damaged life-support systems.
Might we, too, become an 'endangered species'? ....The risks of
skin cancer and cataracts from ozone destruction are evidence
enough; likewise the health hazards from greenhouse-related
heatwaves and hurricanes. <P>

More insidious, though, may be the indirect health consequences
of climate change on food production and the spread of
infections; likewise, immune suppression by ultraviolet
radiation, erosion of overworked soils, depletion of freshwater,
and loss of genetic and biological resources for producing food
and medicines.   Rapid urban growth poses other health hazards. 
Population health cannot be sustained without intact
ecosystems."<P>

The main problem with global warming is not that the weather will
gradually get nice and warm allowing everyone to adapt happily,
but that there will be sudden and severe rises and falls of
temperatures (heat waves and freezes). It is well known that the
first couple of days of a heat wave is a "killer", and so, if
there will be more and more sudden heat waves, there will be an
increasing number of casualties. Heat waves are also known to
increase the rate of violent crime.<P>

Other heat-related problems that may occur if global warming
continues include increases in fungal skin diseases and yeast
diseases (like candidiasis) due to increases in humidity. <P>

Warmer temperatures may induce some people to dispense with
heavy, hot protective clothing, as well as affecting judgment of
safety. It is estimated that the levels of industrial accidents
will increase with global warming. <P>

Although it is argued that warmer winters will reduce the death
rate among the elderly from hypothermia, it should be remembered
that the highest death rate for people below 45 occurs in
summer.<P>

Various insects (mosquitos, ticks, snails, etc), bacteria and
viruses thrive in warm and humid conditions.  An increase of
these conditions on earth will mean an increase in the diseases
they carry.  WHO suggest that malaria is highly likely to
increase with global warming; schistosomiasis (bilharzia) and
dengue are very likely to increase; and lymphatic filariases
(elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness), African
trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), yellow fever, Japanese
encephalitis and other arboviral diseases are likely to increase.

Incidence of all these are strongly correlated with temperature.
<P>

There is concern that malaria in particular might spread to
England, Australia, America and parts of Europe, which had
malaria in the past.  Since these populations will have lost
their immunity to it, this could be devastating.<P>

Bilharzia is carried by water snails, and in Egypt they tend to
infect less during the colder months of January, February and
March.  It is thought that if temperatures rise, the snails might
be able to carry the disease all year, and increase the rate of
infection. Global warming will affect rainfall, and therefore the
distribution of surface water and flood patterns.  This will
reduce the hygiene of drinking water in many areas, and diseases
like diarrhoea, cholera and dysentery might spread.  Many of
these diseases are dependent on temperature.  Sea level rise will
also cause problems for sewage disposal. <P>

<H3><B>WARM ALASKAN WEATHER THREATENS RIVER-ICE TRAVEL.
</B></H3><P>

Above- average winter temperatures, following a long sunny summer
and early ice break-up  has led to behind-schedule river freeze-
ups and made travelling on Alaska's Interior rivers and lakes
much more dangerous than usual. Several trappers have fallen
through hollow ice. The Ruskokwim River at McGrath did not freeze
up until November 20th, the second-latest date in 30 years of
record-keeping. <P>

The National Weather Service attributes the warm weather to an
abnormal flow of warm air moving north from California, known as
the Pacific North American pattern. (The warm summer was ascribed
to a rare recurrence of El Nino, a regional pattern which
periodically warms the Pacific Ocean.)  Simultaneously, the warm
air pattern is bringing very cold weather to the East Coast.<P>

Churchill's "no surrender" policy, in the wake of the 1953

LOBBY. </B></H3> <P>

The chief executive of the Insurance Council of New Zealand
explains that such is the international nature of the insurance
industry that recent huge weather-related insurance losses in
Europe are driving up earthquake insurance cover in New Zealand.
He says:<P>

"It is in the interest of the business community to ensure that
the global environment remains in a balance that avoids the kind
of catastrophic climatic losses that have been experienced in
recent years. This will require business becoming much more aware
of issues involved with global warming and actively lobbying
governments for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions." <P>

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>WORST FLOODING IN 60-100 YEARS ACROSS NORTHERN EUROPE.
</B></H3><P>

Worst floods in 100 years affect 100,000 in Cologne. Worst floods
in 60 years leave French insurers with a bill of over $500
million. Worst floods in 60 years force evacuation of hospital
patients in southern Belgium. Scores of riverside towns and
cities are affected by flooding in Germany, France and Belgium.
In the Netherlands, the military is called in as a state of
emergency is declared. <P>

Flooding is severe throughout the Rhineland, and in other regions
of Germany. In Cologne, five die as the Rhine floods the medieval
city, and many spend Christmas in army barracks and hotels.
10,000 litres of heating oil leak into the floodwaters. <P>

In France, several hundred are evacuated as the Oise, Meuse, and
Moselle burst their banks in flooding described by officials as
the worst of the century. In Belgium, the town of Dinant is cut
off by the river Meuse. Seven die and 4,000 Dutch residents are
evacuated as 170 square km of Dutch territory is inundated. <P>

Estimates for insurance damage from the floods in northern and
eastern France already exceed FFr2 billion (almost $350 million).
The Paris-based Centre for Insurance and Documentation says it
does not exclude a final tally of FFr3 billion. In Germany,
insurance losses are not high (around Dm1 billion) because only a
small percentage of private buildings are insured against
flooding. In the Netherlands, insurance cover for flooding is
almost impossible to get in the lowlands. Charities launch a
Christmas appeal for victims.<P>

("Flooding may cost FFr2bn," Lloyd's List, 28 December
1993;Reuter reports 21 and 28 December 1993).<P>

NOTES: In France, this comes at the end of an already
particularly bad year for natural catastrophe claims. Floods in
the Camargue and Corsica this autumn have already generated
claims of approaching $350 million. ("Flooding may cost FFr2bn,"
Lloyd's List, 28 December 1993).<P>

Total natural disaster claims are expected to be $726-743
million. This should not prove problematic, at least for this
year, because under a 1982 law insurance companies have been
required to put aside a reserve for natural catastrophe claims.
Insurers can draw on a central fund created in this way, to make
up shortfalls between premium income and claims, so protecting
balance sheets. ("French reserves will meet flood costs," Lloyd's
List, 21 December 1993).<P>

<H3><B>AUTUMN STORMS TAKE "HUGE BITES" OUT OF BEACHES AS SOUTH
FLORIDA BEGINS TO RUN OUT OF SAND. </B></H3> <P>

The Economist describes the situation as follows: <P>

"As a professional golfer, Greg Norman knows something about
getting out of sand. What is exercising him now is how to stay in
it. Mr Norman's property, like that of other ocean-front dwellers
in south Florida, has been battered in recent weeks by a
succession of autumn storms that have taken huge bites out of the
region's sandy beaches. He called in work crews to fortify his
house on Jupiter island, about 75 miles north of Miami. Some of
his neighbours were slower to act. The ocean sucked sand under
concrete supports, causing a number of houses, condominiums, and
hotels to collapse. Now for the bad news. In the past, Floridians
coped with this sort of thing by dredging up offshore sand and
pumping it on to the beaches. What nature took away, man
restored. But nature may be having the last laugh, South Florida
is running out of sand. In a state whose economy needs tourists,
and lures the tourists with beaches, this is the equivalent of
Colorado losing its mountains."<P>

("The sands run out," The Economist, 18 December 1993).<P>

NOTES: In Florida's natural state, currents running counter to
the Gulf Stream normally wash sand south along the coast,
renewing beaches naturally eroded by storms. Given all the
development of recent times, this movement of sediment is now
impossibly impeded. Sea-level rise adds to the problem, of
course, as would any increase in the intensity of storm
activity.<P>

In the early 1980s, Miami spent $16m replenishing dwindling
beaches with sand dredged from offshore. With those beaches now
reduced to a vestige, a new replenishment project was planned for
1994. The engineers involved found that there is preciously
little offshore sand left, and they are thinking of trying to
ship sand from the Bahamas. As The Economist puts it, "by the end
of this decade, south Florida could confront the unthinkable: a
beachless future."<P>

<H3><B>NEW YORK FACES WATER CRISIS, TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE.
</B></H3><P>

A "severe" drought is declared along the New York Coast by the
NOAA and large sections of the Carolina's are on the brink of
being declared drought disasters. New York DEP Commissioner, Al
Appleton, says that the appreciable decline in rainfall since
1980 parallels closely what has been predicted by the climate
models based on a global warming scenarios.<P>

Appleton also envisages worse to come in the future. Independent
analysis shows that between 40 and 50 degree N latitudes in North
America, rainfall may drop 40 percent. Appleton warns that,
"under the global warming model the worst year would become the
average" and the economic implications of this would be felt
throughout the city. "A drought emergency costs us money, hits
small business like landscapers, food processors, laundries,
anyone dependent on water cooling because nonresidential water
use gets cut by between 15 to 25 percent," says Appleton. <P>

Swiss scientist, Wilfried Haeberli, professes that the retreat of
glaciers and the warming of the tundra's permafrost gives a clear
signal that the climate is changing: "Glacier and permafrost
signals of the twentieth century warming are coherent: warming of
polar firn and permafrost is pronounced and mass loss/retreat of
mountain glaciers is striking all over the world." <P>

warming,"  Annals of Glaciology, v. 14, 1990).<P>

<H3><B>DIRE IMPLICATIONS OF ENHANCING GREENHOUSE EFFECT OVER VERY
LONG TERM. </B></H3> <P>

NOAA's modelling group shows that doubling and quadrupling
atmospheric carbon dioxide involves serious impacts for humankind
extending over half a millennium and beyond. <P>

Climate modelling exercises tend to assess the effects of
increased carbon dioxide on climate over the next few decades,
and to pay very little attention to the longer term. Manabe and
Stouffer, of NOAA's Princeton modelling group, now attempt to
predict what will happen to the earth's climate over the next
several hundred years, assuming that carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere either double or quadruple. <P>

Their models (a coupled atmosphere- ocean model) estimate that
over the next 500 years, the temperature will rise by 3.5 oC and
sea levels will rise by a metre (if carbon dioxide doubles) and
by 7oC and two metres (if it quadruples). Sea level rise might be
greater than this because only the thermal expansion is included,
and ice sheet melting might make these estimates too low. If
carbon dioxide levels quadruple, profound changes will occur in
the oceans, since they will settle into a "new stable system"
(i.e. a permanent state that will be different from now) and it
is possible that these changes will prevent ventilation of the
deep ocean (and therefore will affect the carbon cycle and the
way that the atmosphere and the oceans interact with each
other).<P>

atmospheric CO2 on the ocean-atmosphere system," Nature, 364

CHAOS FOR THE UK. </B></H3> <P>

The research on ice cores in Greenland, according to a report by
the ESF (including scientists from the British Antarctic Survey),
suggests that temperatures can be expected to veer back and forth
"from tropical to Arctic."  Although previous research has
indicated that increased storms and rising sea levels will result
from global warming, this sea-sawing of temperatures over a short
period is a new prediction.  Dr Eric Wolff at BAS professes that
a gradual warming would have allowed humans to adapt, but that
"sudden and apparently random shifts in both directions would be
extremely hard to deal with."<P>

<H3><B>SOUTH AUSTRALIA HEAT CAUSES A PLAGUE OF MICE. </B></H3><P>

Mild conditions and excellent grain harvests have combined to
provide exceptional breeding conditions for mice. 100,000
hectares of pasture land have already been devastated in South
Australia, causing an estimated Aus$20 million damage. These same
areas were hit earlier this year by plagues of snails and
locusts. In the worst hit areas 175 mice per square metre have
been reported, compared with the more normal 4 per hectare. <P>

("Grain growers threatened by mice," The Sydney Morning Herald,
10 May 1993; "Mice multiply as States argue", The Sydney Morning
Herald, 14 July 1993).<P>

NOTES: Warm weather has contributed to other rodent plagues in
Australia in recent years. In 1987, Cowra, New South Wales, was
struck by  a mice infestation which caused Aus$1.2 million damage
to grain harvests, while a prime wheat growing area, Darling
Downs, Queensland,  lost 30 percent of the summer crop to mice in
1989. By May 1989, farmers had lost Aus$10 million worth of
sorghum, soya beans and sunflower seeds, and more than Aus$80
million may be lost in wheat exports. ("Mice chewing into $80m
wheat crop", The Sydney Morning Herald, 12 May 1989).<P>

<TITLE>NEW ICE CORE RESULTS SHOW ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGES WHEN

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>NEW ICE CORE RESULTS SHOW ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGES WHEN
WORLD IS WARMER. </B></H3> <P>

The latest studies of the Greenland ice cores show that when the
world was last as warm as the IPCC predicts it will be early in
the next century, the climate was subject to catastrophic changes
within just years. <P>

Such abrupt switches in climate, researchers argue, must come in
response to changes in ocean circulation. Superimposing on this
natural capacity for variance, unnatural forcing factors, such as
the heat-trapping abilities of greenhouse gases, therefore
clearly invites compound disaster. As one commentator put it, in
the prestigious science journal Nature, "if the Earth had an
operating manual, the chapter on climate might begin with a
caveat that the system has been adjusted at the factory for
optimum comfort, so don't touch the dials."<P>

The earth has enjoyed a rather steady climate over the last
10,000 years in the current interglacial, and the Ice Age before
that lasted about 100,000 years. During the transitional period,
when the Ice Age transformed into the interglacial period, there
is evidence that the climate fluctuated quite radically, but this
has been generally attributed to the fact that massive glaciers
and enormous volumes of sea ice were moving around. <P>

The Greenland Ice-core Project (GRIP) team "have removed this
sense of security." Their evidence suggests that "very rapid
shifts in temperature and greenhouse gases are also possible in
interglacial periods."  Between 2,780 and 2,870 cm down the first
core, the Eemian interglacial can be found. This period is
somewhat blurred in the Vostok core (Antarctica), but is very
clear in the Greenland cores. The Holocene has only had one
climate state, but it appears that the Eemian had three _ one
like the one we have now, one warmer and one colder. <P>

It appears also that a shift from one climate state to another
took very little time, perhaps less than ten years. The states
themselves seem to have been stable, lasting sometimes for tens
of years, sometimes for hundreds.  "We don't know which is the
norm for interglacial periods: the stable, one-state Holocene or
the multiple-state, rapidly changing Eemian." <P>

The second Greenland ice core ("GISP2") indicates that the
climate system can change from glacial to interglacial over a few
years. The new ice-core results also show that rapid climate
change does not just happen as an interglacial changes into a
glacial, but can happen quite happily within interglacials. It
could happen to us. Since we now have an enormous human
population to feed, such an abrupt change could be catastrophic,
and will need an immediate response. <P>

The GRIP team's research suggests that the stable Holocene
climate has been fairly unusual, and the norm is rather large
climate changes.<P>

during the last interglacial period recorded in the GRIP ice
core," Nature, v. 364, p. 203 - 207, 15 July 1993; review by J.
W. C. White, "Don't touch that dial," Nature ,v. 364, p. 186, 15

<TITLE>TYPHOON MIREILLE'S CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>TYPHOON MIREILLE'S CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO
GLOBAL WARMING. </B></H3> <P>

"The fact is that in recent years natural disasters whose return
period used to be regarded as at least 100 years have transpired
every year in various places in the world. It seems difficult to
believe that these incidents are merely accidental. It would be
sensible to say that, whatever the reason may be, natural
disasters are undergoing qualitative changes."  Shiro Horichi,
Executive Vice President Tokio Marine and Fire<P>

So an Executive Vice President of Tokio Marine and Fire tells the
International Insurance Society. The growing numbers of
catastrophes are not likely to be coincidence, he concludes, and
global warming will mean worse to come.<P>

Mr Shiro Horichi offers the view that "I understand all too well
that data provided by a single typhoon are inconclusive, but I
think it is possible to say that the above mentioned
meteorological features (see entry in September 1991) are closely
associated with global warming... More specifically, it is
possible that the increased temperature of the sea surface, a
result of global warming, facilitates evaporation activities
which can supply typhoons with a greater amount of steam. This
means that the entire force of the typhoon is augmented, keeping
its central pressure lower. Moreover, even when the typhoon moves
north, it is not weakened as much as usual because the increased
temperature of the seas neighbouring Japan keeps the typhoon
strong. The fact that high pressure over the Pacific ocean covers
such large areas is also considered to be related to global
warming." On the more general apparent increase in catastrophes,
Horichi doubts that coincidence is at work. A Tokio Marine and
Fire press release covering the speech concludes that "the global
climate changes which are considered by many to be the cause of
the recent onslaught of natural disasters are expected to
continue. ...The amount paid out by the non-life insurance
industry all over the world for wind and flood risks is expected
to rise."<P>

The final paragraph of Horichi's paper concludes that action is
needed: "I believe that a single non-life insurance company or
the non-life insurance industry of a single country can no longer
solve the problems we face in handling natural disaster risks.
After all, dealing with natural disasters is indeed a global
issue, as long as it can be assumed that worldwide environmental
changes have something to do with natural disasters. .... I
would, therefore, like to suggest that through international fora
like this IIS meeting, the non-life insurance industry worldwide
promote opportunities where we can share information such as
studies in global warming, natural disasters, and the
relationship between the two, thereby upgrading the non-life
insurance industry throughout the world."<P>

(S. Horichi, "Natural disasters and changing environment: can the
industry prepare?" Paper presented to the International Insurance
Society's 1993 Seminar, Tokyo, 13 July 1993; Tokio Marine and
Fire, Press Release, 13 July 1993).<P>

The floods on the Mississippi and its tributaries have by mid
July killed 17, and forced thousands from their homes. A quarter
of a million are without freshwater in Des Moines, Iowa, alone.
Vice President Gore promises federal aid even if it adds to the
budget deficit. The Agriculture Secretary says losses to crops
alone now top $1 billion. There is at least a further billion
dollars in damage to homes and businesses. And more rain is
forecast. (Reuter, 12 July 1993).<P>

"This disaster is getting worse by the hour," says Illinois
Governor Jim Edgar. ("Flooding disaster worsens in water-wracked
Midwest," San Francisco Chronicle, 14 July 1993).<P>

On the 14th July, President Clinton asks Congress for $2.5
billion emergency aid. Touring the area for the second time, he
says "I've never seen anything on this scale before."
("'Biblical' floods threaten the Midwest," The Independent, 15
July 1993).<P>

 At least 20 million acres of America's most fertile farmland are
affected. The floods cover nearly 17,000 square miles, compared
with 12,700 during the previous worst flood in 1937. ("Troops and
more cash pledged by Clinton," Times 19 July 1993).<P>

<H3><B>COULD GLOBAL WARMING CAUSE WAR OVER WATER SUPPLIES?
</B></H3><P>

According to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, The next
war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics.'
<P>

"But the water crisis is becoming dangerous in other parts of the
world too," writes the Observer's Geoffrey Lean in a long essay,
"as more and more governments begin to worry about the
vulnerability of their water supplies. Water's potential as a
source of conflict affects us all, and it is time that we woke up
to the dangers."<P>

The article goes on to review the world's river systems, noting
those that have been seriously polluted, and can no longer be
used for water supplies (especially in the former Soviet Union),
and those that have dams (108 of Japan's 109 major rivers have
dams, and the last is about to get one).  On average, work on 170
dams over the world is started every year, although all the best
sites have already been used.  "Global warming is likely to make
things much worse.  As the earth heats up and the climate
changes, the pattern of rainfall will change unpredictably.  Dry
areas will become wet, wet ones dry, and farmers and engineers
will be hard pressed to adapt.  Power relationships will change
even more abruptly, and the potential for conflict will grow."
<P>

The article notes the floods in Bangladesh of 1985, 1986, 1989
and 1991 (that, as well as deaths from drowning, cause thousands
of deaths from water-borne diseases, especially simple diarrhoea-

the American government to suck water from Nevada's countryside
to pump to Las Vegas.<P>

Conflict almost erupted over water in 1975, when Turkey drained
the Euphrates to fill a newly completed dam, and a bit further
downriver, Syria dammed the river to fill a reservoir of its own.
Thus only a fifth of the usual river water reached Iraq.  Baghdad
mobilised troops and threatened to bomb Syria, and Syria said it
was Turkey's fault.  The situation was defused by Saudi Arabia
who suggested that Syria should allow a "goodwill" release of
water to Iraq.  Since then, Turkey has built the Ataturk Dam, and
the Turkish and Syrian governments are already in conflict over
it. <P>

AND THE WARMEST IN OVER 20 YEARS. </B></H3> <P>

The national average temperature of 9.7 oC was 1.6 oC above
average, according to the National Institute of Water and
Atmospheric Research (NIWAR). The mild weather is being caused by
a dominant north-westerly/westerly wind pattern. It is noticeably
warmer this year after two years of below-average temperatures
blamed by NZ meteorologists on volcanic dust from Mount Pinatubo
and the current extended El Nino event. Wellington is an average
of 1.5 C above average - but also receives 60 percent more
rainfall than the June average. Meanwhile, other regions recorded
30 percent less rain than the June average.<P>

<H3><B>DROUGHT AND INUNDATION IN MEXICO. </B></H3><P>

Serious drought affects northern Mexico at the same time as
severe inundation afflicts the central and southern parts of the
country.  17 people are killed and more than 20 rivers overflow
when tropical storms "Arlene" and "Beatriz" dump 244 millimetres
of rain on the state of Oaxaca, and  sweep the country with wind
speeds of 55 to 75 kph.<P>

Meanwhile, drought causes forest fire, more than 5,000 cattle
deaths and devastation of the apple harvest in the states of
Sonora, Chihuahua and Durango. Sonora experiences its highest
temperatures in 25 years on June 19th - 46.2ÉC. resulting in more
than 1,700 cases of dehydration and three deaths. The high
temperatures spark fires which rage through more than 2,000
hectares.<P>

The warm weather in the north is causing severe difficulties for
apple farmers.  The cold spells essential for apple sprouting
have been absent since 1991. The crops have been devastated,
halved in Durango, forcing many farmers to leave the land. Says
one farmer, Fernando Portela, "the animals are no longer strong
enough to stand up, we need to feed them to keep them alive".  
Scuffles have broken out as farmers demand government support.<P>

John Rudd from the Canadian Freshwater Institute says significant
carbon dioxide and methane emissions from rotting vegetation
trapped during the construction phase can be expected from large
hydro dam reservoirs. In some circumstances these would release
one kg per kilowatt of electricity, rivalling emissions from an
equivalent-sized fossil-fuel plant, although emissions will
depend on the size and type of vegetation cover of the reservoir
area. Other researchers suggest that carbon emissions from
biomass would be offset after three years, assuming that large
trees are cleared prior to construction.<P>

Mild winters and drought in Hungary causes the first locust
plague in 60 years amid "biblical" scenes. The insects destroy at
least 1,000 hectares of vegetation, and cause some $190,000 worth
of damage to crops. "These are almost biblical times here," said
a western observer in Budapest. <P>

In Yemen, clouds of locusts are crossing from East Africa to feed
on crops in the southeast of the county. FAO Officials say "most
of the country [Ethiopia] from the border with Somalia and
Djibouti to the Red Sea coastal plains has been infested by dense
swarms". Insects in Tanzania have destroyed nearly 2,500 hectares
of the rice crop.<P>

A 30 year temperature record taken 12.8 metres below the ground
confirms the surface warming trend this century. Researchers from
the University of Minnesota show that soil temperatures increased
by 0.041 degrees C per year between 1963 and 1990. This is
consistent with atmospheric measurements taken from two nearby
observation stations, offering strong support for those who
profess that the heat-island effect has been screened
successfully from the terrestrial temperature records.<P>

And possibly the worst since white settlement. Over a third of
the richest agricultural land in the state is currently drought
stricken. CSIRO and the Meteorological Bureau is blaming an
absence of cyclones travelling inland these last few years. This
is apparently linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
ENSO events normally last one year; however, the current ENSO
event has just finished its second year and is threatening to
continue for a third.<P>

Queensland freshwater fisheries are threatened by the ongoing
drought, as water levels in central Queensland continue to fall.
Commercial species such as banana prawns and barramundi are
unable to breed when summer rains do not arrive to dilute saline
levels in estuarine areas.<P>

Science magazine reviews mounting evidence from Greenland ice,
ocean sediments, and ancient corals. This evidence shows that
"every few thousand years, the climate system seems to have
changed its mind about being an ice age and jerked towards warmer
times - over just a few years - only to head back into extreme
cold again. Just what flipped the climate system back and forth
between warm and cold is still a mystery. But the question has
more than historical interest, given predictions of global
warming." Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University, a
researcher on the Greenland ice cores, asks, "is there a switch
out there that humans are going to throw? It's a realm that needs
looking into."<P>

<H3><B>EL NINO CONFOUNDS SCIENTISTS. </B></H3><P>

"We didn't foresee last year's El Nino returning this spring,"
says El Nino specialist Stephen Zebiak of the Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory. Zebiak had accurately forecast the El
Ninos of 1986 and 1991. "What is happening this year is very
unusual", says Grant Bigg of the University of East Anglia's
School of Environmental Studies.<P>

An El Nino is usually over after 18 months, but according to the
US Climate Analysis Centre, the present episode began in 1990,
reached maturity during early 1992, weakened mid 1992 and began
increasing again in November 1992. "Some researchers warn that El
Nino events could become more intense with global warming," Fred
Pearce of New Scientist observes. "They appear to be triggered by
a build-up of very warm water in the western Pacific. So, it is
argued, the warmer the oceans, the greater the potential for El
Nino." <P>

("El Nino roars back against the odds," New Scientist, 8 May
1993.)<P>

NOTES: Until recently climate modellers where becoming quite
confident in their predictions of the El Nino phenomena. The
unpredictable behaviour of the recent El Nino is, to use the
words of Grant Bigg, "a setback for climate modelling." This is
a dangerous development; the impacts of El Nino are felt
throughout the globe and the ability to predict the onset of the
phenomenon in advance is crucial if officials are to plan for
adaptation.<P>

Insurance commissioners in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New

stop selling or renewing policies on property.<P>

In Florida, 36 companies are intending to stop or restrict
coverage. Those that are remaining in Florida are seeking rate
increases of 40 percent or more. The New Jersey commissioner says
that "in my view a good deal of this is knee-jerk reaction. We
will not tolerate any company turning its back on the Jersey
shore."  Louisiana and Texas state officials express concern that
an insurance crunch will make sales difficult for  a housing
industry just beginning to come out of recession.<P>

<H3><B>MUNICH RE "PLEA FOR ACTION" ON CATASTROPHES AND CLIMATE
CHANGE. </B></H3> <P>

"Action is now required first and foremost from politics and
business: the imminent change in our climate makes speedy,
radical countermeasures unavoidable." Munich Re<P>

Publishing its analysis of the 1992 catastrophe statistics,
Munich Re notes an increase in the number and severity, and calls
on governments, businesses, and insurers alike to "take immediate
action" to address the "dramatic development of natural
catastrophes." "The threatened climatic changes demand urgent and
drastic measures," the company says.<P>

Commenting on the analyses of Munich Re and Swiss Re, Lloyd's
List writes:  "the convenient theory that the increase in the
size of losses is mainly a reflection of higher wealth - and
consequently, of insured values  - in those countries affected by
natural disasters seems to be incorrect. It is far more likely
that other causes, such as climatic changes, have already taken
over as the main factors pushing losses upwards." ("Munich Re
plea for catastrophe action," Lloyd's List, 23 April 1993).<P>

In its press release, the company observes that the insured
losses from natural disasters in the last ten years (1983-92)
were almost 12 times higher than in the ten years of the 1960s,
even allowing for inflation. "Munich Re recorded over 500 natural
disasters in 1992. This too was way above the recorded in the
years immediately before, when it had been in each case only just
over 400." (Munich Re, press release, 19 April 1993).<P>

Spring rains fail to fall, except for a few showers, worsening
drought conditions for the second season in a row. By the end of
March, dam reservoirs levels are down to 31.7 percent capacity.
This causes difficulty with irrigation of 880,000 hectares of
citrus, sugar cane, beet, pulses, tomatoes and potatoes. Cereals
are particularly hard hit - this year's crop of wheat, barley and
maize to expected to be only 2.5 million tonnes, meeting only
half national consumption requirements.<P>

Bad though the 1992 catastrophe statistics were, the first
quarter of 1993 offers beleaguered insurers little respite with a
bill of $2.2 billion, much of it for natural catastrophes. ("Best
predicts heavy losses for 1993," Lloyd's List, 20 April 1993).
This bill later rises to $2.8 billion. ("Catastrophe claims
soar," Lloyd's List, 14 May 1993).<P>

"The industry is changing - and in deeper ways, some reckon, than

in importance, for reinsurance has grown riskier ...The collapse
of the retrocessional (reinsurance of reinsurance) market at
Lloyd's of London is one cause. The potential for rougher weather
from global warming is another. So is the growing ability of
lawyers to make reinsurers pick up the bill for events that

Research scientist Ken Brooks said that north eastern Australia
has been under the influence of El Nino since 1991 and "if it
hasn't decayed by mid-June it will be locked in for another
year". From April 1991 to March 1993, 38 weather stations across
the state of Queensland have recorded the lowest rainfall since
1884. "The situation is now so critical that irreparable damage
is being done to the environment," Mr Brooks said. "There is a
tremendous amount of land degradation occurring."<P>

<H3><B>ARCTIC ICE CAP MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE TO WARMING THAN HAS
BEEN THOUGHT. </B></H3> <P>

New research suggests that Arctic sea ice could be an early
victim of global warming. Gunilla Gard of the University of
Stockholm finds fossil algae in sediment cores collected from the
centre of the Arctic, and proposes that the ice cover must have
been clear in order for them to get enough light to live. She
believes that several times during the past 7,000 years, warm
spells have melted large parts of the central Arctic Ocean.<P>

Other scientists do not accept this hypothesis, stating that
there is no other evidence of an ice-free Arctic, and propose
instead that the algae have been washed in from the North
Atlantic. Sea ice is more susceptible to global warming than
continental ice because it is much thinner.  If the average
summer temperature rises by 4 oC or less, the ice could be melted
completely within a few years, according to Russian researcher,
M.I. Budyko.<P>

Best estimates that 80,000 Hawaiian homeowners, or 40 percent of
the population, will be without insurance by the end of the year.
Long island could be next. Business Week. comments as follows:
"one scary finding: the damage possible in a single South Florida
storm could reach $75 billion. That's almost half the $161
billion the industry has in reserve to pay all claims, including
those from auto accidents and third-party liability." <P>

Writing in the journal Risk Management, Harold Mollin, President
of Customized Worldwide Weather Insurance Agency, observes
that<P>

"the weather underwriting industry does not boast of having any
great prognosticators or world-renowned scientists in its ranks.
Instead, the industry carefully examines weather patterns in
five-, 10- and 20-year increments. Through these analyses, many
in the weather underwriting industry believe that there is
insufficient data in regard to global warming to warrant altering
current underwriting policies. In light of this situation, it
seems that risk managers and their companies do not currently
face a serious and looming threat from global warming."<P>

So concludes a study sponsored by Canada's Department of National
Defence. Population is growing fast in the region,- at 4 percent
in Jordan and 3.7 percent in Syria, for example. But feeding more
people requires more agricultural productivity, and that is
particularly water-intensive in desert regions. In a warming
world, where evapotranspiration will potentially exceed rainfall
in the region, this is a recipe for trouble.<P>

Some cause extensive damage. During one severe storm February, a
large UK oil platform is cut loose. The Danish Meteorological
Institute publishes a commentary on these storms and the enhanced
greenhouse effect. Such severe storms occur with very cold
conditions around southwest Greenland and relatively mild
conditions in mid northwest Europe. <P>

According to the Meteorological Institute, it is unusual for
several sequential winters of this type to occur, like the six
just experienced. Meteorological data compiled since 1891 clearly
indicates an increase in storms over the past 10-15 years.
However, the Meteorological Institute concludes that there is as
yet no scientific proof to link climate change to the storms, or
to indicate that climate change  has made itself felt yet.  Nor
is there consensus among the climate models as to whether the
enhanced greenhouse effect  will lead to more storms in this
region.<P>

winter -  can they be due to the increased greenhouse effect?"

<H3><B>DROUGHT RETURNS AGAIN TO SOUTHERN AFRICA. </B></H3><P>

One of the worst droughts this century covers southern African
countries of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, Mozambique,
Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  Only 15 percent of the
normal rainfall fell in southern Zimbabwe. The drought has been
devastating to crops and livestock. Corn harvests have been 60
percent below expected tonnage, South African farmers harvesting
their worst crop in 40 years.<P>

"The recent large-scale disasters in Japan and abroad do not seem
to be coincidental. It seems that behind these events are global-
scale changes in climate patterns." Toshifumi Kitazawa Tokio
Marine and Fire<P>

Toshifumi Kitazawa, Manager of the Non-Marine Underwriting
Department at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company, tells
the Japanese press that global-scale changes seem to be behind
recent catastrophes. Covering the Greenpeace report, and
soliciting responses in the Japanese insurance industry to it, an
Asahi Shimbun correspondent writes that Kitazawa "has the same
sense of crisis as his counterparts abroad."<P>

In 1992, the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan
formed a panel on global warming within their Safety Technology
Committee. An unidentified person in the Marine and Fire
Association's public relations office told Takeuchi that "if more
disasters like (Typhoon Mireille) follow, it could affect the
industry's very existence." ("Insurance industry concerned about
the Earth," Asahi Shimbun, 3 February 1993).<P>

<H3><B>LEADING EUROPEAN INSURERS FEAR FOR THE FUTURE IF THE IPCC
IS RIGHT. </B></H3> <P>

In a long report analysing the problems climate change poses for
the insurance industry, Greenpeace quotes interviews with senior
officials in Lloyd's of London and Swiss Re who both take an
apocalyptic view of the future viability of the industry if IPCC
estimates prove correct, unless greenhouse-gas emissions are
cut.<P>

The Greenpeace report argues that the industry must form a lobby
group to participate in the ongoing climate negotiations, co-
ordinate industry input to the IPCC's continuing deliberations,
and promote greenhouse-friendly technologies and industries
capable of mitigating the greenhouse threat at source. (J. K.
Leggett, "Climate Change and the Insurance Industry," Greenpeace
Special Publication, February 1993, and second edition May 1993;
"Insurers turn up the heat," The European, 11 February 1993;
"Weather wise," The Financial Times, 24 February 1993).<P>

"While we have been taking notice of what Greenpeace has been
saying, Lloyd's underwriters have also had first-class scientific
brains investigating on their behalf. The fact is that they have
been coming up with very similar forecasts." <P>

A leading Russian hydrometeorologist concludes that global
warming has arrived. Russian winter temperatures have been rising
for five years, and the January 1993 average temperature is fully
4.5 oC warmer than normal.<P>

The director of the Russian Hydrometeorlogical Centre, Alexander
Vassileyev, concludes that greenhouse gases are responsible, and
that global warming means that there will be more to come.<P>

"It is a trend... I am afraid to say it is because of the so-
called greenhouse gases. ...I think this warming will continue."

<H3><B>FURTHER SCOPE FOR POSITIVE FEEDBACKS CALCULATED.
</B></H3><P>

A study finds that changes in vegetation and soil type that cause
emission of carbon dioxide, such as those engendered by
wildfires, could significantly increase carbon dioxide
concentrations in a warming world. Such transient responses to
warming, two environmental scientists from the University of
Virginia argue, could overwhelm any tendency of in the carbon
cycle for more carbon sequestration (such as species migration or
soil formation).<P>

Estimates for the extent to which carbon might be added to the
atmosphere based on two GCMs suggest that warming caused by a
doubling of carbon dioxide could within 50-100 years provide an
additional source equivalent to one third the present atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide.<P>

terrestrial carbon storage to a perturbed climate," Nature, v.
361, p. 523 - 526, 11 February 1993).<P>

Canadian Wildlife Service biologist Ian Stirling, who has studied
polar bears for 20 years, professes "if the sea ice melts,
they'll simply disappear." Depending as they do on seals they
catch on the ice, and with Hudson Bay already ice-free for three
to four months of the year, says Stirling: <P>

"the bears are already at the limit of what they can endure. If
we get some warming of the climate, it probably won't take too
much before they have to lengthen their on-land fast more than
they could endure."<P>

The Canadian and Alaskan permafrost records a warming of some 3
to 7ÉF over the last century.<P>

<H3><B>THE TUNDRA HAS TURNED FROM A SINK TO A SOURCE FOR CARBON
DIOXIDE. </B></H3> <P>

Researchers from the University of California and the US Forest
Service, measuring the amount of carbon dioxide flowing into and
out of Alaskan tundra over five summers, now publish the first
evidence of significant net emission. They calculate that if
their results apply to the entire high latitude belt, the tundra
emitted 0.19 billion tonnes of carbon in 1990, some three percent
of all the carbon emitted from fossil-fuel burning that year.<P>

This is a significant positive feedback, and this process could
well accelerate as the tundra warms further. (W. C. Oechel et al,
"Recent change of Arctic tundra ecosystems from a net carbon
dioxide sink to a source," Nature, 361, p 520-523, 11 February
1993).<P>

"The recent climate patterns may be part of the normal climate
variation or an early indication of greenhouse warming. In either
case, it is clear that they have affected the current carbon flux
from the arctic ecosystem, and that arctic and boreal forest
ecosystems could provide a strong positive feedback on
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration." W. C. Oechel et al<P>

<H3><B>UK GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT LAND WILL HAVE TO BE
ABANDONED. </B></H3><P>

The British 1993 national coastal strategy concedes for the first
time that thousands of acres of agricultural land in eastern
England will have to be surrendered to the sea. 40 years after
floods killed 1,400 in Holland and 307 in eastern England, both
natural and artificial sea defences in the UK are crumbling under
attack from the sea.<P>

A 1991 survey by the National Rivers Authority showed that more
than 250 miles of sea defences in England and Wales, or 20
percent of the total, would not last another five years.<P>

A 1993 report by English Nature shows that in the past 15 years,
Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex have lost 20 percent of their salt
marsh, a natural buffer zone against wave action.<P>

Eastern England is an area of geological subsidence, which
compounds the problem of sea level rise deriving from global
warming. In 1953, the sea flooded 150,000 acres of eastern
England when gales coincided with high spring tides. Today,
750,000 people live on or below sea level in the region.<P>

<H3><B>NO EVIDENCE OF WARMING IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE ABOVE THE
ARCTIC ICE CAP. </B></H3> <P>

More than 27,000 temperature profiles were obtained in the lower
troposphere over the Arctic Ocean between 1950 and 1990, using
Russian drifting ice stations and American weather reconnaissance
aircraft. These data show no evidence for the climatic warming
predicted by present climate models. The authors suggest that
this discrepancy is because the climate models do not adequately
incorporate physical processes affecting polar regions. (J. D.
Kahl et al, "Absence of evidence for greenhouse warming over the
Arctic Ocean in the past 40 years," Nature, v. 361, p. 335-337,
28 January 1993). <P>

What does this mean in terms of global warming? According to
reviewer Dr. John Walsh of the University of Illinois, "these
findings ...are not necessarily at odds with climate-model
projections. The drifting ice stations ....have to be sited on
the thick pack ice of the central Arctic Ocean. So they do not
sample the potentially sensitive marginal ice zone, where the ice
retreat generally results in the greatest warming in CO2-doubling
experiments of climate models." <P>

(J. E. Walsh, "The elusive Arctic warming,"  Nature, v. 361, p.
300-301, 28 January 1993).<P>

<H3><B>REINSURERS WITHDRAW FROM THE CARIBBEAN. </B></H3><P>

About 24 reinsurers have withdrawn from the region in recent
years, and those still offering reinsurance are driving very hard
bargains. So says the managing director of the Reinsurance
Company of Trinidad and Tobago, Bernard Aquing. <P>

The major factor in this has been the huge property claims
following natural disasters. Rates have risen at least 25 percent
in Trinidad and Tobago, and Mr Aquing says he will not be
surprised if more Caribbean insurance companies go out of
business this year. <P>

<H3><B>LATEST ESTIMATE FOR THE 1990 LOSS AT LLOYD'S IS $2.4
BILLION (#16M). </B></H3> <P>

The 1991 loss is reportedly close to $2 billion. Now, with Andrew
and Iniki, little improvement can be expected in 1992.<P>

Lloyd's List quotes a respected analyst as saying "we will have
to wait for 1993 to possibly make a profit and 1996 to once again
receive a cheque from Lloyd's, for those who can still afford to
underwrite by then."  ("Chatset lifts Lloyd's 1990 loss
forecast," Lloyd's List, 22 January 1993; "£1.6 billion loss
predicted for Lloyd's," Guardian, 22 January 1993). Note that
later the situation would deteriorate still further: the Chatset
estimate for 1991 losses in April 1994 would be $4.4 billion (£3
billion). ("The long haul," The Economist, 9 April 1994).<P>

Hurricane Andrew and Cyclone Iniki begin to take their toll.
Between 1970 and 1992, the insurance industry had taken $10.8
billion in premiums in Florida. In the few hours it took
Hurricane Andrew to pass across the state in August 1992, the
industry lost all that and almost $6 billion besides.<P>

Shares in the estimated $17 billion bill for gross insured losses
associated with Hurricane Andrew and Cyclone Iniki, which hit
Hawaii just a few weeks later, had by December 1992 put nine
insurance companies out of business.<P>

<H3><B>LEADING HERPETOLOGIST ALARMED AT GROWING EVIDENCE FOR
GLOBAL FROG DECLINE. </B></H3> <P>

Evidence is gathering from every continent except Africa that
frogs are declining in abundance. They are disappearing in both
polluted regions and unspoilt regions, in mountains and lowlands.
The reason is clearly a global one, and climate change and
increased UV radiation, singly or in concert, are under
discussion as potential candidates.<P>

Dr David Wake, Professor of Integrative Biology at the University
of California, Berkeley, is unable to pinpoint any single cause,
but is very alarmed. Frogs have been on Earth for 200 million
years. "Their loss would be shattering," concludes the Guardian's
correspondent, "and not just because of their contribution to
insect control." ("Farewell to the frog," Guardian, 15 January
1993).<P>

"I am a relatively cautious scientist but I am very alarmed and
feel very strongly about this decline. Frogs are tough survivors
but they are also delicate, responsive to the immediate
environment, so they act as a symbol. It is clear their decline
is our fault. There is no doubt that this is very, very serious."

<H3><B> NASA AND NOAA RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT MOUNT PINATUBO'S
COOLING EFFECT WILL NOT LAST BEYOND 1993. </B></H3> <P>

Jim Hansen of NASA's modelling team predicted that the shade cast
by the aerosols would cool the planet by about 0.5 degrees
Celsius. By the end of 1992, he was bang on target.<P>

Hansen had earlier bet that one of the early years of the 1990s
would break all records, and he won his bet after the decade's
first year. <P>

His third bet is that greenhouse warming will become obvious to
all, once the Pinatubo cooling effect subsides. How long will
that take? Larry Stowe of the US National Atmospheric and
Oceanographic Administration reports that the stratosphere over
the tropics is nearly free of aerosols already, and anticipates
that Pinatubo's influence will have faded by the end of 1993.<P>

(R. A. Kerr, Pinatubo global cooling on target," Science, 29
January 1993)<P>

NOTES: Pinatubo injected 25 to 30 million tonnes of sulphur
dioxide into the stratosphere in June 1991: a huge amount,
probably not exceeded since the 1883 eruption of Mt Krakatoa. The
aerosols so formed reflected large amounts of solar radiation
back into space, reducing 1992 temperatures by 0.2 degrees
Celsius relative to 1991.<P>

The prognosis of the US National Meteorological Centre (Camp

Ronald McPherson observes that though there had been heavy snows
in December,  "it is unreasonable to expect it to be overturned
by one month's precipitation." <P>

National Weather Service hydrologist Frank Richards professes
that reservoir levels are unlikely to return to normal in 1993,

precipitation. <P>

750,000 people live below sea level today in the area affected by

The National Rivers Authority is touring the region to persuade

New Scientist's Fred Pearce, in a wide-ranging review of the

Pearce points out that a government guidance note on coastal
planning, issued in September 1992, stressed that new building
developments away from existing urban areas should be allowed on
coasts threatened by erosion. Sizewell is among the sites over
which a threat now hangs.<P>

An environmental consultant comments that "you wonder about the
wisdom of building two or three nuclear stations at Sizewell, on
shifting spit that is likely to erode over the coming
decades."<P>

<H3><B>PINATUBO "MAY BE THE LARGEST GLOBAL CLIMATE PERTURBATION
OF THE CENTURY." </B></H3> <P>

So says NASA climatologist James Hansen, warning that the amount
of cooling produced by the volcano points to high climate
sensitivity. <P>

The sulphur dioxide that the volcano ejected into the
stratosphere in June 1991 has since then cooled the planet by
0.3 oC to 0.4 oC, in line with the upper range of Hansen's model
predictions. "Thus it appears that the Pinatudo cooling favours
high climate sensitivity,"<P>

Hansen and his colleagues profess in a paper in press, reported
in New Scientist. "We predict a rapid recovery from Pinatubo
cooling and new record temperatures within the 1990s, despite the
conventional wisdom that natural climate variability prohibits
reliable forecast of the short-term climate trend." <P>

1993).<P>

FORESTS.<P>

Lymantria dispar (fungus spinner or gypsy moth) has ravaged about
10,000 hectares of oak forest in Baden (southern Germany), as
well as corn, strawberry and asparagus fields. About 1500 up to
2000 hectares of Austrian oak forests are infested, and the
Lymantria caterpillars have completely denuded all leaves on the
infested trees.<P>

According to the forest-ecologist Anton Krapfenbauer from
University of Agriculture, Vienna, the "Schwammspinner"
infestation can be linked to  climate change.<P>

46 oC temperatures across central India claim dozens of lives.
Despite ample monsoonal rain in recent years, ground water
supplies are shrinking because deforestation encourages rain to
flow directly into rivers rather first replenishing underground
aquifers.<P>

<H3><B>WHILE MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE WARMING,
THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC HAS BEEN COOLING. </B></H3> <P>

According by German Oceanographer Manfred Stein, evidence from
ice cores taken in Greenland indicates that the NW Atlantic has
been getting colder for about 30 years. The Northwest Atlantic
cooldown follows a warmup, beginning in the 1920s, that pushed
Greenland and Labrador water to their warmest temperatures on
record, attracting salmon and cod to Greenland for the first
time. Now the colder water is driving the salmon and cod from
Greenland, with potentially serious implications for
fisheries.<P>

Meanwhile, the Arctic ice cap is thinning and the layer of fresh
water off Greenland is thickening. This could spell trouble for
the Gulf Stream, an ocean current carrying warm seawater north.
The fresh water impedes convection currents. This is one of the
most vital areas for the ventilation of the deep oceans. The
water sinks to the abyssal depths and flows south the length of
the Atlantic and round into the Indian and ultimately Pacific
oceans. Says Stein<P>

"If you stop that mechanism the central heating for northern
Europe will be switched off." <P>

("Cooling of the northwest Atlantic could hurt fish stock,"
Business Information Wire, 8 June 1993).<P>

CONFIDENCE.<P>

"The probability that the temperature increase of the the last
century has not been influenced by the greenhouse effect is less
than one per cent."  Richard Tol and Aart de Vos Free University,
Amsterdam<P>

Publishing a statistical analysis of the temperature trend of the
last century, two Dutch scientists conclude that it is almost
certain that greenhouse forcing has contributed to it. Their
model explains some of the shorter-term variability in the record
by factoring in the influence of the sun, volcanoes, and El Nino.
"In global terms, this assertion does not rule out that the
increase may have occurred spontaneously', but the probability is
very small. The greenhouse gas explanation is much more
plausible." <P>

<H3><B>MICROBIOTA MAY PREVENT THE OCEANS FROM ACTING AS A SINK
FOR METHANE. </B></H3> <P>

Recent research has shown that archaea (plural of archaeon), a
microscopic lifeform similar to bacteria, may play an important
role in methane production in the ocean. <P>

Archaea have only recently been recognised, and are thought to be
the remnants of one of the earliest lifeforms on earth in the
time when there was no free oxygen. They have been found twice in
Antarctic lakes.  One species, Methanococcoides burtonii, is
known to produce methane at the bottom of one of the lakes.<P>

Scientists suspect that a close relative of this species is
producing methane in temperate and tropical oceans. "Even if the
organism is present in very low numbers, its presence may have a
major effect on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. 
Small amounts of methane produced in the ocean will quickly
saturate the ecosystem, as methane is very insoluble, so
continual production of methane in the ocean would prevent it
from acting as a sink for atmospheric methane."<P>

<H3><B>LONDON BOROUGHS HIGHLIGHT RISK TO THE BRITISH CAPITAL.
</B></H3><P>

"London is at risk from the effects of global warming," a London
Boroughs Association report concludes. <P>

A 1990 report by BNA International had suggested that sea-level
rise was in danger of breaching the Thames Barrier "during the
early decades of the 21st century." At risk of flooding "include
large parts of Hammersmith and Fulham, riverside areas of
Westminster, the City and Tower Hamlets and significant areas of
Newham and Barking and Dagenham." Furthermore, "London is built
on clay soils which would undergo shrinking and swelling. This
would have important implications for the stability of
foundations of buildings and other structures." <P>

Association, March 1993).<P>

BRAZIL.<P>

Drought in the region is now in its fourth year, and is the worst
for twenty years. Seventy percent of northeast Brazil's
agricultural production is affected.  The drought, which began
three years ago, has pushed 8.4 million people towards
starvation. In some areas one child a day is dying of hunger.
Remaining water is frequently contaminated with cholera.  The
area affected threatens to become as extensive as that affected
in the 1980s drought when 350,000 people starved.  ("Earthweek: A
Diary of the Planet," The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, 27
March 1993; "Drought brings misery, starvation to Brazilian
northeast," The Associated Press, 19 April 1993; "Two-year
drought pushes Brazil's northeast into starvation's grip," The
Associated Press, 8 April 1993).<P>

Starving peasants have come to "many" towns in the region in
search of food, and have begun raiding warehouses and
supermarkets. The director of the region's meteorological centre
was not hopeful for an end to the drought. "We expect it to rain
more this year than last. But as this is the fourth year of
drought, the social impact will be far greater." ("Drought
victims loot Brazil's food shops," Guardian, 25 March 1993).<P>

International Netherlands Group "recorded such a great increase
in the number of natural disasters around the world that they can
no longer justify it." So reports the main Dutch financial
newspaper. "The insurer has been losing around a billion Guilders
on premiums each year. <P>

A report by environmental organisation Greenpeace 'Climate Change
and the Insurance Industry,' shows that the number of hurricanes,
cyclones and floods since 1987 has increased sharply.
International Netherlands says they have taken very good notice'
of the recently published Greenpeace report ...and have taken it
into consideration (in their decision) to stop this type of
insurance." <P>

In less than ten years, Spain's rainfall will be perhaps 15
percent less, says Antonio Labajo, assistant director of the
National Meteorological Institute. "The relation between carbon
dioxide concentration increase and climate change is a
scientifically proved fact," he says, "and that temperature
increase will lead to longer and hotter summers and more
desertification in Spain." Labajo calls for a significant
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. <P>

<H3><B>BRITISH BIRDS NESTING UP TO 22 DAYS EARLIER THAN IN THE

Investigators for the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) report
the results from monitoring of 30,000 nests from 82 species. Of
these species, 33 were breeding earlier (varying between one and
22 days), and only five species were found to be nesting later.
On average, eggs were laid a week earlier than in the 1970s. The
trend began about 15 years ago. This means that nearly half of
the migratory birds that nest in Britain are nesting earlier. The
white throated warbler, a migratory bird which winters in the
Sahel, is a good example. <P>

The Director-General of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological
Institute reports that the chances of a succession of recent hot
years in the Netherlands, on the basis of a hypothesis of
unaltered climate, are less than one in ten thousand. Dr
Fijnaut's report says "The KNMI (The Royal Netherlands
Meteorological Service) takes the threat of climate change very
seriously. It is probably no coincidence that four of the hottest
years in the Netherlands of this century have been recorded in
the last five years. ...Mean temperature in the Netherlands was
10.4 degrees in the period 1988-1992, which is 1.3 degrees more
than the mean temperature in the period 1890- 1970s."   <P>

austral summer has been "exceptionally" warm, with minimum
temperatures 5 oC higher than other years. This unusually warm
summer produced a "big defrost" and glacier retreat. <P>

sea-ice extent around Livingstone Island, Antarctic Peninsula,
has also been measured over the past 30 years; Spanish scientists
link this with increased sea temperatures. (Diario 16, 8 October

<H3><B>PINATUBO MAY EXPLAIN THE WARM NORTH AMERICAN WINTER OF
1991/92. </B></H3> <P>

Although the dust thrown up by large volcanic eruptions has the
effect of cooling the planet overall, researchers in the US now
suggest that such eruptions can warm Eurasia and North America
during the winter after the eruption. <P>

Sulphate aerosols cast into the stratosphere reflect solar
radiation back into space, cooling the surface, but they also
absorb heat, warming the stratosphere. In winter, when the sun is
low in the sky, both effects are weak, and uneven warming of the
stratosphere between high and low latitudes enhances the contrast
in temperature with latitude. It is this contrast that drives
wind systems, of course. <P>

Two University of Maryland researchers now model this effect and
achieve results consistent with the pattern of warm winter
weather in North America and Eurasia during 1991/1992,
contemporaneous with unusual cold in the Middle East. The key
factor producing this pattern is a strengthening, in mid- to high
latitudes, of winds capable of bringing warm maritime air over
the contents.   <P>

2405; and "Pinatubo warms winters in the north," New Scientist, 6
March 1993; "This year's weather: it really was strange," New
York Times, 9 March 1993; "Volcanoes may warm locally while

<H3><B>1992 SUMMARY </B></H3><P>

Despite the year-long cooling effect of Pinatubo's aerosols, 1992
was still the tenth hottest year on record.  ("Global temperature
rise confirms warming trend," Independent, 22 January 1992).<P>

"It is still too early to say for sure that this is due to the
build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but it becomes
more likely with each passing year."  Dr Phil Jones, Climatic
Research Unit University of East Anglia<P>

     1992 catastrophe losses reached a record of $27.1 billion, a
global record  and an increase of 87% on 1991 even allowing for
inflation. Swiss Re found that both the size and frequency of
catastrophes seemed to be increasing. (Swiss Re, Sigma 2/93,
Naturkatastrophen und Grossschaeden 1992: neuer Rekord der
versicherten Schaeden. Reported in Lloyd's List, 27 April
1993).<P>

     Munich Re, analysing the 1992 record, listed more than 500
natural catastrophes compared to 400 in previous years. The ten
year period 1983 to 1992 showed ten times the insured losses of
the 1960s, after adjustment for inflation. (Lloyd's List, 27
April 1993).<P>

     1991-92 was the warmest US winter on record. The warm
temperatures minimised snow falls over much of the country and
were associated with very dry conditions in most of the northern
states. ("Snow: a skimpy year," Weatherwise, v. 46,  p. 38-41,
February/March 1993).<P>

     The mildest US winter since at least 1895 was then followed
by the coolest summer in 77 years. Nationally it was the coolest
July since 1950 and the wettest since 1958. "In fact, for much of
the country, and especially the North Central states, it is only
slight hyperbole to call 1992 both the year without a winter' and
the year without a summer'." (Douglas LeComte, "Highlights in the
United States," NOAA/USDA Joint Agricultural Weather Facility,
USA, Weatherwise, v. 46, p .8-13, February/March 1993).<P>

     California endured water shortages for the sixth consecutive
year and the Pacific Northwest also extended its run of dry years
to six, while Alaska experienced a winter heatwave. Warmer early
winter temperatures delayed freeze-up of the Yukon and Kuskokwim
rivers preventing safe travel by usual modes - snow machine or
dog sled. This slow freeze-up followed an exceptionally early
spring break-up and sunny summer. 1993 was the second latest
freeze-up on the Kuskokwim River since records have been taken
over the last 34 years. The average temperature in Anchorage
between November 1 and December 26 this year was 6oF above
normal. ("Alaska Basks in Warmth," Anchorage Daily News, 28
December 1993). In the Alaskan Arctic, temperatures have been
about 3oF above average during most of 1993 and 9.6oF. above
average in October. ("Chukchi Sea's Drifting Pack Ice Perplexes
Experts," Anchorage Daily News, 9 January 1994).<P>

     The 1992 hurricane season in the eastern North Pacific Ocean
broke a several records. "The 24 named storms broke a record of
22 set in 1985, and the 27 tropical cyclones broke a record of 26
set in 1982. The year's total of 14 hurricanes was two shy of the
record set in 1990 but easily greater than the seasonal average
of 10 (calculated since 1966, when routine weather satellite
surveillance began)." Hurricane Tina lasted 24 days longer than
any other North Pacific Tropical cyclone on record and was the
region's most powerful hurricane in 1992 [Category 4]. The 
eighteenth tropical cyclone tracked in the eastern Pacific,
Iniki, ultimately became the strongest and most destructive
windstorm to hit Hawaii this century. (Edward Rappaport and Miles
Lawrence, National Hurricane Center, USA, "Eastern Pacific
Hurricanes," Weatherwise, v. 46, p. 25-28, February/March
1993).<P>

     1992 saw an all-time record for US tornadoes, 1,293, beating
the old record of 1,133 set in 1990. The June total of 339 was
the record for a single month. 14 of the 1,293 were violent
twisters that killed 19 people and injured 364 more, causing more
than US$160 million damage. (Hugh Crowther, National Severe
Storms Forecast Center, USA, "Tornados Hit New Heights,"
Weatherwise, v. 46, p. 29-37, February/March 1993; Preston
Leftwich, Larry Wilson and Hugh Crowther, National Severe Storms
Forecast Centre, USA, "Tornadoes Record Pace Continues,"
Weatherwise, v. 45, p. 23-33, February/March 1992).<P>

     Devastating hailstorms hit the South and Central US states.
Two record hailstorms struck central Florida in March, the first
causing US$25 million in damage, the second  three weeks later
having a US$60 million price tag, Orlando's costliest ever
weather disaster. Kansas City, Wichita, and Dallas also suffered
severe hailstorms. (Hugh Crowther, National Severe Storms
Forecast Center, USA, "Tornados Hit New Heights," Weatherwise, v.
46, p. 29-37, February/March 1993).<P>

     Drought befell Europe for much of 1992. "Southern England,
France, Spain, Portugal and northern Italy received less than
half the normal rainfall until storms relieved the drought in
western Europe in April. However drought developed in Denmark,
Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany and Poland. Rain improved
conditions in Scandinavia in July, but dry conditions elsewhere
spread into the Baltics and central and eastern Europe." (Douglas
LeComte, "Highlights Around the World,"  NOAA/USDA Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility, USA, Weatherwise, v.46, p.14-17,
February/March 1993.<P>

      Swiss glaciers are the smallest now than they have been for
140 years. ("Review of winter 1992/93 in the Northern
Hemisphere," Weather, v. 48, p. 154_15, 1993).<P>

     1992 was the warmest year in Austria since 1822. Average air
temperatures were 1.2oC above the long-term average of 1775 to
1991. In Vienna average air temperatures were even 1.8oC above
long-term average. ("So warm wie 1992 war es zuletzt vor 170
Jahren", Kurier (Austria), 12 January 93).<P>

CHURCHES SAY. </B></H3> <P>

The World Council of Churches issues a compilation  of statements
by churches on the problem. Among the statements, the Church
leaders of the United States and Canada observe that "as church
leaders, we ourselves have been slow to recognize the seriousness
of the global warming problem. We now clearly see it as both an
issue of spirituality and justice. Global warming threatens the
well-being of God's whole creation."  <P>

Pope John Paul II is quoted as saying "we cannot interfere in one
area of the ecosystem without paying due attention both to the
consequences of such interference in other areas and to the well-
being of future generations. ...The resulting meteorological and
atmospheric changes (from burning fossil fuels and other
emissions) range from damage to health to the possible submersion
of low-lying lands." <P>

<H3><B>UK'S ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY SAYS THERE IS CAUSE FOR

<P>

It releases a comprehensive statement based upon the IPCC report
and covering most aspects of climate change. The estimate of
climate change based on the IPCC's "business as usual" scenario
is 0.3oC every ten years.  It is difficult to predict what will
happen in the UK.  Its position near the sea keeps it warmer than
(for example) central Russia at the same latitude.  A long-term
change in the prevailing wind direction could have a "substantial
effect."  <P>

Climate models predict that increasing greenhouse gases mean that
the earth should have warmed by 1 oC over the last 100 years, but
it has only done so by 0.5oC.  Most warming was between
1910-1940, and between 1975 and now.  <P>

"If, over the next 20 years we do not clearly see the man-made
effect in the observational record, this would give weight to the
argument that the sensitivity of climate to increases in
greenhouse gases, and hence likely future global warming, may be
less than we presently believe." <P>

The statement asks the question "should we be worried about
global warming?" The response is yes, but we need to remember the
uncertainties of prediction.  If global warming does occur, 
there are two possibilities: first, there will be a gradual
effect, which will be unnoticeable except in the very long term;
this will mean that the impact on the earth will be minimal;
second, it will be bigger than the models have predicted, and
will have serious consequences. Several points arise: since there
is a time-lag in climate response, it may already be too late to
avert some changes (such as the ozone hole, which will be with us
for decades); current models are not good enough to allow precise
predictions; it may be years before models will be good enough to
predict changes on a local basis. <P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING MAY SKEW SEX-RATIO AMONG SEA TURTLES

FEMALES.<P>

A five year study of hatchling loggerhead turtles in Florida
shows that temperature increases skew populations towards
females, which ranged in different sites and years from 87 to
99.9 percent of the population. This, according to the Canadian
researchers, "may complicate conservation efforts, since global
warming might be expected to skew the ration still further
towards females." They conclude that "in Suriname, even a 2ÉC
warming of the sand would put temperatures in the female-
producing range for the entire present nesting season of green
and leatherback turtles. Perhaps extinction would follow."  (N.
Mrosvovsky and J. Provancha, "Sex ration of hatchling loggerhead
sea turtles: data and estimates from a 5-year study," Canadian
Journal of Zoology, v. 70, p. 530 - 538, 1992).<P>

"Demonstrations of sex-ration evolution in faster maturing
species do not make it safe to assume that turtles will survive
rapid global warming. Indeed one conceivable explanation of the
skewed sex ratios in our study is that the climate at Cape
Canaveral has already started to change, and that the sand
temperatures for 1986 - 1990 were above the average for the last
few hundred years." N. Mrosvovsky and J. Provancha<P>

<H3><B>UNEP CHARTS A VARIETY OF CLIMATIC CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE
</B></H3>
MEDITERRANEAN REGION.<P>

The information summarized below is drawn from "Climatic Change 
and the Mediterranean," edited by L. Jeftic, J.D. Milliman, 
and G. Sestini (publisher: Edward Arnold). All references below
are contributions to this publication.<P>

 Temperature change and precipitation: GCM results indicate a
warming similar in magnitude to the global-mean value, with no
evidence for any marked seasonal differences. Professor Tom
Wigley of the University of East Anglia notes that "although the
magnitude of this warming is uncertain, we can be fairly
confident that, as a prediction, it is qualitatively correct." 
With it will come the probability that periods of extreme
warmth will increase, with all that entails for human health,
drought, forest fires, and reduced growing-season moisture 
levels as a consequence of enhanced evapotranspiration. On top of
this, "the possibility of substantial [precipitation] changes
(say, up to +-30% over the next 50-100 years) must be considered
as realistic." (T.M.L. Wigley, "Future Climate of the
Mediterranean Basin with Particular Emphasis on Changes in
Precipitation," p. 41).<P>

 Sea level rise: "eustatic sea-level is expected to rise 12 to 18
cm in the next 35-40 years, although in the Mediterranean local
subsidence (e.g. Po and Nile deltas) could result in local sea-
level rise by as much as 25-40 cm. Increased withdrawal of
water or petroleum from coastal areas could accelerate local
sea-level rise even more." (J. D. Milliman, "Sea-level 
Response to Climate Change and Tectonics in the
Mediterranean Sea," p.45).<P>

 The Ebro delta: The wetlands may eventually disappear as a
result of aggravated erosion. "The possible change in the
nutrients cycle due to the reshaping of the bays may also affect
the productivity of the adjacent sea and reduce the
fisheries in the area." (M.G. Marino, "Implications of
Climatic Change on the Ebro Delta", pp. 304).<P>

 The Po delta and Venice: Abnormal events can be expected to
increase: hot dry summers, unusually mild and dry winters,
erratic precipitation (including heavy rainfall and floods),
marine storms, tidal surges, and episodes of water stagnation
and eutrophication. "The main threats of an additional sea-
level rise (possibly over 40-50 cm after 2050) would be the
serious degradation of the city of Venice and other towns in
the lagoons and on the coast, the impairment of the harbour-
related activities, and a substantial decline of the beach
resorts." ( G. Sestini, "Implications of Climatic Changes for
the Po Delta and Venice Lagoon", p.428).<P>

 The Inner Thermaikos Gulf, Thessaloniki, Greece: "With an
initial temperature rise of 1-2 oC and a 20-30 cm sea-level
rise, the impact will be a gradual one as the present intertidal 
zone will be flooded. This impact in general will be compensated
by the evolution of various natural and other systems as long 
as they can exhibit high tolerance to the changing environment.
However, with a greater temperature (2-3oC) and sea-level (0.5-1
m) rise, the impact may be catastrophic and may seriously 
alter the coastal morphology of the estuary and the 
unprotected low land. The limited seasonal rainfall will cause 
problems with the water balance, particularly irrigation, and to
hydroelectric power-station reservoirs along the Aliakmon River. 
Deficiency in soil moisture will decrease fertility,  thus 
requiring better drainage and increased irrigation. Reduced
rainfall on the "thirsty" agricultural plain as well as high
irrigational needs will lead to the sea-water intrusion into the
aquifers, thereby deteriorating the groundwater quality." (D. 
Georgas and C. Perissoratis, "Implications of Future Climatic
Changes on the Inner Thermaikos Gulf (Thessaloniki, Greece),"
p.495).<P>

 The Nile delta: "In theory, a sea-level rise (or relative rise,
to include the effects of local subsidence) of 100 cm could
flood land within 30 km of the coast or more, affecting 12-15% 
of Egypt's arable land and 8-10 million people. However, the
cultivated lands are already bordered by dikes, and more 
protection works are likely to be constructed along with new
road, reclamation or water preservation schemes. Yet higher
lagoon and estuary water levels would mean, if not checked by
sluices, easier penetration by salt wedges. Thus, the impact of
sea-level rise will be mainly on the financial resources to
carry out new protection schemes, to make adjustments to
harbour infrastructures, new land use, or reconstruction." (G.
Sestini, "Implications of Climatic Changes for the Nile Delta",
p.535).<P>

 Garaet El Ichkeul and Lac de Bizerte, Tunisia: "The actual
evapotranspiration in the region will increase by around 10%
when mean air temperature rises by 1.5 oC. This will result in,
at least, a 10% decline in riverflow. The salinity of the
latter will also increase. Potential evapotranspiration and open
water evaporation will rise by a minimum of 12%. The demand for 
irrigation water will rise by at least 12% when reservoirs are
depleted by reduced river flow and increased evaporation. The
average storage in the reservoirs will fall by up to 26% and they
will be nearly empty for up to 19% of the time. An expected 25%
filling of the reservoirs with sediments will seriously increase
the water-supply problems, with mean storage falling to around
60% of the levels under present conditions." <P>

(G.E. Hollis et al, "Implications of Climatic Changes in the 
Mediterranean  Basin: Garaet El Ichkeul and Lac de Bizerte,
Tunisia," p.603).<P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING TO PRODUCE MORE VIOLENT STORMS?
</B></H3><P>

Two unusually violent thunderstorms occurred recently in
Australia (one on 21 January 1991 in Sydney, and one on 28
November 1990 in Arnhem Land). Meteorologist L. Eyre asks whether
the extra energy formed by global warming might be being
dissipated by these huge thunderstorms (L.A. Eyre, "How severe
can a thunderstorm be? An investigation into two violent
electrical storms in Australia," Weather,  v. 47, p. 374_383,
1992).<P>

"Are atmospheric energies increasingly vigorous in extratropical
latitudes, as many airline pilots suggest?  More careful
monitoring is evidently needed before hard conclusions can be
drawn. But, qualitatively and subjectively, we may tentatively
postulate that more severe weather is on the way." L. A. Eyre<P>

NOTES: Earlier, Hurricane Gilbert on 12 September 1988 had also
led Eyre to speculate whether global warming could be responsible
for an increase in the severity of storms: "Inevitably, questions
are being raised: was Gilbert the first of a new breed of
superhurricanes that with the greenhouse effect and global

<H3><B>MEXICO CITY LIKELY TO BE DRIER AND MORE POLLUTED IN A
WARMING WORLD. </B></H3> <P>

Using the projections from five major GCMs, Diana Liverman of the
Pennsylvania University, found that a doubling of atmospheric 
carbon dioxide could mean monthly temperature increases for 
Mexico City of up to 5 oC in both winter and summer.  This could
be expected to increase air pollution levels.<P>

Despite variations and uncertainties, all models suggest that
soil moisture and water availability in the basin of Mexico will
decrease.  This has serious implications for water planning in
Mexico City where water supply is already limited; groundwater
levels are already declining and water is pumped over mountains
at considerable expense.  <P>

A study of the retreat of the glaciers on Mount Kenya relates the
phenomenon to climatic factors that may be related to global
warming. These glaciers have receded markedly on Mount Kenya
since the late 1800s, but especially between 1963 and 1987, when
they decreased by 40 percent.  This happened independent of the
effects of the sun. <P>

So concluded the editors of a major study of impacts in the
region. Additionally, "the response of Arctic ecosystems to
global change could in turn feed back substantially on global
climate.  Large carbon pools in tundra soil could augment
atmospheric CO2 and climatic warming if decomposition is
stimulated more than primary production.  <P>

The tundra is also an important contributor to the global
methane budget, so environmental changes affecting methane flux
could have an important global effect. An improved understanding
of physiological controls over biotic processes and of the
feedbacks among these processes is key to predicting the changing
role of the Arctic in the global system." <P>

Bryant and Reichardt look at the role of secondary metabolites in
woody plants, and assess how these might influence long-term and
short-term responses by Arctic tundra ecosystems to climate
change. In Arctic ecosystems, these metabolites in woody plants
reduce the rates at which these plants are recycled in their
grazed form, and at which rate they decompose and return their
nitrogen to the soil.  <P>

Climate change is anticipated to reduce production of these
substances, and may also increase the number and intensity of
forest fires (which will mean that there will be more tundra
vegetation and shrubs that are low in secondary metabolites).
This will mean that in the long term, the Arctic tundra will be
displaced north by deciduous trees and shrubs that are better
defended against grazing in winter. Because taiga browsing
animals can deal better with secondary metabolites than tundra
browsing animals, they are likely to start replacing them. These
changes will directly affect Arctic native peoples by reducing
their food supply, and sources of furs. <P>

metabolite production by Arctic woody plants," in Arctic

But at the moment the Greenland ice sheet seems to be growing.
Braithwaite and his associates conclude that climate warming will
cause increased melting of Greenland glaciers, although the
effects of this may be offset by increased accumulation.  They
observe that the Greenland ice sheet appears to be growing at
present, and that the predicted increased warming has not yet
occurred. <P>

A study of a forested area of the Northwest Territories of Canada
of around 250,000 square kilometres, between 1967-1989, shows
that neither the type of forest nor the human settlements in it
affected the areas that burned each year, but the temperatures
did. "Given a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, future fire
scenarios for the Northwest Territories vary greatly depending on
the climate model used. Potential increases in burned areas
ranged from negligible to 70-80 percent in excess of current
levels in the NWT." <P>

during global warming). <P>

The end of the ice season has come increasingly early at many

through the St Lawrence River over the last 25 years, and
correlates with increases in springtime temperatures at stations

related to loss of breeding habitat due to the long drought. <P>

Temperatures 20 years ago were between 5-10 oC lower than they
are now, and regularly went to -40 oC, but these days, anything
below -15 oC is rare.  Weather researchers have identified three
main possibilities: climate change on a global scale, heavy
industry in the region, and short-term effects of winds from the
Atlantic.
This warming may mean that the Russian steppe might creep north,
at the expense of the Siberian forests.  <P>

<H3><B>STRONGEST EVER NORWEGIAN STORM. </B></H3><P>

A storm over Christmas gusts at 110 knots and averages 70-80
knots. Meteorologists Bjorn Rosting says "We had a similar
hurricane three years ago, 1988, but that "only" reached levels
of approximately 60 knots". He blamed the storm on large
contrasts in the prevailing air masses - when cold air from
north and warm air from the south meet in a restricted area, very
strong winds develop. <P>

The devastated area was declared a disaster zone and more than
35,000 people were without electricity for a week.  Damages are
expected to exceed one billion NOK ($150 million). "After the
hurricane in '88-'89 -  five storms hit consecutively that time -
the damages reached 350 million NOK ($55 million). Now the
damages are much more widespread and larger. It is doubtful
whether one billion will be enough," said Sigmund Gussiaas,
surveyer for the Norwegian Natural Disaster Pool. <P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING COULD MEAN MALARIA, AND EVEN PLAGUE, ONCE
AGAIN IN EUROPE. </B></H3> <P>

So says the UK government's Public Health Laboratory Service in a
new report. <P>

The threat of malaria is very real, the report concludes.
Plasmodium vivax, the most common of the four species of malaria
parasite, caused outbreaks of malaria in the Kent marshes as
recently as the early 1950s.  David Warhurst of the London School
of Tropical Medicine, one of the contributors to the report, says
"malaria is very sensitive to small changes in climate." The
optimum temperature for the development of P. falciparum, the
most dangerous form of malaria, is 26ÉC, which is a temperature
which may soon be common in southern Europe.<P>

Other diseases are also a threat, including Leishmaniasis, which
is a potentially life-threatening disease carried by sandflies
currently found in southern France, and recently in the Channel
Islands, but which quickly die in the current British climate.<P>

Animal diseases, too, might spread north to the UK. African horse
sickness, carried by Culicoides midges, and which kills as many
as 95 percent of infected animals, has recently invaded Spain
thanks to recent warm winters. The report concludes that it could
be on its way to the UK. Even plague could make a return. <P>

The New Scientist coverage of the report observes that "Michael
Rowland, chairman of the think-tank that put together the PHLS
report, ponders whether the plague could be ready to make a
comeback. Although the bacterium that causes the disease is
largely confined to hotter parts of the globe, small reservoirs
of infection still survive in eastern Europe. One theory argues
that the Black Death of Europe in the 14th century began when
infected rats fled massive flooding in China. Flooding, as the
icecaps melt, is a likely consequence of global warming. Our own
brown rats would carry the disease just as effectively as did
black rats,' says Rowland. Suddenly the boom in Britain's rat
population during recent mild winters takes on a sinister
edge."<P>

December 1992).<P>

Dubbed "The Great Nor'easter of 1992" by insurers, it floods the
New York subway, causing it to be closed down for the first time
in its history.  The storm, involving hurricane force winds,
heavy rains, river and tidal flooding, and massive snowfalls
between December 10-13, causes $650 million in insured losses. It
drags houses into the sea, wreaks havoc along 600 miles of
coastline, kills at least 18 people, and causes a state of
emergency to be declared in New York, New Jersey, and
Connecticut<P>

<H3><B>CLIMATE SENSITIVITY IN THE PAST WAS AS CALCULATED BY
CLIMATE MODELS. </B></H3> <P>

This strengthens confidence in the performance of models, and the
IPCC's estimates for future global warming. Two scientists from
New York University and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory justify
their study as follows: "to assess the future impact of
anthropogenic greenhouse gases on global climate, we need a
reliable estimate of the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to
changes in radioactive forcing. Climate sensitivity is
conventionally defined as the equilibrium surface temperature
increase for carbon dioxide doubling...An alternative to model-
based estimates is in principle available from the reconstruction
of past climates, which implicitly includes cloud feedback."<P>

Hoffert and Covey reconstruct two different paleoclimates - one
warmer than now, and one colder, using geological information.
The results show that the temperature ranges from the two
reconstructed climates are very similar to those predicted by
models, and to those that can be predicted from recent
temperature observations. The reconstructed climate sensitivities
for the two periods studied are around 2 to 2.5ÉC. <P>

The authors conclude, "it is remarkable" that independently
estimated climate sensitivities are so close to those estimated
by scientists using GCMs. "The numbers are already good enough to
rule out a very low sensitivity implied by Lindzen. ...The
climate fluctuations imprinted in the geological record could not
have occurred if sensitivity was so sluggish. Interpolation of
the IPCC's Business-as-usual scenario curves to our empirical
sensitivity estimates ...indicate that global warming by the end
of the next century will be 3-4ÉC. Such a warming is
unprecedented in the past million years and represents a secular
climate change much faster than previously experienced by natural
ecosystems during glacial to interglacial transitions." <P>

from paleoclimate reconstructions," Nature, v. 360, p. 573-576,

<H3><B>HAWAIIAN INSURERS GO UNDER IN THE WAKE OF CYCLONE INIKI'S
BILLION DOLLAR LOSS. </B></H3> <P>

Facing $300 million in claims, Hawaiian Insurance Group - the
State's fifth biggest insurer - announces on 3rd December that it
is to cease trading.  Other island insurers then issue an
"indefinite" moratorium on the writing of new policies.<P>

A spokeswoman for First Insurance, Hawaii's biggest insurer, says
that this was while insurers assess the significance of attempts
by reinsurers - including Lloyd's - to renegotiate terms with
insurers.  "The reinsurers are taking a hard look at the Hawaiian
islands in particular and the world situation in general," she
says. <P>

16,000 homeowners are thrown into panic by HIG's move, unable to
find replacement cover. A week later, First Insurance announces
it will cease renewing existing policies as of 1st February 1993.
The number of stranded homeowners would then reach 38,000. <P>

The last cyclone before Iniki to hit Hawaii had been Iwa, in
1982. That had been considered, until Iniki, a freak event.
Hawaii's Insurance Commissioner expands a special programme for
fire and windstorm insurance in areas threatened by Hawaii's
volcano statewide, and forms a team of insurance industry
representatives to investigate the prospect of a windstorm
insurance pool. In Texas, an insurance pool exists for exposed
counties along the Gulf Coast. <P>

A feature of the world ocean is a huge pool of water in the
equatorial western Pacific which is on average 2 to 5oC warmer
than other equatorial waters. Called the Western Pacific Warm
Pool, it covers an area, mostly east and north of New Guinea,
larger than the continental United States. Scientists from the
University of Delaware use NOAA satellite data from 1982 to 1991
to monitor the region. Annual mean sea-surface temperatures, and
the area of the pool, climbed monotonically from 1983 to 1987,
then varied. The researchers conclude that "possible causes of
these variations include solar irradiance variabilities, El Nino
-
 Southern Oscillation events, volcanic activities, and global
warming." ENSO years were 1982 to 1983 (the strongest of the
century), 1986 to 1987, and 1991 onwards (still in progress at
this time). <P>

AUSTRALIA.<P>

Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation predicts temperature changes as follows.<P>

 - Northern Coast (north of about Brisbane) : 0-1.5 oC (2030),
0-4 oC (2070);   <P>

- Southern Coast (south of about Brisbane):
0.5-2 oC (2030), 1-5 oC (2070);   <P>

- Inland (more than 200 km from coast): 0.5-2.5 oC (2030), 1-5 oC
(2070). <P>

Rainfall is expected to increase across Australia in the summer
months. By 2030 summer rainfall is expected to increase by 20
percent and by 2070 by up to 40 percent. Winter rainfall is
expected to decrease across most of the continent but may
increase over the southern and  eastern coasts.  <P>

CSIRO research indicates that extreme events are likely to change
in magnitude and frequency and suggest more very hot days, more
floods and more droughts. Cyclone intensity and frequency may
change. The tropical cyclone belt may move south placing the
major population centres of south-east Queensland at risk. <P>

CSIRO are currently unable to project the effect of climate
change on the important regional climatic pattern El Nino which
brings very dry conditions and drought to eastern Australia,
while the opposite La Nina brings wet conditions and flood.<P>

<H3><B>CYCLONE GAY BECOMES THE FOURTH CYCLONE TO HIT GUAM IN FOUR
WEEKS. </B></H3> <P>

At its peak, while the storm was still a thousand miles southeast
of Guam,  Gay reached supertyphoon strength with sustained winds
at 184 mph, gusting to 225 mph, making it one of the fiercest
storms of the century. Thankfully Gay had lost strength by the
time it made landfall on November 24th, bringing only 120 mph
winds. (Douglas LeComte, NOAA/USDA Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility, USA, "Highlights around the world," Weatherwise,
v.46(1), p. 14-17, February / March 1993). <P>

Since Typhoon Omar on August 28th, Guam has been visited by
typhoons Brian (October 20th), Elsie (November 3rd, which became
a supertyphoon a day after passing the island), and Hunt
(November 18th). More cyclonic storms are generated in this
region than anywhere else on Earth, but on average, in a normal
year, only three or four pass within 180 nautical miles of Guam
each year. (Paulette Coulter, "Typhoons of Guam and the Western
Pacific," paper distributed at the 15th Annual National Hurricane
Conference, Orlando, Florida, 13-16 April 1993).<P>

<H3><B>NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS GLOBAL WARMING WILL BOOST OZONE
DEPLETION. </B></H3> <P>

A UK Meteorological Office climate model shows that doubling
carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere would generate an
Antarctic-type ozone hole in the the Arctic. <P>

John Austin, Neil Butchart and Keith Shine, climate modellers
from the Met Office and Reading University, ran a model
simulating conditions in the stratosphere in a world where
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations had been allowed to
double - the kind of world, in other words, that we will be
living in within less than 50 years if we keep emitting carbon
dioxide at around present-day levels. <P>

The global warming predicted in the troposphere (the lower part
of the atmosphere) has the effect of cooling the stratosphere
(the upper part of the atmosphere). This cooling is compounded,
of course, by the ongoing loss of ozone in the stratosphere:
decreasing ozone, absorbing less solar ultraviolet radiation,
meaning less heating of the stratosphere. The main point is that
together, the two cooling effects promote the formation of polar
stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in much greater volumes than today. 
The profoundly bad news is that, in this new model, PSCs build up
to such an extent that an ozone hole akin to the one over
Antarctica appears in the northern hemisphere - an ozone hole
with nearly 100 percent ozone depletion in parts of the lower
stratosphere. <P>

Austin et al conclude: "During the next few decades, chlorine is
expected to increase then decrease, while carbon dioxide is
expected to increase continuously. It is therefore likely that a
combination of conditions will occur during the next 50 years
which will give rise to an Arctic ozone hole unless both carbon
dioxide and chlorine emissions are curbed." The authors also
conclude: "the occurrence of an Arctic ozone hole directly as a
result of increased carbon dioxide could be one of the most
serious consequences of climatic change." <P>

How long might it be before such an Arctic ozone hole might form?
Austin et al agree with other scientists' conclusions that a true
Antarctic-type ozone hole is not likely to form at today's level
of carbon dioxide (353 parts per million). Their simulation was
of a 660 ppm atmosphere. Clearly, there is a threshold - if the
model is right - somewhere between the two, beyond which the
ozone hole can appear. But they cannot say at which level. Note
too that the ozone hole in the doubled-carbon dioxide atmosphere
would not appear every winter. The authors figure maybe one
winter in five. <P>

Jerry Mahlman, a leading light of NOAA's climate- modelling team
at Princeton University, comments on the process Austin et al
describe as follows:  "When might we expect to see an Arctic
ozone hole? As significant Arctic ozone losses have already been
identified, one could argue that the process is already well
underway...."  "...it is safe to assume that the threat of an
Arctic ozone hole will be with us for a long time unless CO2,
chlorine and bromine emissions are brought substantially below
currently projected levels." <P>

(J. Austin, N. Butchart and K. Shine, "Possibility of an Arctic
ozone hole in a doubled-CO2 climate," Nature, v. 360, p. 221-225,
19 November 1992).<P>

NOTES: Many have hitherto assumed that there is no direct link
between the processes of global warming and ozone depletion. Now,
for the first time, enhanced global warming has been identified
as a likely route to accelerated ozone depletion. <P>

The new modelling shows that we force the planet to run two
terrible gauntlets if we continue with the planned emissions of
CFCS, HCFCs (and other ozone-depleters) and carbon dioxide.
First, the peak chlorine loading in the stratosphere will extend
as much as a decade or more longer than it needs to if industry
gets it way in "replacing" CFCs with HCFCs, so delaying recovery
of the ozone layer. Then, second - just as chlorine
concentrations finally begin to drop in the stratosphere - we
boost the potency of the ozone-depletion process, because
increased numbers of polar stratospheric clouds then begin to
form as carbon dioxide concentrations build towards the doubling
level. Recall that we must live with stratospheric chlorine- and
bromine loadings higher than the levels sufficient to trigger the
Antarctic ozone hole until well into the middle of the next
century - just the time around which we would be approaching
doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations, if we don't in the
interim succeed in moving rapidly away from business-as-usual
burning of fossil fuels. <P>

This result compounds the risk of emitting both carbon dioxide
and CFCs/HCFCs (and other ozone depleters) in the decades ahead.
It is as though we are choosing to sit next to a time-bomb
without knowing the time at which it is set. With HCFCs, we force
ourselves to sit next to the bomb for longer than we would need
to have done had we banned HCFCs at the same time we banned CFCs.
With carbon dioxide, we force ourselves to sit beside the bomb
still longer, while shaking it about, and increasing the potency
of the charge within it. Unless, that is, we can stop the
production and use of ozone-depleters, and begin an accelerated
programme of cuts in carbon dioxide emissions.<P>

The heavy flooding last summer is blamed for silting the water,
resulting in the death of sea grass, the primary food source for
the endangered sea mammals. Around 60 carcasses have already been
found but marine scientists believe the overall death toll is
more than 200. Dr. Tony Preen, research fellow at James Cook
University, says those that have been found alive are in a
"tragically emaciated condition" and suggests that it will be
many years before the population recovers. <P>

<H3><B>RAIN AT LAST IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. </B></H3><P>

After years of drought, southern Africa experiences its first
significant rainfall. However, because the land is so parched and
dry, most of the rain ran into rivers and is lost.  The dryness
of the land also means that much valuable topsoil is swept away. 
Serious floods result. Hopes of a successful growing season are
also diminished by an invasion of army worms. The worms are
reported to have attacked newly sprouted grass and crops and
caused extensive damage to maize and other harvests. <P>

Observation made by the Gwich'in Athabascan people include marked
changes in weather, hydrology, vegetation and animal distribution
patterns. The local people reported that the temperatures have
never been less extreme than currently being experienced during
their lifetimes. The treeline has migrated significantly to the
north and animal species once not present or rarely seen have
become common in the vicinity of this village, including black
bears, porcupines and moose.  The water level in lakes has
dropped and many streams are now clogged with vegetation,
reducing availability of certain fish species.  <P>

<H3><B>WARMER WORLD LIKELY TO BE WINDIER, SAYS UK MET. OFFICE
CHIEF. </B></H3> <P>

On the fifth anniversary of the UK's "great storm," the chief
executive of the Meteorological Office is among the eminent
meteorologists warning of the potential for more windiness to
come. A feature in New Scientist analyses the storm, which killed
19, cut 150,000 telephone lines, and felled 19 million trees. It
goes on to survey the beliefs of UK meteorologists about what
global warming will herald for the UK. <P>

Julian Hunt, chief executive of the Meteorological Office, offers
the view that "there may be a change in the storm pattern and
more windiness in some areas of the UK" (in the next century),
and "it seems quite likely it would be an erratic change and not
a smooth transition." <P>

The head of climate modelling at the Met Office's Hadley Centre,
John Mitchell, thinks that global warming could generate storms
nearer to Europe in the eastern Atlantic. "This means that they
will arrive in Britain in a far more powerful and dangerous
state," the article warns. "More water will have evaporated from
seas that have warmed with the climate, in turn causing wider
variations in atmospheric moisture and temperature, and so
stronger winds. ...If the world's weather is growing stormier,
the impact on Britain could be disastrous." <P>

The article stresses the potential for a return of a storm surge
on the scale of that of 1953, which killed 300 in the east of
England. With sea-level rise as predicted by the IPCC, "the risk
of a flood surge like that of 1953 has shortened considerably,
from one in every 150 years (in 1953) to one in every 35 years."
"Higher tides could overwhelm the Thames Barrier during storm
surges within the next 50 years." <P>

Scientist, 7 November 1992).<P>

A report by a team of scientists from Britain, China, and the
Netherlands points to wholesale disruption of agriculture and
ecosystems. The report, commissioned by the Worldwide Fund for
Nature, uses data made available for the first time to western
researchers by the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences. It
anticipates, by 2050, significant reduction in rice yields and
wheat production, and a halving of soya bean and sorghum
production. <P>

The Declaration from an October 1993 meeting of IPCC experts at
Woods Hole, Massachusetts, reads: <P>

"...the negative feedback mechanism of carbon dioxide
fertilisation is likely to diminish in relative importance as
carbon dioxide concentrations increase further and the positive
feedback mechanisms of temperature enhancing rates of respiration
(as well as production of methane and nitrous oxide) are likely
to become more important as the Earth warms. The result of these
consistent directional changes is that at the very least, the
biosphere will become less effective at sequestering
anthropogenically emitted carbon dioxide and other heat trapping
gases, and at the worst, the biosphere may become a growing
contributor to atmospheric accumulations of these gases."<P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING WILL INVOLVE CHANGING PATTERNS OF DISEASE.
</B></H3><P>

When climate patterns change, disease patterns also change,
especially those diseases that rely on an animal vector.  These
include malaria, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, elephantiasis
and many other diseases with vectors that rely on humans to
complete a part of their life cycle.  Research has shown that
even small changes in temperature can cause insect populations to
increase, coupled with the fact that the parasites inside the
insects can mature more quickly when temperatures are higher. <P>

The "rate of infection" is an estimate of how quickly a disease
will spread. A rate of one means that one person will infect one
other person, which will keep a disease ticking over, but will
not really cause any major problems on a population level.  Mumps
and diphtheria are more infectious, and the rate is about eight. 
Epidemics can quickly get going when the rates of infection are
high.  The rate of malaria is estimated to be about 90 - which is
why an increase in insect populations could have such a
devastating effect. <P>

In America and most of northern Europe, most of these serious
insect-vector diseases have been eradicated, and health
authorities have moved on to worrying about other things.  In
America in 1991, there were 1,000 cases of malaria, most of them
contracted abroad, but recently, there have been reports of
people getting malaria who were in contact with people who had
been abroad, but who had not been abroad themselves. <P>

Research in Oxford University on sleeping sickness (carried by
the tsetse fly) is underway to establish the links between
climate and outbreaks of the disease.  Results so far have not
been as predicted, mainly due to the fact that incidence of
disease and the tsetse, and climate, vary from region to region. 
In Zimbabwe, there were more tsetse in the hottest months of the
year.  Therefore, if global warming means that there is a rise of
even 1 oC in Zimbabwe, the disease will move up into the
country's highlands.  In other countries, such as Kenya and
Tanzania, it is the amount of vegetation that controls the
numbers of tsetse flies. <P>

Incidence of bilharzia (a nasty liver disease carried by water
snails that inhabit still water) has been increased by the number
of dams.  <P>

Another disease is Lyme disease, carried by a tick that lives on
deer.  In America, the numbers of deer have increased because
their habitats are being preserved, but there are fewer deer-
eating carnivores around to keep populations steady.  The more
deer there are, the more ticks, and the more ticks, the more Lyme
disease. <P>

Alfred Bloch, manager of catastrophe and reinsurance research for
Swiss Re, tells Business Insurance that as a result of global
warming, "I think what we can expect, but can't prove, is more
flooding due to more inland rain and rising seas." Bloch
anticipates more typhoons hitting Japan, and more hurricanes
hitting the US.<P>

Andrew Dlugolecki, chief manager of operations at General
Accident, agrees that there will be more frequent losses, and
that these may already be occurring. He observes that "if you
look at the temperature trend in the UK, for example, you can see
that there has been warming over the past 32 years. And looking
at records that go back 300 years, we can see that there is a
tendency for warmer weather to be associated with a higher
frequency in storms." And since the 1960s, the number of

<H3><B>CLIMATE CHANGE WORSENS PROBLEM OF EXOTIC SPECIES
TRANSPORTED IN BALLAST WATER. </B></H3> <P>

In recent years the full extent of the ecological problems caused
by transporting alien species to new environments in ships'
ballast water has become clear. In Tasmania for example, such
aliens have included toxic dinoflagellates responsible for the
intermittent closure of shell fisheries, and Japanese starfish
which have predated local bivalves. <P>

The director of the Australian Bureau of Rural Resources has
described the problem of such stowaway species as "chronic,
irreversible, and cumulative." Earlier this year, New Scientist
reports, two Canadian scientists, Thea Smith and Steve Kerr of
the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, warned that climate change
would make matters much worse. Ballast water would allow "novel
varieties of organisms to test their ability to colonize newly
transformed environments, they said. <P>

Phytoplankton exposed to a broad range of irradiance treatments,
according to experimenters, show that UV-A radiation (320 to 400
nanometres wavelength) "significantly inhibits the photosynthesis
of a marine diatom and a dinoflagellate., and that the effects of
UVB are even more severe." The results are extrapolated to find
out how this might translate into suppression of near-surface
photosynthetic activity below the Antarctic ozone hole, and 12 to
15 percent is the result. <P>

<H3><B>UK GOVERNMENT'S CONSERVATION ADVISORS PROPOSE RETREAT FROM
SEA. </B></H3> <P>

English Nature advise that the sea must be allowed to breach many
UK sea walls, both for ecological and economic reasons. Geoff
Radley, head of English Nature's coastal task force, reports that
"rising tides have destroyed a quarter of the salt marshes of
Essex in the past 15 years. Now they are threatening the sea
walls that protect the farmland behind the marshes... The sea
walls built or raised after the 1953 floods are now reaching the
end of their lives." <P>

In a new report, English Nature argues that building the walls
higher will only cause erosion of the salt marshes in front of
them, which are the first line of defence against the sea. The
best option is to organize a "managed retreat," where new walls
are built further inland, allowing new salt marsh to be created
in the buffer zone between old and new sea walls. English Nature
has begun the first experiment in managed retreat, on a part of
the Essex coast. Along the Essex coast tides are 3 to 5 cm higher
each succeeding year. Britain's spending on flood defences is
currently £60 million per year, and is slated to rise. <P>

October 1992).<P>

<H3><B>AVALANCHE RISK FROM RAPIDLY THAWING ALPINE PERMAFROST.
</B></H3><P>

Swiss glaciologists have estimated the rates of glacier mass loss
during the twentieth century at 0.3 to 0.4 metres/year probably
one order of magnitude higher than in late glacial times, being
significantly higher in the 1980s.  <P>

Permafrost in the Swiss Alps is warming at a rate of 0.5 to 1ÉC
every 100 years, but in the 1980s the warming was  almost
equivalent to this in just ten years. If the warming continues,
this means that permafrost slopes below 3,000 metres above sea
level will thaw within the next 50 years and become unstable.
Several mountain tourist resorts will be directly threatened by
increased risk of avalanche.  <P>

The study confirms other work which suggested the extent of
Alpine ice is at its lowest extent for 5,000 years. "Warming of
Alpine permafrost since the late 1980s as observed in a borehole
drilled in 1987 appears to have accelerated by a factor of about
5 to 10 as compared with reconstructed secular permafrost warming
(about 1oC/century). <P>

(Prof W. Haeberli, "Accelerated glacier and permafrost changes in
the Alps," presentation given at International Conference on
Mountain Environments in Changing Climates, Davos, Switzerland,
October 11-16, 1992).<P>

"With due consideration to the feedback mechanisms affecting
glacier mass balance and of the delayed response related to
permafrost warming and degradation, secular Alpine glacier and
permafrost warming changes seem to be comparable with estimated
rates of anthropogenic greenhouse forcing." Prof W. Haeberli<P>

<H3><B>GLACIERS MAY CONTRIBUTE LESS TO SEA-LEVEL RISE THAN
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. </B></H3> <P>

Revised sea-level estimates by Dutch researchers are
significantly lower than the IPCC's.  Although a fairly small
amount of land ice is stored in glaciers and small ice caps
compared to the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica
(probably only equivalent to a global sea level rise of between
0.3 and 0.7 metres), they are thought to be important for sea
level variations on smaller time scales (decades or centuries).
Since global sea levels have risen by 10-20 cm over the last 100
years, attempts have been made to find out how much of this has
been from glaciers (mountain glaciers have been retreating all
over the world since the nineteenth century). <P>

Oerlemans and Fortuin use an energy-balance model to assess how
much mass is lost or gained from a glacier on an annual basis. 
They argue that glacier melt resulting from increasing
temperatures could be offset by a higher rainfall.  They
investigated this on 12 glaciers by using the model to see what
would happen if rainfall increased by 10 percent for 1 oC
warming. 
On a global scale, sea level rise would be reduced to 0.329 mm
per year. "It thus appears that even a significant increase in
precipitation cannot compensate for increased melting, and
further shrinkage of glaciers and small ice caps must occur in a
warmer climate." <P>

(J. Oerlemans and J.P.F. Fortuin, "Sensitivity of glaciers and
small ice caps to greenhouse warming," Science, v. 258, p.
115_117, 2 October 1992).<P>

in the gradient between an area prone to low pressure centred
near Iceland, and an area prone to high pressure near the Azores.
The pressure gradient between the two has grown over the last 30
years. Winds could have been blowing more persistently in one
direction, as a result, raising higher waves, rather than blowing
more strongly but frequently changing direction, discouraging the
growth of waves. Bacon considered this, however, "only a quarter
of an explanation," and professed that there were certainly too
few data to impute any link with climate change.<P>

("Higher Atlantic waves puzzle researchers," The Independent, 27
August 1992).<P>

Bacon later said: "The waves now are fantastically high on
average. And why? Goodness knows. What pings around in the brain
is the greenhouse effect." ("Waiting for the hurricane;
Indications are that global warming offers the world a stormy
future", The Gazette (Montreal), 16 January 1993).<P>

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>HURRICANE ANDREW, THE MOST EXPENSIVE US DISASTER EVER,
HITS FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA. </B></H3> <P>

Insured losses hit a new world record of $16.5 billion, and a
storm track 20 miles north would have made it at least $50
billion worse. <P>

Andrew reaches storm intensity on August 17 and crashes into the
Bahamas on August 23. The hurricane continues west and runs into
Florida on the morning of August 24. With sustained winds of 145
mph, gusting to 175 mph, Andrew kills 23 people and costs at
least  $20 billion in total economic losses. It leaves 250,000
temporary homeless, some 10 percent of the population of Dade
County. (E. N. Rappaport and R. B. Sheets, "A meteorological
analysis of Hurricane Andrew," in "Lessons of Hurricane Andrew,"
Special Publication of the 15th Annual National Hurricane
Conference, April 13-16 1993, Orlando Florida). <P>

Andrew is the third most intense hurricane to hit land in the US
this century. Nonetheless, it is "only" a Category 4 hurricane
(winds of 131 to 155 mph), not Category 5. 23 fatalities is a
relatively low total. The worst US hurricane for fatalities was
in 1900, when 6,000 died in Galveston. Other strong hurricanes
included Camille (1969), with winds of 175 mph, gusts near 200
mph, and a storm surge (a dome of water accompanying the storm as
it moved ashore) 25 feet higher than the normal tides, with waves
atop that.  <P>

Dr Robert Sheets, Director of the National Hurricane Center,
later testified that "had Andrew been displaced only 20 miles
north of its westward track over South Florida, two different
studies show that losses would have exceeded $75 billion in
Southeast Florida alone. A continuation of the same storm track
across Florida could have created a nightmare storm at New
Orleans, putting that city under 18 to 20 feet of water. Total
property damage would have been far in excess of $100 billion.
The Florida Insurance Commissioner told me that if New Orleans
had been struck the nation's insurance industry would have been
bankrupt and it is reasonable to assume that losses from rising
waters would far exceed the reserves of the Federal flood
insurance programme."  <P>

(R. Sheets, "Catastrophic hurricanes may become frequent events
along the United States east and Gulf Coasts," testimony
presented 29 April 1993 to the Senate Government Affairs
Committee, updated as a paper presented to Lloyd's of London,
December 1993).<P>

NOTES: The insurance industry is singularly vulnerable to
increased storminess in a warming world. A study by the US All-
Industry Research Advisory Council noted that as of 1988 "insured
property exposures to the first tier of coastal counties (Gulf
and Atlantic coasts of U.S.) came to $1.86 trillion, an increase
of 64% over the 1980 total." Such a trend, even allowing for
inflation, is "a phenomenal figure, and it does not include flood
insurance!" (R. Sheets, "Catastrophic hurricanes may become
frequent events along the United States east and Gulf Coasts,"
testimony presented 29 April 1993 to the Senate Government
Affairs Committee, updated as a paper presented to Lloyd's of
London, December 1993). <P>

The impact of Hurricane Andrew on the Lloyd's market illustrates
the extent to which such exposures are international. As the
Observer put it on 2 August 1992, some two weeks before Andrew,
"the time has come when sane people question whether this 304-
year old will survive to the next century, let alone
traditionalists' dreams of a fourth century."  Despite the losses
from 1988 to 1991, Lloyd's received £1 billion in new Names'
money in 1992. But real concerns for the capital base of the
market crystallized with its renewed huge losses from Hurricane
Andrew.<P>

A succession of hot and humid summers has encouraged non-native
insects and spiders to colonise parts of the UK. (Sunday Times, 2
August 1992).<P>

Meanwhile, butterflies and aphids are changing their behavioural
patterns in response to climate change, breeding at different
times due to warming temperatures, and, since not all plants are
temperature controlled, are needing to change some of their
dietary preferences. ("Wildlife brings warning of changes in
climate," The Times, 8 August 1992; "Butterfly that went bananas
heralds a warmer world," The Times, 13 August 1992).<P>

Humid and warm weather throughout July and into August has
provided an ideal environment for cat fleas to breed.  It is
expected that these cat fleas will infest thousands of British
homes. ("Humid weather brings threat of cat flea plague," The
Independent, 12 August 1992).<P>

<H3><B>MIGRATING BIRDS TO SPREAD VIRUSES AND DISEASES IN A
WARMING WORLD?   </B></H3> <P>

Recent research has shown that rare diseases (like tick- borne
encephalitis) may be spread by migrating birds. This would
explain some of these disease patterns along certain bird
migration routes.  However, some diseases are being introduced
into new regions as new ecological niches open (or old ones
close) to birds as a result of climate change.  <P>

It is possible that these diseases could develop new variants by
natural selection that are more serious, or even fatal, than the
originals.  One virus (the KFD virus) is only found in the
Kyasanur Forest region of India, and is now a regular cause of
disease for people in the area. It is possible that it  was
introduced by a migrating bird.  Hence, it is possible that
changing climate may have very serious consequences for disease
patterns in both humans and animals. <P>

borne viruses?" NERC News, v. 22, July 1992).<P>

<H3><B>BILLIONS TO DIE AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE NEXT
CENTURY? </B></H3>
<P>

Two German researchers, in a report for the European Commission,
estimate that the total costs of climate change resulting from a
doubling of carbon dioxide will exceed $900 trillion ($900
thousand billion). <P>

The researchers, Olav Hohmeyer and Michael Gartner, are from the
Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in
Karlsruhe. They base their estimates on the following scenarios
and cost evaluations. For the value of human life, they use an
estimate based on the valuation implicit in the remuneration
people expect for risking their lives in dangerous situations.
The figure they use, which they call "a very conservative
estimate," is $1 million. For the value of productive land, they
use the value of such land in the USA, $30,000 per hectare. As
regards the number of deaths, they conclude that by 2030 (the
time of doubling of concentrations of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases, assuming business-as- usual emissions), the
following are "likely":<P>

     Starvation:  an extra 900 to 1,800 million deaths<P>

     Storms:  an extra 1.3 million deaths<P>

     Heat stress:  an extra 1.3 million deaths<P>

     Tropical diseases:  an extra 540,000 deaths<P>

And costs including the following:<P>

Land lost to sea level rise (18 cm at the time of carbon dioxide
doubling), totalling 60 to 220 million square km of productive
land: $2.4 trillion.   Valued assets affected by sea-level rise
(2.4% of the world market valued assets): $530 billion.   Storm
damage: an extra $20 billion per year, meaning $200 billion over
the period.<P>

The authors emphasize that they consider their estimates
conservative, and that they have necessarily omitted many
incalculable factors, such as the loss of biodiversity and other
damage to ecosystems. <P>

So warns Munich Re's Head of Geoscience Research. Dr Gerhard Berz
says "the present problems will be dramatically aggravated if the
greenhouse predictions come true. The increased intensity of all
convective processes in the atmosphere will force up the
frequency and severity of tropical cyclones, tornadoes,
hailstorms, floods and storm surges in many parts of the world
with serious consequences for all types of property insurance.
...In areas of high insurance density the loss potential of
individual catastrophes can reach a level where the national and
international insurance industries run into serious capacity
problems." <P>

Research has shown that incidence of Asian tiger mosquitos, which
are known to carry "eastern equine encephalitis" is rising in
America.  It has been found in 24 states, and breeds, like other
mosquitos, in pools of stagnant water. <P>

("Mosquito is linked to deadly virus, worrying health officials,"

NOTES: A 1989 study by the EPA identified five of the numerous
mosquito-borne diseases as potential risks to the USA. These are
malaria, dengue fever, encephalitides induced by arbovirus,
yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever. Rocky Mountain spotted fever
and Lyme disease could also spread northwards. <P>

<H3><B>WARMING REPORTED IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC. </B></H3><P>

Results of a 42 year set of temperature readings off southern
California show significant warming, to surprising depth. Over
the period, temperatures in the upper 100 metres of the sea off
California have warmed by fully 0.8 C. Temperatures have also
risen "significantly" down to depths of about 300 metres. <P>

The time-series data showing this trend were recorded at stations
30 to 60 kilometres apart, on a grid extending from Point
Conception north of Los Angeles south to La Jolla, down to depths
of 500 metres in water up to four kilometres deep. The warming
falls off rapidly below (around) 100 metres, to 0.2 degrees C at
200 metres, and 0.1 degrees C or less at 300 metres and below.
Warming of about 0.1 degrees C is still detectable at 500 metres.
<P>


Dean Roemmich, the Scripps scientist reporting the data,
observes: "Although this temperature signal and the associated
rise in steric height are not implausibly above the background
level of decadal variability, the trend observed in the past 42
years is a matter for both strong concern and interest." <P>

<H3><B>ONE THIRD OF WORLD'S CORAL REEFS TO DISAPPEAR WITHIN 20

Australian marine scientist, Dr Clive Wilkinson, from the
Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville, says
climate change and contamination will destroy one third of the
world's coral reefs within 20 years two thirds of reefs within 40
years.  Wilkinson believes that reefs in the Philippines,
Thailand, Malaysia, Java, the Caribbean, east Africa and Florida
will be gone within the 20 year period. Coral experts believe
that coral reefs may be deteriorating faster than the world's
tropical forests. <P>

Executive member of the Pacific Science Association, Dr Lou
Eldridge, says the recent phenomenon of mass coral bleaching, is
serious, unexpected (like the ozone hole) and showed that
tropical reef ecosystems are extremely sensitive even to tiny
increases in ocean temperatures. <P>

So NASA and Columbia University researchers conclude in a new
study. Previous studies organized by the US Environmental
Protection Agency based on GCMs, have given "alarming" results,
including estimated crop production decreases of some 30% and
forest biomass of 40% in the US, Dr. Rind of NASA and his
colleagues point out. But these results depend crucially on the
hydrological cycles embedded in the models. Rind et al compare
GCM and impact models, and find a high degree of variability in
the treatment of hydrology. They conclude that "to engender
consistent and appropriate models, we must foster a community of
modellers, concerned both with climate changes and impacts (IPCC
Working Groups I and II)." <P>

<H3><B>WINTER RAINFALL IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME STEADILY
DRIER SINCE 1930. </B></H3> <P>

Average rainfall in a 30,000 square kilometre area of southwest
Australia has fallen by at least 22 percent, in some areas by a
third. City and regional water supplies are at risk; the state's
capital, Perth, already has a precarious water supply.  <P>

Dr Robert Allan from CSIRO's Climate Impact Group says
"plausibly, the decline in rainfall may be due to one or more of
three possible causes: natural long-term variations in the
climate system governing rainfall in the region; a random
fluctuation in rainfall patterns; and climatic changes resulting
from global warming or the enhanced greenhouse effect." <P>

<H3><B>PACIFIC LEADERS PLEAD FOR CLIMATE ACTION AT THE EARTH
SUMMIT. </B></H3> <P>

For example, the Honourable Solomon Sunaone Mamaloni, Prime
Minister of Solomon Islands, had this to say in his speech. "It
is frightening for us in the Pacific to be told by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that with the sea level
rising at the rate of 6 cm per decade, by the end of next century
the sea level will have risen between 40 - 110 cm.  In practical
terms, it means by the end of the next century many of our atolls
and their inhabitants will have vanished from the face of the
earth.  This frightening prediction calls for the developed
countries to seriously adhere to the provisions of the convention
which require them to take steps to limit emission of greenhouse
gases." <P>

After 18 months of negotiations, 157 governments signed the
Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Earth Summit. The
agreed objective of the convention is to "stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which
would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system." This is reinforced with a sentence which
stipulates that such a goal should be achieved "within a
timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to
climate change, to ensure food production is not threatened and
to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable
manner." To achieve that objective, however, would require deep
cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and the agreed commitments fall
far short of this. <P>

(Sunaone Mamaloni, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, Statement
to the UNCED Earth Summit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 3-14 June
1992).<P>

NOTES: In the run up to the Earth Summit, governments had
recognized the threat of climate change in innumerable individual
publications and joint declarations. Some of these refer darkly
to threats to a viable future for life on the planet and read in
places not unlike the rhetorical essays of environmentalists. As
long ago as 1988, an intergovernmental declaration at a
conference in Toronto spoke of global warming posing risks
"second only to nuclear war." The Final Report of the Advisory
panel on Environment and Culture to the Environment Agency of
Japan, "Towards the creation of an Environment-Friendly Culture,"
April 1991, concluded that if humans continue using natural
resources including fossil fuels at today's rates: "We run the
risk of creating a crisis which will not stop with the ruin of
one country, but will cause the destruction of the entire planet
and every living thing on it."<P>

A US report suggests that these might force abandonment despite
protective measures against sea level rise. The six month study
by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the
first of 25 case studies under preparation for the IPCC. It shows
that protecting the shoreline for two study areas alone on the
Marshalls would, under one scenario of sea level rise, cost $127
million. more than four times the current GDP. Such costs are
clearly prohibitive. Among the adaptive measures considered was
the concept of "floating cities" in the lagoons, platforms which
would provide tourist accommodations and safe- havens from
storms. <P>

Citing a State Department document "US Views on Global Climate
Change," it reviews the arguments of the sceptics, and the
counter arguments, and concludes as follows: "The philosophy that
many scientists contacted by Science are now espousing amounts to
buying some insurance - in the form of no-cost or low- cost
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions - against the possibility
that the higher predictions of global warming turn out to be
right or some nasty surprise is lurking in the greenhouse. And
that notion seems to be catching on at last in the White House."

Idaho is suffering its worst drought on record. The Missouri
river, in Montana, is running at half its normal May level and
normally wet Seattle introduces water rationing. Unusually warm
winter weather in Seattle, over 5 oC above the average, causes
rain to fall instead of snow and lessens dam collection. The snow
that did fall has already melted instead of contributing, as
usual, to spring water supplies. <P>

WARMING. </B></H3> <P>

UNESCO says a set of  124-year old temperature records, first
taken by the Dutch colonial government in Indonesia, show that
the mean monthly temperature between 1866 and 1990 increased by
1.66ÉC. <P>

Roger Harger, the coordinator for environmental programs at
UNESCO's Regional Office for Science and Technology in Southeast
Asia, if the records were extrapolated to cover the years 1850 to
2000, the temperature increases would reach 2ÉC, a significant
increase. <P>

In Indonesia, currently suffering from drought, the average
number of dry months has increased from 4.4 per year at the
beginning of the century to 5.4 today. Dry months are defined as
a month with less than 100 mm of rain or the amount need to
sustain rice production on the island. <P>

General, Leaupepe Sanerivi, goes to the climate negotiations in
New York in May 1992 to draw attention to his country's plight.

three cyclones in the past four years, each of a ferocity that is
supposed to occur every 80-100 years." <P>

<H3><B>DEEP WATER WARMING IN PARTS OF THE TASMAN SEA.
</B></H3><P>

Temperatures have risen by 0.04 oC in an area between Australia
and New Zealand, 43 deg. S and by 0.0 oC at 28 deg. S, over the
past 22 years. <P>

In 1967, an American research vessel had completed an
oceanographic survey across the Pacific Ocean between Australia
and Chile. The cruise measured salinity and temperature from
near-surface waters to deep ocean depths of 4.5 km. Now a
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
(CSIRO) vessel has retraced part of the earlier cruise. <P>

Although the observed warming since the 1960s appears to be
slight, the difference is highly significant. Long-term rises,
however small in the deep interior of the ocean are less likely
than observed changes in air and surface water temperatures to be
the consequence of natural variability. The two researchers on
the vessel, Dr Nathanial Bindoff and Dr John Church, while
cautiously pointing out that conclusive evidence will only be
found with long term monitoring, conclude that human-induced
climate change is the most plausible explanation. (Brett Wright,
"Unravelling the climate-change conundrum," Ecos, v.74, Summer
1992). <P>

In a sister paper, Bindoff concludes "Similar observations in the
North Atlantic show comparable changes in the thermal structure
and water mass volumes, but further measurements in other regions
are required before firm conclusions can be drawn about the
global significance of these changes." (N. Bindoff, "Warming of
the water column in the southwest Pacific Ocean," Nature, v. 357,
pp 59-62, 7 May 1992).<P>

In the aftermath of Cyclones Ofa and Val - two devastating
cyclones within less than two years - Western Samoa's only fire
and general insurer, National Pacific Insurance, announces it
will be removing all cover once existing policies ran out. The
company has invited clients to reapply only if they obtain an
engineer's certification that their properties had been rendered
cyclone-
 proof. For most, this is impossible, even if they could then
afford the subsequent substantially-increased premiums. In
neighbouring American Samoa, Travelers Insurance Company
similarly withdraws cyclone cover. <P>

<H3><B>W.H.O. SAYS MALARIA COULD SPREAD TO MILLIONS IN A WARMING
WORLD. </B></H3> <P>

A World Health Organisation report concludes that "global warming
could cause the spread of malaria and other tropical diseases to
millions of people presently free of them." <P>

"The organization's task group of independent experts has
recommended that national health authorities prepare for the
possible consequences of the greenhouse effect, and launch
education campaigns to alert the general public to them. ...Local
changes that increase warmth and rainfall are `highly likely' to
create more favourable conditions for the insects, allowing them
to breed in much larger numbers, and live longer... Some areas
which before were free of insects may become breeding zones; and
epidemics among non-immune populations caused by imported malaria
parasites may occur. ...."<P>

The risk of spread of diseases is classified as follows by the
WHO: <P>

 - Malaria: highly likely; Schistosomiasis (snail fever): very
likely; Dengue fever: very likely; Lymphatic filariasis, or
elephantiasis: likely; Onchocerciasis (river blindness): likely;
African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness): likely; Japanese
encaphalitis: expected. <P>

 - Also possible: Leishmaniases (oriental sore), Dracuncunliasis
(river blindness). <P>

 - Also at risk of spreading in a worst-case analysis, combining
direct with indirect effects: Tuberculosis, leprosy, measles and
other childhood diseases. <P>

Malaria already threatens 2,100 million people, and 270 million
are infected. Each year there are more than 100,000 new cases,
and in Africa alone malaria kills half a million children a year.
Malaria was endemic in Europe and parts of  North America until
relatively recently.  <P>

Organisation Commission on Health and the Environment, April

</B></H3><P>

Meanwhile, England is facing its fourth successive year of
serious water shortage.  Forty rivers are very low or completely
dry. The National Rivers Authority predicts that there will be
continued drought in the summer of 1992.  Domestic water use has
increased by 70% over the last 30 years, mainly due to modern
machines like dishwashers that use an excess of water.  The
question must be asked as to whether climate change is a threat
to long-term water security in the UK.  <P>

The UK's Climate Change Review Group has stated that the UK could
face many years of water shortages and drought if global warming
continues. However, regardless of this, the Water Services
Association claimed "it's far too early to assess even whether
climate change is occurring at all, far less to assess its
implications for such a long-term industry.  The water industry
is not concerned, and won't be so foolish as to rush out to
invest heavily in measures designed to cope with what may be a
short-term problem."  <P>

<H3><B>SWISS RE GLOBAL WARMING TEAM EXPANDS ON STAKES.
</B></H3><P>

Swiss Re by now has a specialist Greenhouse Effect Project Team
working on the greenhouse effect. It's April 1992 internal report
elaborates on the risks posed by about climate change, for a
range of catastrophes, not just windstorm. Where windstorm is
concerned, the report concludes: "the exposure of important
concentrations of values such as New York or Tokyo can rise
sharply with serious consequences for the industry." (Greenhouse
Effect Project Team, "Greenhouse effect scenarios for Swiss Re,"
Swiss Re internal report, April 1992).<P>

  Inundation: Pointing to the agreement of climate models that
increase in temperature largely correlates with increased
rainfall, the report concludes that "over middle to high
latitudes the processes of convection will tend to accelerate and
intensify. More and more abundant rainfalls of shorter duration
are expected and, therefore, also more inundations." If winter
precipitation leads to more snow, and its melting coincides with
intensive spring rains, the overlap could lead to "extreme"
increase in the risk of inundation.  This warning seems all the
more sobering in the wake of costly floods resulting from
"tropical"-type downpours in England during September 1992, and
the ruinous floods in the Indus valley in Pakistan.<P>

NOTES: In an earlier publication, Swiss Re had drawn attention to
the potential for climate change to amplify risk from inundation
by acting in concert with deforestation in mountain areas to
boost peak discharge. Deforested areas - including pastures, ski-
slopes and paths - absorb far less rainfall than forested slopes.
The human community is enhancing deforestation in most mountain
areas, and has been for some time. <P>

Meanwhile, warm clouds contain far more water vapour than cool
clouds, and the world has been warming.  Calculating peak load
for a 10m wide river 125 years ago, compared to today, Swiss Re's
analysts found that the combination of increased water vapour and
decreased absorption burdens today's river - for a given set of
realistic assumptions concerning other parameters - with 400,000
cubic metres more water. This was one of the factors that might
have contributed to the ruinous flood damage in the Alps during
July and August 1987, they argued. More importantly, the quicker
the world warms, the more the risk is amplified. <P>

("The Force of Water," Swiss Re special publication, 1988).<P>

  Thunderstorms, hailstorms, and tornadoes: The inundation risk
stands to be intensified by regional storms (thunderstorms, hail
and tornadoes). "At middle latitudes where these storms occur,"
the report concludes, "a less stable atmospheric layering is
expected in future. Both frequency and intensity of such storms
will therefore increase ...The link with the hazard of inundation
following heavy rain ...is obvious. ...it must be assumed that
the effects will reinforce each other."<P>

NOTES: The 1993 Mississippi floods, and the European floods of
December 1993, would bear this conclusion out very quickly. Where
tornadoes are concerned, 1992 was a record year in the United
States, with 1,381 reported. The figure for 1991 was 1,133.<P>

  Landslides and mudflows: Landslide- and mudflow-risk would be
enhanced by increased inundation, the Swiss Re Greenhouse Effect
Project Team argue. Furthermore, in the polar regions and the
Alps, thawing of permafrost would add substantially to the
risk.<P>

NOTES: Swiss scientists reported in 1988 that permafrost, found
above 2,700m in the Swiss Alps, was already showing signs of
dramatic shrinkage. ("Receding alpine permafrost," World Climate
News, WMO, no 2, January 1993).<P>

  Storm surges: These form on the seas where high tides coincide
with strong winds. The Swiss Re Greenhouse Effect Project Team
conclude as follows. "If storm paths shift southward (European
storms) or northwards (tropical cyclones on the Northern
Hemisphere) more and higher storm surges must be expected, also
in regions with little present exposure." With sea levels
expected to rise in future, areas of particular risk will be low-
lying cities where subsidence is also in progress. Swiss Re lists
London and Venice as cities at particular risk.<P>

  Drought and bushfire: "Some regions will experience less rain
in the summer, such as continental areas north of the subtropical
dry zone, in particular the middle west of the USA, the south of
the former Soviet Union and the entire Mediterranean basin. These
regions may, therefore, experience an increase in drought
catastrophes." With that, the Swiss Re Greenhouse Effect Project
Team observed, the risk of bush and forest fires increases.<P>

NOTES: In recent years, the warmest years of the century, the
spectre of catastrophic wildfires indeed seems to have grown. The
casebook since 1987 gives a feel for the kind of catastrophes
that the global-warming world might expect to encounter on a
regular, growing, and escalating basis. In April 1987, one of
largest fires in recorded history erupted in tinder-dry larch
forest in eastern Siberia. It destroyed the town of Xilinji and
over 11 million hectares of Siberian forest. In the summer of
1988, after practically no rain in June, July or August, almost
half the forest in Yellowstone Park was lost to fires. In 1989,
it was Canada's turn. Drought in Manitoba led to the loss of 2.7
million hectares of forest to the worst fires ever experienced in
that state. Some 5% of Manitoba's land area was affected, and
over 25,000 people, from dozens of Manitoba towns, became
refugees.<P>

<H3><B>NORTH ATLANTIC SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE
RAPIDLY. </B></H3> <P>

In the past, they have changed by as much as 5oC in fewer than 40
years. Scientists studying isotopic and faunal changes in
sediment cores from the deep North Atlantic discover  rapid
changes in temperature during climatic oscillations experienced
during the last deglaciation, around 11,000 to 10,000 years ago,
(while the world was in the process of warming by some 5 oC on
average, overall, over a period of several thousand years). The
study involves cores from the Norwegian Sea, and it seems that it
was a sudden change in the flow of warm Atlantic surface water
into the Norwegian Sea which was responsible for the warming. <P>

(S. J. Lehman and L. D. Keigwin, "Sudden changes in North
Atlantic circulation during the last deglaciation," Nature, v.
356, p. 757-762, 30 April 1992. See also R. Zain, "Deep ocean
circulation puzzle," Nature, v. 356, p. 744-746, 30 April
1992).<P>

NOTES: In the modern Atlantic there is a type of "conveyor belt"
circulation wherein warm water from the tropics flows north,
there to evaporate, hence grow more saline, hence become more
dense, hence to sink. This salinity/density change is what drives
deep circulation in the world ocean. Some oceanographers think
this pattern of circulation can be turned on and off. One way to
do this is by the melting of ice-sheets, which spread fresh, low-
density water across the ocean surface, switching off the
conveyor belt. The result is cooling of the atmosphere, further
buildup of ice, and the reappearance of warm water currents
derived from the tropics - until the next big melt.<P>

<H3><B> 90 PERCENT OF WILDLIFE IN ZIMBABWE'S DROUGHT AREAS FACE

Meanwhile riots break out in city food queues.  The rainy season
of December to April saw just 50mm of rain this year, compared to
the normal 540 mm. In the 1983 drought, 80% of the game animals
in the Gonarezhou National Park died. Then, there was still some
surface water left. This time, there is essentially none. <P>

A wildlife manager reports that "unless it rains I don't believe
there are going to be any animals left in the lowveld (lowlands
of southeast Zimbabwe, including the Gonarezhou National Park) by
September." There are 200 hippos in Gonarezhou, and at least 13
have already died. They cannot tolerate sunshine: if they are
exposed, their skin blisters and cracks, and they dehydrate and
die. <P>

The badly-hit maize crop, meanwhile, has meant food queues in
several cities, and the riot police have been called in to quell
riots. <P>

<H3><B>STUDY SUGGESTS THREAT OF FAMINE FOR ONE IN EIGHT WITHIN 50
YEARS. </B></H3> <P>

A prominent IPCC scientist concludes that food security is to be
more imperilled than was thought to be the case in 1990.
Professor Martin Parry of the University of Oxford, in a report
for the United Nations, estimates a decline of between 10 and 15
percent in grain yields in Africa, tropical Latin America and
much of India and southeast Asia. According to the latest models
from the UK Met Office and NASA's Goddard Lab, most of the
world's important food crops will be hit by global warming. The
Met Office model also infers reduced yields in North America,
something which Parry believes would substantially raise grain
prices. His study differs from one completed for IIASA just two
years ago. Says Parry: "the change is much more negative than I
had previously guessed. ...Within 50 years, one in eight of the
world's population could be at risk of famine." <P>

April 1992).<P>

<H3><B>BARBADIAN INSURER WARNS OF A CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN.
</B></H3><P>

William Tomlin, general manager of one of the Caribbean's biggest
insurance brokers, General and Marine, paints a grim picture of
the problems at the US National Hurricane Conference in Orlando,
Florida. <P>

Finding enough capacity for his clients' insurances has suddenly
become "a nightmare," he says, and the impacts on economies, in
island nations heavily dependent on tourism, are appalling. 1993
policies require rates of 2% or more on the property insured. On
top of that come deductibles of 2%. How are existing
policyholders reacting? Cancelling or reducing coverage in many
cases, according to Tomlin. This in turn is leading to problems
for banks and other financial institutions, who "are quickly
realising their potential exposure from the very high hurricane
deductible and the fact that some of their mortgagees are
cancelling or reducing coverage." <P>

(William Tomlin, "Insurance and mitigation: problems of
reinsurance,"  Paper presented at the US National Hurricane
Conference, Orlando, Florida, 13 April 1993).<P>

NOTES: A rate of 2% means that if the property is hit by a
hurricane, the policyholder must pay 2% of the sum insured (not
2% of the claim).<P>

<H3><B>CLIMATE CHANGE COULD REVERSE EUROPEAN FOREST EXPANSION
</B></H3><P>

Kauppi et al conclude that forest growth in Europe has increased
by 30 percent over the last 20 years, although their estimate is
hampered by the fact that good survey data are available for only
one third of European forests.  But expansion of temperate
forests would fit the need for a sink in the land biota: only
growing forests, and/or forests responding to the putative
"fertilization effect", can sequester carbon on the scale needed
to soak up a billion tonnes or more. Temperate forests growing
back after being levelled in the 18th and 19th centuries could
fit the bill. <P>

Kauppi et al conclude: "This information seemingly contradicts
the commonly held view of a forest decline in Europe. ...A
decline of forest resources in Europe is a threat for the future,
not a historical fact." They also warn, however: "Severe climatic
perturbations could alter the picture. Thereafter, the favourable
development of forest resources is at risk." <P>

<TITLE>OCEAN SINK FOR CARBON DIOXIDE MAY BE BIGGER THAN THE LAND

<H3><B>OCEAN SINK FOR CARBON DIOXIDE MAY BE BIGGER THAN THE LAND
SINK. </B></H3> <P>

Around twice as much carbon is emitted by fossil-fuel burning and
deforestation as ends up in the atmosphere. Some 7 billion tonnes
of carbon comes from fossil-fuel and forest-burning, and we know
that only 3.4 billion tonnes of carbon stays up in the atmosphere
as carbon dioxide each year. How much of the rest goes into the
land-plant sink, and how much goes into the ocean sink, has in
detail always been a mystery. <P>

A new estimate for carbon uptake suggests 2.1 billion tonnes of
carbon goes into the oceans, with a billion tonnes of carbon
going into the land sink. This new estimate differs with earlier
studies which estimated that only a billion tonnes of carbon are
being taken up by the oceans, with more than two going into land
plants. <P>

Science magazine, in a commentary on the issue, elaborates on the
implications of this work with respect to biological  feedbacks:
"Whatever is going on, researchers are eager to sort it out
before one or more of these mysterious sinks stops working. The
fertilization effect of carbon dioxide, for example, might run up
against some physiologic limit. Then the excess carbon would come
out of hiding, suddenly turning up in the atmosphere."  <P>

This new study uses carbon isotopes. Both fossil fuels and plants
are lighter in carbon-13 than atmospheric carbon dioxide, so that
the decrease in carbon-13 over time in ocean waters gives a
measure of how much anthropogenic carbon dioxide (i.e. from
fossil-fuel and forest-burning) is being taken up by  ocean
waters. <P>

(P. D. Quay, B. Tilbrook and C. S. Wong, "Oceanic uptake of
fossil fuel CO2: carbon-13 evidence," Science, v. 256, p. 74, 3
April 1992; "Fugitive carbon dioxide: its' not hiding in the
ocean," Science, v. 256, p. 35, 3 April 1992).<P>

NOTES: The continuing uncertainty over the size of the two main
sinks means that any attempt to quantify the "comprehensive
approach" and "net emissions" concepts in carbon dioxide
emission-limitations, as advocated currently by many governments,
will be difficult to the point of impossibility. And it flags a
positive feedback - perhaps a profound one - not factored into
the climate models: another reason for exercising a precautionary
approach to greenhouse-gas emissions.<P>

COMMISSION.<P>

"Our planet is already warming at an increasing rate. The first
signs of climate change are already measurable  and noticeable.
Hence, there is no reason any more  to delay urgently required
actions."  Enquete Commission<P>

The German Bundestag's advisory body on climate change now needs
no further persuasion that the first footprint is visible, and
strengthens the case for action: it even subtitles its latest
report "acting now to safeguard the future." The report has a
section on new findings with subsection headings reading "in the
last few years, scientific knowledge about the man made
greenhouse effect has been strengthened by a growing body of
evidence," and "first signs of climate change are now manifest."
Under the latter, the Commission lists the following findings
over the last 30 to 50 years, which "clearly suggest that global
climate is beginning to change," and "which corroborate each
other":<P>

     *     Tropical ocean surface temperatures have increased by
0.5ÉC.<P>

     *     There has been an increase in tropospheric water
vapour concentrations above the tropics.<P>

     *     In the mid layers of the tropical troposphere, there
has been a rise in the amount of bound heat released.<P>

     *     The temperature gradient between the equator and polar
latitudes has grown.<P>

     *     Mean wind velocities have increased.<P>

     *     The quasi-stationary low pressure areas above the
northern Atlantic and northern Pacific oceans have increased in
depth.<P>

Additionally, "today's global mean temperature ranges about 0.7ÉC
above the 1860 level." The seven hottest in that period were, in
descending order, 1990, 1991, 1988, 1983, 1987, 1989, 1944. And
"in the same period, the mass of inland glaciers in the Alps has
decreased by about 50 percent." <P>

<H3><B>SEVERE DROUGHT AND WARM WINTERS IN NORTH OF CHINA.
</B></H3><P>

The Assistant Director of the National Meteorological Institute,
Luo Jibin, reports that February average temperatures in some
regions are around two to four degrees C above normal values.  In
some areas the highest average temperatures for more than 40
years  are being recorded.  Rising temperatures have been
identified during the past six winters and a severe drought
continues in the north of the country.  Luo Jibin suggests that 
this could be the result of global warming. <P>

<H3><B>"AMAZING" EMERGING EVIDENCE FOR DECADAL CLIMATE SHIFTS.
</B></H3><P>

It has become clear that a decade-long change in climate hit the
Pacific beginning in 1976. The principal changes involved a 1.5
degrees C warming in Alaska, and anomalously high waves
consistently battering the California coast. The cause was the
deflection of a low pressure system, normally to be found hanging
over the southwest tip of the Aleutians, intensifying and
shifting eastward towards North America. What caused that, nobody
knows.<P>

Meanwhile, a large patch of anomalously low-salinity water in the
North Atlantic, discovered in 1968 and named the Great Salinity
Anomaly, has been invoked by some oceanographers as a potential
explanation for broad cooling in the North Atlantic region and
Europe during the 1960s, at a time when the entire northern
hemisphere was in fact cooling. Kirk Bryan and Ron Stouffer of
Princeton suspect it may have affected deep-water formation as it
drifted around the North Atlantic, reducing the density of
northern surface waters enough to slow sinking, and putting a
brake on northward movement of warm water. <P>

A NOAA oceanographer, Sidney Levitus, commented as follows: "Ten
years ago we didn't have the evidence for these decade scale
changes. Now  they're showing up everywhere. It's just amazing
what's going on." <P>

(R. A. Kerr, "Unmasking a shifty climate system," Science, v.
225, p. 1508-1510, 20 March 1992).<P>

"The discovery is raising concerns about the Earth's climatic
future. Could oceanic shifts and the climate changes they bring
be masking greenhouse warming, perhaps lulling us into
complacency? Could greenhouse warming somehow be at the root of
such decades-long climate shifts? Will greenhouse warming itself
come in disruptive jumps?" R. A. Kerr, Science magazine
writer.<P>

Heat waves from Costa Rica to Honduras, severe drought in Sri
Lanka and the Philippines, hot and dry weather in Malaysia and
the worst hailstorm in 20 years in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, are
blamed by meteorologists on El Nino.  <P>

Half a million people are impacted by the drought in Sri Lanka,
because of water shortages and ravaged harvests. The drought has
devastated the tea crop in Sri Lanka and India, the two largest
tea producers in the world.<P>

In the Philippines, the severe drought has destroyed 2.5 billion
pesos ($100 million) worth of crops and is currently destroying
crops at the rate of three million pesos ($120,000) each week.
Forest fires are also burning throughout the country, 2,475
hectares of reforested areas, fruit plantations and primary
virgin forests have thus far been destroyed. <P>

Masvingo Province in Zimbabwe has some of the highest
temperatures for the region since records began there.  The
highest to date is 44.7ÉC. Thousands of cattle are by now dead. 
There are only 11 weeks of water left in the reservoirs of
Bulawayo. President Mugabe announces that the drought is a
national disaster. Zimbabwe's usual rainfall before 1980 was 675
mm per year.  Since 1980, it has dropped to 60% of this.  600
emergency wells have been sunk to combat the drought. (The Herald

of Zimbabwe, 3, 7 and 9 March 1992). <P>

The drought has destroyed crops and threatens the water supply of
at least two major cities. It also threatens the governments
ambitious economic restructuring program which has been aimed at
achieving export lead growth. Zimbabwe's economy, one of the most
industrialised in Africa, hinges on agriculture. Farming provides
53 percent of total employment and 40 percent of foreign
earnings. The government now is importing grain from South Africa
to feed people. <P>

However, South Africa is also suffering, the driest January in 30
years has decimated over 75 percent of the country's maize crop.
Nairobi, Kenya's capital, has only enough water for three weeks
by the end of the month. Three of the five rivers that run into
the cities main reservoir have dried up. <P>

Assuming a doubling of pre-industrial CO2-level by 2050, Austria
may expect a temperature increase of 2 oC in the annual mean and
3 oC in winter, an increase in winter precipitation in of around
10 to 20 percent and possibly a decrease in summer and a
reduction in  the number of days with snowcover of around 10 to
20 days each year in elevations up to 2500 metres. <P>

The Report states: "... a rising temperature trend similar to
that of the global mean can be observed since 1850, older records
going back to 1775 show about the same levels as today. This
means that observed temperature changes are still within the
natural variation." <P>

The Academy's report projects an increase in total winter runoff
as the total contribution of snow to total winter precipitation
decreases,  a shift to more arid soils as snowmelt comes earlier,
and a diminishing of glaciers.  This  could lead to water supply
difficulties. Species distribution is expected to alter; a
decline of some species like char and brown trout could be
expected as carp become more dominant.  Various water plants
already endangered,  like water lilies and red and brown algae,
could vanish completely or be replaced by other thermophile
varieties.  Higher temperatures are also expected to promote the
spread of various diseases and to increase heat stress and  - if
certain limits are exceeded - enhance morbidity and mortality.

</B></H3><P>

A detailed report on potential impacts in Indonesia, Malaysia,
and Thailand, by Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit
(see also general reports for 1991), is released by UNEP at a
press conference in Bangkok. Its main conclusions are:<P>

  Indonesia: A doubled carbon dioxide model run using the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies (GISS) model suggests that rainfall
could double in Indonesia, along with a temperature rise of about
3ÉC. Rates of soil erosion and leaching would in that event  have
to be balanced against any increase in water availability for
irrigation, and meanwhile with an estimated sea- level rise of
0.6 metres, land would also be being lost to the sea, meaning
that "more than 81,000 farmers would have to look for other
sources of income due to the inundation of their rice fields or
prawn and fish farms." Where coastal tourist resorts are
concerned, Bali would be among those threatened. Rice yields are
expected to decrease, largely as a result of higher temperatures,
and soybean (an important part of the diet for about 75% of the
Indonesian population) "could frequently suffer a yield loss of
over ten percent." Maize would suffer the most severe losses,
however, with potential reductions of yield of between 25 and
65%. "The overall effect would be to reduce potential average
income." The study talks of tens of thousands of job losses in
the Subang District alone.<P>

  Malaysia: Rice yield reductions of 12 to 22 percent are
estimated, which "would significantly affect levels of farm
income." The poorest farmers might find themselves forced to
relinquish their land, and "in general, levels of rural poverty
might be expected to increase." Rubber production may also be
affected by the higher temperatures and higher rainfall, with a
possible reduction of yields of about 15%. "The effects of sea
level rise could also be severe," with "substantial losses of
agriculturally productive land, of mangrove forests and of the
fisheries associated with mangroves." Where coastal tourist
resorts are concerned, Port Dickson, Penang, and Kuala Trengganu
would be among those threatened.<P>

  Thailand: Estimates of agricultural yield changes for this
country are subject to greater uncertainty than for the other
two. But where sea level rise is concerned, the 2940 km of Thai
coast is clearly set to suffer significant losses. A 1 m sea-
level rise in the representative study area chosen, the
Suratthani Province of southern Thailand, would inundate 7,400ha
(37%). "About 4,200ha of productive agricultural land and large
numbers of shrimp ponds would be lost." Where coastal tourist
resorts are concerned, Rayong would be among those threatened.<P>

<H3><B>WWF WARNS THAT MANY SPECIES FACE EXTINCTION. </B></H3><P>

A report by the Worldwide Fund for Nature International argues
that although a considerable amount of research has been
conducted on modelling climate change, and on policy responses
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, not enough attention has
been given to the probable ecological consequences of global
warming. Because climate change will probably be fast in
biological terms, and because human development has already had a
damaging effect on many natural systems, WWF predicts that 
"characteristic biological diversity is expected to be lost...[at
many levels]...because ecosystems will be unable to adapt or
migrate within the timescale imposed." <P>

Those species that are likely to survive are those that are
already common, and include many pests and disease carriers. 
Those that will die out will be the rare and more specialised
ones.  National parks and other protected areas are likely to
lose a great many of their species. Ecosystems that the WWF
considers to be at highest risk have been classified as
follows:<P>

        "Front-line" ecosystems: <P>

        where "compelling evidence indicates that an acute near-
term climate threat [can be] predicted with a high degree of
confidence," such as coral reefs (that are being bleached by warm
water); mangrove swamps (that are being drowned by sea level
rise); and the Arctic marine ecosystem (that is affected by
melting ice and warming air).  Damage of the first two categories
is already evident.<P>

        "Highly vulnerable" ecosystems:<P>

        where there is strong evidence for a significant threat
in the near future, such as montane systems; coastal wetlands
(where land is sinking or eroding due to sea level rise); tundra
and permafrost in the Arctic; and boreal and temperate forests
(warming rates will probably outpace the migration of many
species to cooler areas).<P>

        "High risk" ecosystems:<P>

        where they are "almost certainly in jeopardy, but for
which the probable impacts of climate change are currently not
clear."  These include wet or dry savannas(where wildlife depends
on a seasonal migration linked to water and temperature); and
tropical forests (where many species have a narrow tolerance for
moisture and temperature changes).<P>

Climate change will affect biodiversity directly, and will lead
to the extinction of plants and animals that cannot keep up with
rapid climate change.  This will be especially devastating in
places where there are few plants or animals scattered over large
areas.  Because ecosystems are interlinked (i.e. if one plant
dies out, it may affect a whole range of animals and insects (and
possibly even other plants) that rely on it for food, shelter or
reproduction) then even small changes may be important to the
system as a whole.  <P>

With the WWF International Discussion Paper is a map, with a list
of the endangered species and habitats on it.  Prominent plants
and animals at risk are:   <P>

     *     migrating birds rely on temperatures to produce
insects and other food sources at specific times; if the food
sources are not available to them during the long flights, birds
will die (such as sanderlings, plovers and Arctic terns),   <P>

     *     hemlock trees will disappear in Minnesota in the next
few decades,  <P>

     *     glaciers are shrinking worldwide (the Glacier Bay wolf
spider only lives in southeast Alaska, and its habitat is at risk
from glacier recession),  <P>

     *     specialised habitats will disappear, taking with them
the species that live only there (the Kirtland warbler in
Michigan lives only on dead branches of jack pine trees; warming
will wipe out the trees in this area, and probably the bird
too),<P>

     *     high sea temperatures have killed ("bleached") many
corals in the eastern Pacific, and in the Comoros (north west of
Madagascar),  <P>

     *     an unusually wet season caused a failure of trees to
fruit in Panama (many armadillos, howler monkeys, opossums,
sloths, porcupines and coati mundis died of starvation),  <P>

     *     the Costa Rican cloud forest is at risk from rising
temperatures and lack of humidity,  <P>

     *     rising sea levels could damage the breeding beaches of
the Galapagos Islands (affecting the rare galapagos sealion,
green turtles, iguanas, penguins and the flightless cormorant), 
<P>

     *     warming of the Arctic will affect polar bears, seals,
the Peary caribou and whales, all of which rely on the ice and
tundra for food supplies,  <P>

     *     the Wadden Sea saltmarshes will not survive
significant sea level rises, which will affect migrating waders
and waterfowl.  <P>

     *     It is also possible that some shellfish will decline,
thus depriving the birds of a main source of food,  <P>

     *     mangroves swamps as far apart as Bermuda and Tonga are
being eroded around the roots, which makes them more likely to be
damaged in storms.  Most mangroves will be swamped if the sea
rises 12mm per decade,  the mangroves in India and Bangladesh are
also at risk from global warming.  This is the last reserve of
the Bengal tiger, and about 30% of Bangladesh's population rely
on the shrinking mangroves for their livelihoods in one way or
another,  <P>

     *     many European sand dunes are eroding, which means that
birds like curlews, stonechats, whinchats, red- backed shrikes,
hen harriers and short eared owls may lose vital breeding
grounds,  <P>

     *     many British plants will not survive warming, either
because they cannot adapt or migrate,or because they face
competition from other plants that they cannot overcome.  <P>

     *     This is also true of many other European Alpine
habitats, and species like the Apollo butterfly, the Siberian
cricket and the black salamander could be at risk,  <P>

     *     the Indonesian mountain weasel only lives in cool
temperatures on mountains; global warming will force it to
smaller areas where the temperatures are cool enough for it,  <P>

     *     the Atlantic Forest in Brazil is now less than 5% of
its original size, and climate change could mean that the last
little bit might not be able to adapt.  Species like the black
lion tamarin, woolley spider monkey, bamboo rat and maned sloth
are at risk, as well as many birds,  <P>

     *     it is possible that higher rainfall in the African
savannas (such as the Serengetti, Masai Mara and Kruger) will
allow big herbivores like buffalo, elephant and zebra, to
displace smaller ones like topi and impala.  <P>

     *     It is important to retain a balance between wet
savannas and dry savannas, but this would be lost with decreased
rainfall,  Xishuangbanna in China has seen a decline in rainfall
and a rise in temperature over the past 30 years.  This has put
about 500 species of plant at risk,<P>

     *     33,000 square km of rain forest in Borneo were
destroyed by forest fire in 1982, mainly due to a drought,  <P>

     *     increased rainfall in northern Australia could cause
problems for some species of wallaby, and 42 other species are
thought to be at risk in Victoria, including parrots, wallabies
and opossums.<P>

Scientists report to a Senate Committee that ice cores in
glaciers from China, Russia, and Peru show that temperatures for
the 50 years between 1937 and 1987 were higher than for any 50
year period for 12,000 years. Lonnie Thompson of the University
of Ohio presented this information to the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation on February 27th. <P>

Experimental irradiance of phytoplankton show that near-surface
photosynthesis can be inhibited by ultraviolet  radiation.<P>

Researchers from the University of California and other US
institutions now publish measurements of UV-B and photosynthesis
made over six weeks below the ozone hole during spring. These
show that UV-B inhibition of photosynthesis varied linearly with
dose, varied between different planktonic organisms, and reduced
overall productivity by between 6 and 12 percent.  <P>

"There probably couldn't be a worse time of year to lose
production, when most of the population is in the nursery," one
of the researchers told New Scientist. "Spring is the time that
phytoplankton are at their most productive." <P>

But the rain brings no end to the Californian drought.  Ten
inches of rain falls, causing the deaths of 8 people. All the
reservoirs are inland, mostly fed by snowmelt from the Sierra
mountain range.  Flash floods are caused by sudden torrential
rain like this, and the only possible option is to channel it all
away as soon as possible to avoid flood damage.  So, the 10" of
rain mostly runs off to sea, and will have done virtually nothing
to alleviate the drought, now in its sixth year. <P>

<H3><B>MANY SCIENTISTS BELIEVE RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE POSSIBLE.
</B></H3><P>

A Greenpeace poll shows that a worryingly high proportion of
climate scientists believe it possible that continuing emissions
of greenhouse gases can awaken synergistic feedbacks capable of
generating a runaway greenhouse effect. <P>

Bad though the best- estimate of the future, as portrayed by the
IPCC would be, there is a worst-case view, which is that the IPCC
estimates will prove to be underestimates, and that natural
amplifications of warming (positive feedbacks) will be awakened,
potentially even generating a point of no return beyond which
might lie unstoppable heating of the planet, no matter how deeply
anthropogenic emissions might ultimately be cut. <P>

The results of an opinion survey on this subject, published by
Greenpeace at the 1992 American Association for the Advancement
of Science annual meeting in Chicago, show that almost half of
surveyed world climate scientists believe that a runaway
greenhouse effect is possible if action is not taken to cut
greenhouse gas emissions. More than one-in-ten of those polled
believe this worst-case analysis - a point of no return beyond
which lies unstoppable heating of the atmosphere - to be
probable. <P>

Greenpeace International polled 400 climate scientists during
December 1991 and January '92. The sample included all scientists
involved in the 1990 study of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, and others who have published on issues relevant
to climate change in `Science' or `Nature' during 1991.
Scientists were asked whether they thought there would be a point
of no return at some time in the future, if emissions continued
at their present rate. By the end of January 1992, 113 had
replied, in the following way: probably - 15 (13%), possibly - 36
(32%), probably not - 53 (47%). In other words, 45% believe the
runaway greenhouse effect to be possible. <P>

("Fear expressed of runaway greenhouse effect," Boston Globe, 10
February 1992; and for further details see: J.K.Leggett, "Global
warming: the worst- case," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, v.
85, p. 28-32, June 1992; and "Running down to Rio," New
Scientist,  p. 38-41, 2 May 1992).<P>

NOTES: This survey was misreported on a number of occasions in
the US media as showing that only 13% of scientists thought
global warming itself was probable. The Greenpeace press release
was specific about what a runaway greenhouse effect was: it
talked about "a point of no return beyond which lies unstoppable
heating of the atmosphere," and the risk of "unleashing global
warming at a rate which threatens the future of the human
species, and indeed most life forms."  <P>

The misreporting began in the Washington Times on May 2nd, when
an editorial opined that "Greenpeace, which polled around 400
climate scientists around the turn of the year, was disconcerted
to find that only 13 percent subscribe to their alarmist version
of the greenhouse warming. Thirty-two percent said that the
theory was possible and 47 percent that it was probably not'
true." From here there was a ripple effect. On CNN's "Crier &
Co," Nancy Mitchell of Vice- President Dan Quayle's Council for
Competitiveness volunteered in a debate that according to a
Greenpeace study, only 13% of scientists polled were concerned
about global warming. In the Wall Street Journal, an op-ed by
Fred Smith, President of the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
echoed the same line, and he put it in words on the
MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, where he concluded that the poll
"suggests there is no consensus that carbon dioxide is a serious
threat to the future." This, of course, is exactly the reverse of
what it suggests.  <P>

On CNBC's "McLaughlin Report, Greenpeace USA's Peter Bahouth was
faced with Jeremy Taylor of the Cado Institute, who continued the
confusion of worst-case runaway warming with the best-estimate
view that the IPCC had spent three years thrashing out. Perhaps
the worst use of the distortion came in the New Republic on July
6, where Gregg Easterbrook, a Newsweek writer, spun the survey
against Al Gore. "Gore, for example, asserts that reporters
should attach little weight to scientists who question greenhouse
emergency claims, because perhaps 2 percent of credentialed
researchers feel that way. This simply isn't true. Greenpeace
recently surveyed climatologists, doubtless hoping for evidence
of global warming panic; instead it found that the largest group
of respondents, 47 percent, believe runaway greenhouse effect is
nearly impossible." <P>

Finally, on July 27th, the survey made the New York Times. Keith
Schneider's story again confused runaway warming with IPCC best-
estimate warming. "The survey did not reflect the considerable
causes for concern outlined by a succession of international and
national scientific panels over the last few years," Schneider
concluded.<P>

Drought has stopped hydro- electricity generation; water supply
to the national Paute plant has disappeared and daily 12-hourly
power cuts are planned. Ecuador is forced to buy electricity from
Columbia. Some experts believe deforestation in the region may
have contributed to the drought. <P>

A study notes the disappearance of the snow ramp on Stonington
Island, north of the Wordie ice shelf by comparing photo images
taken in previous years.  Previous research had suggested that
the Wordie ice shelf is disintegrating rapidly, possibly as a
response to global warming.  The fact that the snow ramp looks to
be melting too, adds more evidence to the theory that the
Antarctic is  being affected by global warming. <P>

In Lebanon the worst snowstorm in recorded history  kills 13.
Floods have killed 20 in northern Algeria, Cyprus receives its

<H3><B>IPCC IMPACTS SUPPLEMENT IS COMPLETED. </B></H3><P>

Studies since the First Impacts Assessment "do not radically
alter the conclusions despite uncertainties of that report."
Extracts are as follows:<P>

<B>On human settlement:</B> "Recent studies for the Maldives and
for the Pacific island states including Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tokelau
and the Marshall Islands have reconfirmed that small low-lying
island states and large populations living in low-lying coastal
areas will be increasingly vulnerable, particularly if adaptive
measures are inadequate, to the combination of sea-level rise,
storm surges and coastal flooding." "A British study shows soil
shrinkage and swelling as a result of climate change in clay-rich
areas has major implications for the construction and insurance
industries and for human settlement."<P>

<B>On industry:</B> "Water-dependent industries such as food
processing, paper making, and power generation could be affected
by hydrological changes under changed climate conditions."<P>

<B>On health:</B> Knowledge of climate change on human health has
extended and confirmed the previously reported results with
greater understanding of potential shifts in disease vector
habitats with global warming particularly in New Zealand and
Australia. Diseases such as malaria, lymphatic filariases,
schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis (river blindness),
dengue fever, and Australian and Japanese encephalitis could
increase or be reintroduced in many countries as a consequence of
global warming. Regarding the impact of UV-B radiation on health,
recent studies show that it affects human immunosuppression
system (sic) and vision."<P>

 <B>On agriculture and forestry:</B> "...the impact of global
warming on agriculture may be serious if warming is at the upper
end of the range projected by the IPCC Working Group 1."
..."Recent studies have reinforced concern that drought is the
area in which climate change poses the greatest risk for
agriculture..." "...climate change may benefit ecological
conditions for insect growth and abundance which is likely to
have a negative effect on crop, livestock and forest production
in some areas." <P>

"...While some scientists emphasize enhanced photosynthesis and
more efficient water use seen in controlled settings, others are
sceptical that these benefits will be seen in farmers' fields
under changing climate conditions." "...Adaptation to climate
change by the existing agricultural production system should be
possible, and the worldwide systems of agricultural research
should be able to provide new crop cultivars that maintain high
yields and nutritional quality." "...the impacts of climate
change on forests could have significant socio-economic
consequences."<P>

<B>On terrestrial ecosystems:</B>"Analyses subsequent to those
included in the IPCC First Assessment Report reinforce the major
conclusion of that report that natural terrestrial ecosystems
could face significant environmental impacts... ...the rate of
these (climatic) changes will be the major factor in determining
the type and degree of impacts... ...Current climatic projections
continue to suggest that the rates of change are likely to be
faster than the ability of some component species to respond and
that species and ecosystem responses may be sudden, potentially
leading to ecosystem destabilization or degradation." <P>

"...With projected climate change, profound impacts, both
beneficial and destructive, can be expected for the distribution
and productivity of valuable fisheries..."<P>

<B>On ocean and coastal zone ecology:</B>"...the combination of
sea-level rise, along with changes in precipitation and UV-B
radiation, are expected to have strong impacts on marine
ecosystems, including redistributions and changes in biotic
production." Most <B>coral reefs</B> "should keep pace with the
expected rise in sea level if other factors do not alter growth
conditions. Stress on the reefs from other variables (storms,
sedimentation, disease, rainfall, radiation, turbidity,
overfishing, mass mortality in algal grazers, etc) may prevent
some reefs from keeping pace with rising sea level, resulting in
changes to nearshore hydrodynamics." "...Temperature rise may
trigger bleaching events in some corals, but it is expected that
the other stresses mentioned above will be more important." 

<B>UV-B:</B> "Since so many marine resources spend all or
vulnerable parts of their lives near the water surface, there is
a significant threat to some fisheries." "...The first Report
expressed concern about leaching of contaminants during sea-level
rise, from coastal waste disposal sites." "...potential changes
in storm frequency or intensity could have important ecological
consequences to coastal resources."<P>

<B>On hydrology and water resources:</B> "...there is not yet
adequate information on regions affected by aridity and
desertification, and an effort should be undertaken to fill that
gap." In new studies, "virtually all regions exhibited greater
variability and amplification of extremes, with larger flood
volumes and peak flows as well as increased low flow
episodes..."<P>

<B>On the cryosphere:</B> "...projected changes in climate ...are
expected to substantially reduce the areal extent and volume of
seasonal snow cover, mountain glaciers, terrestrial ice sheets
and frozen ground including permafrost and seasonally frozen
ground." "...Analysis of satellite-derived snow cover data have
shown the extent of northern hemispheric snow to be at record low
levels since the middle of 1987 with the largest negative
anomalies occurring in the spring." Recent analyses suggest
"Emissions in Arctic regions of methane from methane hydrates as
a result of permafrost degradation may have been
underestimated."<P>

<H3><B>CORAL GROWTH UNABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH SEA-LEVEL RISE.
</B></H3><P>

So warns a Japanese study of the effects of sea-level rise on
Pacific nations . In the Pacific island nations excluding Papua
New Guinea, 2.14 million people live in a total land area of
only 90,000 square kilometres. These island nations consist of
both continental islands and oceanic islands. Many of the
latter are atolls that are barely one or two meters above sea
level. Because the upward growth of coral cannot keep up with
the speed at which the sea level rises, Masateru Anraku
concludes, reefs will be submerged. This will bring forth the 
possibility that the atolls will be submerged and shores 
will be eroded. The effects of typhoons and tidal waves will 
be especially great. Aid from developed countries will be 
essential for alleviating these impacts. <P>

Atolls  Sink?" Enerugi Rebyu (Energy Review), p. 12-17, January

<H3><B>IPCC COMPLETES SUPPLEMENT TO FIRST ASSESSMENT REPORT.
</B></H3><P>

This essentially confirms the gravity of the warning given in
1990, concluding that "findings since 1990 do not affect our
fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse
effect, and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the
major conclusions of the first IPCC Scientific Assessment."<P>

There are two particularly important modifications to scientific
understanding, however:<P>

  Radiative forcing of CFCs has been offset at many latitudes by
ozone depletion: It has become clear since 1990 that CFCs have
been depleting ozone so fast during the 1980s that their heat-
trapping capacity has been effectively cancelled out at many
latitudes. In the 1990 IPCC report, scientists calculated that
CFCs had contributed 24% to overall global warming during the
decade of the 1980s. They did not attempt to do the difficult
calculation of how much ozone (also a greenhouse gas) had
contributed to overall warming. <P>

The 1992 IPCC report, however, concludes as follows:
"...reduction in radiative forcing resulting from ozone depletion
could, averaged on a global scale and over the last decade, be
approximately equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the
enhanced radiative forcing due to increased CFCs during the same 
time period."<P>

  Sulphate aerosols from coal burning have also been suppressing
global warming: IPCC scientists have come to believe, between
writing their 1990 and 1992 reports, that sulphate aerosols have
been suppressing global warming. This they do by reflecting a
greater amount of incident solar radiation back to space. <P>

(J. T. Houghton, B. A. Callender and S. K. Varney, (eds),
"Climate Change 1992 - The Supplementary Report to the IPCC
Scientific Assessment," Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, WMO/UNEP, Cambridge University Press, 1992).<P>

NOTES: At the time, elements in the coal lobby argued that the
sulphate aerosol dampening factor was a reason for persisting
with coal combustion. But the partial - and temporary -
suppression of the global-warming "fever" by boosting acid rain,
and knocking out ozone, involves using two "drugs" of such
toxicity that to contemplate continuing to apply them to the
patient is not possible. The IPCC finding in no way reduces the
urgent need for an immediate policy attack on carbon dioxide
emissions. Note also that when the dampening effect of the two
phenomena is factored in, the model-predicted increase in global-
average temperature in the second half of the century rises to
match the actual measurements of temperature. This, of course,
boosts confidence in the models.<P>

The drought, now in its fourth year, has diminished river flows,
increasing reliance on groundwater, which is being depleted by
the heavy use. Mr Roger Hyde, regional manager of the National
Rivers Authority, Anglia region, says that "unless there is
substantial rainfall in the next four months, farmers, growers
and domestic consumers will all suffer shortages." The 41 months
to the end of December 1991 were the longest dry period this
century.<P>

<H3><B>ICE CORES SUGGEST RAPID AND CHAOTIC FLUCTUATIONS IN PAST
CLIMATE  </B></H3>  
 
The ice cores of the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) show that
there were rapid alternations between cold and mild states during
the last glaciation, which ended around 11,500 years ago.<P>

Rapid warming at the onset of each mild spell involved surface-
temperature increases in Greenland of some 7 oC in just a few
decades.  (This, note, is a regional temperature increase, not a
global average increase). Abrupt changes in ocean circulation,
the researchers conclude, are the most likely explanation for
this. <P>

(S. J. Johnson et al, "Irregular glacial interstadials recorded
in a new Greenland ice," Nature, v. 359, p. 311 - 313, 24
September 1992. See also "Blowing hot and cold with climate
models," New Scientist, 26 September 1992).<P>

NOTES: If such rapid changes were possible then, they are
possible now.  We are left with a clear lesson: the climate can
go badly wrong on us, and in ways that could well be essentially
unpredictable. We can expect a flood of important new data from
the GRIP ice cores. The study described deals only with the last
40,000 years. Since it was written, the coring has continued
through progressively older ice all the way to bedrock, at a
depth of just over three km, where the ice is 200,000 years
old.<P>

David Peel of the British Antarctic Survey comments as follows:
"Eagerly awaited will be the first data through the last
interglacial, when conditions around 126,00 years ago were up to
2 degrees C warmer than now. This should give us the first detail
from the Northern Hemisphere on climate and associated
environmental responses during the last period of the Earth's
history when conditions were analogous to those predicted for the
near future."(D. Peel, "Merely the tip of the ice core," Nature,
v. 359, p. 274-275, 24 September 1992). <P>

Already, the team of Danish scientists responsible for the work
suggests that in the light of their evidence, it may not be
possible to feasibly model large natural climate changes. The
changes they see in the ice core record seem to have a strong
component of chaos underlying them. This additional uncertainty
adds all the more credence to the view that it would be unwise to
wait for more science to come in before acting to cut greenhouse-
gas emissions.<P>

<H3><B>MT PINATUBO COOLING INCREASES CONFIDENCE IN CLIMATE
MODELS. </B></H3> <P>

The climate models accurately predicted what the results of
Pinatubo's June 1991 eruption would be on the world's climate,
increasing confidence in their estimates of future warming. The
Pinatubo eruption was the largest this century, hurling millions
of  tonnes of sulphur compounds into the atmosphere.  This caused
an average drop in the world's temperature of a few tenths of a
degree Celsius.  <P>

These observations are consistent with evidence from previous
eruptions - the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia in 1815, which
injected ten or fifteen times more sulphur into the atmosphere
than Pinatubo, led to a terrible summer, with frost in New
England, and the latest wine harvest since 1482. The eruption of
Toba in Sumatra 73,000 years ago was even larger, and may have
accelerated the onset of the last Ice Age. <P>

(B. Burroughs, "Pinatubo's summer washout," The Independent, 28
September 1992).<P>

"...instead of being concerned about the cooling effect of
Pinatubo, we should be more worried about how current weather
events are providing support for the performance of global
climate models - and hence the threat of global warming." B.
Burroughs, The Independent<P>

Environment Minister Anwar Saifullah says the damage estimate to
the Pakistani economy could exceed $2 billion. Floods spread
through the Himalayan foothills in India and Pakistan, causing
havoc for two weeks. At least 4,000 people are killed by the
floods and landslides triggered by the heavy rains. Nearly 3.2
million people are affected in the Punjab and the Northwest
Frontier Provinces. 1.7 million hectares of agricultural land in
Punjab are inundated. The floods are thought to have been
aggravated by illegal deforestation. <P>

<H3><B>CARBON "FERTILIZATION EFFECT" THROWN INTO DOUBT.
</B></H3><P>

The idea that excess carbon dioxide can encourage the growth of
certain plant species (under glass house conditions) has been an
argument in some quarters that global warming may in some degree
be good for agriculture. Swiss experimenters growing a tropical
ecosystem in an an elevated carbon dioxide atmosphere now find no
significant change in biomass, and carbon dioxide emissions from
soil. <P>

The scientists conclude: "our data indicate that elevated CO2 may
not necessarily lead to greater carbon sequestration by
terrestrial ecosystems, but that it will likely result in greater
turnover." This is a very significant development. It means that
any attempt to quantify the "comprehensive approach" and "net
emissions" concepts in CO2 emission-limitations will be more
difficult yet, and in all ultimately likelihood impossible. (In
these approaches, advocated by some governments at the climate
negotiations, emissions of carbon dioxide would be offsetable
against calculated carbon sequestration in forests). <P>

dioxide in artificial tropical ecosystems," Science, v. 257, p.
1972-75, 18 September 1992).<P>

With insured losses of $1.6 billion, it becomes the tenth
"billion dollar windstorm" for the insurance industry within five
years. It was the strongest hurricane to affect Hawaii since the
Weather Service opened in World War II. Sustained winds were 130
mph and took three lives. (Douglas LeComte, "Highlights in the
United States,"  NOAA/USDA Joint Agricultural Weather Facility,
USA, Weatherwise, v. 46, p. 8-13, February/March 1993). <P>

The cyclone's path went through Hawaii's "garden island" (Kauai)
destroying 10,000 homes and 70 hotels with winds up to 175 mph. 
It was Kauai's first hurricane for ten years. (Agence France
Press Report, 15 September 1992; "Review of autumn 1992 in the
northern hemisphere," Weather v. 48, p. 57_58, 1993).<P>

Reporting on the 1991 catastrophe statistics, the company notes
that "the last five years have shown a loss burden above the long
term trend, both in the natural catastrophe and major man-made
loss sectors." <P>

Between 1970 and 1985, total insured losses from natural and man
made catastrophes had varied between $2 billion and $6 billion
(at 1991 prices). Then they began to go up. In 1989 they reached
$14 billion, in 1990 $18 billion, and in 1991 $15 billion. The
challenge to the industry will be huge if this trend continues,
the company says. The Financial Times  lists climate change as a
possible contributory factor, but comments "the jury is still
out." <P>

Klaus Conrad of Munich Re is quoted as saying that premiums
"apparently have been too low. Otherwise one would not have lost
in 5 years what it had taken 50 to collect." <P>

<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>CHAOS A FACTOR IN COLLAPSE OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE
SHEET? </B></H3> <P>

A University of Chicago study combining geological evidence with
modelling suggests that several times during the past million
years, sporadic and perhaps chaotic collapse of the West
Antarctic ice sheet (that is to say, complete mobilization)
occurred. When this happened, most recently during the
interglacial warm phase 120,000 years ago, evidence from fossil
beach and coral reef terraces indicate that sea level was up to 6
metres higher than today. <P>

The erratic behaviour of the ice sheet is due to the way the ice
sheet slips over the rocks underneath it, in particular glacial
deposits. The study concludes that the West Antarctic ice sheet
(WAIS) "collapses occasionally when deformable basal till becomes
widespread." It is "the slow build up of deforming subglacial
till towards a critical value (that) seems to trigger rapid ice
sheet shrinkage." The researcher concludes that "the hypothesis
that WAIS snow-accumulation rates increase when the climate warms
does not contradict the hypothesis that future climate warming
could cause the WAIS to collapse. My simulations incorporate the
feedback between accumulation rate and climate warming, yet they
display ice-sheet collapse or shrinkage at times when model
climate forcing is warm. What is most important in determining
the possibility of WAIS collapse in the near future is the
distribution of deformable subglacial till." <P>

sheet," Nature, v.  359, p. 29_32, 3 September 1992).<P>

<H3><B>WORST DROUGHT IN  LIVING MEMORY STRIKES AUSTRIA.
</B></H3><P>

An all-time August high of 36 oC is recorded in Austria as
central and eastern European temperatures average 3-6 oC above
normal.
(Douglas LeComte, "Highlights Around the World," NOAA/USDA Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility, USA, Weatherwise, v.46, p.14-17,
February/March 1993). <P>

A drought lasting several weeks and the hottest summer in more
than 150 years is causing severe damage to Austrian agriculture
and forests.  In some areas, crop yields are only 20 percent of
last year's production. Maize, soya, sun- flower, sugar-beet and
cereal production are all 20 to 40 percent below 1991  production
levels, while paprika and tomato yields have dropped to 50
percent of 1991's levels. According to the Ministry of
Agriculture, losses are estimated at 8 billion Austrian
Schillings ($700 million).  <P>

The heat is encouraging insect infestations; around 2 million
cubic metres of timber have already been destroyed by bark-
beetles. 10,000 hectares of re- forested area have been destroyed
by heat and drought, while fires have struck forests in Tyrol and
lower Austria. (D. Hornbachner, "Der anthropogene Treibhauseffekt
- Die Auswirkungen desKlimawandels auf Oesterreich", p. 43,
Vienna, 1993). <P>

The oldest Austrian glacier skiing area on the Kitzsteinhorn is
to be closed, because of poor snow and shrinking ice area on the
"Schmiedinger Glacier". This was the first time in 25 years that
this area has been closed. ("Hitzewelle zerstoert auch einige
Sommerski-Pisten", Kurier [Austria], 28 August 1992). <P>

Vienna records 36.5 degrees C on 28th August, its hottest day
since 18 August 1892. Poyersdorf in lower Austria registers
37.2 oC the same day. ("Heissester August seit 100 Jahren", Der
Standard (Austria), 31 August 1992). <P>

Within the last 60 years arid areas in lower Austria have become
more arid, while  humid areas have become more humid.
Furthermore, precipitation patterns have become unfavourable;
long-lasting droughts over summer have become more common while
precipitation generally is occurs sporadically in short intense
periods - that is, heavy rainfall alternates with droughts. (H.
Nagl, "Der Treibhauseffekt und seine Auswirkungen auf
Niederoesterreich", University of Vienna, August 1992).<P>

<H3><B>SOCIAL PROBLEMS ERUPT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA'S WORST DROUGHT
THIS CENTURY. </B></H3> <P>

Conflict breaks out between park wardens and local people wanting
to graze their starving cattle on game reserves.<P>

In the Transkei, workers on the Mkambati reserve, acting in
solidarity with locals who have invaded the park and built
barricades across its entrance, kidnap their white bosses and
lock them up for a night. Earlier, residents of Matsulu, a
sprawling township in another homeland, Kangwane, had fought
pitched battles with game rangers after going into the park to
poach animals and collect fuelwood. <P>

"People feel in hard times like this the land must be given back
to the people," says Lawrence Mooi, a Matsulu civic leader. "When
people are starving it is not right to worry about the welfare of
wild animals." (InterPress Service, August 1992). <P>

"In Gonarezhou National Park, in southeastern Zimbabwe, perhaps
the hardest hit area, the carcasses of cape buffalo and zebra lie
scattered on the parched ground, and elephants are devastating
the remaining woodlands in desperate search for food.  In Zambia,
wildlife experts fear the Luangwe River, which is believed to
have more hippos per mile than any other river in Africa, will
simply stop flowing.  And in South Africa's Kruger National Park,
the corpses of hippos, crocodiles and baboons can be found along
the now-dry Luvuvhu River." <P>

Willie K. Njduka, director of the Zimbabwe Department of National
Parks and Wildlife Management, describes the scene in Gonarezhou,
the country's second largest park: "There is no grass, there are
no leaves, and there is no water.  If we do nothing, we will
surely lose whole populations." <P>

Park officials have started moving endangered species such as
rhinos, and culling larger populations, including elephants, in 
an effort to save the wildlife. (Audubon, v. 94,  p. 25-27,
November-
 December 1992).<P>

</B></H3><P>

A number of plant species known to be temperature-responsive are
changing their distribution and abundance, possibly as a result
of climate change. Some species are moving north, while a species
of orchid common in France and previously seen only at a few
sites in southern England is now increasing both in range and
abundance.<P>

<H3><B>WARMING REPORTED IN THE ANTARCTIC. </B></H3><P>

Measurements taken from 1957 at Antarctic coastal bases, show a
warming trend of 0.15 oC per decade. Sea ice seems to have
responded to the coastal warming; measurements taken between 1973
and 1988 show a decrease in sea ice extent of around 33
kilometres per decade (T.H. Jacka, "Antarctica and southern ocean
sea-ice and climate trends," Annals of Glaciology, v. 14, 1990).
<P>

Some sub-Antarctic islands have also shown signs of warming. The
mean annual temperature for Kerguelen island has increased by
1.5 oC over the last 20 years and (incomplete) data from Herald
Island suggests a similar increase. (J.J. Scott, "Changes in
Vegetation on Heard Island 1947 - 1987," in K.R. Kerry and G.
Hemple (eds), "Antarctic Ecosystems, Ecological Change and
Conservation,"  Springer- Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1990). <P>

These data appear to be borne out by Australian scientists, who
report that records from 31 meteorological stations in the
southern hemisphere show an increase in temperatures since 1950. 
A mean warming trend of between 0.1 and 0.5 oC per decade was
noted by Australian scientists between 1950 and 1985, with a
significant increase of 0.2 to 0.8 oC per decade being observed
from 1966 onwards.  A corresponding cooling trend in the lower
stratosphere was also observed. <P>

Dr Karoly from University of Monash notes that while there are
problems with the short period of data available, both of these
trends are consistent with the impact of increased concentrations
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. (Karoly, D. J., "Evidence
of recent temperature trends in the southern hemisphere," in G.
I. Pearman (ed), "Greenhouse: Planning for Climate Change,"
CSIRO, 1988).<P>

<H3><B>POLAR BEARS COME UNDER THREAT AS ICE MELTS IN THE ARCTIC.
</B></H3><P>

Most years Wrangel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, is at least
partially surrounded by sea ice. In 1990, however, the ice
disappeared, and by October not a single piece of pack ice could
be found within 2,000 kilometres of the island. This stranded
several hundred hungry polar bears on an island with no natural
food supply. <P>

The bears were forced to scavenge from the remains of dead walrus
and to hunt among the walrus colonies also stranded on the
island. Walrus is not natural prey for polar bears, and only
fully grown and experienced males were able to kill.  Said Dr
Nikita Ovsyanikov, Arctic researcher, "with global warming, these
conditions of climate and ice might become a regular occurrence.
If that happens, the polar bear - now thought to be recovering in
numbers since 1973 ...could be in trouble again." <P>

December temperatures are seven degrees C above average.

<TITLE>HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE KM. OF COASTAL LAND MAY BE
LOST TO THE SEA.</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE KM. OF COASTAL LAND MAY BE
LOST TO THE SEA. </B></H3> <P>

The first report of the IPCC's Coastal Zone Management Subgroup
reports that a one metre rise would require about 360,000 km of
coastal defences, at a cost of $500 billion over the next
century. <P>

This estimate reflects only the marginal cost, and is not
discounted. It does not include the cost of maintaining existing
defences, or the value of lost land or ecosystems, or the costs
of saltwater intrusion, or the costs associated with the fact
that "global climate change may ...in some areas, increase the
frequency and severity of storms." "The overall cost will
therefore be considerably higher." <P>

The report points to problems with protecting coasts. In
particular, "two thirds of the world's fish catch and many marine
species, depend on coastal wetlands for their survival. Without
human interference (the retreat option), ecosystems could migrate
landward as sea level rises and thus could remain intact,
although the total area of wetlands would decline. Under the
protection option, a much larger proportion of these ecosystems
would be lost, especially if hard structures block their landward
migration." Nonetheless, it is imperative that adaptation be
taken seriously. "It is urgent for coastal nations to begin the
process of adapting to sea level rise not because there is an
impending catastrophe, but because there are opportunities to
avoid adverse impacts by acting now." <P>

("Strategies for adaptation to sea level rise," Report of the
Coastal Zone Management Subgroup, IPCC Response Strategies
Working Group," UNEP-WMO, November 1990).<P>

NOTES: The implications for coastal infrastructure are profound.
Among the structures worryingly exposed are coastal nuclear
reactors. For example, as British environmental scientist Bill
Carter notes, "the geological effects of sea-level rise are
largely associated with the remobilization and transport of
coastal sediments. ...Gravel beaches, which protect about 7% of
the British coast from marine inundation, are a special case. We
already know that many gravel beaches are very recent, for
example, Dungeness in Kent and the Crumbles in Sussex have both
evolved in the last 1,000 years, and it seems likely that the
anticipated sea-level rise will cause them to become active, and
perhaps disperse, not only threatening structures built atop them
(including several nuclear power stations) but also the adjacent
inland areas." ("Rising sea level," Geology Today, , p. 63-67,
March-April 1989).<P>

A drilling programme over the last five years has documented

the northern part of the delta, where much of Egypt's 50 million

Stanley reports that coastal erosion and encroachment of
saltwater are "already severely limiting agricultural
development" in the northern delta plain, which is Egypt's
primary grain-growing area. <P>

CONFERENCE.<P>

The Rt. Hon. Bikenibeu Paeniu says in a speech to the World
Climate Conference in Geneva that "the greenhouse effect and sea-
level rise threaten the very heart of our existence. ...We island
states in the Pacific and Caribbean have done the least to create
the problem, and yet we stand to lose the most."<P>

He reports that Tuvalu had noticed increased salinity in their
aquifers, an increased number of dry spells, and more ferocious
cyclones than normal. "We entreat this conference to propose
measures which promote urgent and pragmatic actions," Paeniu
says. During Cyclone Bebe in 1972, Tuvalu's main atoll, Funafuti,
was completely overwhelmed by huge waves, which accompanied an
exceptional spring tide. Nearly all the houses were destroyed.<P>

(J. Lewis, "Sea-level rise: some implications for Tuvalu," Ambio,
v.18, p. 458-459, 1989). This shows how vulnerable such atolls
are. Tuvalu had been badly damaged again by Cyclone Ofa earlier
in 1990.<P>

The Ministerial Statement of the Second World Climate Conference,
November 1990, signed by 137 governments, reads: <P>

"We agree that the ultimate global objective should be to
stabilize greenhouse- gas concentrations at a level which would
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with climate...
Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack
of full scientific consensus should not be used as a reason for
postponing cost-effective measures to prevent such environmental
degradation."  <P>

This was later established as the objective of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change, signed at the Earth Summit of June
1992.<P>

Philippines, killing more than 160 people and leaving 120,000
people homeless. <P>

NOTES: Tropical cyclones are windstorms with sustained windspeeds
exceeding 100 kph. In the Atlantic, they are called hurricanes;
in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific east of the International
Dateline, cyclones; in the Pacific west of the International
Dateline, they are often called typhoons.<P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING THREATENS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN CULTURES IN
PACIFIC. </B></H3> <P>

A UNEP study group warns that there may be no escape from sea-
level rise for many cultures, if emissions reductions do not
transpire. There are more than 3,000 small isolated islands,
grouped into 24 political entities, in the Pacific region. Many
of these islands are low coral atolls highly susceptible to the
impacts of sea level rise. <P>

"The ratio of coastal length to area is high; offshore water is
deep; thus engineering response strategies to climatic change are
not feasible. Migration of human populations from impacted zones
and islands may be necessary. Although the population is
relatively small in absolute terms, numbering approximately 5
million people, the cultural diversity is enormous (one-third of
the world's languages are spoken in Melanesia). The social,
political, and economic integrity and biological environments of
more than 800 separate human cultures will be threatened by
projected climate changes." (UNEP Report of the Joint Meeting of
the Co-ordinators of the Regional Task Teams on the Impacts of
Climate Change," 12 November 1990). <P>

Coral atoll islands larger than about 1.5 hectares, or with
diametres of more than 200 metres, contain a permanent lens of
freshwater which is very vulnerable to salinization. The lens
essentially "floats" above saltwater below the coral sand or
gravel on the island's surface. Inundation of saltwater from
overwash can contaminate the lens, and sea-level rise itself can
shrink this lens, in  manner where an increase of sea-level of
one unit results in a loss of volume in the lens by many times
more. <P>

Some of the limited-diversity atoll flora and fauna are
relatively salt resistant, like coconut and pandanus. But taro, a
staple crop, is much less so. Ultimately, salinization can be
irreversible, forcing dependence on the collection of rainwater.
(P. Roy and J. Connell, "The Greenhouse effect: Where have all
the islands gone?" Pacific Islands Monthly, April/May 1989).<P>

NOTES: President Ierimea Tabai of Kiribati had been prominent
among the Pacific leaders speaking out on the issue ahead of this
report. In 1989, he said "If the greenhouse effect raises sea
levels by one metre it will eventually do away with Kiribati. In
50 or 60 years my country will not be here." (P. Roy and J.
Connell, "The Greenhouse effect: Where have all the islands
gone?" Pacific Islands Monthly, April/May 1989). <P>

Neither are the problems limited to the Pacific. In 1987, the
Maldives were subject to exceptional flooding. President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom warned the United Nations that his nation was in
danger of disappearing beneath rising seas. (S. Wells and A.
Edwards, "Gone with the waves," New Scientist, 11 November
1989).<P>

<TITLE>SWISS REINSURANCE COMPANY BLAMES WINDSTORM LOSSES ON
GLOBAL WARMING.</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<H3><B>SWISS REINSURANCE COMPANY BLAMES WINDSTORM LOSSES ON
GLOBAL WARMING. </B></H3> <P>

"There is a significant body of scientific evidence indicating
that last year's record insured loss from natural catastrophes
was not a random occurrence. Instead it may be the result of
climatic changes that will enormously expand the liability of the
property-casualty industry. ...in the light of the magnitude of
these losses, it would be prudent for the property/casualty
industry to act is if that theory (global warming) is correct.
Failure to act would leave the industry and its policyholders
vulnerable to truly disastrous consequences ...if the rapid
increase in worldwide storm damage is due to a trend that has
hitherto gone unnoticed, the situation is indeed highly ominous:
even a flourishing industry cannot be stretched beyond its
limits. ...Research meteorologists are in no doubt that this
climatic change has already begun."  H. R Kaufmann General
Manager, Swiss Re<P>

Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurance company,
concludes that the phenomenon poses a significant risk to future
profitability. A pamphlet essay by its General Manager, published
this month, concludes that the potential losses as a result of
human-enhancement of the greenhouse effect are huge, and that the
industry would be advised to assume that global warming is real.
<P>

As evidence, he cites the 0.6 to 0.7 oC increase in global
average temperature over the last 150 years, and the 15 percent
increase in the area of Pacific waters where the surface
temperature exceeds 26 oC (the temperature above which tropical
cyclones can form). (H. R. Kaufmann, Storm damage insurance - Quo
Vadis?" Swiss Re, November 1990). <P>

Sea-level rise, as well as windstorm risk, is clearly of concern
to Swiss Re. A leading Swiss Re underwriter wrote in The Review 
in 1989 that " it is only a matter of time before the exaggerated
greenhouse effect becomes a problem for the insurance industry,"
and that "it may be that further revisions in original rates are
required, combined with a restriction of the cover given in areas
exposed below the five metre contour level." (Jeremy Hindle,
"Warming signals," The Review,  p. 34 - 37, March 1989). <P>

Other reinsurers had also expressed concern about climate change
by this stage. A Cologne Re underwriter, giving an address to the
Insurance Institute of London in March 1989, said that "one thing
is now clear, that the weather is changing in a fundamental way."
Of flooding, he said, "a Thames flood at today's values could
easily cost between £10 and £15 billion and perhaps as much as
£20 billion, enough to ensure the demise of a number of
reinsurers and a good quantity of the London market as a whole."
(S. Hitchcock, "Changing weather patterns and their effect on
reinsurers," Paper given to the Insurance Institute of London, 9
March 1989).<P>

NOTES: The worst-case analysis that is being hinted at here
involves a collapse of the global reinsurance market, and
consequent implosion of the direct insurance market. Global
reinsurance capacity is around $160 billion today. In principle,
that amount could be lost in one unlucky year, if climate change
involves an increase in intensity of windstorms. It could even be
lost without  the effects of global warming, given very bad luck.
For example, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 alone caused $16.5 billion
in insured losses. A single stronger cyclone on a more valuable
location like Tokyo or Manhattan could cause losses exceeding
$100 billion. (See August 1992 and September 1993).<P>

The  following  effects  are predicted on  the  basis  of
equilibrium and transitional experiments using the global
circulation model (GCM).  <P>

Regarding temperature: <P>

     *     at the  time of equivalent carbon dioxide doubling in
2030-2060,  overall rise  in  ground-level temperature will be
1.2 - 3.0ÉC;  <P>

     *     there  will  be sharp rises in winter temperature in
the high latitudes  of  the northern hemisphere, while
temperature increases  in  the  low-latitude  southern hemisphere
will be small; <P>

     *     continental  temperature  increases will be greater
than those at sea; <P>

     *     in  high-latitude  areas  temperature increases  will 
diminish  with  altitude,  but will be greater in high altitudes
in  low-altitude  areas. <P>

Regarding rainfall:<P>

     *     averaged over the entire  globe,  water  vapour, 
rainfall, and evaporation will all  increase;  the rainfall 
increase when equivalent CO2 has doubled will be  2-9 percent;
<P>

     *     convective rainfall will increase; rain will
concentrate  in certain  areas, and there will be a higher 
frequency  of  heavy rainfall;  <P>

     *     mid-latitude  regions with  heavy  rainfall  will 
migrate toward the poles, thereby increasing rainfall in the high

latitudes.<P>

(Meteorological  Agency,  Climate  Issues  Discussion Committee,
Working  Group on Global Warming, "Report by  the Meteorological
Agency,  Climate  Issues Discussion Committee, Working  Group  on

Global Warming," Meteorological Agency, October 1990).<P>

NOTES: Earlier Environment Agency reports had pointed out that an
increase in  convective rainfall would worsen soil erosion, and
create a range of water-resource problems. The first also
predicted increased occurrence  of drought  in  agricultural
lands because of climate  change.  A temperature rise would cause
increased evaporation from the soil, which would cause
dehydration  of  soil, as well as decreased  soil fertility and
diminished moisture retention in conjunction with the accelerated
breakdown of organic matter in soil. (Toru Kubota, "Documents for
the Global  Environmental  Problems Seminar," Environment Agency,
1989). <P>

The Japanese Environment Hygiene Centre predicted that the heavy
rains accompanying global warming would mean problems for dams
and other construction projects, winter  flooding and also more
serious water shortages in spring  and  summer, plus worsening
water quality in reservoirs and rivers. (Japan Environment
Hygiene Center, "Investigative Screening Report on Global 
Warming Countermeasures,"  (construction  environment,  civil
engineering),  Environment  Agency, March, 1989).<P>

Bangladesh suffered its worst ever flooding in 1988, when a
record flood inundated 62% of the country. At least 2,000 died
over a two week period. After one bank-collapse on the
Brahmaputra, 100,000 hectares of crops were covered. The country
was brought to a standstill for a month. The previous year had
also seen a record, with 40 percent of the country under water.
Aid specialists subsequently argued over how best to protect the
country from recurrences. French engineers suggested a $10
billion network of high embankments. US and Japanese studies
cautioned against engineered options. <P>

Dr Robert Raven, curator of arachnids at the Queensland Museum,
says that an unprecedented population boom by the red back spider
may be due to changing weather conditions in Queensland in recent
years.  "There are new infestations occurring all the time," he
says. "They are being found in areas where there was no sign of
them 20 years ago." For the first time, this year, he has found
adults in full breeding condition at the end of winter. "Usually
it would be October at the very earliest before they would
appear," he says. Throughout Australia, around 400 people are
bitten annually by redback spiders. Although still considered
dangerous, there have been no deaths since the development of the
antivenene in 1952. <P>

"It could well be we can learn more about the greenhouse effect
by studying the behaviour of these things than from other
studies."  Dr Robert Raven<P>

</B></H3><P>

Researchers have measured a further rise in sea surface
temperature in the central tropical Pacific.  ("Earthweek - A
Diary of the Planet", The Toronto Star, 27 October 1990). <P>

The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climatic phenomenon
which  influences the entire global climate system. The term
refers to two closely linked states, the classic ENSO, commonly
know as El Nino, associated with warm events, and the opposite
extreme, anti-ENSO, commonly called La Nina, associated with cold
events. <P>

ENSO events usually occur every two to ten years and generally 
last up to 18 months. They are characterised by a weakening or
reversal of the easterly trade winds, a warming of the waters of
the eastern Pacific and the switching of the see-sawing
atmospheric pressure between the eastern and western Pacific
(called the Southern Oscillation).<P>

Anti-ENSO events are generally associated with anomalies that are
the opposite to those linked to ENSO; a strengthening of the
trade winds and a cooling of waters in the eastern Pacific. ENSO
events result in climatic changes throughout the world, in
particular drought in southern Africa, Brazil and Australasia,
and floods in the countries bordering the eastern Pacific. Anti-
ENSO events generally involve phenomena which mirror those of
ENSO; floods in Australasia for example. Currently, our
understanding of ENSO is limited.<P>

NOTES: The effect of climate change on the El Nino phenomenon is
speculative. Recent work with coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs
suggests that wet and dry anomalies may become more intense.
(Report of the Workshop on ENSO and Climate Change, Bangkok 4-7
November 1991, Earth Global Environment Monitoring System, United
Nations Environment Programme/Environment & Societal Impacts
Group National Centre for Atmospheric Research).  <P>

Leading Australian climatologist Professor Ann Henderson-Sellers,
suggests that ocean warming may unbalance the constant swing from
ENSO to anti-ENSO. She speculates that ENSO may become the normal
climate state and anti-ENSO the unusual event. (A.Henderson-
Sellers and R. Blong, "The Greenhouse Effect. Living in a Warmer
Australia," New South Wales University Press, 1989). <P>

This has indeed occurred in the 18-year period 1975-1994. During
the period, a marked weakening of  anti-ENSO events led some
scientists to suggest that this period was anti-ENSO free.
("Blowing Hot and Cold in the Greenhouse," New Scientist, 11
February 1989; R.A. Kerr, "Unmasking a Shifty Climate System,"
Science, v.255, p.1508-1510, 10 March 1992). A strong anti-ENSO
occurred in 1988, and in 1990/91 a moderate ENSO developed that
continued until (at least) the end of 1993.<P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING THREAT TO WORLD FOOD PRODUCTION?
</B></H3><P>

In a report prepared for the United Nations, Prof. Martin Parry
of Birmingham University says  that global warming would reduce
food production, increase prices and introduce new uncertainties
for food supplies. At greatest risk would be one billion people
living in semi-arid regions, including much of Africa. In these
regions, any reduction in rainfall would cause drought, erosion
and desertification. <P>

In major cereal production areas, production could decrease by 10
to 20 percent by the year 2030. While some areas in the world
would have increased food production, the greatest losers would
be the US, Canada, much of Africa, the Middle East, central
America, northeast Brazil and southern Europe. <P>

("Global warming 'threat' to world food production," The Times,
25 October 1990; "Treibhauseffekt koennte Hungersnoete
verursachen,"  APA, 21 November 1990).<P>

NOTES: In June 1989, world grain reserves had fallen to just 61
days, the worst since the Soviet crop failures of 1972-3. The
contributing factors were the poor harvest in the US in 1988, and
an earlier poor harvest in India in 1987. According to agronomist
Lester Brown of the US Worldwatch Institute, in a view
contrasting with the IPCC's, if the harvest had been as bad in
1989 as it was in 1988, world grain prices would have increased
by two to three times; the resulting shock waves in the world
economy would have dwarfed the oil shock of 1973. [Note also that
the 1980s was the first decade where there was no increase in
farmed land area]. ("World's store of food shrinks to just 61
days," Times, 11 June 1989; "Famines before the floods?" New
Scientist, 31 March 1990).<P>

<H3><B>MAJOR CITIES WILL BE IN DANGER FROM STORM SURGES IN THE
FUTURE. </B></H3> <P>

Sea level rise could breach the safety margins of London's Thames
Barrier around 2030, a new study suggests. Scientists at the
University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit used the
IPCC's estimates of sea level rise, of 10-30 cm per decade, to
show that currently-engineered flood defences provide "only short
term respite" from the greenhouse effect. Cities in danger
include Hamburg, Rotterdam, Osaka, Leningrad, Miami, Shanghai and
Sydney. <P>

("Surge tide threat to Thames barrier," Guardian, 11 October
1990).<P>

NOTES: Storm surges had already proved a problem in 1990. In
February, 2,000 people were forced to flee a storm tide in Towyn,
North Wales when floodwaters breached a sea wall ("Storm tide
forces 2,000 to flee," The Independent, 27 February 1990). <P>

A report prepared as part of the IPCC process, meanwhile,
suggested that each Briton would be required to pay, at minimum,
£116 towards sea defences if a 1 metre sea-level rise was to be
kept at bay. The estimate did not include any increase in storm
intensity. Dr Pier Vellinga of the IPCC's impacts working group
observed that "it's a fraction of the total effect of climate
change. You run the risk of people saying if this is all the
cost, why do we go on burning fossil fuels?' I would like to
stress that this is only a fraction of the cost." ("Global
warming to cost each Briton £116 in sea defences," The
Independent, 29 March 1990).<P>

<H3><B>UNPRECEDENTED CORAL BLEACHING IS IN PROGRESS IN THE
CARIBBEAN. </B></H3> <P>

"We may be witnessing an early warning of global changes which
should re present  a serious concern for mankind."  Dr Tom Goreau
and colleagues testifying to a US Senate Committee.<P>

A group of five coral experts testify to a Senate committee that
corals are bleaching in many areas of the Caribbean. One, Dr Tom
Goreau from the Discovery Bay Marine Lab in Jamaica, says: "I am
confident that the mass coral bleaching events of the last four
years are unprecedented as long as reefs have been studied..."<P>

Examining evidence of sea-surface temperatures from NOAA
satellite readings, and the few sites in the Caribbean where
direct measurements had been taken during the 1980s, Goreau and
his colleagues conclude that  there had been an increase of mean
temperature of 0.5 to 1ÉC. <P>

According to Goreau: "...when Caribbean regional mass bleaching
began in 1987, many, including myself, found it hard to accept
that so severe an impact could be provoked by so small an
increase in temperature."   (Testimony to Committee on Commerce,
Science and Transportation, US Senate: 11 October 1990, including
"Prepared statement of Raymond L. Hayes,"  W.C. Jaap, "Coral
bleaching and global climate change").<P>

Coral bleaching occurs as a result of the microscopic algae which
live in symbiosis within the coral tissue - zooxanthellae - being
expelled from the tissue as a result of ecological stress. A
variety of stresses can produce this effect, including hot water,
cold water, excessive UV radiation, or pollution. Corals are
highly temperature-sensitive: stable at 25 to 29ÉC, depending on
geographic location, but stressed if they encounter temperatures
of just a few degrees C higher even for a matter of days. The
worse episodes have been associated with El Nino years. During
the 1982-83 El Nino, mortality reached 50 percent off the coast
of Panama, and 70 to 80 percent in the Galapagos. According to
reef biologists Barbara Brown and John Ogden, "the episodes of
the past decade have consistently been correlated with high
seawater temperatures." "...The narrow temperature range of
healthy coral is very close to its upper lethal temperature: an
increase of one to two degrees (C) above the usual summer maximum
can be deadly."  (B. Brown and J. Ogden, "Coral bleaching,"
Scientific American,  p. 47 -  50, January 1993).<P>

NOTES:  The seriousness of the potential impact of global warming
on coral reefs, the second most diverse ecosystem on the planet
(after the tropical rainforests), cannot be overemphasised. The
devastation visited on the eastern Pacific reefs by the hot
waters associated with the 1982-1983 El Nino provide a
foretaste.<P>


Brown and Ogden reported a decade later that "the coral
frameworks of the reefs of Panama and Galapagos have changed
dramatically as a result of the bleaching. Large areas of dead
coral have become colonized by benthic algae, which in turn
support increased populations of herbivores, particularly sea
urchins. Sea urchins are grazers; they scrape the coral rock
surface of the reef as they feed, contributing to the erosion of
the reef structure." The  rates of erosion attributable to sea
urchins alone after the 1982-1983 bleaching exceeded the growth
rates of the healthy reefs before that time. <P>

"This finding suggests that without recovery of coral
populations, these reefs will soon be reduced to carbonate
sediments. Because the grazers erode the reef surface, they may
also interfere with the recruitment of new coral colonies,
prolonging, or even preventing, their recovery." <P>

(B. Brown and J. Ogden, "Coral bleaching," Scientific American, 
p. 47 -  50, January 1993). In other words, what is at stake here
is the very existence of coral reefs. (B. Brown and J. Ogden,
"Coral bleaching," Scientific American,  p. 47 -  50, January
1993).<P>

AGRICULTURE. </B></H3> <P>

Dr Barrie Pittock tells the Australian Society of Agronomy that
"it is clear that over the next several decades climatic changes
due to the increase in the greenhouse effect will change not only
mean growing conditions but also the extremes and variability in
ways which will profoundly affect the risk and profitability of
virtually all sectors of primary industry in Australia." <P>

There were many uncertainties, he points out, but these offer if
anything further cause for concern. "Too little is known about
the climatic tolerances of most of our native plant species and
many of our crops, and almost nothing about their reaction in
field conditions to changes in carbon dioxide concentrations and
UV-B levels. ...Research is also needed on the possible effects
of environmental change on the distribution and virulence of
plant and animal diseases and pests ranging from insect-borne
diseases to locusts, ticks, rust in wheat, soil fungi and
termites." <P>

<H3><B>METHANE HYDRATES COULD STRONGLY AMPLIFY GLOBAL WARMING.
</B></H3><P>

One explanation of rapid climate change at the end of the last
glaciation, argues Dr Euan Nisbet of the University of
Sakatchewan, is that it was initially driven by methane from
natural gas fields and gas hydrates during a period of extreme
insolation. <P>

Methane hydrates are solids which lock methane gas up under
pressure in an ice-like lattice of water molecules. They are
present under the oceans and permafrost in vast quantities. In
the offshore Arctic, the cold allows their formation at
sufficiently shallow depths that warming can reach them and
destabilize them. <P>

Nisbet is one of a number of geologists who fear methane hydrates
as a potentially major positive feedback. He wrote in a 1989
paper that "any slight warming of the Arctic water will release
hydrate from the sea floor almost immediately. A temperature
change of a few degrees will liberate methane from the uppermost
sea-floor sediments at this depth within a few years." The worst-
case analysis is grim indeed: "the danger of a thermal runaway
caused by methane release from permafrost is minor, but real
...even if there is only a 1 per cent chance that such events
will occur, the social implications are profound."<P>

(E. Nisbet, "Climate change and methane," Nature, v. 347, p. 23,
September 1990).<P>

Last year, four million people were affected by famine in
northern Ethiopia; rains have thus far failed to arrive this
year. In contrast, storms and floods have left 350,000 people
homeless near the Sudanese border. This is the third consecutive
year of drought.<P>

In Sudan, drought has driven 10,000 people from their homes and
forced  the price of food to soar. In Khatoum, the price of
sorghum has quadrupled and in the south, food prices have
increased by as much as 14 times. The UN estimates that the
prolonged drought in Angola threatens 250,000 people with
immediate starvation. <P>

<H3><B>ICE CORES SHOW EVIDENCE OF HIGH CLIMATE SENSITIVITY.
</B></H3><P>

Reviewing analyses of bubbles of air trapped in ice cores in
Antarctica and Greenland, Prof. Claude Lorius and his French-
American team argue that about half the global average 5ÉC
temperature difference experienced between the last ice age
(which ended about 10,000 years ago) and the present interglacial
period was due to the heat trapping of greenhouse gases, and most
of the rest was due to changes in the amount of reflected solar
radiation resulting from the build-up of northern hemisphere ice
sheets. <P>

They believe that the switches between ice ages and interglacials
may have been triggered by the weak orbital variations
(variations in the amount of incident solar radiation resulting
from the Earth's non-circular orbiting of the Sun), and amplified
by changes in greenhouse-gas concentrations and ice cover. <P>

They argue that "...the ice-core data suggest that greenhouse
gases have had a significant role in explaining the magnitude of
past global temperature changes, and indicate a net feedback
effect ...consistent with a climate sensitivity of about 3 to 4ÉC
for a doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide." [Climate sensitivity
is the average global temperature achieved at equilibrium by
doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations - the higher
the climate sensitivity, the greater the problems arising from
global warming]. <P>

(C. Lorius, J. Jouzel, D. Raynaud, J. Hansen and H. Le Treut,
"The ice-core record: climate sensitivity and future greenhouse
warming," Nature, v. 347, p. 139-145, 13 September 1990).<P>

NOTES: To understand the implications of the temperature changes
currently predicted by climate models, the past climate record is
essential. In recent years, scientists have much refined our
appreciation of ancient  climate change using studies of cores
from ice.  <P>

In ice, measurements of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes permit
scientists to "read" the air temperature at the time the ice
formed.  A continuous record of ice up to 160,000 years old has
been drilled in Antarctica, and other important ice-core drilling
has been completed in recent years in Greenland. Using ice of
different ages, temperature trends can be built up.  Many such
studies have been completed in recent years, allowing scientists
to draw up increasingly detailed reconstructions of climate
stretching back into the past.<P>

when in Marseille rainfall was half of normal, and in Athens 40
percent of normal. In France, water utilities in more than half
the country have restricted water use.  ("The year the taps ran

Several climatologists tell the annual meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science that changes in
circulation could cause "enormous and rapid" changes in global
climate. Among them, Dr Peter Killworth of Oxford University's
Robert Hooke Institute notes that ice core data suggest the
oceans can "flip" to a completely different state within 50 years
or less. During this period, the oceans can lose heat at a
dramatic rate." Enhancing the greenhouse effect, he says, could
trigger such a switch, and it could release more than a hundred
watts per square metre, or "four times the extra amount we are
expecting from the greenhouse effect," This prospect Killworth
describes as "terrifying." <P>

Times, 21 August 1990; "Sea change that would harm world climate

<H3><B>RECORD-BREAKING HEATWAVE IN ENGLAND AND WALES.
</B></H3><P>

Amid the highest temperatures since 1879 in the UK, the M1
motorway melts, trains are cancelled for fear of buckled rails,
and a surge of patients are admitted to hospital with  heart
attacks, strokes, and smog- induced asthma. One London hospital
reports admissions up 20 percent in early August. ("The year the
taps ran dry," New Scientist, 18 August 1990). <P>

The maximum temperature recorded in England and Wales is 37.1ÉC
in Cheltenham - the highest temperature ever to be recorded
there.  Manchester's 33.8 oC is its highest since 1871; and
Heathrow's 36.5 oC is its highest since records began in 1948.
Previous heatwaves of this magnitude in the UK were in 1906 and
1911. Some places went without measurable rain for 39 days in
England. (R. Brugge, "Record_breaking heatwave of 1_4 August 1990
over England and Wales," Weather, v. 46, p. 2_10,  1991; and
R.A.S. Ratcliffe, "Review of summer 1990 in the northern
hemisphere,"  Weather, v. 45, p. 414_415,  1990).  <P>

A blocking anticyclone, sitting over western Europe for weeks and
interrupting the normally changeable westerly flow of weather, is
responsible. ("Why the heat went on and on," The Times, 7 August
1990).<P>


        THE INCIDENCES OF TEMPERATURES OVER
        35 DEGREES CENTIGRADE IN EACH COUNTY
        IN BRITAIN FROM 1879 TO 1991<P>

(J.D.C. Webb and G.T. Meaden, Weather v. 48, p. 282-291, 1993)<P>

NOTES: Only four or five similar droughts have occurred in the UK
in the past 250 years.  (T.J. Marsh and R.A. Monkhouse, "Drought
in the UK, 1988_92," Weather v. 48, p. 15_22, 1993). 1989 had set
the drought up by breaking a number of weather records in
Britain.  The average temperature in central England of 18.3 oC
in 1989  had only been passed once before, and that was in 1659
(with 1983 and 1976 being quite close).  July 1989 was the
sunniest July since 1911, and north of Glasgow, it was the
sunniest month of any other months this century.  November was
also the sunniest November on record over most of eastern
England. (P. Eden, "1989: a plethora of records," Weather, v. 45,
p. 57_58, 1990).<P>

Lima's river water supply dries up, and water tankers that
usually supply the shanty towns on the outskirts of the city are
diverted to the rich areas.  The shanty towns residents  receive
only two buckets of water a day and with food running out, and no
fuel to boil water, dysentery and intestinal diseases have
increased by 52 percent.<P>

<H3><B>MORE CYCLONES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, SAYS GEOGRAPHER.
</B></H3><P>

According to records published by the University of the South
Pacific scientist Dr Patrick Nunn, Tuvalu was hit by an average
of three per decade between the 1940s and 1970s. Eight occurred
in the 1980s.  Fiji was hit by 12 between the 1940s and 1970s, an
average of 3.1 per decade). Ten occurred between 1981 and
September 1989. (P. D. Nunn, "Recent environmental changes on
Pacific islands," Geographical Journal, v. 156, p. 125-140, July
1990).  <P>

Cyclone Ofa, one of the strongest ever Pacific cyclones, had
earlier in the year hit Tonga, the Samoas, Tokelau, and Nuie
particularly badly. Tonga, experiencing wind speeds of 110 mph,
had not been hit by such a strong cyclone for at least half a
century. ("Ofa was one of the worst in 169 years," Pacific
Islands Monthly, March 1990).<P>

NOTES: At the South Pacific Forum meeting during July, leaders of
the Pacific Island nations call for action on climate change.
They first discussed climate change at the twentieth South
Pacific Forum meeting in Kiribati, the previous year. Here, the
Forum communique stated: "Climatic Changes and Sea levels - The
Forum expressed concern about the possible effects on island
countries of rising sea levels, resulting from global warming,
and emphasised the importance of a regional approach to
environmental impacts. <P>

It agreed that Forum members should take decisive action to draw
attention to the way the environmental problem affected the South
Pacific, and to represent regional views at appropriate
international gatherings, possibly including by way of a
resolution in the UNGA."  (Paragraph 20, p. 7). In Port Vila,
Vanuatu, together with the Prime Ministers  of Australia and New
Zealand, they again warn of the dangers of climate change for the
region in their annual Declaration on economic and environmental
affairs, and call on the industrialised nations to agree
"significant" greenhouse gas emission reductions: <P>

"The Forum noted the continued threat to the cultural and
physical survival of Pacific nations from climate change and sea
level rise. The Forum recalled that the gases which cause the
greenhouse effect, notably carbon dioxide, are emitted mainly by
the industrialised countries. The Forum therefore strongly urged
industrialised countries to enact immediately significant cuts in
the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, including
the establishment of obligatory emission reduction standards. The
Forum agreed to communicate these concerns to all relevant
international bodies, including the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP), the Inter- governmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), and the World Climate Conference (WCC)".  (para 5 &
6).<P>

<H3><B>SEVENTH "BILLION-DOLLAR" NATURAL CATASTROPHE IN THREE
YEARS. </B></H3> <P>

This time, it is a windstorm in Colorado, which causes over a
billion dollars of insured losses. For the twenty year period up
to October 1987, the insurance industry had suffered no
catastrophes costing more than a billion dollars (in constant
1992 dollars) in losses. In October 1987, a run of astonishing
bad luck began with a windstorm in NW Europe which cost the
industry $2.5 billion. Then came Hurricane Hugo in September
1989, hitting the southeast coast of the US as well as for
Caribbean, causing more than $5.8 billion worth of insured losses
- the most expensive disaster in US history, up to that time. The
other four were European windstorms during January and February
1990. <P>

(J. K. Leggett, "Climate change and the insurance industry,"
Greenpeace International Special Report, February 1992 updated
May 1992, and references therein).<P>

NOTES: In the wake of the European windstorms of January and
February, insurers were pointing with concern, in growing
numbers, to the emerging predictions of global warming. For
example, Norman Lynagh, a meteorologist and Director of Noble
Denton Weather Services, an insurance consultancy, noted that
recent history "once again raises the question of whether or not
there is a trend towards more severe meteorological events in
this country." <P>

Graham Dimmock, non-marine manager for Swiss Re in the UK,
observed that "our results show that the frequency and magnitude
of weather losses are changing unarguably." ("Insurers fear
global warming to hike losses," Business Insurance, 12 February
1990).  Already, increases in premiums were under discussion. For
example, the Chief Executive of the Association of British
Insurers, Mike Jones, said in February, after the bad European
storms of that month and January: "it is very easy to be alarmist
about damage costing £2.5 billion, but this should be seen in the
context of a very mild winter and the fact that premiums are
smoothed over a long period." However, "clearly if the existing
adverse weather continues over the next few weeks, with even
higher claims, it will put more pressure on insurers to increase
their rates." <P>

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING MAY SPREAD INFECTIOUS DISEASES.
</B></H3><P>

An article in "World Health" warns that increases in rainfall and
temperature could involve expansion of the malaria-carrying
Anopheles mosquito into areas where malaria has never existed, or
had been eradicated. Desertification may counter this effect, but
"on the whole , increasing temperatures could be expected to
increase the reproduction rates both of the parasites and their
vectors and hence augment transmission of malaria." <P>

Other diseases which might be affected, including leishmaniasis,
Chagas disease (or American trypanosomiasis), schistomsomiasis,
filariasis, and onchocerciasis. Additionally, "generally
speaking, increased temperatures would raise the reproductive
rates of disease vectors, adding to vector control difficulties.
As a consequence, the shorter generation times for these vectors
could favour the emergence of strains resistant to pesticides."

<H3><B>ARCTIC ICE CAP MAY BE THINNING SAY BRITISH SCIENTISTS.
</B></H3><P>

Global warming is cited among the possible causes. The Scott
Polar Institute in the UK, using data collected on Royal Navy
submarines, reports a loss of volume of sea ice of at least 15
percent over an area of 300,000 square kilometres between 1976
and 1987. <P>

The ice sheet thinned in that period from an average of 5.3
metres, to 4.5 metres. This is not necessarily representative of
a general thinning, it could conceivably have been due to simple
interannual variability. As Wadhams concludes, "thinning of the
ice and a decrease in its extent are expected to be an early
consequence of greenhouse warming', the magnitude of which is
expected to be greatly enhanced in the Arctic regions relative to
lower latitudes, but in the absence of data from intervening
years or from years since 1987 it is not possible to confirm or
deny an effect from global warming in these data sets." <P>

Clearly, more data are urgently required. Currently, it is being
kept classified by the navies of the UK, USA, and Soviet Union.
(P. Wadhams, "Evidence for thinning of the Arctic cover north of
Greenland,"  Nature, v. 345, p. 795-797, 28 June 1990).<P>

If the ice cap (which averages only four to five metres in
thickness) melts, water circulation in the Atlantic would be
disrupted, with traumatic climate changes being the inevitable
outcome.  The main mechanism for deep water circulation in the
modern world ocean is the sinking of saline water in the North
Atlantic, and the saline water forms because salt is expelled
from ice as it forms. This mechanism is a major determining
factor on climate. Geologists have come to believe, based on ice
core information from Greenland, that ocean currents in the North
Atlantic have rearranged themselves many times over the last
160,000 years or so, often in just a few years, and with changes
of regional average temperatures of 5 oC or more. <P>

(W. S. Broecker, "Unpleasant surprises in the greenhouse?"
Nature, v. 328, p. 123-126, 1987).<P>

NOTES: Full Arctic ice data are also urgently needed to improve
the accuracy of climate models, and two leading modellers issued
a public appeal for access to the data in February 1990. Speaking
at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, Prof. Michael Schlesinger of the
University of Illinois and Prof. Syukuro Manabe of Princeton
stressed that their models were currently using data that were
inadequate for simulations of the Arctic. Manabe professed that
the exchange of sea-ice data between the US and USSR "could be
one of the peace dividends." ("Secret sea ice data holds key' to
greenhouse effect," The Independent, 21 February 1990).<P>

Publishing the first attempt to take into account in a General
Circulation Model the dynamic effects associated with changes in
ocean circulation, scientists from the Max Planck Institute in
Hamburg warn that  the buildup of a warmer surface layer will
inhibit the formation of cold, deep ocean currents. <P>

"At present, a significant fraction of the emitted carbon dioxide
is transported to the deep ocean by the newly formed deep water,
thus limiting the increase in atmospheric pCO2. If the efficiency
of this marine transport and storage mechanism is reduced, the
increase atmospheric pCO2 will be amplified. This positive
feedback can have important consequences for the evolution of
future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. pCO2 is a term for the
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, currently 350 parts per
million (ppm)." <P>

<H3><B>BRITISH DROUGHT MAY BE WORST THIS CENTURY. </B></H3><P>

Record numbers of farmers are already having their water supplies
cut off. National Rivers Authority officers in the southwest of
England report that the levels of major rivers in the region are
up to 15 per cent lower than in the record drought year of 1976.
("Britain faces worst drought this century," Sunday
Correspondent, 3 June 1990).<P>

Drought in Europe had been building for some time, and in the UK
since 1988. In January, Southern Water officials had been talking
of hiring two huge desalination plants from Saudi Arabia to moor
in the English Channel. ("Drought families will drink the sea,"
Daily Express, 6 January 1990). <P>

In February, parts of Britain experienced their hottest February
day of the century. ("Century's hottest February day," Daily
Telegraph, 24 February 1990; "Can this really be Britain in
February?" Daily Mail, 24 February 1990). <P>

On May 1st, the hottest May day ever in the UK, temperatures of
81 F in Scotland were higher than those in the Sahara. ("Hottest
May day since 1875 beats the Sahara," Today, 2 May 1990).<P>

NOTES: Warmer than average temperatures across much of Asia,
Europe and North America encouraged an early growing season. Cold
snaps in early April then caused massive damage to crops. In the
Netherlands, for example, where March was the warmest in this
century, many apple and pear trees which had already bloomed were
heavily damaged by frost in the first week of April. (Doug
LeComte, "Weather of 1990...And Around the World," NOAA/USDA
Joint Agricultural Weather Facility, USA, Weatherwise, v.44,

<H3><B>CANADIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FEAR RECURRENCE OF FOREST
FIRES. </B></H3> <P>

Drought conditions have persisted since unprecedented forest
fires in 1989. This year, they fear, the officials fires could
even be worse, because of existing damage, and because the
drought has engendered ideal conditions for the fast spread of
forest fires. <P>

(D. Nixon, "Canada blazing: unprecedented fire losses last year
and persistent drought conditions are making officials fear the
summer of '90,"  American Forests, v. 96, p. 33_35, 1990).<P>

NOTES: Before 1989, high temperatures and drought had dried up
many natural wetlands that generally serve as natural barriers to
fire. By Autumn 1989, the province of Manitoba had been burned by
over 1,140 fires, six times more than usual, consuming 2.7
million hectares and forcing the evacuation of 25,000 people.
Fires also raged in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Ontario. By the end
of the year, 6.4 million hectares of forest have been destroyed,
an area twice the size of the Netherlands.("Fire emergency
declared as 18,000 flee from homes,"  Winnipeg Free Press, 24
July 1989; "Shifting the Ashes" series, Winnipeg Free Press,
September 6,7,8,12 1989; "Unprecedented weather cited in record

<TITLE>THE IPCC PUBLISHES ITS FIRST IMPACTS REPORT.</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<IMG SRC= "../icons/gpclogo.gif" ALT="Greenpeace Logo"><BR>
<H3><B>THE IPCC PUBLISHES ITS FIRST IMPACTS REPORT. </B></H3><P>

The IPCC's Impacts Working Group (WG2) points to a wide variety
of potential problems. These are highlighted by the extracts
below. ("Potential Impacts of Climate Change" Report Prepared for
IPCC by Working Group 2, UNEP-WMO, June 1990; "Scientists
increase pressure for curbs on global warming," The Independent,
1 June 1990).<P>

<B>On natural terrestrial ecosystems:<B> "Climatic zones could
shift several hundred kilometres towards the poles over the next
fifty years." "These rates (of projected climate change) are
likely to be faster than the ability of some species to respond
and responses may be sudden or gradual. Some species could be
lost owing to increased stress leading to a reduction in
biological diversity. Increased incidence of disturbances such as
pest outbreaks and fire are likely."<P>

NOTES: The record of the effects of past relatively rapid rates
of change on ecosystems, particularly at the end of the last ice
age, suggest that rates higher than 0.1 oC per decade are
unsustainable without ecological trauma.  The IPCC central
estimate is 0.3 oC per decade. (B. Huntley, "Lessons from
climates of the past," in J. K. Leggett (ed), "Global Warming:
The Greenpeace Report," Oxford University Press, p. 133-148,
1990).<P>

<B>On agriculture:</B> "Studies have not yet conclusively
determined whether, on average, global agricultural potential
will increase or decrease. Negative impacts could be felt at the
regional level," and some of these could be severe, especially in
the regions least able to adjust (naming among others Brazil, the
Sahel, the Asian region of the USSR, and China). <P>

"There is the possibility that potential productivity of high and
mid latitudes may increase because of a prolonged growing season,
but it is not likely to open up large new areas for production
and it will be mainly confined to the Northern Hemisphere.
Patterns of agricultural trade could be altered by decreased
cereal production in some of the currently high-production areas,
such as Western Europe, southern US, parts of South America and
western Australia. Horticultural production in mid-latitude
regions may be reduced. On the other hand, cereal production
could increase in northern Europe. Policy responses directed to
breeding new plant cultivars, and agricultural management
designed to cope with changed climate conditions could lessen the
severity of regional impacts. On balance, the evidence suggests
that in the face of estimated changes of climate, food production
at the global level can be maintained at essentially the same
level as would have occurred without climate change; however, the
cost of achieving this is unclear."<P>

NOTES: Not everyone shared this relatively sanguine view. For
example, a few months earlier the Chairman of the British
Countryside Commission, Sir Derek Barber, had warned that "the
distortions of food production (as result of climate change)
could be horrific.." He warned that "it could lead to this
country having once again to accept food maximisation policies
last seen in the Second World War." ("Global warming may mean a
return to wartime farming'," Daily Telegraph, 11 January
1990).<P>

Note also that pests and diseases cut the world's food supply
significantly each year. Diseases alone are responsible for a
reduction in the total harvest of around 12 per cent. And half
the world's pests have evolved tolerance to at least one major
group of pesticides. (S. Day, "A shot in the arm for plants," New
Scientist, 9 January 1993). There is appreciable scope for this
problem to exacerbated in a warming world. <P>

A major criticism of the early view of the IPCC on the impact of
climate change food security involves the potentially synergistic
effect with declining biodiversity, which according to the FAO
and others is already threatening food security. Biological
diversity represents, as the FAO puts it, both the raw material
for the production of plant and animal foodstocks and "a
reservoir of genetic agricultural adaptability, which acts as a
buffer against harmful environmental changes. Their erosion
severely increases agricultural vulnerability and threatens world
food security. According to experts, since the beginning of this
century around three quarters of the genetic diversity amongst
agricultural crops has been lost and according to the FAO/UNEP
World Watch List for Domestic Animal Diversity, 28% of the
remaining world's domestic animal genetic resources are under
serious threat." (FAO Progress Report on Resolution 3 of the
Nairobi Final Act, Information Paper, First Session of the
Intergovernmental Committee on the Convention on Biological
Diversity, Geneva, 11 - 15 October 1993).<P>

<B>On hydrology and water resources:</B> "Relatively small
climate changes can cause large water resource problems in many
areas, especially arid and semi-arid regions and those humid
areas where demand or pollution has led to water scarcity." "In
some limited areas, for example, under the assumed scenario of a
1 oC to 2 oC temperature increase, coupled with a 10% reduction
in precipitation, a 40-70% reduction in annual runoff would
occur." "Change in drought risk represents potentially the most
serious impact of climate change on agriculture at both regional
and global levels."<P>

NOTES: Drought was at this time building in a number of places
around the world.  In California, suffering its fourth year of
drought, the situation was becoming severe. In December 1989 most
of California had no precipitation at all. The last time that had
happened was in 1876. A vast area of high pressure, the Pacific
High, hung over the Pacific. It would normally have broken up or
moved south by now, but California had not had a "normal"
precipitation year since 1975. The last time the state suffered 
four dry years in a row was during the Great Drought of the
1930s. ("Running on empty," The Guardian, 6 January 1990).<P>

<B>On human settlements and health:</B> "In coastal lowlands such
as Bangladesh, China and Egypt, as well as in small island
nations, inundation due to sea-level rise and storm surges could
lead to significant movements of people." "Major health impacts
are possible, especially in large urban areas, owing to changes
in availability of water and food and increased health problems
due to heat stress spreading of infections. Changes in
precipitation and temperature could radically alter the patterns
of vector-borne and viral diseases by shifting them to higher
latitudes, thus putting large populations at risk. As similar
events have in the past, these changes could initiate large
migrations of people, leading over a number of years to severe
disruptions of settlement patterns and social instability in some
areas."<P>

<B>On oceans and coastal zones:</B> "A 1m rise by 2100 would
render some island countries uninhabitable, displace tens of
millions of people, seriously threaten low-lying urban areas,
flood productive land, contaminate fresh water supplies and
change coastlines. All these impacts would be exacerbated if
droughts and storms become more severe." "Impacts on the global
oceans will include changes in the heat balance, shifts in ocean
circulation which will affect the capacity of the ocean to absorb
heat and CO2, and changes in upwelling zones associated with
fisheries."<P>

NOTES:  Neither are the threats to coastal zones limited to
developing countries, or to cities immediately on the coast.
Hamburg's experience is instructive. It is 120 km from the North
Sea, but the River Elbe acts as a funnel, lifting tides higher
than at the coast. After a 1962 flood which killed 315, Hamburg
raised its defences from 5.7 to 7-2 to 9 m above sea level. In
1976, these were nearly breached by a 6.45 m above-sea-level
tide. The defences were raised a further 30 cm. An official
analysis shows that at risk if they are breached are 320,000
people, over 200 square km of land, and a damage bill measured in
billions. (B. O'Neill, "Cities against the sea," New Scientist, 3
February 1993).<P>

<B>On seasonal snow cover, ice and permafrost:</B> The global
areal extent and volume of elements of the terrestrial cryosphere
(seasonal snow cover, near-surface layers of permafrost, and some
masses of ice) will be substantially reduced. These reductions,
when reflected regionally, could have significant impacts on
related ecosystems and social and economic activities.
Compounding these impacts in some regions is that, as a result of
the associated climatic warming positive feedbacks, the
reductions could be sudden rather than gradual."<P>

<H3><B> MORE NORTH SEA STORM SURGES PREDICTED </B></H3><P>

Dr Robert Kay of the University of East Anglia, undertaking a
study of cities at risk for the US Bureau of National Affairs,
observes that storm surges of the kind that killed 300 in the and
3000 in Holland in 1953 would be more likely, and with bigger
impact, if sea-level rises as predicted by the IPCC. In 1953, a
major storm pushed water down the North Sea at the same time as a
high tide. <P>

("More North Sea storms likely," The Independent, 1 June
1990).<P>

NOTES: A secret list of parts of the UK which will have to be
abandoned to rising seas was already underway at this time,
according to a report leaked to The Observer. The report was a
four-year study for the Anglian region of the National Rivers
Authority, was the "most detailed ever undertaken" of the
subject. It shows that about 70% of the coastline is retreating
as sea level rises, and that 80% of beaches are becoming more
steep, making them less able to absorb the power of waves, and
more prone to erosion. The Anglian National Rivers Authority
described the situation as a "tidal time bomb." ("Britain under
threat from tidal timebomb," Observer, 8 April 1990).<P>

Anticipated impacts include the following. Tropical cyclones may
increase in the north of the country, and since much of the
country's wealth and population is in the north, this makes it
more vulnerable. More rain is likely, and especially more heavy
rainstorms that release a lot of rain in short periods, over all
of New Zealand. Areas that are already liable to flooding will
become more so. Global warming will melt ski slope snow and
affect New Zealand's tourist industry. <P>

The floods swamp an area the size of Britain, France and Germany
combined. Houses are swept off their foundations, cars and
businesses are damaged and thousands are left homeless. 150,000
livestock are lost and farming communities left isolated.  The
final cost is expected to  run into hundreds of millions of
(Australian) dollars. <P>

<H3><B>THIRD SUMMER OF SEVERE FIRES IN THE BOREAL FOREST.
</B></H3><P>

600,000 hectares of Mongolian Forest are destroyed by fire, and
forest fires rage in Eastern Siberia as gale force winds spread
hundreds of fires over thousands of hectares and threaten the
cities of Uran Ude and Chita. ("Fires in Mongolia burn 600,000
hectares of forest," Yinha, 26 May 1990; "Forest fires rage in
Trans-Baikal area," Tass, 17 May 1990; "Forest fires continue
raging in Buryat Republic," Tass, 18 May 1990).<P>

NOTES: In 1988, a huge area of Yellowstone Park had been
destroyed by forest fire as the park suffered the worst drought
in its 112 years of recorded history. 249 fires burnt though the
National Park, double the usual number. Windstorms of hurricane
strength had driven walls of flame 60 metres high through the
park. Despite the best efforts of more than 25,000 fire fighters,
more than 411,000 hectares of forest had been severely damaged.
(Gregory Vogt, "Forest on Fire: the fight to save our trees,"
Watts, New York, 1990). Then, in 1989, Canada had experienced the
worst forest fires in its history. Early in 1990, it seemed to be
Siberia's turn.<P>

<H3><B>THE FIRST REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENT PANEL ON CLIMATE
CHANGE IS RELEASED. </B></H3> <P>

"...we have an authoritative early warning system: an agreed
assessment of some three hundred of the world's leading
scientists of what is happening to the world's climate ...a
report of historic significance... what it predicts will affect
our daily lives."   UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the
morning of the release of the IPCC's first scientific assessment,
15 May 1990. <P>

The IPCC formalises the fact that the great majority of the
world's climate scientists now believe global warming to be
"certain" in the decades ahead. This report was commissioned by
the UN General Assembly in 1988 and involved more than 300
scientists from more than 20 countries. The message of the report
is that the planet is seemingly heading for environmental
disaster if  humankind continues to put greenhouse gases
(principally carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs and nitrous oxide)
into the atmosphere at anything like the rates we do today as a
result of many of our current energy, industrial and agricultural
practices. <P>

According to the predictions of the IPCC scientists - in fact a
synthesis of predictions from all the world's major climate
modelling centres, which are now in close agreement - world
average temperatures and sea level would increase much faster
than at any time in the history of human civilisation if
humankind keeps emitting greenhouse gases in anything like the
present volumes. <P>

The best-guess predicted rate of global warming is an increase in
global average temperature of 0.3 oC per decade, with an
uncertainty range from 0.2 to 0.5 oC per decade.<P>

("Scientific Assessment of Climate Change" Report of IPCC Working
Group 1, UNEP-WMO, 1990; "Race to save Our World," Daily Express,
16 May 1990).<P>

NOTES: Estimates of future climate are based on computer
simulations of the climate, General Circulation Models (GCMs),
which require the world's fastest computers. In the USA,
institutions where this work is carried out include the National
Centre for Atmospheric Research, NASA, and NOAA; in the UK, at
the Meteorological Office; in Germany, at the Max Planck
Institute; and in Australia, at the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Bureau of
Meteorology Research Centre.<P>

What the IPCC said:<P>

Climate extremes and extreme events: "Changes in the variability
of weather and the frequency of extremes will generally have more
impact than changes in the mean climate at a particular location.
With the possible exception of an increase in the number of
intense showers, there is no clear evidence that weather
variability will change in the future. In the case of
temperatures, assuming no change in variability, but with a
modest increase in the mean, the number of days with temperatures
above a given value at the high end of the distribution will
increase substantially." "If the large-scale weather regimes, for
instance the depression tracks or anticyclones, shift their
position, this would affect the variability and extremes of
weather at a particular location, and could have a major effect.
However, we do not know if, or in what way, this will happen."<P>

NOTES: Considerable interest focused on this question at the time
because the 1980s had been a decade which broke a number of
records. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, "in
the period between 1981 - 1990, several significant new records
were set: minimum temperature of - 86.6 oC in July 1983 in
Antarctica, minimum surface atmospheric pressure of 888 hPa
associated with Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, a maximum surface
pressure of 1075 hPa in Alaska in 1989. Tropical monsoon rainfall
generally diminished and midlatitude precipitation may have
increased.  The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm episode
of 1982/83 was perhaps the strongest this century, causing
Australia to have the worst droughts since the 1860s.  The ENSO
cold episode of 1988/89 was one of the strongest for 50 years.
Global mean temperature was up in the 1980s.  The 1980s were the
warmest decade since relevant records began available in the mid
nineteenth century." ("A remarkable decade," World Climate News,
WMO, no 2, January 1993).<P>

Tropical storms in a warmer world: "Tropical storms, such as
typhoons and hurricanes, only develop at present over seas that
are warmer than about 26 oC. Although the area of sea having
temperatures over this critical value will increase as the world
warms, the critical temperature itself may increase in a warmer
world. Although the theoretical maximum intensity is expected to
increase with temperature, climate models give no consistent
indication whether tropical storms will increase or decrease in
frequency or intensity as climate changes; neither is there any
evidence that this has occurred over the past few decades."<P>

NOTES: Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988, the strongest
hurricane ever seen, killed 300 in the Caribbean and left one
million people homeless. Hurricane Hugo of  1989, which caused
$5.8 billion of insured losses, was the most expensive disaster
in US history. These "superhurricanes" had come after several
decades of very low activity.  At this time, one of the world's
most eminent hurricane researchers, Dr William Gray, was
predicting that more hurricanes will hit the US mainland in the
1990s, but not necessarily because of global warming. Gray links
Atlantic hurricanes to changing weather patterns over Africa
rather than to global warming, with dry periods in the Sahel
coinciding with periods of less intense hurricanes, and vice
versa. The years 1988 and 1989 brought the heaviest rains in the
Sahel since 1966-67, when a two-decade period of drought (the
worst in 150 years) began. In relatively wet periods, a wavy jet
of wind blows out of west Africa into the Atlantic. Atmospheric
disturbances associated with it, Gray suggests, provide a trigger
for hurricanes. ("Hurricane-Drought link bodes ill for US Coast,"
Science, 12 January 1990).<P>

Mid-latitude storms in a warmer world: "Mid-latitude storms, such
as those which track across the North Atlantic and North Pacific,
are driven by the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. As this
contrast will probably be weakened in a warmer world (at least in
the Northern Hemisphere), it might be argued that mid-latitude
storms will also weaken or change their tracks, and there is some
indication of a general reduction in day-to-day variability in
the mid-latitude storm tracks in winter in model simulations,
though the pattern of changes vary from model to model. Present
models do not resolve smaller-scale disturbances, so it will not
be possible to assess changes in storminess until results from
higher resolution models become available in the next few
years."<P>

NOTES: There was considerable concern over this issue at the
time, because a number of ferocious windstorms had hit Europe
earlier in the year. An un-named storm in October 1987 had caused
$2.5 billion worth of insured losses. That record had been broken
in January 1990, when the insurance bill for Windstorm Daria had
been $4.6 billion. Then, in February 1990, three more storms
piled up $5.8 billion in losses. The UK Government took out a
controversial full-page newspaper advert with pictures of the
storm damage, and some of the millions of felled trees, under the
caption "Global warming: We have been warned." British
meteorologists Brian Hoskins and Paul Valdes were among those who
suspected the greenhouse effect might be implicated. Others, such
as former Director General of the Meteorological Office, is sure
that the greenhouse effect had nothing to do with the storms.
("Scientists in a storm over cause of the gales," Sunday Times,
11 March 1990). The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
(ECE) reported severe damage to forests after the storms More
than 50 million cubic metres of forest was destroyed across
Germany. Czechoslovakia, Austria, France and Switzerland also
sustained significant losses. (Austra Press Agency, "Maerz-
Steurme warfen in Europa 100 Mill. Kubikmeter Holz," 3 May
1990).<P>

Sea level rise: The average sea-level rise in the twentieth
century has been around 10 cm per decade. Assuming a "business-
as-usual" emissions scenario, "the predicted rise is about 20 cm
in global mean sea level by 2030, and 65 cm by the end of the
next century. There will be significant regional variations." The
best estimate, then, is about 6 cm per decade, with a range of 3
to 10 cm. "The best estimate ...is made up mainly of positive
contributions from thermal expansion of the oceans and the
melting of glaciers. Although, over the next 100 years, the
effect of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is expected to
be small, they make a major contribution to the uncertainty in
predictions."<P>

One very important IPCC caveat on feedbacks: "Because natural
sources and sinks of greenhouse gases are sensitive to a change
in climate, they may substantially modify future concentrations.
It appears that as climate warms, these feedbacks will lead to an
overall increase, rather than decrease, in natural greenhouse gas
abundances. For this reason, climate change is likely to be
greater than the estimates we have given."<P>

NOTES: Greenpeace's criticisms of the IPCC scientific assessment
focused, then, as now, on the fact that the worst- case analysis
arising from this conclusion was not spelt out for policymakers. 
Given that the climate change problem is essentially one of
threat-assessment in the face of uncertainty, this we consider to
be an important omission in the IPCC science- advisory process.
The worst-case analysis is, in principle, amplification of
warming, by the kinds of feedbacks alluded to here, to a point of
no return, beyond which might lie a point where emissions
resulting from feedbacks would cancel out any anthropogenic
emissions reductions, hence engendering essentially unstoppable
warming. (J. K. Leggett, "Global warming: the worst- case,"
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, v. 85, p. 28-32, 1992).<P>

And another very important caveat on risk, potentially related to
the above: "We must recognize that our imperfect understanding of
climate processes (and corresponding ability to model them) could
make us vulnerable to surprises; just as the human-made ozone
hole over Antarctica was entirely unpredicted. In particular, the
ocean circulation, changes in which are thought to have led to
periods of comparatively rapid climate change at the end of the
last ice age, is not well observed, understood, or modelled."<P>

<H3><B>1990 SUMMARY </B></H3><P>

1990 was the hottest year since records began 140 years ago.
March 1990 was the most anomalously warm month ever.  1990 was
0.39ÉC above the 1951_1980 average. (D. E.  Parker and P. D.
Jones, "Global warmth in 1990," Weather,  v. 46, p. 302_311,
1991).<P>

"On physical grounds, and in the light of an increasing number 
of numerical modelling studies, it is becoming increasingly 
probable that the enhancement of the greenhouse effect, through
the input of carbon dioxide and other gases into the  atmosphere,
is contributing to the recent warming."   D. E. Parker (UK
Meterological Office) and P. D. Jones (University of East
Anglia)<P>

   The extent of snow cover in the northern hemisphere was less
than normally expected during every month of the year, by an
amount averaging 8 to 10 per cent. In the late winter and spring
there was less snow cover in the northern hemisphere than at any
time since satellite records began in 1970. (P. D. Jones and T.
M. L. Wigley, "Global warming trends," Scientific American,
August 1990). Satellite pictures indicate  that  snow cover
during 1988 and 1989 was at its lowest extent since monitoring
began in  1972, and the previous nine years have had less snow
cover than during the 1972-80 period. Studies also suggest a
close correlation between average  surface air temperature and
average snow cover. (David A. Robinson and Kenneth F. Dewey,
"Recent secular variations in the extent of September 1990
northern hemisphere snow cover,"  Geophysical Research Letters,
v.17(10), pp. 1557-1560, September 1990).<P>

     California is ending its fifth year of drought, which is its
longest spell of drought this century.  ("Review of winter
1990/91 in the northern hemisphere," Weather, v. 46, p.148_150,
1991;  "Review of autumn 1990 in the northern hemisphere,"
Weather, v. 46, p. 55_56, 1991).<P>

     1990 is Washington D.C.'s warmest year on record. According
to the US National Weather Service, records show an irregular,
but definite warming trend since 1917.  ("Earthweek: Diary of the
Planet", The Toronto Star, 5 January 1991).<P>

     Not for at least seven centuries has central Europe
experienced such a succession of mild and dry winters as it has
between 1987 and 1990. (G. A. Berz, "Greenhouse effects on
natural catastrophes and insurance," Geneva Papers on Risk and
Insurance, v. 17, No. 64, p. 386-392, July 1992).<P>

      In southern Africa, a drought early in the growing season
devastated crops in Angola. The ongoing civil war complicated
relief efforts and food shortages resulted in the death of over
10,000 people during the first seven months of the year.<P>

     In northern Africa, the Sahel rainy season was
disappointing. Two consecutive years of good rain had raised
hopes that the dryness that had plagued the region since the
1960s had ended, but this year's rainy season suggests the Sahel
has not returned to the wetter climate of the past. "The most
serious drought was in the Sudan and was compounded by high
temperatures, which raised the spectre of famine. The drought was
as severe as the drought in 1984 which caused the death of
thousands of people." ("Weather of 1990...And Around the World,"
NOAA/USDA Joint Agricultural Weather Facility, USA. Weatherwise,
v. 44 (1), p.13-15, February 1991).<P>

     The eastern Pacific saw a record 16 hurricanes, including
several very strong ones [four Category 4s].  This figure is
twice the average and four more than the previous record. Twenty
named tropical cyclones materialized, two shy of the record but
four more than the long term average. Hurricanes Hernan and Trudy
were among the strongest ever observed in the region, although
records are suspect prior to the implementation of the weather
satellites in 1966. ("Eastern Pacific Hurricanes: A Record Year,"
Lixion Avila, National Hurricane Center, USA; Weatherwise, v. 44
(1), p.36-43, February 1991).<P>

     A new US record was set for the most tornadoes in a single
year: 1,126. Only twice since records began in 1950 has the
annual total exceeded 1,000  in 1973 (1,102) and 1982 (1,047).
"As in 1989, there was an increase in violent tornadoes (F4 and
F5 on the Fujita scale). Fourteen tornadoes fit these categories
and three F5 tornadoes had estimated windspeeds in excess of 260
mph....Not since 1976 have so many F5 tornadoes struck the nation
in a single year." (Edward Ferguson and Frederick Ostby,
"Tornadoes of 1990: An All Time Record Year," National Severe
Storms Forecast Center, USA. Weatherwise, v.44 (2), p.19-28,
April 1991).<P>

     Corals suffered mass bleaching and 50 percent mortality in
the southern part of the Arabian Gulf (Straits of Hormuz). Corals
hereabouts can withstand an unusual span of high and low
temperatures (13-36 oC). This led reef biologist Dr Peter Glynn
to conclude that "this suggests that even some corals adapted to
extreme thermal conditions can be severely affected by sea
warming over prolonged periods." (P. W. Glynn, "Coral reef
bleaching in the 1980s and possible connection with global
warming," TREE, v. 6, p. 175-179, June 1991).<P>

     The mild UK winter of 1989/90, and hot dry summer of 1990,
were both the second such in succession, and caused significant
ecological changes.      <P>

     *     most plants flowering before April were early<P>

     *     vernal species such as the bluebell were suppressed<P>

     *     aphids flew early (in April), with record numbers in
July <P>

     *     potatoes were affected by aphid-related blight<P>

     *     frogs spawned several weeks to months earlier<P>

     *     rat populations were unusually high<P>

     *     slugs were very active in winter 88/89<P>

     *     wasps were very active in summer 90<P>

     *     some mature broad leaved trees suffered possible
lasting damage      <P>

     *     nuisance blooms of blue-green algae developed in many
lakes <P>

(M.G.R. Cannell and C.E.R. Pitcairn (eds), "Impacts of the mild
winters and hot summers in the United Kingdom in 1988-1990,"
Department of the Environment, HMSO, 1992).<P>

NOTES: In the UK, magnolias normally bloom between the third week
of March and the beginning of April, marking the "official"
opening of Spring on 21 March. But not in 1989. New Scientist
reported that "with no respect for officialdom, magnolias and
almonds, daffodils and a host of other plants are blooming long
before they are supposed to." The first magnolia blossom appeared
on the 10th February.  "Even now it is far too soon to speculate
on whether the greenhouse effect has anything to do with the
early spring," concluded New Scientist's correspondent. "But
doom-mongers and climatologists could do worse than keep an eye
on the magnolias." (S. Pain, "Flowers that bloom in the winter,"
New Scientist, 11 March 1989).<P>

      UK hydrologists argue that water management will need to be
rethought. "Along with much of the rest of Europe, the UK
experienced atypical weather patterns in 1990 (and over the
preceding two years) with, as a consequence, dramatic variations
in river flow and groundwater levels." 1990 and 1989 have
demonstrated that parts of southern Britain are very vulnerable
to drought conditions.  Since there are population concentrations
in these areas _ and intensive agriculture _ this could become a
very real problem. Marsh and Monkhouse conclude that if this
pattern of rainfall is to become the norm, we need to rethink our
water supply systems.  We may need to consider options involving
more reservoirs, desalination plants, or moving water from one
region to another.  All these are expensive, especially since
"the implications of global warming remain imprecise."  (T. J.
Marsh and R.A. Monkhouse, "A year of hydrological extremes _
1990,"  Weather, v. 46, p. 366_376,  1991).<P>

     Research by the UK's Marine Biological Association and
others showed that warm water species were being recorded in
British waters in growing numbers by the spring of 1990, and some
scientists were already ascribing their appearance to the
greenhouse effect. In early April, for example, a large groper,
normally found in the Mediterranean and other warm seas, was
caught  six miles off Lyme Regis on the UK south coast. One
expert observed that "it is still only April. Tropical fish would
not survive in our normal winter. It is quite possible that there
is a change in our climate. Once again we have had a mild winter
and the greenhouse effect cannot be ruled out." (Warmer seas lure
fish from tropics," The Times, 6 April 1990). The appearance of
such warm-loving species as the red mullet, the marbled electric
ray, and the triggerfish, plus associated changes in much smaller
marine life, led Prof. Alan Southwood, one of the UK's most
eminent marine biologists, to tell The Times in August 1989 that
he thinks the greenhouse effect is responsible. The Times'
correspondent reported that he had "spoken to other marine
biologists who share Professor Southwood's view but feel unable
to speak publicly about it."  ("Greenhouse clues off the Cornish
coast," The Times, 4 August 1989).<P>

"I think it is the greenhouse effect." Prof. Alan Southwood

Prof. Martin Parry of Oxford University, in a book setting out
the work underlying the IPCC's conclusions on agriculture,
concludes that it should be. "But the cost of achieving this is
unclear. It could be very large."could be very large."  The
report suggests that agricultural production in major cereal
production areas could decrease by 10 to 20 percent.  Arid and
semi-arid areas such as the Sahel zone and countries around the
Horn of Africa may be particularly vulnerable. <P>

<H3><B>IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, EXISTING STRESSES CAN ONLY BE
EXACERBATED. </B></H3> <P>

An UNEP report warns that the Mediterranean is already a severely
stressed environment, and climate change impacts will accordingly
be amplified. Examples involves the dangers on the Po delta: "An
unstable coastline and degraded shallow water environments make
the northern Adriatic lowlands especially susceptible to the
effects of climate change. At risk is the very existence of
Venice and neighbouring towns of artistic and historical
significance, a thriving tourist industry, unique agricultural
lands, and thriving harbours." <P>

Other dangers highlighted include drought, salinization,
desertification, increasing forest fire, soil erosion as a result
of loss of soil organic matter, the loss of freshwater resources,
increasing difficulty of waste-water treatment, and health risks
arising from a variety of sources.<P>

("High and dry: Mediterranean climate in the Twenty-first
Century," UNEP, 1990).<P>

NOTES: The report concludes: "it is likely that the impact of
climate change will first be felt in the Mediterranean water
resource system." By the end of 1993, these words were to look
highly prophetic, especially where Spain and Greece were
concerned.<P>

"Even a cursory glance at some of the basic principles of
reinsurance reveals the concern that ought to exist about the
greenhouse effect scenario ...If ever there was a case for moving
the goalposts this is it." J. C. Doornkamp<P>

A UK Reinsurances Offices Association report concludes, in the
wake of Hurricane Hugo and the 1990 European windstorms, that the
greenhouse effect poses a major threat the reinsurance
industry.<P>

<H3><B>WINDSTORM RISK MAY BECOME UNMANAGEABLE, MUNICH RE SAYS.
</B></H3><P>

"For the first time in the history of our planet, mankind is
about to change the climate significantly and possibly
irreversibly, without having any idea of the consequences that
will have. ....With economic and insured losses increasing in
volume by a factor of 3 and 5 respectively since the '60s, we
definitely have a trend which, without exaggeration, may be
regarded as dramatic." Munich Re<P>

The world's biggest reinsurance company issues a long report
analysing the threat of climate change.  It argues that "if water
temperatures increase by 0.5 to 1 degree C in the course of the
next few decades, we can expect an extension of the hurricane
season by several weeks and a considerable increase in the
frequency and intensity of hurricanes. ...A warmer atmosphere and
warmer seas result in greater exchange of energy and add momentum
to the vertical exchange processes so crucial to the development
of tropical cyclones, tornadoes, thunderstorms and hailstorms.
Accordingly, such natural hazards will increase not only in
frequency and intensity but also in duration and size of areas at
risk. <P>

This applies above all to tropical cyclones, which will penetrate
moderate latitudes and thus also affect areas so far not exposed
to risk. Hence, risk conditions are not only growing worse in the
population centres and industrial regions along the northeast
coasts of the USA, Australia and New Zealand or in the whole of
Japan already exposed to such hazards in the past, but possibly
also along the coasts of Western Europe, which have already been
hit from time to time by heavy rainfall following in the wake of
hurricanes. Now such parts of Western Europe might even be
reached by a full-fledged hurricane. Similarly, the explosive'
development of low pressure systems already observed time and
again in the Mediterranean region, with features quite comparable
to tropical cyclones, might well result in full-scale hurricanes
causing incredible damage in these densely populated regions."
("Windstorm," Munich Re Special Publication, 1990).<P>

NOTES: Munich Re officials had been talking about climate change
as a possible problem long before 1990. A special publication as
long ago as 1973 had mentioned carbon dioxide in connection with
flood risk. ("Hochwasser/Ueberschwemmung," Munich Re, 1973). In
the 1977 Annual Report, General Manager Herr Jannott mentioned
the risk for the first time to shareholders. Dr Gerhard Berz,
head of Geoscience Research, began writing about the threat in
insurance industry literature in 1987 ("G. A. Berz,

<TITLE>ANTARCTIC RESEARCHERS SPECULATE ON LONG-TERM IMPACT OF

<H3><B>ANTARCTIC RESEARCHERS SPECULATE ON LONG-TERM IMPACT OF
GLOBAL WARMING ON ICE SHELVES. </B></H3> <P>

A temperature scenario is imposed in which surface air
temperature rises to 4.2 oC in the year 2100 AD, and is kept
constant afterwards.  As GCM studies seem to indicate a higher
temperature increase in polar latitudes, the response to a more
extreme scenario (where warming is doubled) is also been
investigated.  The models suggest that retreat of the Ross and
the Ronne-Filchner ice shelves will be small, or absent, but that
in some areas along the Antarctic Peninsula and the east
Antarctic coast, ice retreat will be much more apparent. <P>

(P. Huybrechts and J. Oerlemans, "Response of the Antarctic ice
sheet to future greenhouse warming,"  Climate Dynamics, v. 5 , p.
93_102, December 1990).<P>

NOTES: Some NASA glaciologists believe that signs of instability
seen in fast flowing ice streams on the Ross Ice Shelf in recent
years may indicate possible instability in the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet. If all or part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses
into the sea, the sea level rise would be far more catastrophic
than that already predicted by the IPCC. A British Antarctic
Survey scientist wrote in New Scientist in 1989 that: "People
should treat a rapid disintegration of the West Antarctic ice
sheet as a threat while so many important influences, such as the
ocean circulation below the ice shelves and the interactions
between ice streams and inland ice, are still unknown." (R.
Frolich, "The self life of Antarctic Ice," New Scientist, 4
November 1989). <P>

A report of a January 1990 workshop on the problem concluded that
"the presence of five active ice streams feeding ice from the
interior of West Antarctica into the Ross Ice Shelf, and other
ice streams draining other portions of West Antarctica into the
Ronne Ice Shelf and separate peripheral ice shelves on the
northern boundary of the ice sheet, may be manifestations of
collapse already underway. The current absence of a substantial
ice shelf that could buttress the Pine Island and Thwaites
Glaciers could cause a forthcoming collapse of that part of the
ice sheet. <P>

The question facing us is whether the atmosphere and ocean system
is coupled to the ice sheets in such a way that a climatic
warming from present conditions is likely to trigger, or has
already triggered, the marine ice-sheet instability in the West
Antarctic ice sheet, or in certain parts of the Greenland or East
Antarctic ice sheets that are marine in character. Answering this
question requires a better understanding of the interactions
between the marine ice sheets and the global environment than has
yet been developed." (R. A. Bindschadler, "SeaRise: A
multidisciplinary research initiative to predict rapid changes in
global sea level caused by collapse of marine ice sheets,"
Results of a workshop held in College Park, Maryland, January
23-25, NASA 1990).<P>

FUNCTION.<P>

Carbon dioxide is transported to the deep ocean by downwelling
currents and may be retained in the depths for centuries.  An
important area of downwelling is in the Greenland Sea where
northward moving warm and relatively saline water from the Gulf
Stream sinks and cools. Scientists suggest that during the past
decade, "the formation of North Atlantic deep water in the
Greenland Sea apparently stopped."  (P. Schosser, et. al.
Reduction of Deepwater Formation in the Greenland Sea during the
1980's: Evidence from tracer Data,"  Science, v. 251, p.
1054-1056). <P>

This shutdown would become a major positive feedback not
currently included in the General Circulation Models, if it
causes the ocean to cease serving as a carbon dioxide sink.

<H3><B>WARMING TO BLAME FOR DRAMATIC INCREASE IN CANADIAN FOREST
FIRES. </B></H3> <P>

More than 11,000 fires have burned through 6.4 million hectares
since 1989. Canadian Forest Fire expert, Brian Stocks, warns that
"with the projected trend towards gradually warmer temperatures,
and the influence this would have on fuel moisture, water levels,
and fire season length, the impact on the forest fire business in
Canada would be dramatic.  With resources stretched to the limit
at this time, and with successful fire management activities
usually resulting in further budget restraints, it is certain
that increased fire weather severity will exacerbate the forest
fire problem dramatically. <P>

The increase in area burned will not be proportional to the
increase in fire weather severity, as there is often a fine line
separating manageable and unmanageable fire situations, with the
result that a disproportionate number of fires will escape
initial attack  in the future, assuming current resource levels
are  maintained. Aside from gradual warming, GCMs also indicate
an increase in the occurrence of extreme events, such as extended
droughts, and any disturbance that interrupts regular
precipitation patterns means major forest fire problems." <P>

Canada," in Geoffrey Wall (ed.), "Symposium on the Impacts  of
Climatic Change and Variability on the Great Plains," Department
of Geography, University of Waterloo, Occasional  Paper No. 12,

<P>

Negative salinity and increases in sea ice were observed in the
1960s around Greenland, and were preceded by larger than average
runoffs from North America into the western Arctic. It would seem
that all the fresh water running into the sea reduced the
saltiness of the water, and caused more sea ice (freshwater
freezes at 0 oC and seawater, because of the salt in it, freezes
at around -1.9oC).  The extra sea ice then drifted into the
Greenland Sea three or four years later.  When it melted, this
ice would have contributed to the production of a large layer of
cool, relatively fresh surface water in the Greenland Sea.  This
seems, among other things, to have reduced cyclonic activity and
rainfall over northern Canada.  This sequence of results
comprises a "negative feedback loop" which suggests that self-
sustained climate changes in the Arctic over periods of 15_20
years can and do occur. <P>

<H3><B>INCREASE IN FRESHWATER RUNOFF TO THE SEA FROM THE ICELAND
ICE CAP. </B></H3> <P>

A model is used to see what will happen, under various different
climate changes, to the ice cap in central Iceland, taking into
account the effects of greenhouse warming. The model suggests
that the "response time" of the glacier will be somewhere in the
order of 50 to 100 years (i.e. the time that it will take for the
glacier to react to a change in climate). Increased melting will
be significant for 100 to 200 years after the climate begins to
change.  A warming of 1_1.5 oC over the next 50 years will lead
to a runoff after 50 years equivalent to about half of the total
amount of rain falling on the ice cap, and about a quarter of the
present discharge of rivers. <P>

Records show that throughout China, warmer temperatures have
always been accompanied by higher rainfall. Ice core records show
that temperature fluctuations have been basically identical
throughout China since 1600 AD, with a slight phase difference
between east and west. Rainfall fluctuations are practically
identical.  The main features of these climate patterns through
time is that temperature decrease is accompanied by low rainfall,
while temperature increase is accompanied by high rainfall. 
Therefore, the rise in temperatures due to the greenhouse effect
may be accompanied by increased rainfall. <P>

<H3><B>SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD WILL BE
LARGE SCALE. </B></H3> <P>

A UNEP study of Brazil, Indonesia/Malaysia/Thailand, and Vietnam,
carried out by Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit,
shows that the developing world can expect a range of substantial
problems. A more detailed version of the
Indonesia/Malaysia/Thailand report, published in February 1992,
will be summarized there. Important impacts anticipated in the
other countries are as follows:<P>
<B> Brazil:</B> The current pattern of drought being a particular
problem in the northeast, and flooding a particular problem in
the south and southeast, is likely to be exacerbated. The
north-east is 60% semi-arid, and largely over-populated and
underdeveloped. 
Experience with the drought of 1979 through 1983 suggests that
"if more frequent extreme droughts were to occur as a result of
long-term changes of climate, the impact on the rural poor would
probably be greatly increased." In the south, floods have already
caused serious damage in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In Rio
during February 1988, the equivalent of three months normal
rainfall fell in 24 hours. About 300 were killed, and thousands
made homeless. The total estimated economic losses were US$1
billion.<P>

<B>Vietnam:</B> In this country, inter-annual climatic
variability -
seemingly in large measure related to the El Nino - Southern
Oscillation phenomenon -  is already a problem. In ENSO years,
for example, the number of storms is about 20 percent less than
in non-ENSO years, but when storms do occur they seem to be
stronger. A 30 year temperature record shows a trend of
increasing rainfall in the north and a decrease in the south,
with a tendency for warmer temperatures in the south, especially
in summer. With GCMs suggesting a 0.5 to 1.5 C increase in
average temperatures in Vietnam at the time of carbon dioxide
doubling, "increases in the incidence of drought, particularly in
the south of the country, would be the major adverse effect." The
region of greatest sensitivity to current climatic variability at
present is the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam, because of
its substantial inter-annual variations in rainfall. "However,
the projected decreases in available moisture, particularly in
the southern part of the country, may have the greatest effect on
the Mekong River Delta. Both of these regions are major centres
of agricultural output and any substantial reductions in their
agricultural potential could have consequences at a national
scale." <P>

Economic Effects of Climate Change, A summary of three regional
assessments," Nairobi, United Nations Environment Programme,

<H3><B>ALPINE GLACIERS MELTING FASTER TODAY THAN THEY DID AT THE

Haeberli presents a simple way of measuring glacial changes.  He
takes two periods where glaciers are known to have retreated _ in
the later stages of the last Ice Age (20,000 to 10,000 years
ago), and in the twentieth century.  Both periods show an
increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.  However, the twentieth
century melting shows that, since the middle of the last century,
ice has been melting faster than it did towards the end of the
last ice age.  Also, the rate of glaciers melting, compared to
the increase in temperature, is probably much higher now than it
was in the last Ice Age. <P>

The Sierras provide much of the water for Los Angeles and all its
satellite cities (about nine million people), and so, with five
years of drought, how water storage might be affected by global
change is important to a large group of people.  The authors use
an energy- based model to look at snow-melt run-off processes,
and assess what might happen if global warming occurs.  They find
that the "snow season" will end between 19 and 63 days earlier at
an elevation of 2800 meters. <P>

Air temperatures going back to 1945 for the Southern Ocean and
1956 for the Antarctic, with information about the extent of sea
ice cover going back to 1973, show a lot of variation, both
between and within areas and over time.  However, the data do
suggest a small but significant increase in temperature, and a
small but significant decrease in sea ice cover. This would
suggest that global warming is occurring. <P>

<H3><B>SOME AUSTRALIAN LOSS RATIOS ARE "BORDERING ON THE
UNINSURABLE. </B></H3> "<P>

The chief executive of FAI writes in the company's annual report
that "the loss ratios in some geographic locations in Australia
are bordering on the uninsurable." Other major Australian general
insurers' annual reports also show the key role of climatic
catastrophes in the poor recent profitability of the insurance
industry. <P>

Grahame Bond, chief executive of the Insurance Council of
Australia, claimed that "the impact of an unprecedented spate of
natural disasters" along with other factors had a severe impact
on the industry in 1989/90. National Commercial Union's managing
director Philip Clairs cited "catastrophic losses from natural 
causes" as a major factor impacting on his company's performance
and the performance of the industry as a whole in their 1991
Annual  Report. <P>

Colonial Mutual mirrored this point of view. Mr Rodney Adler,
FAI's chief executive, stated in their 1991 Annual Report that
one of the four main reasons for his company's Aus$191 million
underwriting loss was "the continuing impact of natural disasters
which not only included the Newcastle earthquake and the Sydney
hailstorms, but the more recent storms in Sydney's upper north
shore, Adelaide and Brisbane." According to National Commercial
Union, the storms that hit Sydney's upper north shore "caused
damage resulting in insurance industry losses of Aus$175
million."<P>

Professor Orman Granger. a University of California geographer,
writes that "loss of beaches and beach resort areas will decimate
the economically vital tourist industry." By 2030, Granger points
out, "the likelihood is that the Earth will be warmer than at any
time in the past 120,000 years." <P>

He concludes that such higher temperatures will increase the
intensity of hurricanes and storm surge heights.  Thereupon, "if
hurricane intensity were to increase, only two storms could
threaten the viability of some communities." Granger notes that
Hurricane David in 1979 destroyed 80% of Dominica's housing and
90% of its banana crop. Every year, some part of the Greater
Caribbean is devastated by hurricane damage. Relevant annual
averages for hurricanes are: 1871 to 1980, 4.9; 1910 to 1930,
3.5; 1944 to 1960, 6.0. Since then, "frequency has decreased, but
intensity and magnitude have increased significantly, with
hurricanes David, Frederic, Allen, Gilbert and Hugo being among
the most severe this century."<P>

"...Between 1951 and 1989, there were six hurricanes of Category
5, and eight of Category 4, for an average of 2 hurricanes per
year in the Caribbean region capable of causing death and
devastation. Such a frequency over-taxes the resources of island
nations or nation groups." <P>

Caribbean," The Environmental Professional, v. 13, p. 43-58,

<H3><B>MANY OF BRITAIN'S PLANTS ARE AT RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE.
</B></H3><P>

A University of Sheffield report concludes that 53 species of
plants are endangered: six species of spring flowers may be
ousted by other plants that are thriving in the warmer weather;
ten species that like damp habitats are dying out because of
drought; five mountain species are at risk from increased sheep
grazing; 33 species are finding the weather too hot (some of them
protected species); and five species are threatened by sea level
rise. Some common plants may become more common.  Much of this is
because intensive agriculture and building has reduced the
habitats of most plants, bringing many to the edge of extinction.
The report continues to note that vast tracts of traditional
woodland, bog and meadow have been lost in the last 150 years, so
that many plants are forced into little "islands" in between the
areas that have been cultivated or built on. <P>

Warmer temperatures will affect the breeding cycles of some
plants. Bluebells, for example, establish cells in the summer and
autumn in preparation for growth the next year.  They get a head
start because they can start growing earlier than other plants.
However, if temperatures in the winter increase, then many plants
will begin to grow at the same time, and the "competitive
advantage" that bluebells gain by starting to grow early will be
lost.  Many vigorous "weeds" will proliferate in the warmer
weather, and many will start to appear earlier or later in the
year (Dandelions, that are usually out by late April, have been
flowering in February and August recently).  Most plants, though,
are not resistant to prolonged drought, which has been affecting
plants in the south of England (like the Welsh poppy).  <P>

Britain still has many plants that can be classified as "arctic-
alpine," but these will continue to decline (like tufted
saxifrage and the Snowdon lily) if there is sustained warming. 
If sea levels rise, many plants (like sea heather) will be
squashed in an ever dwindling space between sea walls and the
rising tide, while increasingly violent storms threaten to damage
fragile sand dunes (and the plants such as dune helleborine that
live on the dunes). Lovage likes the mean temperature in July to
be less than 15oC, and has been driven slowly further north over
the last few decades in search of cooler weather. <P>

bluebells? Global warming and British plants,"  London: Natural
History Museum, 1991).<P>

<H3><B>NEW ZEALAND HAS WARMED BY 0.5 oC SINCE 1950. </B></H3><P>

According to Dr Jim Salinger, of the N.Z. Bureau of Meteorology,
1971 was the warmest year on record, while 1985, 1988, 1989 and
1990 were well above average. This warming has caused a massive
retreat in all New Zealand's glaciers and little snow for the
lower altitude ski resorts. The Franz Josef glacier has retreated
by more than one kilometre. Rainfall patterns have also changed;
much of the North Island has become wetter while western South
Island has become dryer. <P>

<H3><B>TYPHOON MIREILLE, THE EIGHTH BILLION-DOLLAR WINDSTORM IN
FOUR YEARS, HITS JAPAN. </B></H3> <P>

Insured losses reach $4.8 billion. On 27 September 1991, Mireille
becomes the sixth strongest in the Japan Meteorological Agency's
records. No typhoon as strong had hit Japan for 30 years. It
damages 1.6 % of all Japanese households, draining $2.21 billion
from the Japanese insurance industry's property-catastrophe
reserve system (leaving just $1.86 at the end of fiscal 1991).
The storm skirts the western edge of the Japanese archipelago,
and in that respect - like Hurricane Andrew less than a year
later - could easily have been much, much worse.<P>

There are two interesting things about the cyclone,
meteorologically. While crossing the Philippine Sea, it is forced
to move to the northwest around a strong area of high pressure
east of Japan, so that it swings to the east, as such windstorms
are prone to do in that region, further north than usual. Second,
it does not lose strength once it makes landfall in southwest
Japan, and this is probably due to the fact that the eastern
China Sea is fully a degree C warmer than it normally should be
for the time of year. <P>

Japan had already suffered earlier in September from typhoon Ivy,
which caused more than 200 landslides and the death of three
people, and one week later on September 14, Kinna killed nine and
destroyed 150 homes. Five days later, Typhoon Luke, dumped
torrents of rain, killing at least five and inundating more than
6,400 homes. <P>

("Earthweek: Diary of the Planet", The Toronto Star, 14 September
1991; "Earthweek: Diary of the Planet", The Toronto Star, 21
September 1991)<P>

NOTES: After an extensive study of Mireille and other typhoons by
his technical experts, Executive Vice President of Tokio Marine
and Fire, Mr Shiro Horichi, would tell the International
Insurance Society  in Tokyo on July 13th 1993 that he believed it
was possible to say that the particular characteristics of the
storm were the product of global warming (see July 1993).<P>

<H3><B>AUSTRALIAN METEOROLOGIST WARNS OF AUSTRALIA'S HOTTEST EVER
</B></H3>
DECADE.<P>

Don White thinks that the El Nino and global warming will act in
concert. "There's a lot of evidence that it's getting worse and
temperatures are increasing. Six of the past ten years have been
the hottest in the past 100 years," he says . According to the
Bureau of Meteorology, the (Australian) summer of  1990/91 was
the hottest on record,  with an average maximum temperature
topping 28ÉC. <P>

("Australia suffers El Nino's curse: a hot dry decade," The Sun
Herald, 15 September 1991).<P>

NOTES: The hot temperatures of the Australian summer are part of
an overall warming trend this century. According to Dr P . A.
Jones, (at Macquarie University at that time, now at Sydney
University) there are a number of interesting trends in the
Australian data. "Cloud cover records have shown that cloud cover
over Australia has significantly increased by 5% since 1910.<P>

There is also a small overall increase in rainfall but this is
not considered significant. Temperature records show a
significant increase in minimum temperature of 0.12 C/decade and
an increase for maximum of 0.06 C/decade; mean temperature
increased by 0.08 C/decade. The overall trend in mean temperature
is similar to that obtained for southern hemisphere land areas an
increase of 0.052 C/decade.  ...Jones et al (1990) find a warming
over the period 1930-1988 of around 0.6 C for eastern
Australia....The southern hemisphere sea surface temperatures
also show an increase, suggesting that the temperature changes
are widespread and not a local effect. Worldwide marine
temperatures show an increase since 1900, but the long-term trend
is not a monotonic increase as the data show a fall in marine
temperatures over the latter half of the 19th century." (P.A.
Jones, "Historical records of cloud cover and climate for
Australia," Australian Meteorological Magazine, v.39,  p.181-189,
September 1991).<P>

<H3><B>PREPARE FOR AN INCREASE IN DEADLY INSECT-BORNE EPIDEMICS
IN THE USA, TOP MEDICS SAY. </B></H3> <P>

Aedes albopictus or the Asian Tiger mosquito, carrier of dengue
fever, is thought to have arrived in the US at Houston via a
shipment of Japanese tyres in 1985. Since then, apparently aided
by mild weather conditions, it has spread to Chicago, Baltimore
and St Louis. A recent WHO report stated that "It should be clear
that climate change will affect the distribution and prevalence
of vector-borne diseases dramatically, and that these changes
cannot be ignored." <P>

American medical entomologist and Asian Tiger mosquito expert,
George Craig agrees, reporting that in a global warming world
"tropical diseases are going to move northward, there's no doubt
about it."<P>

Craig says that the mosquito has already moved well out of the
hot zone and is currently limited by temperature. "With the
vector well established, all that might be necessary is for
enough people to import the disease itself from places like
Pueuto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Jamaica to set the epidemic
wheels in motion.  And with the immigrant population swelling,
the wheels are already greased". <P>

USA may also be prone to another mosquito-transmitted tropical
disease - encephalitis, or sleeping sickness.  In the past winter
there was an outbreak of encephalitis in Florida, with 280
confirmed cases statewide. According to University of Florida
entomologist, Jonathon Day, the outbreak was connected to an
unusually light rainfall during the winter dry season, providing
plenty of puddle breeding grounds. <P>

Enrique Bucher from Argentina's University of Cordoba Centre for
Applied Zoology warns of other diseases, such as leishmaniasis
and Chagoas disease, spreading northward into America in
conjunction with warming air temperatures. "Generally speaking,
increased temperatures would raise the reproductive rates of
disease vectors, adding to vector-control difficulties. As a
consequence, the shorter generation times for these vectors could
favour the emergence of strains resistant to pesticides".
Leishmaniasis can cause horrendous facial disfigurations; there
is no vaccine and treatment is prolonged and painful. There is no
vaccine or cure for Chagas Disease, caused by a parasite which
invades and debilitates the muscles, including the heart
muscle.<P>

Bucher also warns of the possibility of the spread of
elephantiasis, the world's fastest spreading disease, currently
affecting 400 million people worldwide.  In a global warming
world the mosquito vector would spread into new regions AND
reproduce more quickly. <P>

An increase in skin diseases might also be expected, according to
David Taplin, professor at Department of dermatology at the
University of Miami School of Medicine. And Cornell University's
Thomas Eisner warns "It is folly for anyone to tell you that we
can cope with spreading insect populations. I'm anxious about
that kind of technological optimism.  We tried to wipe out
malaria, and what have we got?  DDT-resistant insects, drug-
resistant plasmodium and a vaccine that's not working." <P>

the Killer Mosquitoes," Los Angeles Times, 15 September 1991.)<P>

CHANGE.<P>

Disease patterns are changing with human activities - especially
where they involve humans moving into areas where diseases can
spread (like the jungle of South America, which is ideal for the
malaria-carrying mosquito to breed).  If climate change
continues, different areas of the earth will become available to
disease-carrying insects - they will move north into parts of
North America and Europe.  Since the insects are already building
up resistance to many drugs and pesticides, we could face a new
epidemic unless we move to eliminate (or at least control)
malaria in stricken countries now. <P>

(E. Lisberg, "The world malaria situation," World Health, v.  2,
p. 6, September-October 1991).<P>

NOTES: 110 million cases of malaria occur in the world every
year.  More than 90 million cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa
alone. WHO estimates that between one and two million people die
of malaria every year, mostly children under five. Malaria is
therefore one of the most serious and most widespread of human
diseases in the world today. WHO's statistics say that 1,400
million people live in areas that are free from malaria, and
another 1,600 people live in regions where malaria has been
eradicated by anti-malaria campaigns.  <P>

However, 2,000 million people live in 100 countries where there
is a very real risk of getting the disease.  Of these, 500
million people, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, live in areas where
the risk of getting malaria are very high, and where there are
virtually no anti- malarial campaigns at all.  <P>

In Asia and Latin America, expansion of human activities into
bits of the jungle that were previously unoccupied has led to an
increase in malaria, especially where there has been illegal
smuggling and trading across borders.  All this is even more
complicated by the fact that the malaria- carrying mosquito has
become immune to some anti-malarial drugs and insecticides.<P>

<H3><B>REVIEW OF WATER RESOURCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE POINTS TO
NEED FOR ACTION. </B></H3> <P>

Reviewing the evidence available from climate models on the
question of water availability, American scientist Peter Gleick
points to the possibility of mid-latitude summer soil moisture
loss and reduced runoff "in many regions of the world." The
consistency of such indications "must be considered a first
warning of possible important changes in regional water
availability." A conclusion is that "the long construction times
and subsequent lifetimes of reservoirs, dams and water transfer
facilities mean that planning should begin today for changes that
may not become evident for years." <P>

"American Re's general manager for Australia and New Zealand, Mr
Tony Richardson, echoes the views expressed overseas by the likes
of Lloyd's of London's deputy chairman, Dick Hazell, that there
is no reason to expect the recent spate of disasters was just bad
luck or a statistical oddity. The long-term impact of global
warming on the world's weather patterns and the high incidence of
disasters due to man-made constructions or industry pollution may
both ensure that a significant number of of large-scale
catastrophes occur somewhere around the world each year."
Australian Financial Review, 26 August 1992.<P>

The company's Australasian general manager tells the Australian
Financial Review that global warming may give rise to a
significant increase in insurance losses. The last decade has
seen a string of  natural disasters, both in Australia and
overseas, which have left - according to the managing director of
the Mercantile Mutual Group - "a trail of damaged companies,
failed managers, spoilt insureds, and angry shareholders."
("Natural disasters take heavy toll of industry," and
"Catastrophe cover likely to become harder to get," Australian
Financial Review, 26 August 1992).<P>

<H3><B>HURRICANE BOB JUST MISSES MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR STATUS.
</B></H3><P>

The first hurricane to make landfall in the northeast US since
1985, Bob kills 18 people and causes damage exceeding US$1.5
billion. ( Lixion Avila and Richard Pasch, "Atlantic Hurricanes:
Bob Hogs the Headlines," National Hurricane Centre, USA.
Weatherwise, v.45, p.34-41. February/March 1992). <P>

With winds gusting at more than 100 mph, the storm "seemed to
reserve some of its fiercest fury for the playgrounds of the rich
and famous," hitting the Hamptons, beaching scores of yachts on
Shelter Island, moving up through Martha's Vineyard before
blacking out Cape Cod. ("Bob," The Economist, 24 August 1991).
Nonetheless, it did not turn out to be the Category 4 or 5
hurricane on Long Island or Manhattan, the disaster scenario that
growing numbers in the insurance industry fear.<P>

NOTES: "We truly dodged a bullet there." So said Dallas Luby,
Executive Vice President of General Reinsurance, at a seminar on
climate change and the insurance industry in New York in 1993
(see September 1993). "The 1938 storm in New England was the
granddaddy of all storms, the one that worries us. Bob looked
like it for a while." During the 1938 storm, half of New England
had been under water. But at the time, there was little
development on the island. If that storm was repeated today, Luby
said, the insurance payout would be $60-100 billion. Bob's most
powerful stage was out at sea.<P>

Dr Andrew Dlugolecki, Chief Manager for Operations at General
Accident, warns that there is no time to wait for proof that the
enhanced greenhouse effect is causing more storms and droughts.
Business Insurance, describing his lecture at a Risk Management
Forum in Monte Carlo, writes that the recent "huge increase in
weather-related losses should be attributed to lasting changes in
weather patterns and not to a run of bad luck." Dlugolecki points
out that just a small increase in the violence of an event "leads
to an enormous increase in its impact." <P>

Insurance, 28 October 1991).<P>

<H3><B>NINTH BILLION-DOLLAR CATASTROPHE IN FOUR YEARS.
</B></H3><P>

In the fifth year of the Californian drought, a major bushfire
sweeps through the Oakland Hills. The insurance price tag exceeds
$1.7 billion, and the economic losses are around twice that. It
is the third biggest fire in US history, and hits a type of mixed
forest-and- home development, with a high proportion of
combustible shrub, which makes the fire spread as though in a
forest while causing the same damage as though in a city. <P>

Swiss Re sends a team of investigators to the site within three
days. Their conclusions:<P>

"This fire may well prove to be a harbinger of a new type of
catastrophe that could reoccur on an even larger scale in the US,
Japan, Western Europe or in any other economically advanced
industrialised nations. ...The issue at stake is best illustrated
with the term coined by the American fire fighters at the
occasion of the East Bay hills fire. They called it 'the fire of
the future'." <P>

Could the drought have had anything to do with the fire? That
goes without saying. But could global warming have had anything
to do with it? The Swiss Re conclude that it might.<P>

(Swiss Re, "The fire of the future," Swiss Re special publication
1991).<P>

"We ...cannot entirely rule out the possibility that  the East
Bay hills fire was at least encouraged by these global rises in
temperature, even though there is no concrete indication of this
development to date." Swiss Re<P>

<H3><B>THE ECONOMIST QUESTIONS WHETHER LLOYD'S OF LONDON CAN
SURVIVE. </B></H3> <P>

"Haunted by catastrophes past, Lloyd's of London faces a bleak
future. Some wonder whether, in any recognisable form, by 2000 it
will even be there." But "Lloyd's is synonymous with British
insurance. An enfeebled Lloyd's would harm the City of London's
international standing." ("Leaking at the seams," The Economist,
26 January 1991). <P>

The article omits to mention that many of the "catastrophes past"
are climate-related. From 1966 until October 1987 there had been
no natural catastrophes costing a billion 1992 US dollars,
anywhere in the world. This had had the effect of attracting
capital and competition, and reducing reinsurance prices.
Investors queued up to join the Lloyd's market, which saw a
proliferation of syndicates and agents. <P>

From the late 1970s onwards capital flowed ever faster into
Lloyd's, running at around $2 billion in 1978, more than $10
billion by 1987, and peaking at $17.87 billion in 1991. This
generated from 1986 onwards sizeable overcapacity - too much
money chasing too little business. In 1986, profits exceeded
$1,000 million. In 1987, they were around $700 million. Then the
losses began, with the high storm catastrophe payouts compounded
by rocketing asbestosis and pollution losses in the USA, and with
balance sheets weakened by junk-bond holdings, low interest
rates, and generally weak stock markets. In 1988 the losses
exceeded $1,000 million. (Note that Lloyd's operates a three-year
delay in its accounting system to wait for all claims to be dealt
with). In 1989 they ran to $3.3 billion. Half this was borne by
less than half-a-dozen syndicates, and 37% by just two. The
losses devastated the market. In 1987, there were 30,000 "Names"
(investors in Lloyd's) and more than 400 syndicates. By 1991
there were 22,000 Names and 278 syndicates. <P>

("The Spiral in Context," Lloyd's of London briefing paper, 1992;
J. K. Leggett, Climate Change and the Insurance Industry, A
Greenpeace International Special Report, February 1993, and
references therein).<P>

NOTES: The worldwide insurance market today is worth some $1,400
billion per year. ("Burned by warming," Time, 14 March 1994).
Just over 1% of that is taken by Lloyd's, but 30% of world
property-casualty business flows through the market. Worldwide
non-life insurance premiums run at around $600, having grown from
around $100 billion in 1973 and around $300 billion in 1984 (i.e.
they have doubled in size in less than a decade). The reinsurance
industry today has income from worldwide non-life premiums of
under $100 billion per year, having throughout the '60s, '70s and
'80s been fairly consistently about 15% of direct insurance
premiums. (J. K. Leggett, Climate Change and the Insurance
Industry, A Greenpeace International Special Report, February
1993, and references therein).<P>

<H3><B>RECORD WET IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA SPREADS DISEASE.
</B></H3><P>

Top health official warns that first climate change health
impacts might be appearing. According to the Bureau of
Meteorology, Darwin's  wet season over  1990-91 is the wettest on
record.  By mid January more than  50,000 square kilometres of
country in far north Queensland is flooded.  Infrastructural
damage is estimated at Aus$2 million. The record wet also leads
to an unprecedented outbreak of the rare water-borne disease,
melioidosis. In the past thirty years only 90 cases have been
documented; during the 1991 wet season 33 cases and 12 deaths are
recorded. The melodises outbreak is compounded by other weather-
related outbreaks of Ross River Fever and diarrhoea. The
chairperson of Australia's National Health and Medical Research
Council's public health committee, Dr Tony Adams, suggests that
this may be the first sign of climate change impacting the health
of northern Australian communities. <P>

A University of Maryland scientist, Dr Alan Teramura, conducts
the first experiments in which rice is grown under conditions
likely in the middle of the next century, with elevated
ultraviolet radiation levels and higher carbon dioxide
concentrations. With carbon dioxide alone increased, the biomass
of the rice increased by up to 50 percent. But with high levels
of UV-B, the increase in yield was obliterated. Teramura also
notes from the work of others, that temperatures near 40 C can
seriously retard the growth of rice, wheat and corn. Half the
world's population obtains 70 percent of their calories from
rice. Note also that rice paddies emit methane, a potent
greenhouse gas.<P>

<H3><B>RECORD FLOODING IN QUEENSLAND IN THE WAKE OF CYCLONE JOY.
</B></H3><P>

Hundreds of families are evacuated from far north Queensland
towns. Joy sits within 150km of the coast off the city of Cairns
for the three days before finally diminishing. Its aftermath
brings flooding to 50,000 sq km. Flooding in Rockhampton peaks at
9.4 metres, the worst in 90 years. The damage bill is estimated
at Aus$100 million. ("Queenslanders flee flooded cities," Sydney
Morning Herald, 4 January 1991; "1,000 flee floods, worse to
come," Sydney Morning Herald, 5 January 1991).<P>

If Joy had crossed the cost at full strength (that is, as a
Category Four) damage might well have exceeded Aus$ 1 billion.

<H3><B>AUSTRALIAN EARTH SCIENTIST WARNS INSURERS. </B></H3><P>

Writing in the Australian Insurance Institute's journal,
Professor Russell Blong of Macquarie University's Natural Hazards
Research Group concludes that "climate change holds profound
implications for the insurance industry." Blong shows that the
insurance industry in Australia faces a special challenge. The
database on which its predictions and risk assessment are made is
limited in its scope, deficient in its categorisation and has a
relatively short history. The Insurance Council of Australia's
records only began in 1967. The Bureau of Meteorology documents
frequency and magnitude of climatic events but only the ICA's
database records property damage. This lack of historical
perspective and the uncertainty presented by human-induced
climate change will be the central challenge for the industry in
the future. <P>

(R.J. Blong, "Natural disasters II: An Australian view," AII
Journal, July 1991).<P>

NOTES: Australia is prone to costly natural disasters. In order
of importance to the insurance industry, in terms of total
payout, are cyclones, hailstorms, earthquakes, floods, storms,
bushfires and tornadoes. <P>

The Insurance Council of Australia has been keeping records of
all natural disasters causing more than A$1 million damage since
1967. Cyclone damage (in Aus$1991) ran to a maximum of Aus$689
(Cyclone "Tracy" of 1974), and the 46 events in the period
1967-1990 averaged Aus$33.5 million. Damage resulting from
hailstorms ran to Aus$369 (the March 1990 Sydney hailstorm) and
the 17 events between 1967-1990 averaged Aus$62.9 million. Floods
ran to Aus$269 (the Australia Day floods in Brisbane during
1974), and the 38 events between 1967-1990 averaged Aus$21.9
million. Storms ran to Aus$80 million and the 88 events averaged
Aus$7.6 million. Bushfires ran to Aus$267 million (the "Ash
Wednesday" bushfires in Victoria and South Australia in 1983),
and the 22 events averaged Aus$22.6 million. Tornadoes ran to
Aus$8 million and the 7 events averaged Aus$4.9 million. <P>

In terms of total economic cost, however, drought is the most
important of all the potentially greenhouse-related costs to the
Australian economy. The total economic costs of the 1982-83
drought ran to Aus$5-7 billion.  The record for an annual payout
(in 1991 dollars) was Aus$1,180 in 1974, and the second most
costly year was 1989, at about Aus$850 million. Most years the
total insurance payout varies between about Aus$100 miilion and
Aus$300 million, averaging Aus$226 million. About 80 percent of
the total has been related to the various meteorological
phenomena, and 20 percent to earthquakes.<P>

<H3><B>FIRST EXTINCTION OF A REEF-BUILDING CORAL FEARED.

During the 1982-83 El Nino, there were prolonged high sea
temperatures in Panama and elsewhere in the eastern Pacific. Two
of the twelve coral species in  Panamanian waters were eliminated
suddenly in consequence. They have not been seen alive in
Panamanian waters since 1983. One has suffered a range reduction,
the other was thought at the time to be a probable extinction.

building hydrocorals following the 1982-83 El Nino warming
event," Science, v. 253, p. 69-71, 5 July 1991). Note that five
live colonies of the coral were later discovered in Panama's Gulf
of Chiriqui. <P>

<H3><B>OZONE DEPLETION CAN INDIRECTLY BOOST GLOBAL WARMING.
</B></H3><P>

A UNEP study warns that ozone depletion can in principle disrupt
tropospheric chemistry, fostering conditions which allow the
lifetimes of greenhouse gases to extend - a potential positive
feedback to global warming. Ozone depletion can also harm the so-
called "sinks" for carbon dioxide - land plants and phytoplankton
in the surface waters of the sea. The net amplification of
warming by ongoing ozone depletion can in principle be
substantial.<P>

On tropospheric chemistry: The panel concludes that "chemical
reactivity is expected to increase in response to increases in
UV-B." This can lead to an increase in ozone - a greenhouse gas,
of course - in the troposphere: "if stratospheric ozone levels
decrease, the resulting increase in UV-B near the earth's surface
should increase the production of some very reactive radical
molecules, potentially increasing the chemical reactivity of the
troposphere. In rural and urban areas with sufficient NOx
concentrations (above 0.5 ppb v/v), this enhanced reactivity is
calculated to result in greater levels of tropospheric ozone and
other potentially harmful oxidising products."<P>

NOTES: We should be particularly concerned about the net effect
on the hydroxyl radical. Tropospheric ozone has been building up
because of the interaction other pollutants (carbon monoxide,
methane, VOCs) and sunlight. Hydroxyl is the troposphere's vital
cleansing agent, because it oxidises and so gets rid of a host of
gases including the ones which form tropospheric ozone. There are
many uncertainties over what will happen, in a warming world, in
the complex gaseous "soup" of the troposphere. A major fear has
to be that the vital hydroxyl will be impoverished. If it starts
to decrease, the atmospheric lifetimes (and hence global warming
potentials) of methane, tropospheric ozone - and HCFCS and HFCs -
will go up.  The IPCC, in its 1992 report, (see January 1992)
reviews the complex chemistry involved here, but ends up not
hazarding a guess as to the net outcome in terms of capacity to
boost or dampen global warming. Reading their account, however,
shows clearly the scope for unpleasant surprises in this area of
climate science.<P>

On phytoplankton productivity: The panel concludes that "any
reduction of (phytoplankton) populations would decrease the
uptake of carbon dioxide and so augment the greenhouse effect.
Also, phytoplankton production of DMS (dimethyl sulphate), which
acts as a precursor of cloud nucleation, would be reduced, hence
potentially affecting global climate." The biology of
phytoplankton organisms (microscopic but mobile plants) shows
why. "Mobility and orientation mechanisms are impaired by UV-B
radiation. Because most organisms do not possess UV-B receptors,
they cannot avoid deleterious wavelength radiation that
(according to new measurements) penetrates deeper into the water
column than had been previously measured. ...The inability to
adjust their position within the water column causes massive
inhibition of photosynthesis, measured both in field laboratory
studies. Only in a few cases have potential UV-B-inducible
screening pigments been identified." The outcome, the panel
concluded, could in principle be profound. "A hypothetical loss
of 10% of the marine phytoplankton would reduce the oceanic
annual uptake of carbon dioxide by about 5Gt (an amount equal to
the annual emissions of carbon dioxide by fossil fuel
consumption)." <P>

(United Nations Environment Programme,"Environmental effects of
ozone depletion: 1991 update," Panel Report Pursuant to Article 6
of the Montreal Protocol, November 1991).<P>

NOTES: In laboratory studies, increasing UV-B does demonstrable
harm to phytoplankton and land plants, but the effects vary
enormously between species. In the (infinitely more complex) real
world, we have very little experience on which to draw in order
to make calculations.<P>

Domack and colleagues present the first east Antarctic chronology
for the Holocene (last ten thousand years) based on radiocarbon
dates.  The chronology suggests that the expansion of several
glaciers took place in the mid-Holocene in climatic conditions
that were warmer than they are now. The results from the new data
suggest strongly that Antarctica's response to future warming
will be an increase in mass balance. <P>

<H3><B>CONTINUING CHINESE DROUGHT NOW AFFECTS AN EIGHTH OF THE

Now covering one-eighth of the country, the drought has
devastated  the winter grain crop. Over 10 provinces have
received little or no rain over the last three months and in the
worst hit areas, wheat seedlings have either shrivelled of failed
to sprout. A government meteorologist says the drought is  "rare
in terms of the large area being affected". <P>

("Drought affecting harvests in China and Australia", Agence
France Presse, 26 November 1991; "Earthweek: Diary of the

NOTES: Meanwhile, China's recent industrial boom is seriously
stressing water supplies in the country. About 300 of China's 487
cities already face severe water shortages, with an annual
shortfall of 1.2 trillion cubic feet, which is expected to triple
by the end of the century. Chinese authorities are pinning their
hopes on massive diversion projects such as the Three Gorges
project in Sichuan, which will divert a large part of the Yangtse
to the north, and the plan to divert Yangtse water 680 miles from
Yangzhou to Beijing (UPI, 27 January 1992).<P>

Large tracts of rainforest in Southeast Queensland and northern
New South Wales are dying in the worst drought in Australia's
European history. The absence of effective rain for eight months
has so severely dehydrated many species that they may be beyond
recovery according to researcher, Dr Michael Olsen, from the
University of Queensland. Tree species generally fire resistant
are becoming vulnerable to fire damage and weeds such as lantana
are taking hold in the warmer drier conditions.  Fruit eating
birds, reliant on healthy trees, are reported to be declining
dramatically. Other species such as platypus are also starving as
their water habitats dry up. <P>

According to a UNEP report produced by Oxford University, the
first detailed study of the potential impact of climate change on
the region, increased droughts, floods and frosts could affect
agriculture, while sea-level rises could affect fish and prawn
production. Over the next 30 years, rice production in Malaysia
could decrease by more than 20 percent. Inundation of river
deltas such as the Mekong Delta, and some coastal zones could

rainfall could increase production in some areas, while increased
evaporation would offset this to some extent in others, requiring
irrigation. <P>

<H3><B>WORKSHOP SUGGESTS GLOBAL WARMING MAY STRENGTHEN EL NINO.
</B></H3><P>

Sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme and US
National Centre of Atmospheric Research, a workshop brings
together experts from ten countries to discuss the implications
for ENSO under the global warming scenarios of the IPCC. The
following speculations emerge from the meeting:  <P>

1. Will ENSO events continue to occur? Likely. There is little
evidence that ENSO will get stuck in one (or other) extreme (El
Nino or La Nina).   <P>

2. Will ENSO become more intense? Possibly. Model simulations
suggest an intensification of ENSO's tropical impacts, with wet
areas becoming wetter and dry areas becoming drier.  <P>

3. Will ENSO change in frequency? Possibly. Changes in the upper
ocean temperature associated with global warming may effect
ENSO's frequency. 4. Will ENSO change in duration? Less
Likely.<P>

(Report of the Workshop on ENSO and Climate Change, Bangkok 4-7
November 1991, Earth Global Environment Monitoring System, United
Nations Environment Programme/Environment & Societal Impacts
Group National Centre for Atmospheric Research.)<P>

NOTES: The prospect of an intensifying ENSO is particularly
frightening. The super-ENSO of 1982/83 impacted half the world's
population and has been linked, among other things, to
catastrophic droughts in Africa and Australia, major flooding in
eastern South America, and mass mortality among corals in the
Galapagos islands.<P>

Dr Jim Salinger of the National Climate Centre, NZ Meteorological

climate warming has been occurring throughout most of the central
South Pacific in the 1980s and in the New Zealand region of the
South Pacific since the 1940s.  According to Salinger, "the trend
matches the strong warming seen throughout the entire southern
hemisphere since the mid 1970s". The records are from climate
observations sites where there can be no question of an urban
influence. <P>

<H3><B>NORTHERN RETREAT OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS DUE TO GREENHOUSE
WARMING? </B></H3> <P>

A long-term study undertaken by the University of Michigan points
to the retreat of the woodland deer mouse 30 miles northward from
the old forests of northern Michigan in the past 20 to 40 years.
The study has also documented the northward move of ferns (eg the
ebony spleenwort), fish (eg the orange spotted sun fish, fine-
scale dace, and grayling) and mammals such as the red-back vole,
some at a rate of ten miles each year. Other small mammals, trees
and orchid plants, once very common at the southern extremity of
their range, appear to be shrinking into Canada. Dr James A.
Teeri, Director of the Michigan Biological Station, observes that
"It is clear there is enough circumstantial evidence now that
many scientists believe that causes of these range changes
deserve an immediate and intensive investigation to determine
whether it is related to global warming.  The real challenge is
to separate possible global warming causes from other changes in
land use due to human activities." <P>

Prof. John Maunder, Director of the Medical Entomology Centre at
Cambridge University, warns that many more asthma attacks will
result from the sunny periods and scattered showers of the
British summer. "There is no doubt that people are going to be
more ill this autumn and in turn there is going to be more
mortality." Asthma causes 2,000 deaths a year in Britain, and
hundreds of thousands suffer from the condition. Cat fleas and
head lice are also proliferating. <P>

<H3><B>"EXTENSIVE" CORAL BLEACHING IN THAILAND IN RECENT WEEKS.

"...there appears to be no particular climate event like El Nino
that could have caused it (the anomalously warm water), fuelling
the debate over whether global warming is ultimately to blame."
New Scientist<P>

In the past few weeks, New Scientist reports, coral reefs in 
Thailand have become extensively bleached. Reefs in the Andaman 
Sea have lost their colour down to a depth of about eight metres.
Scientists who have studied the reefs for 15 years say that some
bleaching has been observed in this period, but nothing on the
present scale. The waters in the region have been up to 2ÉC
warmer than normal since December. <P>

<H3><B>TWO PERCENT SHRINKAGE OF THE ARCTIC ICE CAP BETWEEN 1978
AND 1987. </B></H3> <P>

So a NASA/US Geological Survey study of satellite data reveals. A
NASA scientist involved in the study, Dr Per Gloerson, concludes
that the Arctic "bears close scrutiny," but that 30 years of
observations would be necessary "before you can say something
about climate trends." ("Arctic Ocean's Glacial Retreat,"
International Herald Tribune, 5 July 1991). <P>

Variations in the extent of sea ice at the poles and areas of
open water enclosed within them (called polynyas) were observed
every two days between 1978 and 1987.  The data show that trends
in the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover are not similar. During
the nine years, there have been significant decreases in ice
extent and open water areas in the Arctic, but no significant
trends in the Antarctic. (P. Gloersen and W.J. Campbell, "Recent
variations in Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice covers,"  Nature, v.
352, p. 33_36,  1991).<P>

1,000 die, 10 million are made homeless, and some 20% of China's
croplands are submerged. Chinese scientists blame the floods on
global warming. Flooding since May has killed around 1,800 people
and affected more than half of China's population of 1.1 billion,
across central, eastern and northern China. Exceptional
rainstorms fall in eastern China throughout June and into July. 
The Yangtse River overflows its banks in many places and
threatens Shanghai and Nanjing.  The floods result in over 1,300
deaths and some 10 million homeless people. At one stage 20
percent of the croplands of China are estimated to be under
water. Rainfall from June to mid-July reaches amounts more than
half the average annual rainfall. The worst floods in 50 years in
east China cause an estimated $800 million damage. Health
authorities express concern at the rapid spread of water-borne
dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis and malaria as two million homeless
people camp in unsanitary roadside camps. More than half the
summer wheat crop in east- central China is destroyed. Chinese
scientists blame the early arrival of the floods on global
warming.<P>

The resulting ejecta are expected to cool global temperatures for

the century. It throws millions of tonnes of dust into the
atmosphere. This, meteorologists predict, will cause a slight

Peter Glynn of the University of Miami, notes that coral
bleaching has been increasingly common in the last decade, often
associated with warming of sea water. "Whether or not the coral
bleaching complexes of the 1980s have been caused by global
warming is a critically important yet currently unresolved
question. However, the evidence of numerous recurrent, large-
scale coral bleaching and mortality events in recent years is
unequivocal." As for the future, Glynn suggests that corals could
not adapt to the rates of warming predicted by the IPCC. "Sea
warming over a period of 50 or less years may cause the
extinction of many coral species. This prediction is based on
observations in Hawaii, which suggest that much longer periods
than a few decades would be necessary for the selection of high
thermal tolerance in long-lived corals." <P>

<H3><B>SOUTHERN OCEAN'S COOLING INFLUENCE ON OCEAN CIRCULATION

Large mammals and other animals near the top of the Antarctic
food chain my be disadvantaged. Along the edges of the ice
sheets, a very deep current moves cold, oxygenated water into the
deep ocean.  This developed as Antarctica shifted into its
present position and shape, and grew a persistent ice sheet about
14 million years ago.  The potential of the Southern Ocean to
ventilate the deep and bottom ocean layers is related to the
occurrence of polynyas that form within the winter sea ice cover.
Global climate changes would be expected to alter the polynya
size and frequency.  Under greenhouse-induced warming, offshore
polynyas may become less common as the ocean layers mix up.  This
would mean that the Southern Ocean's cooling influence on the
deep layers of other oceans would be reduced, resulting in warmer
oceans at depth.  Global warming is also expected to create lower
salinity through slightly cooler surface water.  (Salinity might
decrease if there is increased melting of ice or increased
rainfall (adding more water volume to the sea).  Polynias are
ice-free areas in polar seas where all kinds of marine life
concentrates _ algae and micro-organisms start to proliferate in
the sunlight, small shellfish and other fish eat these, and
bigger marine mammals come to eat the fish.  The whole point of
this is that polynias allow a concentration of marine flora and
fauna, and if there are larger areas of ice-free water, then they
will be more dispersed, which might be a disadvantage to those
species at the larger end of the ecosystem. <P>

<H3><B>HOTTEST DAY OF THE CENTURY AS HEATWAVE HITS MOSCOW.
</B></H3><P>

The Russian capital experiences its hottest June days this
century  on June 28 and 29. The Urals, Volga and eastern Black
Soils regions  are also affected. Crops are dying and forest
fires rage out of control across southeast Ukraine and Kashmir.
The 40 oC temperatures are expected to reduce the spring harvest
by 30 million tonnes. <P>

<H3><B>TASMANIAN TREES GROW FASTER IN RECENT WARM SUMMERS.
</B></H3><P>

Scientists studying growth rings on ancient pine trees in western
Tasmania, Australia, report a strong growth spurt since 1965
which corresponds to the 1 oC increase in average summer
temperatures observed in Tasmania in the last 30 years. The
cooperative study involves scientists from Sydney University, the
Lamont Doherty Laboratory for Climate Research, Australia's
government science organisation CSIRO and the Tasmanian Forestry
Commission, and shows that the last 100 years have been the
hottest in the last 1,000 years. Dr Michael Barbetti, Sydney
University, noted however that further research would be required
before any definitive link between tree growth and increased
uptake of carbon dioxide corresponding to human enhanced global
warming could be made. <P>

organisation's financial and staff reserves. Emergency relief is
currently being provided to drought and famine stricken Sahel,
Sudan and Ethiopia, cyclone victims in Bangladesh and refugees
from wars in Somalia, Liberia, Mozambique, Angola and
Afghanistan. Ethiopia, already famine-ravaged, has had to appeal
for urgent aid to feed one million starving refugees arriving
from Somalia and Sudan. <P>

CHANGE.<P>

According to a researcher from the Climatology Research Group in
Johannesburg, within 30 to 50 years, the summer and winter
temperatures in southern hemisphere Africa may increase by 4ÉC
and rainfall may increase over tropical regions while decreasing
over subtropical regions. Dr Tyson, says: "It seems certain that
conditions in southern Africa will change more in the next 30-50
years than at any time during the recorded history of people on
earth". While concluding that scenarios for regional climate
change over southern Africa are, "exploratory and highly
tentative", Tyson warns that should human-induced climate changes
be "superimposed" on the current pattern of wet and dry years,
"the consequences for the biosphere and for man will be
profound". Drought years bring severe environmental stresses,
deteriorating vegetation, agricultural losses, increased pressure
on water resources, increased economic stresses and social
pressures. Water demand in subtropical southern Africa is already
expected to increase with population growth and economic
development, and coupled with human-induced rainfall reductions,
will make the effects of prolonged dry periods more difficult to
handle. <P>

Present conditions and Possible Future Scenarios", Climatic

<H3><B>GLOBAL WARMING MAY ENHANCE ANTARCTIC OZONE DEPLETION.
</B></H3><P>

Leading Australian Antarctic researcher, Dr Bill Budd, suggests a
feedback link between climate change and Antarctic ozone
depletion. As stratospheric ozone has been lost, upper
atmospheric temperatures have fallen. The decrease in
stratospheric temperatures  over the Antarctic has been
coincident with a general increase in lower atmospheric
temperatures. Budd suggests: "This type of reaction would be
expected to result from reduced stratospheric ozone but it is
also a feature which can result from the CO2 warming in the
troposphere...these changes were strongest in the Antarctic,
pointing to the dominance of the ozone effect, although no doubt
both processes may be acting together and reinforcing each
other." "...the strength of the Antarctic stratospheric vortex
which may be expected to increase and last longer with the
reduction in Antarctic stratospheric temperatures. This could
isolate the region of ozone reduction even more, and possibly
lead to further reduction extending longer into summer...". Budd
also reports that global warming may cause changes in the
circulation of the Southern Ocean leading to global warming
positive feedbacks. When sea ice forms in the austral Autumn and
Winter, salt is rejected from the freezing waters, increasing the
salinity and therefore density of the surface ocean. This cold
and saline water then sinks carrying carbon dioxide and, heat
into the deep ocean. Budd suggest that the loss of sea ice in a
global warming world may reduce this deep mixing by limiting salt
rejection, thus producing a positive feedback, increasing the
rate of carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere and the rate at
which the surface ocean warms. <P>

<H3><B>EL NINO MAKES APPLICATION OF CLIMATE MODELS TO SOUTH
AMERICA DIFFICULT. </B></H3> <P>

Researchers from Argentina, Chile and Brazil undertake a
comparison of GCM results for the South American continent and
discover El Nino and the climatic effects of deforestation make
prediction difficult. Both play an important role in regional
climate throughout South America but are currently not included
in GCM simulations. Having acknowledged the limitations, the
researchers drew up  following scenario: <P>

*   Northern Region (NW-SE line centred at 10 deg S):  A one
degree C increase by 2010, although cooling from
evapotranspiration may maintain surface
temperatures at current levels. Increased convection is expected
to make the region slightly wetter. The southward movement of the
subtropical high pressure system may bring increased rains to the
north coast.  <P>

*     Central Region (from 10 deg S to a line
oriented NW-SW at about 35 degs): An upper estimate of  two
degrees C increase in surface temperature by 2010. Increased
dryness, lower humidity and decreased cloudiness is also
predicted.   <P>

*      Southern Region (southward of 40 deg S):  A
one degree C increase in surface temperature by 2010. The region
is also expected to be wetter. Simulations undertaken for the
year 2050 show that the same trends continue, temperatures
increase and the central region is expected to become drier.

Deforestation in the Amazon will be important in determining
future climate changes in the region. Ongoing deforestation at
current rates will see the entire Brazilian Amazon deforested
within 15 years. The extensive forests across the Amazonia Basin
play a fundamental role in the regional hydrological cycle and
tropical atmospheric circulation.  Existing large scale
deforestation is thought already to have led to a 20 percent
decrease in rainfall over the basin. Regional climate changes
caused by deforestation are expected to be opposite of those
caused by global warming, such as decreasing rainfall in the
north and south and increased rainfall in the centre of the
continent. But deforestation can also be expected to accelerate
the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere.  <P>

The frost was unlike a normal spring cold snap, with temperatures
down to -7 oC. The Loire Valley and the Bordeaux regions are
affected. In Bordeaux alone the loss amounts to some 400 million
bottles. Overall losses are described as "catastrophic" for the
industry, and very serious for France's trade balance.<P>

<H3><B>SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS, TORNADOES AND FLOODS AMID RECORD
HEAT IN US. </B></H3> <P>

Nearly 100 US cities are experiencing record high temperatures.
Officials suggest that the warmer temperatures are producing the
energy for storms. Twenty-seven are killed by tornadoes in
Kansas. The destruction in April follows a storm on March 26 to
28 which caused $210 million in insured losses; the heaviest
damage from winds, hail and flooding was in Illinios, Kansas and
Missouri. <P>

("Earthweek: Diary of the Planet", The Toronto Star, 13 April
1991; "Tornadoes kill 27 in Kansas, Oklahoma", The Reuter Library
Report, 27 April 1991; "Late March U.S. storm causes 210 million
in damage", Reuters, 18 April 1991).<P>

NOTES: The US experiences the most intense and devastating
tornadoes in the world. At any given moment, an average of 2,000
thunderstorms are in progress over the surface of the planet, and
the US suffers an average of 10,000 per year, around 1,000 of
which will spawn tornadoes. With wind speeds of up to 300 mph,
tornadoes are the most violent winds on earth. On March 18, 1925,
eight tornadoes in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee and Alabama killed 689 people. The average annual US
death toll is 50-75.  Approximately 10,000 forest fires are
started each year by lightening, resulting in around $100 million
in annual losses from forest an and building fires. Floods and
flash floods can occur within all US states. Property damage
totals over a billion dollars on average each year. Nearly nine
in every ten presidential disaster declarations results from
natural phenomena in which flooding was a major component.<P>

Sun Alliance, which recently unveiled the first pre-tax loss in
its 200 year history, is among the companies which are in the
process of significantly increasing their rates. "Household
insurance has been a disaster area, with record claims caused by
both hot weather (prompting subsidence) and last year's serious
storms," the Guardian reports.  A Kleinwort-Benson analyst says
that "people have been paying ridiculously cheap prices for
insurance without realizing it." <P>

<H3><B>SUSPICIOUSLY WARM WATER REPORTED IN THE ARCTIC NORTH OF

An international group of scientists report temperatures in the
water column between Svalbard and Severnaya Zemlya almost a
degree warmer than they were at the same depth in 1987. They also
report ice thickness recorded by a Soviet icebreaker which
smashed its way to the North Pole in 1990 as being 20 to 30% less
than normal.  The researchers conclude that this "might simply
reflect that the vessel was taking the route of least
resistance," and that "it is of course not immediately clear
whether the higher subsurface temperatures and the lower ice
thickness already reflect a climate trend or just some normal
interannual variability." However, they conclude that "it seems
clear that there is a need for careful monitoring of heat
fluctuations in the Arctic."  <P>

"Although no proof exists as yet, increasing amounts of
circumstantial evidence indicate that gradual  warming of our
climate is occurring."<P>

So says Munich Re board member Klaus Conrad,  writing in an
industry journal, arguing that global warming is "certain to lead
to weather anomalies, often with catastrophic effect. Uncertainty
over the rate of climatic change could cause problems for the
industry." He concludes that "the imminent change in climate may
well offer reinsurers interesting market opportunities, but the
dangers such a change poses for mankind as a whole make it
imperative that reinsurers, as citizens and business people, make
every effort to slow down the rate of this change." <P>

<H3><B>STORM OF THE CENTURY DEVASTATES THE SAMOAS FOR THE SECOND

Cyclone Val, the second cyclone in 18 months rages for four days.
The first witnesses to see Western Samoa after the airport re-
opens say it looks as though it has been sand blasted. Nine
people are killed by the 240 kph winds that blast through Western
Samoa and American Samoa before heading for the Cook Islands.
Worst hit are the main Island of Savaii and Upolu Island, with
roads, bridges, and buildings destroyed and crops flattened.
Almost 90% of the vegetation on Savaii is reportedly destroyed.
("Cyclone Val devastates Samoa Islands groups," Pacific Report,
12 December 1991). Cyclone Ofa had been the worst cyclone for 20
years in Western Samoa, and caused $200 million in damage. Val
causes a further $300 million. It leaves Samoans without
electricity for five weeks and without water for seven. Food
crops are devastated, and for three months after the event, 80%
of the population depend on emergency food aid. On the two main
islands, substantial damage is inflicted on 90% of buildings on
Savai'i, and 80% on Upolu. As of 1993, whole villages would still
be deserted on the exposed western side of the islands. Few would
be able to afford cyclone insurance any longer. ("Islanders count
the cost of climatic change," Financial Times, 5 January 1994).
An eye-witness account: "It seemed to last forever. Its slow
moving eye passed directly over us. It trashed-impacted villages,
jungle, and plantations, lives and infrastructures and
expectations. The third major hurricane to hit the archipelago in
five years, it brought home to many islanders the current and
impending danger of our local super-heated ocean that births and
feeds such storms. Are they the inevitable offspring of the
greenhouse effect? Or just the children of another, all too
frequent El Nino?" <P>

<H3><B>UP TO 85% OF CORALS BLEACHING IN SOME REEFS IN FRENCH
POLYNESIA. </B></H3> <P>

For several weeks the coral reefs have been subject to warmer
than average waters and have become fluorescent and then white.
The small temperature increases at 0-70 metres depth around
Tahiti (the normal average temperature during this season is
28.4ÉC; today it is 29ÉC) are thought to be responsible.  Local
diver Henri Poulique called it an ecological disaster of the
first order and has blamed global warming. A similar episode
occurred in 1984; seven years later the recent coral growth is
now dying. Bleaching is also occurring on other islands, although
thus far not to the same effect.  (Henri Pouliqueu, "Ecological
Catastrophe in French Polynesia," La Depeche, 22 and 23 April
1991; "Is coral bleaching caused by global warming?" New
Scientist, 17 August 1991).  Director of the Florida Institute of
Oceanography, John Ogden, says that nearly every reef system in
the world is suffering from coral bleaching, along the coasts of
more than 20 countries, including Australia, China, Japan,
Panama, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, India, Indonesia,
Kenya, the Red Sea, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Bahamas and
Okinawa.  <P>

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>GREENPEACE SCHIP GEDWONGEN 
CHINESE WATEREN TE VERLATEN</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>

Amsterdam, 12 juni 1996
<P>
Het schip MV GREENPEACE heeft zich uit Chinese wateren teruggetrokken,
nadat de Chinese kustwacht had aangekondigd het schip uit de
territoriale wateren te verwijderen. Het schip is nu op weg naar
Hongkong om opnieuw een dialoog met China aan te gaan. Greenpeace
heeft niettemin op het schip ten overstaan van ongeveer 70 Chinese
officials haar oproep aan China kunnen overbrengen: Stop onmiddelijk
alle kernproeven en teken het Kernstopverdrag.
<P>
De MV Greenpeace is eerder vandaag de 12-mijlszone binnengevaren en
ankerde in de monding van de Yangtze rivier die toegang geeft tot de
haven van Shanghai. Vier Chinese loodsboten omsingelden het schip,
waarvan twee langszij vastmaakten. De kapitein is te verstaan gegeven
dat het schip zich illegaal binnen de Chinese wateren bevond en dat
het geen toestemming krijgt Shanghai aan te doen. In een ontspannen
sfeer maakten de Chinese officials foto- en video-opnames.
<P>
De vreedzame missie van de MV Greenpeace valt samen met de
onderhandelingen - onder Nederlands voorzitterschap -in Gen&egrave;ve over
het Kernstopverdrag (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty). De betrokken
delegaties moeten het uiterlijk 28 juni eens zijn over de tekst van
het verdrag, wil het verdrag dit jaar nog ondertekend kunnen worden.
<P>
China's standpunt in de onderhandelingen en haar testprogramma staan
een effectief verbod op kernproeven in 1996 in de weg. China kondigde
vorige week aan dat het een kernstopverdrag zou ondertekenen op
voorwaarde dat een verbod op zogenaamde 'vreedzame' kernproeven over
10 jaar kan worden herzien.
<P>
Zaterdag 8 juni voerde China haar 44e kernproef uit. Dit leidde tot
wereldwijde protesten, onder meer van naburige landen als Australi&euml;,
Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongoli&euml; , Nieuw Zeeland, de Filippijnen en
Zuid-Korea. China wil een volgende kernproef doen v&oacute;&oacute;r September.

Amsterdam, 1 juli 1996
<P>

Ruim 50 procent automobilisten bereid zuinige auto te kopen
<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>NIPO-ENQUETE: 
NEDERLANDER BESCHOUWT AUTO 
ALS MILIEUPROBLEEM</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>

Ruim 67 procent van de Nederlandse automobilisten beschouwt de auto
als een milieuprobleem. Dat blijkt uit een opiniepeiling die
NIPO/Emnid in opdracht van Greenpeace heeft gehouden. Greenpeace deed
deze opiniepeiling in de aanloop naar de lancering van de
SmILE-technologie (Small, Intelligent, Light and Efficient), waarmee
auto's 1 op 30 kunnen rijden. In de loop van dit jaar wordt in
Zwitserland een Renault Twingo gelanceerd waarop deze technologie is
toegepast.
<P>
Opmerkelijk is de bereidheid om een zuinige auto aan te schaffen: ruim
50 procent van de automobilisten zegt met zekerheid een zuinige auto
aan te schaffen als zij nu een nieuwe auto zouden kopen. Uitgangspunt
bij deze vraag was dat de veiligheid aan dezelfde normen voldoet als
een andere auto. Ruim 31 procent zegt "zeer waarschijnlijk" tot
aankoop van een zuinige auto over te gaan, en ruim 12 procent antwoord
met "ja, misschien". Zo'n 93 procent is dus in principe bereid om een
zuinige, gesmilede auto aan te schaffen.
<P>
Volgens een peiling van Emnid in Duitsland is bijna 50 procent van de
automobilisten bereid om een zuinige auto aan te schaffen. Ruim 15
procent antwoord met "zeer waarschijnlijk" en ruim 21 procent zegt
"ja, misschien".
<P>
Greenpeace beschouwt deze cijfers als een positieve indicatie. Later
dit jaar wordt een antwoordkaarten-actie gestart, waarmee
automobilisten kunnen aangeven dat zij een zuinige, gesmilede auto
zouden aanschaffen als zij een nieuwe auto zouden kopen. Deze cijfers
zijn vooral belangrijk omdat de auto-industrie blijft volhouden dat de
consument niet ge&iuml;nteresseerd is in zuinige auto's.
<P>
Bijna de helft van de Nederlanders die auto's als een milieuprobleem
zien, noemt luchtvervuiling als grootste probleem (44 procent). Maar
slechts een kleine 6 procent noemt klimaatverandering als probleem.
Klimaatverandering was de voornaamste invalshoek van Greenpeace bij de
ontwikkeling van de SmILE-technologie. Het terugbrengen van het
brandstofverbruik van auto's heeft namelijk een evenredig effect op de
uitstoot van het broeikasgas kooldioxyde (CO2), de voornaamste
veroorzaker van klimaatverandering.
<P>
Ook de gezondheidsrisico's worden onderschat: slechts 5 procent noemt
gezondheidseffecten als probleem.

GREENPEACE VINDT CHINESE 
HOUDING INZAKE 'VREEDZAME 
NUCLEAIRE EXPLOSIES' 
ONAANVAARDBAAR</PRE></B></FONT>
<P>
Greenpeace heeft vandaag het Chinese voorstel om het verbod op
zogenaamde vreedzame nucleaire explosies over 10 jaar mogelijk te
maken, volstrekt onaanvaardbaar genoemd. De milieu-organisatie heeft
de delegaties, die nu onder Nederlands voorzitterschap in G&eacute;n&egrave;ve de
onderhandelingen voeren over een Kernstopverdrag, opgeroepen het
voorstel van China af te wijzen. Iedere speciale behandeling van
vreedzame nucleaire explosies ondermijnt de effectiviteit van het op
handen zijnde Kernstopverdrag.
<P>
China wil tot nu toe niet akkoord gaan met een onvoorwaardelijk en
volledig verbod op alle kernproeven. Greenpeace vindt dat China's
houding het verdrag al verzwakt nog voordat definitieve afspraken zijn
gemaakt. Het voornaamste doel van een verbod op kernproeven is immers
het verhinderen van alle soorten nucleaire explosies voor welk doel
dan ook. Als de deur op een kier blijft - ook na tien jaar - voor
vreedzame nucleaire explosies, kan van een effectief verdrag geen
sprake zijn. Greenpeace roept alle landen op China's voorstel met klem
af te wijzen.
<P>
Greenpeace acht het schadelijk om vreedzame nucleaire explosies als
uitzonderingen te behandelen omdat in de tekst van het ontwerp-verdrag
duidelijk is bepaald dat elk onderwerp in principe bespreekbaar is in
de evaluatie van het verdrag over tien jaar. Speciale aandacht voor
vreedzame nucleaire explosies nu laat de mogelijkheid open dat deze in
de toekomst uitgevoerd kunnen worden. Elke kernproef - vreedzaam of
niet -  kan worden gebruikt om kernwapens verder te ontwikkelen.
<P>
De Nederlandse minister van VROM, de Boer, legt deze week een
officieel bezoek af aan China. Greenpeace heeft de minister voor haar
vertrek verzocht de kwestie van de kernproeven aan de orde te stellen.
Eind deze week wordt minister de Boer in Nederland terug verwacht.

Amsterdam, 30 mei 1996
<P>
<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>Nederland moet import van 
Franse atoomstroom stoppen
Import van Franse atoomstroom 
frustreert duurzame energie</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>
De export van elektriciteit door het Franse staatsbedrijf Electricit&eacute;
de France (EdF) naar Europese landen, waaronder Nederland, is slecht
voor de Franse economie, schadelijk voor het Europese milieu en remt
de ontwikkeling van duurzame energie af. De schade aan het milieu
ontstaat door de aanleg van nieuwe hoogspanningleidingen en de
produktie van meer gevaarlijk kernafval. Dit blijkt uit een vandaag
verschenen studie 'Echanges d'Electricit&eacute; en Europe: le cas de France'
die het Franse onderzoeksbureau INESTENE (Institut d'Evaluation des
Strat&eacute;gies sur l'Energie et l'Environnement en Europe) in opdracht van
Greenpeace heeft uitgevoerd.
<P>
De bouw van 56 kerncentrales heeft in Frankrijk een enorme
overcapaciteit aan produktievermogen opgeleverd. Om al die centrales
draaiende te houden wil EdF op permanente basis steeds meer stroom
gaan exporteren. Frankrijk exporteert op dit moment meer dan 60
TeraWattuur(TWh) naar andere Europese landen. Lange-termijn
exportcontracten, onder meer met Nederland, zijn voor EdF dan ook de
enige rechtvaardiging om nieuwe kerncentrales te bouwen. De
INESTENE-studie heeft echter berekend dat het goedkoper is om de
overbodige kerncentrales in de mottenballen te leggen dan in produktie
te houden. Het niet opstarten van nieuwe kerncentrales zoals die van
Chooz en Civaux levert zelfs nog een groter financieel voordeel op.
 Voor Frankrijk is de export van elektriciteit zwaar verliesgevend: de
 jaarlijkse verliezen worden door INESTENE geschat op minstens 5
 miljard francs. De tarieven die aan buitenlandse afnemers, zoals de
 Nederlandse Sep, worden berekend zijn veel lager dan die de Franse
 industrie en huishoudens moeten betalen. De verkoopprijs van
 uitgevoerde elektriciteit varieerde in de afgelopen vijf jaar van 19
 tot 22.7 centimes per kiloWattuur (cF/kWh), terwijl de kosten van
 atoomstroom op ten minste 27.6 cF/kWh worden berekend.
<P>
Met de EdF heeft de Nederlandse Sep (Samenwerkende
elektriciteits-produktiebedrijven) twee meerjaren-contracten
afgesloten: voor de periode 1997-2002 een stroomimport van 600
Megawatt en voor de jaren 2002-2009 van 750 Megawatt. Greenpeace vindt
dat deze importen moeten stoppen omdat de grote overcapaciteit aan
elektriciteit in Nederland zelf op deze manier in stand blijft. Dit
gaat ten koste van verdere ontwikkeling van duurzame en schonere
elektriciteit zoals windenergie en stroom uit warmte-krachtcentrales
(WKK). Bovendien heeft Nederland met de goedkope stroomimporten wel de
lusten maar niet de lasten: het onopgeloste probleem van nog meer
kernafval, ongevallenrisico's en de kostbare ontmanteling van
kerncentrales komen zo ten laste van de Franse bevolking.

<P>
Amsterdam, 5 februari 1996
<P>

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>GREENPEACE VERWELKOMT CHLOORVRIJ 
BOEKENWEEKGESCHENK</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>
Greenpeace verwelkomt het Boekenweekgeschenk Palmwijn van auteur
Adriaan van Dis, dat is gedrukt op chloorvrij geproduceerd papier.
Mede op verzoek van Greenpeace besloot de Stichting Collectieve
Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek (CPNB) om het Boekenweekgeschenk
en ander toekomstig drukwerk voortaan te vervaardigen op chloorvrij
geproduceerd papier. Bovendien zal de CPNB papier gebruiken dat
afkomstig is uit duurzaam beheerde bossen, zodra dat voorradig is.
<P>
Tijdens de presentatie van het Boekenweekgeschenk vanaf 12.00 uur in
het Nieuwe de la Mar Theater te Amsterdam, roept Ton Tukker (algemeen
directeur Greenpeace Nederland) de Nederlandse uitgeversbranche en de
papierleveranciers op om het voorbeeld van de CPNB te volgen, en
uitsluitend nog chloorvrij geproduceerd papier te gebruiken. Bovendien
vraagt hij de uitgeversbranche, om net als de CPNB, in het colofon te
vermelden dat een boek is gedrukt op chloorvrij geproduceerd papier.
Greenpeace start hiermee een papier-bewustwordingscampagne.
<P>
Vanaf 14.00 uur vanmiddag is Greenpeace ook aanwezig in het
RAI-Congrescentrum te Amsterdam tijdens 'Vers voor de Pers', de
presentatie van boeken die komend voorjaar verschijnen. Greenpeace
informeert hier op ludieke wijze de aanwezige uitgevers en
journalisten. Greenpeace-medewerkers -gehuld in een chloorvrij
boekpak- verspreiden richtlijnen voor milieuvriendelijk papiergebruik.
<P>
Chloorvrij geproduceerd papier is in ruime mate beschikbaar en wordt
al gebruikt in de uitgeversbranche. Toch worden op dit moment nog veel
boeken gedrukt op papier dat niet chloorvrij is. Hoewel de
uitgeversbranche verantwoordelijk is voor slechts een klein deel van
het Nederlandse papierverbruik, kan zij met deze stap een goed
voorbeeld geven aan de overige Nederlandse papiergebruikers.

herhaling van een ramp, zoals tien jaar geleden bij Tsjernobyl, wordt
uitgesloten. Dit blijkt uit het vandaag verschenen RBMK-report 1996, a
critical discussion of the Chernobyl-type reactor, dat het Duitse
bureau Kollert & Donderer in opdracht van Greenpeace heeft opgesteld.
<P>
Uit het rapport blijkt dat tien jaar na de ramp:
-Men er niet in is geslaagd de juiste toedracht van de ramp te
reconstrueren en de exacte mechanismen te achterhalen die tot de
extreme vernietiging hebben geleid; -Westerse technische steun ter
waarde van bijna 2 miljard gulden niet heeft geleid tot daadwerkelijke
aanpassing aan Westerse veiligheidsmaatstaven; -Er nog steeds 15
RBMK-centrales volop in bedrijf zijn (elf in Rusland, twee in de
Oekra&iuml;ne en twee in Litouwen) die in het Westen nooit een
bedrijfsvergunning zouden krijgen.
<P>
Daarnaast geeft het rapport aan dat:
-De effectiviteit van de Westerse hulpprogramma's laag is: het doel
van de G7-top van 1992 (M&uuml;nchen) om kerncentrales die niet in
voldoende mate aan Westerse veiligheidseisen kunnen worden aangepast,
zo spoedig mogelijk te sluiten, is mislukt; -Westerse hulp is mede
ingegeven door eigenbelang: met opdrachten in Oost-Europa de eigen
nucleaire industrie op de been houden omdat juist door Tsjernobyl
bijna alle nucleaire orders in het Westen zijn weggevallen. -Westerse
hulp de organisatiestructuur in het Oosteuropese establishment (bij
voorbeeld het Russische ministerie van Nucleaire Zaken) versterkt, die
verantwoordelijk is voor de uiterst slechte toestand van de
kerncentrales.
<P>

<P>

<P>

Greenpeace concludeert dat juist door de voortdurende financiering van
Westerse steunprogramma's voor Oosteuropese kerncentrales een
herhaling van Tsjernobyl mogelijk is. Deze Westerse subsidies kunnen
effectiever worden besteed. Investeringsprogramma's in de
mogelijkheden voor energie- effici&euml;ntie en schone energiebronnen in
Oost-Europa zijn ecologisch en economisch te verkiezen boven het in
stand houden van kernenergie.
<P>
Greenpeace doet daarom een oproep aan de Westerse regeringen, in het
bijzonder G-7 en EU, om alles in het werk te stellen om RBMK-centrales
onmiddellijk te sluiten.

Amsterdam, 22 mei 1996
<P>
<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>BRENT SPAR RAPPORT TOONT ONGELIJK 
BRITSE EN NOORSE REGERING</FONT></B></PRE>
'Case to case' benadering afgedankte platforms onder vuur
<P>

Greenpeace verwelkomt vandaag het rapport van een internationale groep
wetenschappers, die bij elkaar zijn gebracht door de Britse minister
van Handel en Energie Tim Eggar. Het rapport toont het ongelijk van de
Britse en de Noorse regering om te volharden in hun 'case to case'
benadering van het ontmantelen van afgedankte offshore installaties.
<P>
De wetenschappers verwerpen deze hoeksteen van het Britse beleid: de
'case by case' benadering die ook de Noorse regering hanteert. Zij
raden de Britse regering aan de cumulatieve impacts van alle vormen
van vervuiling van de zee in haar afweging te betrekken.
<P>
De zogenoemde 'Scientific Group on Decommissionning' is in november
1995 opgezet door minister Eggar. De wetenschappers is toen gevraagd
te kijken naar de milieu-effecten van dumpen van de Brent Spar op de
diepzee, nadat de Greenpeace-campagne tegen dumpen van deze
olie-installatie was geslaagd.
<P>
De groep wetenschappers werkte onder auspici&euml;n van het Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC), en stond onder voorzitterschap
van professor John Shepherd van het Southampton Oceanography Centre.
Zij concludeerden onder meer dat:
<P>
&#168;	De Britse regering zou niet iedere installatie puur op een 'case to
case' basis moeten beschouwen. Zij zou ook de cumulatieve impacts van
alle vormen van vervuiling van de zee in haar afweging moeten
betrekken.
<P>
&#168;	In het besluitvormingsproces rondom de Brent Spar hadden vele
aspecten moeten worden meegenomen, zoals de noodzaak om energie en
grondstoffen te besparen door gebruik van minder energie en
grondstoffen, hergebruik en recycling van afval. Ook andere factoren
-zoals het maatschappelijk draagvlak- moeten in de toekomst ook in de
afweging worden meegenomen.
<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
&#168;	De problemen die kunnen voorkomen bij ontmanteling van de Brent Spar
aan land zijn niet gecompliceerder dan de ervaringen die met andere
installaties zijn overwonnen.
<P>
Het rapport toont aan dat de opinie van wetenschappers niet aansluit
bij het beleid van de Britse en Noorse regering. Beide landen moeten
volgens Greenpeace stoppen wetenschappelijk materiaal te gebruiken als
een excuus om de maatschappelijke bezorgdheid om het milieu te
negeren. Zij moeten hun oude offshore installaties aan land brengen,
waarmee bovendien veel werkgelegenheid is gemoeid. In Nederland zijn
op dit moment al twee consortia die offshore installaties aan land
kunnen brengen en kunnen ontmantelen (ROS Holland in de regio IJmuiden
en het consortium 'in wording' in de regio Rotterdam).
<P>
Het Britse rapport geeft steun aan de beslissing van de OSPAR
commissie vorig jaar juni in Brussel, toen deze commissie besloot tot
een moratorium voor het in zee dumpen van afgedankte platforms. De
Britse en de Noorse regering gaven als enigen geen steun aan dit
moratorium. Volgens Greenpeace is het nu verschenen rapport een
duidelijk signaal aan de OSPAR Commissie -die van 17 tot 21 juni in
Oslo bij elkaar komt- om het moratorium zo snel mogelijk in een
permanent verbod om te zetten.

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>KERNPROEF CHINA ONDERMIJNT 
ONDERHANDELINGEN KERNSTOPVERDRAG</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>
Greenpeace veroordeelt de kernproef van China van vandaag sterk. Zij
roept de internationale gemeenschap op bij China te protesteren en te
eisen haar testprogramma te stoppen om de huidige onderhandelingen
over een Kernstopverdrag niet in gevaar te brengen. Vandaag is het
schip MV GREENPEACE vanuit Manilla vertrokken om haar vreedzame missie
naar Shanghai te vervolgen. Met deze missie wil Greenpeace aan China
het wereldwijde verzet tegen kernproeven en kernwapens overbrengen.
Het is de bedoeling dat het schip rond 11 juni in Shanghai zal
aankomen.
<P>
Met deze kernproef brengt China de onderhandelingen over het
Kernstopverdrag in gevaar. Deze onderhandelingen -onder Nederlands
voorzitterschap- bevinden zich nu in een beslisende fase. Eind deze
maand moeten de betrokken delegaties het eens zijn over de
uiteindelijke verdragstekst, wil het verdrag in september ondertekend
kunnen worden. Nadat Frankrijk haar testprogramma in januari dit jaar
voortijdig afbrak, is China nu de enige kernwapenstaat met een een
actief testprogramma. Greenpeace vindt dat de internationale publieke
opinie de Chinese kernproeven even sterk moet veroordelen als de
Franse in het afgelopen jaar.
<P>
De proef werd geregistreerd door de meetstations van de Australische
Geological Survey Organisation in Canberra. Volgens wetenschappers van
deze stations vond de proef vanmorgen om 04.56 uur Nederlandse tijd
plaats in het testgebied bij Lop Nor in het westen van China. De
kracht van de proef wordt geschat op 20 tot 80 kiloton TNT, een
explosie vijf keer zo groot als de bom die in 1945 Hiroshima
verwoestte. China's kernproef van vandaag is de 44ste. Nog meer
kernproeven worden verwacht zolang het Kernstopverdrag niet van kracht
is.   
<P>
De Nederlandse minister van VROM, De Boer, heeft de afgelopen week een
officieel gebracht aan China. Voor haar vertrek heeft Greenpeace de
minister verzocht de kwestie van de kernproeven aan de orde te
stellen. Morgen wordt de minister in Nederland terug verwacht.

Platform Tour op Noordzee in juni
<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>NIEUW GREENPEACE-SCHIP TEGEN 
TOEKOMSTIGE BRENT SPARS</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>

AMSTERDAM, 6 JUNI 1996 - Het nieuwe Greenpeace-schip Arctic Sunrise is
donderdagochtend 6 juni om 11.00 uur gelanceerd tijdens een
persconferentie aan de Oostelijke Handelskade in Amsterdam. Later deze
week vaart het schip uit voor een tour langs Noordzee-platforms die
mogelijk worden gedumpt.
<P>
Tijdens de persconferentie ging Thilo Bode (algemeen directeur van
Greenpeace International) in op de geschiedenis en het doel van het de
Arctic Sunrise, die de afgelopen maanden op de werf is aangepast aan
de wensen van Greenpeace. De Arctic Sunrise is gebouwd voor de
zeehondenjacht in 1975 (Noorwegen) en heeft een historie met
Greenpeace sinds acties tegen het schip in 1984 en 1986.
<P>
De politieke situatie omtrent het dumpen van platforms is toegelicht
door Simon Reddy (campaigner en auteur van 'No Grounds For Dumping').
Van 17 tot 21 juni komt in Oslo de OSPAR Commissie bijeen en wordt het
'Brent Spar probleem' besproken. Greenpeace is waarnemer tijdens de
vergadering en wil dat de OSPAR Commissie haar moratorium op het
dumpen van platforms zo snel mogelijk omzet in een permanent verbod.
Een definitief besluit hierover zal in juni 1997 vallen.
<P>
De tour vindt plaats &eacute;&eacute;n jaar na het besluit van Shell om de Brent
Spar niet te dumpen op 20 juni 1995. Sindsdien heeft Shell het Leman
BK platform aan land gebracht. Verder besloot de Noorse regering om

The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and
distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals.  These
include animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and
drugs for pet (or companion) animals.  CVM is responsible for regulating drugs,
devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million
companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, sheep, and minor
animal species.  (Minor animal species include animals other than cattle, swine,
chickens, turkeys, horses, dogs, and cats.)

<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine encourages anyone to contact the
agency for assistance, to supply information, or to report a problem with a
product.<P>
<b>Veterinary Drug Adverse Reaction Reporting</b><P>
If you are aware of adverse reactions to veterinary drugs, please report them
to the FDA. Information about adverse drug reactions is critical to the CVM's
on-going surveillance of animal drug products to assure their continued safety
and effectiveness. You may report your experiences on a "Veterinary Adverse
Reaction, Lack of Effectiveness or Product Defect Report" (Form FDA 1932a).<P>
Copies of the form are available from:<p>
Food and Drug Administration<br>
Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Division of Surveillance<br>
7500 Standish Place, HFV-210, MPN2<br>
Rockville, Maryland 20855<p>

You may also report adverse reactions
by telephone during normal working hours (8:00 a.m. to<br>4:30 p.m. EST) by
calling collect (301) 594-1751, or after hours by dialing direct (301)
594-<br>1797. In the second case, a message is recorded and the call is
returned by a veterinarian the<br>following day.<P>
<b>Reporting Violations of the Federal Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act</b><P>
If you find a violation of the laws and regulations enforced by FDA, you may
contact your nearest FDA district office, or:<P>
Food and Drug Administration<br>
Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Division of Compliance<br>
7500 Standish Place, HFV-230<br>

<HR>
<H3>Welcome to the FDA CVM Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation</H3>
<hr>

The Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (NADE) is responsible for reviewing information
submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and sell
animal drugs.  A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved new animal
drug application.  Virtually all animal drugs are "new animal drugs" within the meaning
of the term in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

<title>Annual Report FY'94 and Research Plan, FY'95 </title>
</head>
<body>

<a name="RTFToC1"><b>The Office Of Science</a> 
<br> Annual Report - Fiscal Year 1994 <br>
 Research Plan - Fiscal Year 1995</b>
<P>
<P>

<h2>A.Introduction:</h2>
<P>
The mission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to assure that drugs,
devices, and human biological products are safe and effective, that food is
safe and wholesome, and that radiological products and cosmetics are safe.<P>
As an integral part of the FDA, the primary function of the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is to regulate the interstate marketing and use of
animal drugs, devices, feeds, and food additives.  The Center approves only
those products which are shown by data to be:<P>
1.	Safe and effective for animals.<P>
2.	Safe for consumers of animal derived products.<P>
3.	Safe for the environment.<P>
In addition to the above, the Center continuously monitors these products'
performance, under field conditions, and disseminates information to users of
these products to assure that they remain safe and effective for their intended
purposes.  When appropriate, the Center initiates compliance action in response
to violations of law or regulations.<P>
Decision-making within CVM must reflect the "state of the art" in science and
technology.  It should be noted that the Center's scientists frequently meet
directly with scientists from academia and industry.  It is essential that
these meetings be held in an environment of mutual credibility and respect.  In
order to maintain the level of scientific credibility that is necessary to
support the authority of regulatory decisions, it is essential that CVM
scientists be involved in the conduct of research programs that reflect areas
of scientific excellence.<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine is primarily a regulatory agency.  However,
research is recognized as a critical resource required by the Center to achieve
its mission of public health and consumer protection.  Thus, the research
conducted must be relevant, of the highest quality, and timely.<P>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">B.Research Mission:
</a></h2>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">1.Center for Veterinary Medicine</a></h3>
<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine, in addition to implementing programs
providing for scientific review and approval of new animal drug applications
(NADAs) and food additives, and for surveillance and compliance activities,
initiates, through the Office of Science, intramural and extramural research
programs designed to provide a scientific basis for Agency decision making.<P>
The primary objectives of the research activities are to provide:<P>
a.	Data necessary to establish and support Agency policies in regulating animal
drugs, food additives, feeds, and medical devices.<P>
b.	Research addressing specific regulatory problems, e.g., contamination of
feedstuffs, elimination of drugs in food producing animals, and development and
validation of analytical methods for detecting residues of drugs in animal
derived food products.<P>
c.	A projection of future problems or developments that may affect Center
regulatory policies or activities coupled with a long range research plan
designed to provide the necessary science base required to effect needed
changes in regulatory policies.<P>

<h3><a name="RTFToC4">2.
Director, Office of Science (DOS)
</a></h3>
<P>
The DOS has the primary responsibility for implementing all research
(intramural and extramural) undertaken by the Center.  The DOS ensures that the
Center's research programs are supportive of the Agency's regulatory policies
and is responsive to current and future needs of the Center.  The DOS is also
responsible for evaluating the results of the Center's research programs.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">3.
Intramural Research
</a></h3>
<P>
The Deputy Director, Office of Science directs CVM's intramural research
program.  Intramural research projects are conducted at the Office of Science's
research facilities located on the United States Department of Agriculture's
Research Center in Beltsville, MD.  The research conducted may be a) in
response to a recognized need of the Center or Agency to develop, improve, or
validate analytical methods and techniques; b) in response to a need to develop
better research methodology, procedures, or models to support the evaluation of
the safety or efficacy of new animal drugs; c) in response to a need to provide
qualitative or quantitative assessments of risks associated with animal drugs,
feed additives, or other xenobiotics; or d) in response to a need for
information for dissemination to the general public under the Center's
education initiatives.  As a part of its responsibility for the Center's
research, the Office of Science, Beltsville (OSB) provides current and
pertinent resumes of the results of the intramural and extramural research
programs.  The OSB also provides a ready resource of scientific expertise in
specialized fields and disciplines to the rest of the Center.  Staff personnel
provide technical expertise as project officers or project advisory group (PAG)
members on several extramural contracts or cooperative agreements.  The OSB
personnel also engage in cooperative research studies with other research
facilities and programs such as, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), and Animal Drug Research
Center (ADRC), for the purpose of meeting the individual or mutual needs of the
participants.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC6">4.
Extramural Research
</a></h3>
<P>
Extramural research programs are initiated to extend the intramural capability
or develop new areas of research for which intramural resources are not
available.  In addition to university and private laboratory research support
via contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, extramural programs may be
conducted through interagency agreements with USDA and the National Biological
Survey.  Extramural research is conducted under the guidance of project
officers from within the Center and under the supervision of the Office of
Science.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">5.
Methods Development Program
</a></h3>
<P>
The specific goal of this program is to conduct research in the development of
separation and identification techniques for animal drugs in meat, milk, eggs,
fish, and honey.  The program addresses both the need for better regulatory
methods for approved animal drugs and the general lack of availability of any
analytical methods for drugs used in an extra-label manner in food-producing
animals.  This research program is a coordinated effort involving intramural
resources of FDA, USDA, and state regulatory agencies, as well as significant
expenditure of extramural funds.  <P>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">C.
Description of Planning Process:
</a></h2>
<P>
The research planning process at the Center for Veterinary Medicine is guided
by review and concurrence of Center management.  The plan resulting from this
process is relevant to the Center's needs, is sufficiently well defined to
provide for adequate planning and monitoring, and is compatible with available
resources.<P>
The Annual Report and Research Plan is a presentation of the Center's current
priority for research.  Intramural and extramural planning is initiated by
discussions between scientists and managers from OS, Office of New Animal Drug
Evaluation (ONADE), and Office of Surveillance and Compliance (OSC).  Planning
for subsequent year's research is finalized in a meeting between the Center
Director, Deputy Directors, designated managers from ONADE and OSC, and OS
managers.  At this meeting, OS managers present proposed studies for the next
year with the Center managers directing any change.  The product of this
meeting is Center research priorities for the next year.  Available expertise,
facilities, and on-going research are also primary considerations in defining
the research to be conducted at Beltsville.  Importantly, this plan reflects
reasonable estimates of the research which OS staff expects to complete.<P>
Intramural research for the next fiscal year is outlined in individual research
program plans.  Each plan addresses the objectives and relevance of the program
to the CVM mission; discusses background information and accomplishments of the
research program; describes ongoing studies that will be continued into the new
fiscal year; and proposes new studies that will be initiated in the new fiscal
year.  Intramural programs include GLP and non-GLP studies.  These programs are
evaluated annually for progress and priority of the Center.  Center priorities
may require a study which is not appropriate for any of the ongoing programs.
In such a case, the study will be conducted as an independent study and will be
identified appropriately in the Annual Report and Research Plan.<P>
 <P>
The extramural research plan is based on the specific studies to be initiated
or on-going in the first year of each extramural contract, grant, or agreement.
All grants and cooperative agreements receive additional scientific review,
prior to funding, by two advisory panels of scientists from outside the Center.
Contracts and interagency agreements receive additional scientific review by
project advisory groups composed of scientists from within and outside the
Agency.  Extramural plans are generally shown as multiyear projects.<P>
Although CVM research planning is a continuous process, the Annual Report and
Research Plan is presented to the CVM Council annually at the beginning of the
fiscal year as the Center research plan.  CVM Council members and other CVM
personnel, as appropriate, use the plan for information and planning purposes.
The plan also serves as a source document for the next planning cycle.

	<p>
Products intended for aquaculture use are subject to all applicable provisions
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations under CFR Title 21.
Such products, which are not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe
and effective for their intended uses, are "new animal drugs" under the Act and
may not be legally distributed without a NADA approved by FDA.<P>
With the increased consumption of farm raised fish, there is an increased
awareness and concern for the safety of this food source.  For aquaculture, CVM
interests are in ensuring the safe use of drugs and chemicals and the
availability of a monitoring program for detecting unsafe residues.<P>
As consumption and production of aquaculture species increase, there is an
increased need and use of drugs and chemicals to maintain the health status of
these species.  The majority of these compounds are not approved.  Many of the
compounds are also not approved in other species.  As there is no approval of
these compounds, our knowledge of toxicity and metabolism is limited.  With the
wide use of these compounds and the unknown metabolism and toxicity of
residues, the potential for unsafe residues is great.  <P>
As many of the chemicals are available through chemical warehouses, there will
be no incentive for sponsors to develop the data for approval.  Similarly for
those drugs used, the use in aquaculture is not expected to be of a volume
which would justify sponsorship.  <P>
There will be increased questions regarding the safety of drug and chemical
residues in this food source.  The need for a monitoring program will become
more apparent.<P>
In 1989, we received an unsolicited grant application from Dr. Kevin Kleinow of
Louisiana State University which requested support to study the
pharmacokinetics and metabolic profiles of selected chemicals in fish.  The
application was reviewed and approved for funding by expert field readers and
the National Advisory Environmental Health Sciences (NAEHS) Council.  The
project was funded for three years, followed by a six month extension, and
expired on March 31, 1993.  A final report was submitted and approved on
January 12, 1994.<P>
Dr. Kleinow has conducted studies with nalidixic acid (NA) and oxolinic acid
(OA) that have produced useful information to FDA.  Studies with NA demonstrate
that the drug is well distributed into all fluid spaces and organs.
T(subscript 1/2beta) and volume of distribution values for NA in trout were considerably
shorter and smaller, respectively, relative to reported OA values gathered
under identical conditions.  The relative relationship of NA to OA (subscript t1/2beta)
in trout was similar to that as reported in mammals.  Total body clearance
rates were relatively high compared with other drugs in trout, but much lower
than NA in mammals.  Plasma protein binding of NA was low and exhibited
saturability over the range of concentrations examined.  The magnitude of
protein binding for NA was similar to oxolinic acid in trout, but much lower
than NA values reported in mammals.  While apparent oral bioavailabilities of
NA were high in trout, non-linear kinetics appeared to be elicited.  Trout
exhibited evidence of NA metabolism in bile and liver with a NA glucuronide as
the primary metabolite (1,2). <P>
Studies with OA demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics and disposition varies
with both the fish species and acclimation temperature.  Oxolinic acid
clearance, elimination half-lives, oral bioavailability as well as distribution
into muscle and bile, were temperature dependent in the catfish.  The major
species difference when compared at the same and divergent temperatures was the
volume of distribution.  In general, trout exhibited longer (subscript t1/2beta)'s and
larger V(subscript ss) values than their catfish counterparts.  These findings suggest that
extended drug withdrawal times will be necessary for either species at
14(superscript 0)C, as compared to 24 (superscript 0) C catfish (1,3).  <P>
On September 28, 1990, September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1993 we initiated
three contracts to determine the total residue depletion and metabolic profile
of selected chemicals used in aquaculture.  The first contract, which is with
Simon Fraser University, involves studies on malachite green, furazolidone, and
tricaine methanesulfonate in trout.  The second contract, which is with Ohio
State University, involves studies on benzocaine, trichlorfon, and diquat in
catfish.  The third contract, which is also with Ohio State University,
involves studies on 17-alpha-methyltestosterone in rainbow trout, and
flumequine and acriflavine in rainbow trout or another salmonid species.<P>
The contract with Simon Fraser was scheduled to expire September 27, 1993;
however, we extended the expiration date to May 27, 1994.  Dr. Francis Law, the
principal investigator, has completed his evaluation of furazolidone and
malachite green.  The results of the total residue depletion and metabolic
profile study in orally dosed trout demonstrated that furazolidone residues
were rapidly absorbed but slowly eliminated.  The levels of residues were
highest in kidney followed by liver, skin, and muscle.  Most of the residues
were water soluble and associated with cell debris, since &lt;10% was
extractable by ethyl acetate.  The ethyl acetate layer from skin and muscle
contained only a small quantity of unchanged furazolidone and other material
that was unidentified (4).  <P>
The total residue depletion and metabolic profile study with malachite green in
trout demonstrated that the malachite green concentration in the organic
extract of the whole fish homogenate decreased with time (over 7 days after
exposure),  while the concentration of leuco malachite green increased with
time.  The concentration of (superscript 14)C-levels in liver, muscle, and skin
decreased with time (over 21 days after exposure), but it appears the levels in
kidney did not significantly decrease with time.  This may explain why
malachite green is efficacious for trout infected with proliferative kidney
disease.  A small but significant amount of  (superscript 14)C in cell debris was
not extractable by repeated methane extractions, indicating irreversible or
covalent binding of (superscript 14)C to the cell debris.  It is interesting to
note that while irreversibly bound  (superscript 14) C in the liver, muscle, and
skin decreased with time during the post-exposure period, irreversibly bound
 (superscript 14) C in the kidney increased with time (5). <P>
Dr. William Hayton, the principal investigator on two contracts with Ohio
State, is making excellent progress.  He has completed a) the pilot study on
diquat equivalence of water exposure and intravascular administration, b) the
trichlorfon pilot total residue depletion and metabolic profile study, and c)
the total residue depletion and metabolic profile study of benzocaine in
catfish (Contract No. 223-91-7015).  The work under Contract No. 223-93-7014 is
in the early stages and there are no results to report at this time other than
pilot studies have been initiated with acriflavine.  <P>
The diquat equivalence study demonstrated that after both water exposure and
intravascular administration of  (superscript 14)C-diquat, the trunk kidney and the
liver accumulated the highest levels of radioactivity.  Concentrations of
radioactivity in other tissues were much lower, particularly in white muscle
where the steady-state concentration of radioactivity was less than 0.5% of the
water concentration.  On a weighted average basis, the concentration of
radioactivity in the entire carcass after 5 hr water exposure to
 (superscript 14)C-diquat was estimated to be less than 0.1% of the water
concentration.  After intravascular administration, diquat was rapidly
eliminated into the water.  A small fraction of the radioactivity in the fish
was not associated with diquat and therefore appeared to be in the form of one
or more metabolites.  The apparent metabolite found after intravascular
administration of  (superscript 14) C-diquat differed in its chromatographic
behavior from that observed after water exposure.  Tissue/plasma ratios of
radioactivity concentrations were generally similar after water exposure and
intravascular administration of  (superscript 14)C-diquat (6).<P>
The trichlorfon pilot study revealed that trichlorfon disappeared from the
exposure solution before the exposure phase ended.  Its instability in water is
known and some thought should be given to shortening the exposure phase.  While
the kinetic events (i.e., drug absorption) in the exposure solution were
pronounced during the 96 hr exposure, the results of the total residue
depletion were remarkably similar among fish.  The treated fish all seemed to
accumulate a similar amount of residue, as evidenced by the smooth log-linear
decline of the residue-time profiles for several of the tissues.  The high
concentration of tissue residue relative to the exposure water concentration of
trichlorfon makes it feasible to individually expose fish to trichlorfon for
the main study without purchase of additional labeled material.  The half life
of up to 53 days for depletion of the residue suggests that a relatively long
depuration phase for the main study will be needed (7).<P>
The benzocaine depletion and metabolic profile study demonstrated that at the
end of the exposure period, the concentration of total radioactivity varied
among tissues and was similar in order of magnitude to the 35 ppm exposure
water concentration.  At this time, most of the residue was in the form of
benzocaine in plasma and tissues, while benzocaine was about one-third of the
total residue in bile.  The residue concentration in bile rapidly increased and
remained orders of magnitude greater than in the other tissues for the 20 days
depuration characterized by this study.  The concentration of residue in the
other tissues fell rapidly, reaching about 1% of the 35 ppm exposure
concentration by 25 hr, except trunk kidney (4.2%), liver (11%), and bile
(1100%).  Starting at about 25 hr depuration, the residue concentration in all
the tissues and fluids studied appeared to enter a log-linear phase having a
half-life of about 8 days.  The concentration-time profiles appeared parallel
and the rank-order (highest to lowest) of concentrations (240 hr) was bile &gt;
liver &gt; trunk kidney &gt; head kidney &gt; skin &gt; red muscle &gt; plasma
&gt; white muscle (8). <P>
On April 1, 1992, we initiated an interagency agreement with the National
Biological Survey to study the effects of temperature on the   pharmacokinetics
of benzocaine in rainbow trout.  The agreement was extended on two occasions
and the current scheduled expiration date is September 30, 1994.  Dr. William
Gingerich, principal investigator, has developed and evaluated HPLC methods for
the detection of benzocaine in whole blood or plasma of trout.  Under the
current agreement he will a) validate methods of analysis of benzocaine and
acetylated benzocaine developed for rainbow trout fillet tissues in channel
catfish fillet tissues and b) document loss of benzocaine and acetylated
benzocaine residues from temperature-acclimated channel catfish following
typical use-pattern exposure. <P>
<b>D.	 Studies to be Continued in FY 95 </b> :<P>
1.	Total residue depletion and metabolic profile of selected drugs in
catfish.<P>
Studies to determine the total residue depletion and metabolism of  trichlorfon
in catfish will be completed in FY 95.  This information will provide a
database suitable for the development of analytical methods for the assessment
of tissue residue concentrations of this drug in catfish.  The analytical
method used to develop the metabolic profile data may be applicable for the
development of an analytical method to monitor for tissue residues of this
compound.<P>
2.	Effects of temperature on the loss of benzocaine and acetylated benzocaine
residues from edible tissues of channel catfish.<P>
The relative accumulation and loss of benzocaine and acetylated benzocaine will
be determined in the edible fillet tissues of channel catfish, a species that
constitutes the major warm water fish cultured in U.S. aquaculture.  Initially,
an analytical method for benzocaine and acetylated benzocaine already developed
for rainbow trout tissue will be validated in channel catfish fillet tissue by
in vitro recovery studies of spiked, homogenized catfish tissues and by mass
balance studies of incurred residue using radiolabelled
 (superscript 14) C-benzocaine.  The validated method will be used to determine the
loss of benzocaine and acetylated benzocaine in two separate groups of channel
catfish temperature-acclimated to one of two different temperatures that bound
the upper and lower limits of their normal culture range.    <P>
3.	Total residue depletion and metabolic profile of selected drugs in
salmonids.  <P>
	Studies will be conducted to determine the total residue depletion,
distribution, and metabolism of acriflavine in rainbow trout.  These data will
be used in the development of analytical methods for the assessment of tissue
residue concentrations of these drugs.  <P>
  
<b>E. 	Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :</b><P>
	Total residue depletion and metabolic profile of selected drugs in
salmonids.<P>
Studies will be conducted to determine the total residue depletion,
distribution, and metabolism of 17-methyltestosterone and flumequine in rainbow
trout.  These data will be used in the development of analytical methods for
the assessment of tissue residue concentrations of these drugs.<P>

On February 24, 1989, we published a notice in the Federal Register  requesting
cooperative agreement applications to conduct research on new or emerging
techniques of analytical chemistry that have not been applied to any great
extent to the analysis of animal drug residues (1).  In response to the RFA, we
received 20 applications which were peer reviewed by scientists from outside
the Center.  The following four applications were selected for funding in FY 90
and beyond:  a)  Cornell University (# FD-U-000577-01), b) Martin Marietta-Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (# FD-U-000575-01), c) Louisiana State University (#
FD-U-000581-01), and d) Research Triangle Institute (# FD-U-000589-01). <P>
The cooperative agreements with Cornell University and Martin Marietta-Oak
Ridge National Laboratory were completed and accepted by the Center in FY 94.
The cooperative agreement with Louisiana State University was extended 12
months and the scheduled expiration date was June 30, 1994.  Dr. Barker, the
principal investigator, and his co-investigators have developed a matrix solid
phase dispersion (MSPD) procedure for the extraction of drugs from biological
matrices.  This technique, which has been patented, has been applied to a large
number of drugs and chemicals (aminoglycosides, benzimidazoles, beta-lactams,
chloramphenicol, chlorsulfuron, furazolidone, nicarbazin, organophosphates,
sulfonamides, and tetracyclines) in many different biological matrices (bovine
kidney, milk, bovine muscle, bovine liver, swine muscle, chicken muscle, bovine
fat, catfish muscle, and infant formula).  To date, Dr. Barker and his
colleagues have published at least 23 scientific articles from this work.  CVM
has been the main source of extramural funding for this project since its
inception.  In one of his most recent studies, Dr. Barker developed a simple
and rapid method for the simultaneous extraction and liquid chromatographic
determination of sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and 4-N-acetylsulfadimethoxine
(N-acetyl SDM) in channel catfish muscle and plasma.  Intra-assay variation was
&lt;10% for both compounds at all concentrations examined.  Inter-assay
variation for SDM was 13% for muscle and 14% for plasma and for N-acetyl SDM
was 11% and 10% for muscle and plasma, respectively (2).<P>
The cooperative agreement with the Research Triangle Institute has also been
completed.  The final report was received and accepted in FY 94.  Dr. Voyksner
and his colleagues at RTI and North Carolina State University (subcontractor)
have explored the development of analytical methodology for the extraction,
detection, or confirmation of drug residues (beta-lactam aminoglycosides,
tetracyclines, sulfonamides, nitrobenzamide classes of drugs) in tissues and
milk.  Work on extraction primarily centered on the use of ultrafiltration for
beta-lactam and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) for tetracycline and
nitrobenzamide from tissues or milk.  Determinative methods using HPLC with
ultraviolet (UV) or fluorescent detection were evaluated for beta-lactams
and selected aminoglycosides in milk and tissues.  Multiresidue HPLC/UV methods
could detect 10-100 ppb levels of beta-lactams in milk.  Confirmation
methodology using electrospray MS was evaluated and proved successful for
detection of all drug classes mentioned.  The use of on-column concentration
combined with capillary HPLC/electrospray MS permitted the confirmation of
beta-lactams to the 10 ppb level in milk.  This work resulted in the
publication of nine scientific papers (3)<P>
This program of support via cooperative agreements was continued with the
publication of a notice in the Federal Register on July 28, 1992 (4) in which
we requested applications to conduct basic research and development on the
isolation, separation, detection, quantitation, and unambiguous identification
of animal drug residues in tissue matrices (including milk).  Particular
emphasis was placed on a) extraction and clean-up, b) analyte separation and
detection, c) confirmatory procedures other than mass spectrometry, and d)
multiresidue separation, determination, and confirmation. <P>
Twelve applications were received in response to the Federal Register notice.
These applications were peer reviewed by scientists from outside the Agency and
four applications were selected for funding, two in FY 93 and two in FY 94.
Applications from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the University of
California were funded in FY 93 and applications from the University of
Maryland, Baltimore County and the University of Maryland, Baltimore were
funded in FY 94.  The principal investigator from RTI, Dr. Voyksner, proposes
to continue and expand the work that the Center has supported in the past.  He
will focus on developing extraction and cleanup procedures,
screening/determination procedures, and confirmation methods for beta-lactams,
aminoglycosides, steroids, spectinomycin, unapproved drugs, such as flunixin,
and other drugs as appropriate in tissues and milk.  Dr. Voyksner and his
colleagues have just recently developed a rapid, simple method for the
determination of ceftiofur in bovine milk by ion-paired liquid chromatography.
The method involved an ultrafiltration of diluted milk with an equal volume of
50% acetonitrile through a 3,000 dalton molecular weight cut-off filter.  The
ultraviolet-visible absorbance of the column effluent was monitored in the
230-350 nm range of a photodiode-array detector (max 290.6 nm).  Recoveries of
ceftiofur from bovine milk spiked at 100 ppb, 50 ppb, and 25 ppb were 90, 82,
and 80% with coefficients of variation of 13.2, 13.7, and 16.2%, respectively
(5).<P>
The two projects with the University of Maryland have just been funded and
there are no results to present at this time.  Dr. LaCourse, the principal
investigator at Baltimore County, plans to develop pulsed electrochemical
detection/HPLC or high performance ion-exchange chromatography methods for the
detection of animal drug residues (aminoglycoside, penicillin, and
cephalosporin) in tissue and milk.  Dr. Eldefrawi, the principal investigator
at Baltimore, plans to develop very rapid, highly sensitive and specific fiber
optic immunofluorosensors and light addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS)
for the detection of ampicillin and dexamethasone and their metabolites in milk
and animal tissues with minimal or no sample preparation.  Ideally, there
should be no false positive or negative results and the principles to be
developed would be applicable to other antibiotics.<P>
On September 30, 1991, we initiated funding on a new five-year task order
contract with A.D. Little, Inc.  We assigned the contractor two tasks to
conduct with FY 91 funding.  These tasks were to develop a) a mass spectrometry
confirmatory procedure for novobiocin in raw milk and (b) to evaluate a
potential regulatory method (published by Dr. W.A. Moats) for penicillin G,
ampicillin, and cloxacillin in milk.  Additional tasks were assigned in FY 93
and FY 94.  The most recent tasks involve a) the evaluation of an analytical
procedure for thionin, a metabolite of methylene blue, in milk and b) the
evaluation of an analytical procedure for ceftiofur in milk.<p>
In April 1992, we initiated an interagency agreement with USDA to develop,
modify, or adapt analytical methods, including chromatographic and
affinity-based methods, to detect residues of antibiotics or their metabolites
in raw milk.  Dr. Moats, co-principal investigator, has been involved in the
development of the following methods:  a) HPLC method for the determination of
ampicillin and amoxicillin in milk and b) HPLC method for the multi-residue
detection of beta-lactams in milk.  Dr. Medina, co-principal investigator, has
been involved in developing the following methods:  a) TLC method for the
determination of hygromycin B in milk and b) HPLC/affinity chromatography
method for the determination of hygromycin B in milk.  This agreement was
extended through September 30, 1994.  During FY 94, Dr. Moats will evaluate the
performance of antibiotic residue screening tests for milk from individual cows
following a clinical episode of mastitis and subsequent treatment with a
selected beta-lactam drug, develop practical HPLC-based procedures for
quantitating beta-lactam residues in milk, and consult with OSB scientists
involved in validating beta-lactam residue methods in milk.<P>

The Committee on Animal Nutrition (CAN) is concerned with various aspects of
animal nutrition and with the relationship of animal nutrition to the welfare
of the agricultural enterprise and to human health.  While the primary focus of
CAN is the preparation of the nutrient requirement series, CAN also identifies
and addresses emerging concepts and problems in the field of animal nutrition.
CAN is a standing committee of the National Research Council's Board on
Agriculture.  The membership is on a three year rotation.  The committee serves
as the parent or master committee for all activities related to animal
nutrition.  Decisions are made by CAN based on their knowledge of new and
emerging problem areas and the need to compile and disseminate new information
for the benefit of animal agriculturalists and scientists.<P>
The Center has supported the activities of the CAN committee for several years.
The publications of the committee are used by Center veterinarians and
scientists in their pre- and post- clearance review activities. <P>
The committee met in the first quarter of FY 94 (October 8 and 9)  in
Lexington, Kentucky to review and discuss subcommittee activities and the
status of various projects.  The revisions of the poultry nutrient requirements
and the laboratory animal nutrient requirements will issue in 1994.  A first
draft of the revision of the beef publication has been completed, and it is on
tract for 1995.  The CAN has a subcommittee working on a report on metabolic
modifier effects on nutrition (e.g., BST).  A publication is expected in 1994.
Other projects that CAN is working on include a National Feed Composition
Database and revision of the nutrient requirement series for swine and
dairy.<P>

On July 1, 1993, we funded a one year contract with the University of Arkansas.
The objectives are to conduct studies that optimize culture media, conditions,
and procedures for the detection of <i>Salmonella</i> in finished feed
matrices, and the principle feed ingredients.  We are now in the process of
modifying the contract to provide for the evaluation of non-culture methods
using the procedures and media described in the scientific literature or
according to the instructions supplied with commercial kits.  For the
non-culture detection methods requiring a pre-enrichment and/or a selective
enrichment step, the contractor will also evaluate these methods using
universal broth for the pre-enrichment and tetrathionate-Hajna and selenite
cystine as the selective enrichment medium.  Each non-culture method will be
evaluated in meat and bone meal and a mixed feed at two <i>Salmonella</i>
inocula levels.<P>

and Residue Depletion Studies.

<P>
<b>B.	 Objectives :</b><P>
The overall objective of this program is to conduct metabolism and residue
depletion studies on animal drugs that were approved in the 1950s and 1960s.
The drug tolerances and corresponding regulatory methods that were established
by FDA during these time periods may not meet today's human food safety
standards.  In those cases where an analytical method must be developed, it may
be necessary to first conduct a metabolism study to determine the compound of
concern.  Such research may also necessitate a new residue depletion study
utilizing the new analytical method.<P>

Both of the projects listed in this section have or will be supported via an
interagency agreement with the USDA, which was initially funded in 1989.  The
first two years' work in this program were devoted to the study of total
residues in sulfamethazine treated cows.  After this work was completed, the
investigator initiated studies on total residues in levamisole treated cows,
which will be completed in 1994.  The principal investigator's work
demonstrates that the concentration of levamisole residues in milk decreases
from time of treatment to a level of 0.06 ppm at 36-48 hr postdosing in both
orally treated and subcutaneously treated cows.  The percentage of drug
residues in the lipid fraction of milk in both treatment groups increases over
time to 4.0% and 4.8%, respectively, at 36-48 hr postdosing.  Also, the
percentage of drug in the aqueous eluent increases with time after treatment;
whereas, the level of drug residues in the methanol eluent decreases with time
after treatment.  The HPLC fraction corresponding to levamisole decreased with
time after treatment in both groups.  In a more recent study, Dr. Paulson
fractionated milk, from cows orally and subcutaneously dosed with
 (superscript 14) C-levamisole, by centrifugation, XAD-2 column chromatography, and
reverse phase C-18 HPLC in an attempt to isolate  (superscript 14) C-labelled
fractions.  A metabolite was isolated in pure form and identified by
 (superscript 1) H-NMR, FAB-MS and GC-MS (after derivation) analysis.  Attempts to
convert very polar levamisole metabolites to less polar products by acid and
base hydrolysis were unsuccessful.  <P>
<b>D. Studies to be Continued in FY 95  :</b><P>
Residue study in levamisole treated cows.<P>
The objectives of this study are to determine the composition, levels, and
depletion of drug related residues in the blood, urine, milk, and edible
tissues of lactating cattle administered an 8 mg/kg dose of
 (superscript 14) C-levamisole.<P>
<b>E. Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :</b> 
  <P>
In FY 95, Dr. Paulson will conduct <i>in vitro</i> incubation studies with
nitrofurazone in milk.  If the drug is metabolized, than the Hoogenboom method
will be used to measure bound residues.  Subsequently, radiolabelled metabolism
studies may be conducted with nitrofurazone administered via the uterus or the

The Seventh NRSP-7/FDA Workshop was conducted September 29-30, 1994, in
Bethesda, MD.  Objectives of this workshop were a) to inform and discuss with
the representatives of academia, pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies,
and producer groups the latest developments in regulations governing drug use
in aquaculture, prevalent diseases encountered in commercial production of
aquatic species, and new research developments that impact husbandry practices,
b) to provide the opportunity for representatives of academia, pharmaceutical
industries, regulatory agencies, and aquaculture producer groups to meet in a
non-confrontational environment to facilitate the free exchange of ideas and
information; and in this fashion each group can learn more about each other's
problems and learn to work cooperatively together, and c) to evaluate the
current status of aquaculture drug registration both within and external to the
NRSP-7 Minor Animal Drug Program.<P>
   
The Center for Veterinary Medicine provided partial support for the Agency's
grant to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Other Agency support was
provided by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  The activities
supported by this grant involved toxicological evaluations of food additives
and contaminants (other than pesticide residues) within the ongoing programme
of the JECFA/CCFAC system (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food
Additives/Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants of the Codex
Alimentarius Commission).  JECFA serves as the scientific advisory body to the
CC/RVDF (Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods), which is
hosted by the US government.  Center funds were used to support the evaluation
of residues of veterinary drugs in food.<P>
The 42nd meeting of JECFA was held on February 1-10, 1994 in Rome to review and
discuss nine veterinary drugs.  Staff in CVM prepared working papers on three
veterinary drugs that were assessed during the meeting.  The 43rd meeting of
JECFA on veterinary drugs is scheduled for November 15-24, 1994 in Rome.  CVM
has volunteered two employees for the 43rd meeting to serve as temporary
advisors and prepare working papers.<P>
The National Academy of Sciences (Panel on Animal Health and Veterinary
Medicine) is conducting an assessment of animal health and veterinary medicine
which involves choices and challenges confronting professionals in the care and
treatment of animals, particularly farm animals and aquaculture species, and
associated institutions carrying out research, education, regulatory, and
technology delivery activities.  The Center is providing partial support for
this project.<P>
The most recent meeting of the Panel was held on May 4-5, 1994 in Washington,
D.C.  Agenda items included a) Use of Drugs in Food Animals: Benefits and
Risks, b) An Integrated Food Safety Assurance System, c) Animal Well-Being
Workshop, and d) Future Activities (BSE, Implications of NAFTA and GATT on
Animals and Animal Products). <P>
The 9th Biennial Symposium of the AAVPT was held June 15-19, 1994 in Kalamazoo,
Michigan.  The objective of this conference was to provide a broad overview of
the pharmaceutical industry and the veterinary pharmacologist's role in the
pharmaceutical industry, both in the development of human health
pharmaceuticals and animal health pharmaceuticals.  The Center provided $1,000
to support this conference.<P>
Dr. Stanley Katz of Rutgers University reviewed the literature and provided a
written report on the use of the <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus</i> disc assay
to detect drug residues in milk.  The Center provided $2,000 to support this
activity.<P>
<b>D.	 Studies to be Continued in FY 95 :</b><P>
	 
	The Center's support for WHO's JECFA Committee will continue in FY 95 as 	will
the Center's support of the National Academy of Science's Panel on Animal
Health and Veterinary Medicine.<P>
<b>E.	 Studies to be Initiated in FY 95: </b><P>
Our support for new workshops and conferences will be identified at a later
date.

<H3>About the FDA CVM Office of Science</H3>

<P>
	Decisionmaking within CVM must reflect the "state of the art" in science and
technology.  In order to maintain the level of scientific credibility necessary to
support the authority of regulatory decisions, it is essential that CVM scientists be
involved in the conduct of research programs that reflect areas of scientific
excellence.
<P>
The Office of Science conducts intramural research and coordinates extramural research
grants and contracts that support pre- and post-marketing responsibilities by
providing information to aid CVM scientists in their review and decisionmaking
processes.
<P>
The research group's responsibilities include the following:
<P>
<ul>

<li>Develops and validates quantitative, qualitative analytical procedures for
analyzing drugs, additives, and contaminants in animal tissues and food.

<li>Validates the methods proposed by drug sponsors in support of their New
Animal Drug Application (NADA) to detect drug residues in animal tissue and products,
and in medicated feeds.

<li>Investigates the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of
drugs, feed additives, and contaminants in food animals (including minor species).

<li>Develops models for determining the safety and efficacy of veterinary drugs
and food additives in domestic animals.

<li>Determines the safety and efficacy of diagnostic agents and devices for
animal use.

<li>Investigates the affects of drugs, food additives, and contaminants on
immunological and physiological functions of domestic animals.

<li>Evaluates screening tests for drug residues in animal derived foods. 

<li>Investigates interactions between diet and drugs in food producing animals.
</ul><P>
During the process of carrying out their responsibilities, the research staff
interacts with other groups in CVM, scientists in other government agencies, and
scientists outside the Federal government.
<P>
Research is usually performed in response to a request from another office with the
Center.  There may be a need for studies to validate data submitted in an NADA or an
Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) exemption, to discover the cause of a
particular adverse effect caused by an animal drug, or to generate scientific data in
support of a legal action.  When a specific need arises, the research facility is
available to other CVM review scientists to conduct studies relating to the Center's
mission within their area of expertise.

<h2>Adverse Drug Experience Reporting System</h2><p>


<B>Introduction</B> <p>

Veterinarians and animal owners are encouraged to report adverse experiences and
product failures to the government Agency that regulates the product in question.
Pretesting by the manufacturer and review of the data by the government does not
guarantee absolute safety and effectiveness due to the inherent limitation
imposed by testing the product on a limited population of animals.  CVM
encourages you to contact the manufacturer of a suspect product. Reporting
information for the following product categories:<p>

<B>1. Animal Drugs, Devices and Foods</B><p>

Veterinarians and animal owners may report adverse drug experiences to FDA by: <p>

A. <B>Submitting a FORM FDA 1932a</B>, "Veterinary Adverse Experience, Lack of
Effectiveness or Product Defect Report".  The 1932a is pre-addressed, prepaid
postage form that is completed and dropped in the mail.  A form may be obtained
by writing:<p>

      ADE Reporting System<br>
      Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
      U.S. Food & Drug Administration<br>
      7500 Standish Place<br>
      Rockville, MD 20855-2773<p>

The Center may occasionally need more detailed information about an incident and
the reporter may be called by a CVM staff veterinarian.<p>

<body>

<H3>FDA CVM Post-Marketing (OS&C)</H3>

<P>
Even though a new animal drug product is carefully tested before it is marketed,
wider use of the product may disclose problems not evident during the pre-marketing
research.
<P>
The CVM post-marketing group, Office of Surveillance and Compliance, works in
cooperation with the FDA Field Offices, monitoring marketed animal drugs, food
additives, and veterinary devices to assure their safety and effectiveness.  This
regulatory responsibility is carried out by scientists and by investigators and
analysts around the country.  Also involved in these activities are the Department of
Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other State and Federal
agencies.  State and Federal field forces conduct inspections of drug and medicated
feed manufacturers to assure that acceptable manufacturing procedures are followed. 
Violations may result in legal action.
<P>
Activities within the post-marketing Divisions are varied, yet closely related.  One
activity is the overseeing of medicated animal feeds.  Another involves monitoring
drugs used in food and non-food animals, and providing scientific expertise for legal
cases.  In addition, information is prepared by this group for dissemination to the
public and regulated industry in an effort to encourage voluntary compliance with the
laws and regulations enforced by FDA.
<P>
One of CVM's highest priorities is assuring the safety of the food supply through
reduction of violative residues in meat and milk.  Drugs are used in food-producing
animals to treat and prevent animal diseases, and to increase animal production. 
However, drug use in food-producing animals is attended by a risk of residues in food
when directions for use are not followed.  For example, the most frequently found
cause of drug residues in meat is failure to follow the indicated withdrawal time on
the label.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)
is responsible for the inspection of meat and poultry products in Federally-inspected
establishments and has primary responsibility for the wholesomeness of these
products.  FSIS reports violative residues of drugs in meat and poultry to FDA for
regulatory followup.
<P>
FDA conducts followup inspections of producers or others involved in the production
or marketing of food animals or poultry which have tissue residue violations.  The
goal of CVM's Tissue Residue Program is to eliminate violative drug residues in
edible tissue of food animals.  Because of resource constraints, FDA cannot
investigate all of the initial tissue residue violations reported by FSIS.  State
regulatory bodies have stepped in to help carry out followup investigations.  The
States usually conduct investigations on violations caused by fist-time violators and
provide education to producers.  FDA usually focuses its resources on repeat
offenders.  Through these Federal and State programs, progress is being made in
reducing the number of residue violations.
<P>
The responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Nation's milk supply lies with the
FDA.  The Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) is the standard used in the
voluntary Cooperative  State/PHS Program for the certification of Interstate Milk
Shippers.  The program involves all 50 States, District of Columbia, and U.S.
Territories.  The states have authority to administer the PMO.
<P>
The PMO is a powerful enforcement tool.  Every producer of Grade A milk must have a
permit to ship the product.  Permits can be suspended for PMO violations such as the
sale of milk with violative drug residues.  Penalties are economic and severe.  In
addition to fines at the farm level, when a producer's milk contaminates a tank truck
load of milk, the producer is financially liable for the entire load of milk.
<P>
The National Drug Residue Milk Monitoring Program (NDRMMP) is another effort to
ensure milk safety.  The NDRMMP routinely tests raw milk for drug residues.  It is a
cooperative effort between FDA and State milk control officials.  Milk samples are
assayed for eight sulfonamide and three tetracycline drugs, chloramphenicol, and the
beta lactam antibiotics.  Analytical methods for more compounds are added as they are
developed.
<P>
Additional functions of the post-marketing group include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Approves food additive petitions after determining their safety and utility.

<li>Approves medicated feed applications after ensuring the sponsoring firm is
operating in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and properly
labels the medicated feed.

<li>Monitors animal feeds with regard to their safety to the animals which
receive them, to the public who consume the food products derived from treated
animals, and to the environment.

<li>Monitors approved veterinary drugs and food additives to assure their
continued safety and effectiveness.

<li>Monitors marketed unapproved veterinary drugs and veterinary devices.

<li>Prepares for publication in the Federal Register all actions that are being
proposed or taken concerning regulation of animal health products.

<li>Enforces industry compliance with the FFDCA  by coordinating legal cases
brought against violators by the Agency.

<li>Pursues voluntary compliance by sharing information regarding animal drug
use with the regulated industry, the medical community, and consumers.

<li>Withdraws drugs and food additives from the market when conditions warrant
removal based on scientific fact concerning a lack of safety and/or effectiveness.

<li>Assures that good laboratory and manufacturing practices are maintained,
through the monitoring of clinical and laboratory investigators who conduct studies
as part of the NADA approval process.

<li>Continuously monitors and evaluates reports of adverse drug reactions for
animal safety and public health issues.   Withdrawal of an approved drug may be
recommended if it is determined to be unsafe or ineffective.

</head><body><H3>The Year in Review</H3>

 
The reality of new facilities began to take shape in fiscal year 1994.  Final
plans for MOD II were accepted and ground breaking ceremonies were held August
29, 1994.  Several CVM personnel participated in the ceremony, which was the
official "kick-off" for the Agency's consolidation program.  Many OS personnel
attended this important and long awaited ceremony and are looking forward to
the completion of these much needed facilities.  The time schedule for
construction of MOD II calls for completion within 30 months.  Also, a contract
is being finalized for temporary office facilities at our present OSB site.
The new space, which will replace several existing trailers in need of major
repairs, is to be available in the first quarter of FY 95.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC1">Intramural
Research:
</a></h3>
<P>
Office of Science, Beltsville personnel provided significant support to the
regulatory and scientific programs of the Center during FY 94.  Accomplishments
in individual research programs are provided in the research plans for the
various programs.  Some of the general accomplishments of OSB personnel are
listed below.<P>
A.	OSB scientists assumed responsibility for the method trial of all non-NADA
regulatory methods.  One goal of this program is to greatly increase the number
of trials, historically only one or two have been completed per year.  For the
first year, we ambitiously sought to improve this to five or six trials.  In
fact, in FY 94 trials were initiated and are nearing completion on methods for
chloramphenicol, gentamicin, ceftiofur, and thionin in milk and malachite green
in catfish.  In our new streamlined process, OSB study directors are empowered
to deal directly with method sponsors and negotiate schedules and any needed
changes in methods.  The new system eliminates formal memoranda and their
time-consuming travels up and down chains of command.  As we gain experience
with this process, we anticipate further gains in efficiency by telescoping the
phases of different trials.  Dr. Philip Kijak is coordinating this program.<P>
B.	OSB scientists conducted evaluations of post-acceptance performance of three
screening tests.  We tested the performance of the EDITEK EZ-SCREEN test for
chloramphenicol and the IDEXX Cite-Probe and SNAP tests for beta-lactam drugs.
The EZ-SCREEN performance was reassessed after sensitivity/selectivity problems
were noted in laboratory accreditation sample results by the Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition's (CFSAN) Laboratory Quality Assurance Branch
(LQAB).  We found decreased sensitivity compared to the original test.  The
Cite-Probe was retested to resolve differences in performance between the
original OSB study with incurred residues and the subsequent work at the
independent laboratory.  Results of the second study agreed with our earlier
findings.  The SNAP test was not available for our original study.  Again,
based on experiences at LQAB, we conducted a study to determine if normal
manufacturing variations can affect the test sensitivity for different
beta-lactams.  Two of four lots tested failed to detect amoxicillin at the safe
level (10 ppb) with 90 percent sensitivity (.95 confidence limit).<P>
C.	Intensive evaluations of screening tests for milk from individual cows was
continued.  Two significant investigations were completed in this area.  One
involved screening the entire United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA)
dairy herd, using several screening tests approved for use with milk from bulk
tank or tanker trucks, to determine their selectivity rate when used on milk
from individual cows.  The second study investigated the effects of storage
time and conditions on the performance of these screening tests.<P>
D.	Production of control and drug incurred tissues in conjunction with external
organizations, particularly USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS),
was expanded in FY 94.  Two such studies involved the dosing of animals and
harvesting of tissues with three sulfonamides in swine and berenil in cattle.
In addition, the program to produce drug incursions in aquatic species was
expanded to include work with shrimp.  An OSB study involving metabolism of
trichlorfon in shrimp was completed.<P>
E.	OSB scientists and Dr. Guy Paulson (USDA's Agricultural Research Service)
have agreed to a long-term collaboration on research into the biotransformation
and transfer of drugs and their metabolites into eggs.  During a series of
meetings in Beltsville and Fargo, they agreed that Dr. Paulson would conduct
radiolabelled dosing studies on chickens with several classes of drugs of
interest to CVM.  Isolation and characterization studies would be carried out
at OSB under the direction of Dr. Jurgen von Bredow.  In addition, several
productive cooperative studies with USDA's Growth Biology Laboratory and the
Mastitis Laboratory were developed and completed.  These cooperative efforts
are continuing and will likely be expanded in the future.<P>
F.	In addition to publishing in scientific journals, our scientists
participated in a broad variety of seminars, symposia, and scientific
meetings.<P>

I.	OSB scientists are recognized by their peers for their expertise and
scientific reputations.  This recognition is demonstrated in the requests for
our scientists to participate on various committees in CVM, FDA, and other
government agencies and in other scientific and professional functions.
Committee assignments include the Commissioner's Science Advisory Panel, CVM's
Animal Welfare Committee, CVM's Training Committee, an <i>ad hoc</i> CVM
committee on the Regulation of Veterinary Cytokines, CFSAN's Radiation Safety
Committee, the Commissioned Corp's Professional Advisory Committee for the
Veterinary Category, and the USDA's Animal Care and Use Committee.  OSB
scientists served as reviewers for scientific publications, reviewed grant
proposals for the Agency for International Development, served as general or
associate referee for the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, edited a
book on Veterinary Cytokines, and served on various committees in scientific
and professional organizations.  OSB scientists served as Project Officer or as
a members of various Project Advisory Groups for extramural research
projects.<P>
J.	The occupational health, safety, and environmental field is constantly
evolving.  Consensus standards and the continuing promulgation of new
regulations by the State of Maryland, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) impact on the research activities at OSB.  The OSB Safety
Officer, Mr. Bruce Bradley, incorporated these standards and regulations into
the OSB safety program.  Mr. Bradley provided significant input into addressing
the radiation safety program issues raised by the State of Maryland and the NRC
regarding the CFSAN NRC license (which OSB operates under) and low level
radioactive waste management.  Mr. Neil Schibblehut and Mr. John Schrider
renovated building 369A to meet building codes and regulatory requirements for
the storage of low level radioactive waste.  A new prefabricated hazardous
materials building was purchased and constructed to provide a hazardous waste
marshalling area.  In addition, documents were prepared for the State of
Maryland to provide the 1993 Annual Air Emissions report for the OSB
incinerator and the 1993 Annual Hazardous Waste report.  Three staff members
were recertified as infectious waste incinerator operators.  Mr. Bradley
participated in various safety meetings with CFSAN, USDA, and Agency
personnel.<P>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC2">Extramural
Research :
</a></h3>
<P>
The extramural section of the Center's research program consisted of a total of
21 research and research related projects that were supported through
contracts, grants, conference grants, cooperative agreements, and interagency
agreements.  Sixteen of these projects were supported from FY 94 funds and the
remaining five were funded from prior year funds.  The total extramural
research budget in FY 94 was $1,048,705.<P>
In FY 94, sixteen project officers from the Office of New Animal Drug
Evaluation, the Office of Surveillance and Compliance, and the Office of
Science provided technical guidance on various extramural projects.  The high
priority program areas for FY 94 were analytical methods development and drug
metabolism/residue studies in aquatic animal species.  These two programs and
other funded projects are summarized below.  In addition, manuscripts,
abstracts/presentations, final reports, and a patent generated from the program
are listed below:<P>
A.	The primary objectives of the analytical methods program are a) to develop
multiresidue procedures that can reliably quantitate and confirm the identity
of classes of drug residues, b) to develop methods for residues of unapproved
drugs that may be used illegally in food-producing animals, and c) to develop
chemical based methods for analysis that can be used to confirm analytical
results obtained with currently available antimicrobial screening assays for
several approved classes of antibiotics used in food-producing animals.<P>
There were eight projects in the analytical methods development program in FY
94.  Six of these were cooperative agreements, three of which were funded in
prior years and three were funded from the FY 94 budget.  The remaining two
projects, a contract and an interagency agreement, were also funded from the FY
94 budget.  Two of these projects (No. FD-U-000903, University of Maryland,
Baltimore County and No. FD-U-000895, University of Maryland, Baltimore) were
initiated during this fiscal year.  The Baltimore County project involves the
development of pulsed electrochemical detection/HPLC or high performance
ion-exchange chromatography methods for the detection of animal drug residues
in tissue and milk.  The Baltimore project involves the development of fiber
optic immunofluorosensors and light addressable potentiometric sensors for the
detection of ampicillin and dexamethasone in milk and tissues. <P>
B.	There were five projects (three contracts, one cooperative agreement, and
one interagency agreement) in the aquatic animal species research program in FY
94.  Three of these were funded from prior year funds and the other two were
funded from the FY 94 budget.  The three contracts have very similar objectives
and were designed to determine the total residue depletion and metabolic
profile of selected chemicals used in aquaculture.  The experimental drugs and
species include a) malachite green, furazolidone and tricaine methanesulfonate
in trout, b) benzocaine, trichlorfon and diquat in catfish, c)
17--methyltestosterone in trout, and d) flumequine and acriflavine in rainbow
trout or another salmonid species.  The primary objective of the cooperative
agreement is to study the pharmacokinetics and metabolic profiles of selected
chemicals in fish.  The primary objective of the interagency agreement is to
study the effects of temperature on the depletion and metabolism of benzocaine
and acetylated benzocaine in channel catfish.<P>
C.	Other extramural projects that were in the Extramural Research Program in FY
94 are listed as follows:
                   <P>
1.	NAS/NRC Committee on Animal Nutrition, National Academy of Sciences - A new
three-year cooperative agreement was initiated and funded in FY 94.  It is
scheduled for completion in FY 97.<P>
2.	Salmonella:  Optimization of culture and non-culture methods in a feed
matrix, University of Arkansas - Contract was modified to fund additional work
in FY 94.  The work is scheduled for completion in FY 95.<P>
3.	Total residue study in levamisole treated cows, USDA/ARS - Funded in FY 94
and scheduled for completion in FY 94.<P>
4.	Minor use animal drug workshop, Michigan State University - Funded and held
at the Holiday Inn in Bethesda, MD in FY 94.  The proceedings are expected in
FY 95.<P>

Development Program :
</a></h3>
<P>
The Office of Science, Beltsville coordinates this program under which research
on the development of regulatory methods of analysis for residues in
animal-derived human food is conducted at Beltsville, and also at more than a
dozen outside laboratories including those at universities, FDA Districts,
Agricultural Research Service and Food Safety and Inspection Service of USDA,
animal drug sponsors, and the Department of Health and Welfare in Canada. <P>
Progress in the program during FY 94 was marked by the development of two new
analytical methods for residues in tissue and nine new milk residue methods.
In addition, five analytical procedures, developed under the program,
successfully completed the Center's method trial procedure in three government
laboratories, thereby becoming "official regulatory" methods.  Four analytical
procedures are currently undergoing trial, and about nine additional methods
are on a prioritized list waiting to be evaluated in method trials.  During FY
94, we addressed the issue of increasing numbers of procedures waiting to
undergo resource intensive method trials by negotiating a contract with A. D.
Little Co., under which the contractor's chemists were trained and then
participated in three trials, replacing one of the government laboratories. <P>
Final protocols were prepared for the evaluation of milk residue screening
assays for three classes of animal drugs:  sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and
aminoglycoside antibiotics. In September, applications for sulfonamide test
kits were accepted and are currently undergoing evaluation.  <P>
A.	Tissue Residue Methods<P>
An initial list of 61 animal drugs that lacked reliable analytical methods for
residues in tissues was established in 1985 by a joint FDA/USDA Task Force.
Later, some of the animal drugs on the list were assigned a low priority when
scientists in each Office in CVM agreed that, for various reasons, the need for
residue methods for these drugs was not urgent.<P>
During FY 94, cooperation between OSB and the Agricultural Research and Food
Safety and Inspection Services of USDA on identification and prioritizing of
animal drugs needing improved residue methods has continued at a high level
through numerous formal and informal meetings and telephone conversations. The
current status of the approximately 51 animal drugs that have been assigned a
high or medium priority for residue methods development is described in Table
1.<P>
Normally, a regulatory method consists of two distinct analytical procedures, a
determinative procedure used for accurate quantitation of a residue and a
confirmatory procedure, usually based on mass spectrometry, that is used to
confirm the identity of the analyte being measured.  During FY 94, work was
completed on a determinative procedure for residues of the tranqualizer,
azaperone, in pork and on a mass spectrometry-based procedure for residues of
clenbuterol and several other beta-agonist drugs in the eyes of cattle.
Research has shown that residues of beta-agonist drugs, used illegally as
repartitioning agents in food animals, are more persistent in the eyes of
treated cattle than in edible tissues.  The procedure for azaperone in pork has
been scheduled to undergo method trial.<P>
B.	Milk Residue Methods<P>
After considering information from many sources within and outside the Agency
on drugs used in lactating cattle, their toxicity, and the expected exposure of
consumers to residues as a result of this use, the Office of Science, in 1989,
established a list of animal drugs that should be monitored for residues in
milk.  An August 1992 GAO Report, "FDA Strategy Needed to Address Animal Drug
Residues in Milk", contained a list of 82 drugs known to be, or suspected of
being, used in lactating cattle, and therefore capable of producing residues in
milk.  CVM ranked these 82 drugs using the same criteria applied to develop the
1989 list, and drugs considered to present a high or moderate risk to consumers
were combined in a single list of compounds needing analytical methods for
residues.  Table 2 contains the current status of methods development work on
the approximately 54 animal drugs on the combined list. <P>
During FY 94, work was completed on determinative procedures for residues of
spectinomycin, pirlimycin, tilmicosin, phenylbutazone, methylene blue,
ceftiofur, and furosemide.  All of these seven procedures are currently
undergoing or scheduled to undergo method trials.  A method trial of a
determinative procedure for chloramphenicol residues in milk, begun last fiscal
year, was completed in FY 94.  Confirmatory procedures for pirlimycin and
chloramphenicol were accepted as official regulatory methods this year.  All of
these methods have been or will soon be incorporated into FDA's National Drug
Residue Milk Monitoring Program at our Denver District Laboratory.  This
monitoring program was increased to approximately 5000 milk samples this
year.<P>
C.	Methods for Residues in Eggs<P>
On October 23, 1990, Dr. Craig Reed, Director of the Agricultural Marketing
Service in USDA, sent a letter to Dr. Gerald Guest, Director of CVM, containing
the recommendations of an informal committee of CVM and AMS scientists
concerning animal drugs that had the potential to occur as residues in eggs.
The seven drugs or classes of drugs recommended for methods development are
presented in Table 3.  This year CVM suggested that FDA District chemists
consider the adaptation of existing residue methods for use with eggs and honey
(see Part D below) as possible research projects.   Arrangements have been made
with the ARS metabolism laboratory at Fargo, ND to begin a cooperative effort
with OSB scientists to examine the transfer of radiolabeled sulfonamide drugs
from layer feed to eggs.<P>
D.	Methods for Residues in Honey<P>
During FY 90, investigations by the Staff of CVM's Office of Surveillance and
Compliance led to the conclusion that two animal drugs, oxytetracycline and
sulfathiazole, are being used in apiculture.  Because both drugs have the
potential to contaminate a human food when used to treat bees, a decision was
made in FY 91 to add this commodity to the Center's methods development program
(Table 4).  As resources permit, methods that have been developed for these two
drugs in tissue or milk will be adapted for use with honey.<P>
E.	Evaluation of Screening Assays for Residues in Milk<P>
This program began in 1991 when CVM undertook the evaluation of two
commercially available screening assays for chloramphenicol residues in milk.
At their biannual meeting in 1991, the National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments (NCIMS) passed a resolution requiring that each tanker truck be
tested for residues of beta-lactam drugs before the load is accepted by a milk
processor.  Responding to this resolution, both AOAC Research Institute and CVM
evolved plans to evaluate the more than two dozen commercially available milk
residue screening assays for this class of widely used animal drugs.  In 1992,
the two organizations agreed to initiate a cooperative effort to evaluate milk
screening tests.  The agreement was formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding
signed in October 1992.  In January 1993, FDA agreed to allow Arthur D. Little,
Inc. (ADL) to perform the same functions as AOAC-RI for clients that did not
wish to enroll in the latter's program.  Immediately thereafter, 19
applications for evaluation of beta-lactam screening assays were accepted by
AOAC-RI/ADL and CVM.  In October 1993, CVM "accepted" 16 of the original 19
tests.<P>
During FY 94, CVM personnel worked with the Laboratory Committee of the NCIMS
on how the accepted tests should be used, on the inclusion of positive and
negative standards in each test kit, and to obtain more definitive data on the
sensitivity of the fifteen acceptable tests to residues of each of the six
beta-lactam drugs approved for use in lactating cattle.  As a result of this
cooperation, the Laboratory Committee recommended that all 15 tests accepted by
the Agency be used in NCIMS monitoring programs.<P>
Manufacturers of three beta-lactam screening tests that had been evaluated and
accepted in FY 93, submitted applications describing modifications the firms
wanted to make in their tests.  One of these changes was accepted; the other
two are still under review.  It also became necessary, on the basis of reports
from test users, to reexamine the performance of certain aspects of three
previously accepted screening tests during FY 94.  As a result of these
studies, ampicillin was not permitted to remain of the label of the Cite Probe
beta-lactam Test (this test was subsequently withdrawn from the marketplace)
and the EZ-Screen test for chloramphenicol was reformatted to increase its
sensitivity.  The outcome of the third reevaluation will be the subject of
future discussions with its manufacturer.<P>
Standard protocols for the joint AOAC-RI/CVM evaluation of screening assays for
additional classes of animal drugs (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and
aminoglycosides) were prepared and a schedule for the submission of
applications for tests that detect these residues have been distributed to the
industry.<P>
Milk from individual cows often contain higher levels of certain normal
components than is found in co-mingled milk.  Furthermore, research reports in
the published literature indicate that some of these components, at the higher
levels encountered in milk from an individual cow, interfere with the
performance of certain types of residue tests.  Because testing of milk from a
medicated cow by a dairy farmer can be an effective way of ensuring that
illegal drug residues do not enter the country's food supply, CVM has
undertaken a separate evaluation program for milk residue screening assays
labeled for use with milk from an individual animal.  A final protocol for the
evaluation of such tests has been prepared with input from dairy veterinarians,
test kit manufacturers, and other interested parties.<P>
During FY 94, an interagency agreement between CVM/FDA and the Milk Secretion
and Mastitis Laboratory of the Agriculture Research Service of USDA was
initiated under which five to seven beta-lactam tests that were previously
accepted by the Center for use on commingled milk will have their selectivity
and sensitivity evaluated using milk from individual cows.  Results from this
study will be used to decide which screening tests will be included in further
performance evaluation with milk from animals treated with endotoxin as a model
for induced mastitis.<P>
F.	Residues in Fish:<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine is continuing its focus in developing fish
residue detection methods for those chemicals in Table 5.  These priority
chemicals were established by the Aquaculture Subgroup - Seafood Research Task
Force which meets quarterly to review the list and also the status of research
being conducted.  This subgroup consists of representatives from CVM, the
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the Office of Regional
Operations (ORA) and the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR).
The research involves resources in CVM, CFSAN, ORA, and NCTR.  Table 5 provides
the current list of chemicals, the required research, and thestatus of the
research.  The goal of this research program is to have reliable residue
detection methods which can be used by CFSAN for both domestic and import
monitoring programs.<P>
The CVM extramural program will continue to determine the fate of chemicals
administered to fish.  This work is essential for the development of residue
detection methods as there is little information available on most chemicals as
to the identity of the marker residue in edible fish tissue.  The Center
provided over $300,000 in FY 94 to support two extramural research projects.
The first project was an interagency agreement with the National Biological
Survey to study temperature effects on the depletion of benzocaine in catfish.
The second project was a contract with Ohio State University to study the
metabolism and residue depletion of drugs in rainbow trout.  The contract with
Ohio State University continues through FY 95.<P>

A.  Title :<P>
 
Maturational, Nutritional, and Disease-Related Factors Affecting Drug
Metabolism in Domestic Animals 
<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
  
The effects of age, diet, disease, concurrent therapy, and environmental
factors, on target animal drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) activity can be
evaluated using a combination of <i>in vitro</i> DME assays, and <i>in vivo</i> drug
disposition and/or pharmacokinetic studies.  Information obtained from these
kinds of studies can be used by both pre-market clearance and post-approval
review groups in assessing the potential impact of these environmental factors
on therapeutic efficacy, target animal safety, and human food safety.  Poor
efficacy would be a direct result of unforeseen extensive metabolism/
clearance.  Target animal toxicity could occur from slowed metabolism and/or
conversion to potentially toxic metabolites.  These latter two situations could
lead to increased drug residues as a potential human food safety concern. 
<P>
C.  Background :<P>
 
Past efforts under this research program have demonstrated that age, diet,
disease, concurrent therapy, and environmental factors can alter DME activity
and drug disposition.  We showed that the DME activity in both companion
[dog](1-5) and food-producing species [sheep (4-6) and cattle (7)] undergoes
various stages of ontological development.  The development of DME activity in
cattle is further complicated as a result of dietary/nutritional factors -
non-ruminating calves, both bob veal and fancy veal, have depressed levels of
DME activity (7).  Whether the increased activity in ruminating calves is a
result of induction resulting from dietary exposure to xenobiotics or better
nutrition resulting from rumen function have not been determined.  Disease also
plays a significant role in determining the levels of hepatic DME activity.
Sheep that had experienced various systemic diseases, such as bacterial, viral,
or parasitic (8) diseases had lower enzymatic activities when compared with
healthy animals (6). 
<P>
Data from studies 275.13 and 318.03 indicate porcine somatotrophin (PST)
depresses <i>in vitro</i> hepatic DME activities in both barrows and gilts.  These
results emphasize the need to assess the effects of PST treatment on drug
disposition <i>in vivo</i>.  Drug disposition could be changed as a result of
increased organ size, altered hepatic blood flow, or the diet effects that PST
may have on DME levels.   
<P>
Since bovine somatotrophin (BST) has been approved for use in dairy cattle, the
sponsors have applied for its use in beef cattle.  An early study sponsored by
industry purported to show that BST had no effect on disposition of drugs in
cows and bulls.  However, results of this study are questionable because a wide
range of BST doses was used and the BST was obtained from several different
sources.  Studies designed to demonstrate the effects of BST on drug
disposition in beef cattle should be repeated in the same way as studies 275.12
and 275.13. 
<P>
Preliminary experiments performed in collaboration with two other studies
(318.04 and 305.41) indicated there may be considerable differences in the
levels of DME activity in chicks that are raised in brooders as opposed to
those raised in pens.  The latter have considerably higher levels of
activity. 
  <P>
D.  Studies to be Continued in FY 95 :  
<P>
1.  The effect of porcine somatotrophin (PST) on disposition of drugs in pigs
(study 275.12). 
  <P>
The animal phase of this study was initiated during the last quarter of FY 94.
In this study we are comparing the disposition of several drugs, using
pharmacokinetic analyses, in untreated swine and in pigs treated with 100 &#181 g
PST/kg BW daily for ~30 days.  Drugs being studied are indocyanine green, which
is used specifically to measure hepatic blood flow, and propranolol, which
exhibits flow-dependent hepatic clearance.  If there is a PST-related effect on
the pharmacokinetic parameters associated with the clearance of propranolol,
then one can infer there may be changes in the residue levels of other drugs
whose elimination is also dependent on hepatic blood flow. 
 <P>
2.  <i>in vitro</i> metabolism of therapeutic drugs by liver of PST treated pigs
(study 275.13).  
<P>
In this study we are assessing the <i>in vitro</i> metabolic capacity of livers from
PST-treated animals.  Initially, propranolol and sulfadiazine are being
studied.  Use of the former will corroborate the <i>in vivo</i> data being obtained
under study 275.12.  Sulfadiazine was chosen as a model sulfonamide because it
undergoes ring hydroxylation in addition to acetylation in swine. 
<P>
E.  Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :<P>
 
Additional collaborative studies to determine the effects of various factors,
such as environment, diet, disease, and immune response on DME activities in
poultry and swine will be conducted.  These studies will utilize <i>in vitro</i>
metabolism of classical substrates and approved drugs, such as sulfadimethoxine
or sulfadiazine, to evaluate those factors which effect drug disposition in
these animals.  The following studies are being considered: 
<P>
1.  Assess the effects of BST treatment on the disposition of therapeutic drugs
in both lactating cows and beef steers.<P>
 
2.  Assess the impact of different types of litter on hepatic DME activities in
pen-raised chicks and compare the results with chicks raised in brooders. 
<P>
3.  Determine if inoculating veal calves with ruminal contents will alter the
hepatic DME activity in calves on milk-replacer diets  &#177  fermentable substrates,
e.g. cellulose.<P>
 
4.  Evaluate hepatic and/or <i>in vivo</i> DME activities in animals used in
immunotoxicological studies.<P>

A.  Title :<P>
Method Development for Drugs in Edible Animal Tissues and Feeds.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The overall objective of this program is to provide the Agency, USDA, and the
states with regulatory methods for all drugs whose use may result in residues
in edible tissues or contamination of animal feeds.  Methodology is selected
and refined based on regulatory needs.  Whenever possible, proven separation
and detection systems are chosen to maximize reliability.  However, when a
drug's chemistry does not lend itself to conventional analysis, we select from
novel or new techniques that have potential as regulatory tools.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
Division of Residue Chemistry (DRC) chemists completed a number of method
development studies in FY 94.  A determinative procedure for residues of
trichlorfon and dichlorvos in shrimp was developed using capillary gas
chromatography with cool on-column injection and nitrogen-phosphorus detection.
Previously, residues of trichlorfon in food products were difficult to detect
directly because of thermal lability.  Using published serum methods as
starting points, DRC scientists developed determinative procedures for residues
of pirlimycin and tilmicosin in milk.  The former uses precolumn derivatization
with FMOC reagent and ultraviolet detection (UV).  Since the official procedure
uses liquid chromatography-thermospray mass spectrometry, the new procedure
will provide many more labs the ability to monitor for pirlimycin.  The
tilmicosin procedure is also a simple LC-UV approach and will allow for
monitoring of extra-label use of this drug in dairy cows.<P>
In FY 94, procedures to address two very difficult analytical problems were
completed.  A confirmatory procedure for sulfonamides in milk using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry and positive chemical ionization was
completed.  This procedure can confirm the identity of eight drugs at 10 ppb
while meeting Agency criteria for MS procedures. A procedure for determining
spectinomycin in milk using LC and electrochemical detection was validated from
100 ppb to 800 ppb.<P>
A critical step prior to beginning method development is the identification of
the marker residue.  The marker may be either the parent drug or a metabolite.
In the case of phenylbutazone, three metabolites were known in the horse.  A
published method was modified and the depletion of phenylbutazone from a dosed
cow was followed.  The principal component in milk was parent phenylbutazone
with small amounts of oxyphenbutazone and gamma-phenbutazone.  Subsequently,
serum and milk levels were monitored in a second dosed cow to estimate the
transfer coefficient from serum to milk.<P>
D.  Studies to be Continued in FY 95 :<P>
1.  Development of determinative and confirmatory procedures for tetracyclines
in milk (study 301.26).<P>
A confirmatory procedure utilizing the Carson metal chelate affinity cleanup,
additional solid phase extraction on a polymer support, and liquid
chromatography-particle beam mass spectrometry has been developed and reported.
CFSAN mass spectrometrists have suggested additional investigation of the use
of partial scan data for confirmation.  This work will be conducted after the
completion of the beta-lactam method evaluation.<P>
2.  Development of a confirmatory procedure for gentamicin in milk (study
301.27).<P>
The resumption of this study was delayed by several other studies.  We plan to
restart it early in FY 95.<P>
  3.  Development of a determinative procedure for corticosteroids in milk
(study 301.31).<P>
Due to the transfer of the study director to another CVM office, the extension
of the LC procedure for dexamethasone to other cortico-steroids has been
delayed.<P>
4.  Evaluation of three procedures for the determination of beta-lactams in
milk (study 301.36).  <P>
We expect to complete the initial evaluation of the Moats, Charm, and Petz
procedures by the end of FY 94.  At that time we will recommend either a)
adoption of one of these approaches, b) modification of one of these methods,
or c) development of a new approach.<P>
E.  Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :<P>
  1.  Development of a regulatory method for nitrofurans in milk.  <P>
Although use of nitrofurans in food animals is banned, misuse in dairy animals
for treatment of mastitis and uterine infections is suspected.  Nitrofurans
become bound residues in tissue.  The literature will be reviewed and the need
for additional studies for identifying a marker residue evaluated prior to
beginning method development.<P>
  2.  Development of a regulatory method for sulfonamides in eggs.<P>
These drugs have been identified as potential egg residues.  In cooperation
with G. Paulson, Agricultural Research Service, we plan to conduct a total
residue depletion study with (superscript   14)C-sulfamethazine.  If this indicates
transfer of the drug to eggs, we will characterize the residues and select a
marker for method development.<P>
  3.  Development of a regulatory method for streptomycin in fish.<P>
We selected this compound because the tolerance/safe level (0.5 ppm) is
established in terms of microbiologically active compound.  We plan a
cooperative effort with DAR to identify the microbiologically active moieties.
If successful, this will allow application of specific chemical methods to this
drug, as well as establish a model for other drugs of this type.<P>
  4.  Development of a method for the detection of barbiturates in pet food and
animal feed.<P>
Animals from humane shelters that are killed by injection of barbiturates are
often disposed of by rendering.  A method is required to ensure that
barbiturate residues are not present in products such as pet food, bone meal,
or rendered fat.  Barbiturates have been extensively analyzed by capillary gas
chromatography.  The difficulties in this case are detection limits and the
variable matrix effects that animal feeds present.<P>
  5.  Development of a confirmatory procedure for phenylbutazone in milk.<P>
To complete the regulatory method for this drug, a mass spectrometric
confirmatory procedure will be developed.<P>
6.  Development of a confirmatory procedure for sulfonamides in tissue.<P>
Currently there is an official confirmatory procedure for sulfamethazine only.
We plan to collaborate with R. Maxwell, ARS, on the combination of
supercritical fluid extraction with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.<P>
  7.  Development of a regulatory method for thiazide diuretics in milk.<P>
Because of a need to monitor furosemide in milk at 10 ppb, we were unable to
simultaneously include the three thiazides.  These will be determined in a
separate procedure that will build on information developed in study 301.28.<P>

A.  Title :<P>
Generation of Animal Tissues Containing Incurred Drug Residues in
Food-Producing Animals.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
This program supports the Center's initiatives for development and refinement
of analytical methods by providing incurred residues in tissues required in
establishing the validity of such methods.  This program also provides the
Center with information regarding concentrations and depletion kinetics of
residues in milk and tissues which may result from the extra-label use of
drugs.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
This program was initiated in FY 86 to supply drug-incurred tissues from
food-producing animals in support of the Center's initiative for development
and refinement of analytical methods.  Some work performed under this program
originated by way of requests made through the Office of Science, CVM as

A.  Title :<P>
Method Trials of Analytical Methods for Drugs in Animal Tissues, Fluids, and
Feeds.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The major goal of this program is to introduce into the laboratories of the
FDA, FSIS, and the states, analytical methods that meet all CVM criteria
necessary for satisfactory performance.  Methods selected for the trial process
include methods in NADA's methods developed by FSIS, ARS, FDA-ORA, and CVM, as
well as promising candidates from extramural researchers and the scientific
literature.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
In FY 94, we conducted five method trials of non-NADA residue methods.  These
were chloramphenicol in milk (DENVAS), malachite green in catfish (ADRC),
methylene blue in milk (ADRC), gentamicin in milk (DRC), and ceftiofur in milk
(DRC).  This first year effort meets our goal of five to six trials per year
for this program.  Because of a backlog of methods awaiting trial, OS asked the
other CVM offices for help in prioritizing these future trials.  We plan to
conduct trials in FY 95 for spectinomycin (milk), pirlimycin (milk), neomycin
(tissue), tilmicosin (milk), azaperone (tissue), and gentian violet (feed).<P>
We have taken several steps to streamline this method trial process.  The
Chief, Analytical Methods Branch, serves as the nexus for the overall program.
He acts as the key link between CVM, DFS/ORA, FSIS, contract laboratory
participants, and the sponsoring laboratory and coordinates their activities.
The DRC method trial study director serves as the technical liaison with the
sponsor and participants.  A major departure from the New Animal Drug
Application (NADA) method trial process is the use of direct, informal
communication between the DRC study director and the sponsor.  We eliminated
the slow, formal communications by memoranda through multiple organizations.
The process of developing a suitable method standard operating procedure is now
much more efficient.  Another innovation to improve the transfer of technology
is the use of videotape versions of the method to help trial participants
become familiar with the necessary techniques.  Because the above changes have
speeded the pre-laboratory phase of trials, the rate-limiting step is the
availability of laboratories to participate.  We hope the inclusion of contract
laboratories in the process will help break this bottleneck.<P>

Bioequivalence, Bioavailability, and Pharmacokinetics of Selected Antibacterial
Agents in Food-Producing Animals.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The objective of this program is to gather data from controlled studies on the
bioavailability, bioequivalence, and pharmacokinetics of selected antibacterial
drugs in plasma, milk, and target tissues in food-producing species.  The
acquired data is expected to provide information of utmost importance to CVM
for its decision making role in the proper use and adequate withdrawal time for
a variety of drugs.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
Although violative neomycin residues are still being detected in veal calves
there is relatively little scientific information available on the possible
absorption and disposition of neomycin, after oral administration to veal
calves (1-5).  Results from two recently published preliminary studies (2,3)
strongly suggest that absorption of neomycin does occur after oral
administration of the drug to calves.  The capability of neonatal calves to
absorb large molecules, such as immunoglobulins, antibodies, and vitamins from
colostrum is well documented (4).  However, the ability to absorb
immunoglobulins lasts only 24 to 48 hours post-parturition.  The implication
from this physiologic phenomenon is that a drug which is poorly absorbed in
adult ruminants may be absorbed to a greater extent in neonatal calves.
Antibiotics, including neomycin are often fed to veal calves in milk replacers.
Therefore, the possibility of increased residues does seem to exist.  These
issues are being addressed in study 314.04.<P>
The expiration of patents on many of the proprietary drugs used both in human
and veterinary medicine has permitted the marketing of generally less expensive
generic equivalents (6).  However, the capability of some generic drugs in
providing an equal degree of safety and efficacy as the original or pioneer
product has been questioned.  Data available from human patients indicate that
differences detected in their safety and efficacy are generally related to
variations in the rate and extent of their absorption.  In domestic animals,
however, these data are not complete since bioavailability studies on
veterinary products have only been undertaken in the last 15 years (6).  The
assurance that the safety and efficacy of the generic product are the same as
that of the pioneer drug is a must for the proper clinical use of the product
by veterinary practitioners (6). <br>
 <br>
The decision of CVM to fully support the undertaking of bioequivalence studies
and eventually develop a data base file is of utmost importance to the goals of
the generic industry.  Results from scientifically conducted studies might very
well provide the needed basis to allow extrapolation of bioequivalence studies
from one species to another.  Such a finding would substantially decrease the
time, the expected high cost, and the large number of animals needed to achieve
the same objectives through the continuous conduction of these studies in
multiple species.  These issues will be addressed by study 314.05.  <P>
There is essentially no data available which confirms that the pharmacokinetics
and metabolism of drugs in cattle do not differ significantly due to
physiologic stage or gender.  The physiologic changes that occur during
lactation (i.e., increased size of the liver and gastro-intestinal tract
tissue; increased blood volume) may affect the metabolism and disposition of
drugs.  This may result in different levels of residues and withdrawal periods
for a drug depending on the stage of lactation, dry period, or purpose of the
animal (beef versus dairy), which may impact on human food safety.  These
issues will be addressed by study 314.07.<P>

A.  Title :<P>
Deposition of Drug Residues and Contaminants into the Eggs of Laying Hens.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The objectives of this program are to:  a) gather data from controlled studies
on the deposition of animal drugs in eggs from laying hens and b) develop a
model which would predict the extent and elimination of animal drug residues
from eggs.  This work addresses the Center's mission by providing a scientific
basis for identifying and eliminating residues in the human food supply.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
It has been established that the legal, illegal, or extra-label use of animal
drugs for production or therapeutic reasons may produce drug residues in eggs
(1-3).  Unfortunately, there is a paucity of scientific information on the
quantity and duration of drug residues in eggs used for human consumption.  To
provide data for sound scientific decisions by CVM on drug residues, we have
developed a research program to evaluate the mechanisms of drug incursion in
eggs.  <P>
This laboratory was the first to report hens fed organic arsenicals can exceed
the FDA established tolerance (500 ppb elemental arsenic) for arsenic in whole,
edible eggs (1).  It is apparent these residues are preferentially deposited in
the yolk and may pose human food safety risks especially when yolks are
separated for use in further processed foods.  These data have been requested
by USDA/AMS for evaluation of arsenic testing in eggs used for human
consumption.  Furthermore, we have participated in a collaborative effort with
ORA/Denver to validate an analytical method and identify halofuginone transfer
into eggs (study 317.05).<P>
Recent efforts have produced a theoretical model which predicts the pattern of
drug residue incursion in eggs (studies 317.04 and 317.06).  Depletion kinetics
and establishment of residue patterns for both yolk and albumen identify drugs
with the greatest human food-safety risk potential.  Development of egg residue
models permits:  a) the ability to predict the elimination of kinetics for a
variety of drugs and b) identification of drugs with the greatest potential for
residue incursion.  <P>

A.  Title:<P>
Immunomodulation by Drugs and Chemicals Used in Food-Producing Animals.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The purpose of this program is to obtain information concerning the
interactions of xenobiotics and environmental factors with the immune system.
The complex interactions of environmental factors (e.g., diet, sanitation,
environmental toxicants), together with drugs commonly used in animal
husbandry/veterinary medicine, can modulate the normal homeostasis of the
immune system.  Perturbation of the immune system has been shown to induce
stress or inflammation.  This results in the production of mediators, which
affect growth and other physiological parameters.<P>
Production of mediators, especially cytokines, has been shown in rodent models
and man to affect drug metabolism.  Thus, induction of stress or inflammation
can potentially lead to decreases in growth and altered pharmacokinetics.
Results from this program will aid the mission of the Agency of assuring a safe
food supply by identifying factors affecting animal health and human food
safety.<P>
C.  Background:<P>
The initial studies of this program (1,2) focused on the effects of
oxytetracycline (OTC) on the immune system of mice and cattle (study 318.01)
and the effects of cholesterol and fish oil on the immune system of miniature
swine (study 318.02).  Results from study 318.01 demonstrated that rapidly
proliferating immune cells, such as lymphocytes, were inhibited at high
therapeutic levels of OTC, whereas nonproliferating cells, such as neutrophils
and macrophages, were only affected by supra-pharmacologic levels of OTC.
Study 318.02 was a collaboration with the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition (CFSAN).  This effort was part of a major CFSAN study examining the
toxicity of cholesterol and fish oil in miniature swine.<P>
Recent efforts (3,4) have examined the potential for production drugs such as
growth hormone and chromium to affect immune homeostasis in domestic animals
(studies 318.03 and 318.05).  Growth hormone (GH) affects numerous aspects of
immunity (5-7), including production of tumor necrosis factor following <i>in vivo</i>
administration of bacterial-derived endotoxin (8,9).  <br>
Study 318.03 demonstrated that <i>in vivo</i> treatment with PST alone had no
significant effect on production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin-6
(IL-6) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  Chromium treatment
resulted in an elevated level of IL-2 by PBMC.  The combination of PST and
chromium treatment abrogated the effect of chromium alone to enhance IL-2
production, while diminishing the production of IL-6.  Swine treated with
chromium exhibited enhanced production of IL-6 following endotoxin challenge as
compared to all other groups.<P>
D.  Studies to be Continued in FY 95 :<P>
  1.  Effect of chromium on production of interleukin-2 in swine lymphocytes
(study 318.07).<P>
This study will determine if previously observed changes (study 318.03) in IL-2
production following exposure to chromium are a direct or indirect effect.
This study is a collaboration with Dr. Norman Steele, USDA/ARS. <br>
  2.  Development of non-lethal porcine host defense models (study 318.12).<P>
The results from studies 318.03, 318.06, and 318.08 demonstrated a need for
host-defense model system(s) in food producing animals.  Most host defense
models employed in biomedical research use death as the end-point, which is not
an appropriate determinant for food-producing animals.<br>
 <br>
Some potential parameters that may be measured include pathogen number(s),
immune cell infiltration, type and numbers, cytokine and free radical
production, and select serum components.  This may involve the use of molecular
techniques to assess cytokine production because there are no available assays
for certain cytokines.  The results from studies 318.06 and 318.08 will assist
in selecting factors to be examined.<P>
E.  Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :<P>
1.  Further characterization of the endotoxin challenge model in swine.<P>
The endotoxin challenge model is an accepted model for bacterial infections in
human medicine.  Results from studies 318.03, 318.06, and 318.08 have
characterized the alteration of several immunological and physiological
parameters in swine following endotoxin challenge.  This study will examine
changes in three components, production of neopterin, nitrite/nitrate levels,
and lymphocyte cell surface markers.  These markers are currently used by CBER,
CDER, and CDC.<P>
This study will be a collaboration with Dr. Joan Lunney, USDA/ARS.<P>
2.  Effect of antimicrobial administration on biomarker levels during an
experimental infection.<P>
Current delineators of infection in food producing animals rely on subjective
criteria.  The development of suitable biomarkers would provide objective,
quantifiable measures of the extent of infection and efficacy of therapeutic
intervention. This study will be initiated after development of infectivity
models and identification of additional biomarkers.<P>

A.  Title :<P>
Evaluation of Screening Assays for Animal Drug Residues in Milk.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The objective of this program is to obtain information on the performance
characteristics of commercially available screening assays for animal drug
residues in milk.  Data collected will define the lowest level of residues that
can be reliably detected by the assay.  The test's performance will be
evaluated using milk from various parts of the country, frozen milk, and milk
contaminated with high levels of bacteria or somatic cells.  Cross reactivity
in the assay of drug metabolites and other animal drugs will be determined and
critical parameters of the test procedure will be identified.<P>
Information obtained on the performance of each assay evaluated will be made
available to the public with the objective of encouraging use of reliable
assays by milk producers, state milk agencies, and others.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
We conducted studies in two principal areas in FY 94.  The first area, and one
that is expected to continue, is label claim verification.  It derives from
FDA's post-marketing authority for animal diagnostic devices.  In study 319.06,
we examined the performance of three tests:  the Idexx Cite-Probe, the Editek
chloramphenicol E-Z Screen, and the Idexx Snap test for beta-lactams.  The
Cite-Probe's performance, originally examined in study 319.02, was revisited
because of conflicting performance in various laboratories.  Our latest results
were similar to the earlier OSB work.  We found that the heated or
45(superscript   o)C version of the Cite-Probe test failed to meet selectivity
criteria and the room temperature version did not have sufficient sensitivity
to detect ampicillin residues at 10 ppm.  CFSAN's Milk Quality Assurance Branch
reported a lack of sensitivity for the Editek E-Z screen by state milk
laboratories.  In study 319.01, we found the sensitivity to exceed the needed 1
ppb.  However, when we returned to this test in study 319.06, the sensitivity
no longer met the label claim.  The results of this work led the firm to
reexamine its manufacturing and quality assurance programs.  Similarly FDA
became concerned that the Idexx Snap test was no longer meeting its label claim
for amoxicillin sensitivity (10 ppb).  Two of four lots tested failed to detect
amoxicillin at the 10 ppb level with 90 percent sensitivity (.95 C.L.).<br>
FDA is also concerned about the comparative performance of screening tests and
official determinative assays.  Beyond the well-known class wide cumulative
response of most screening assays is the concern that for a given drug the two
tests may detect different markers of that drug.  The quantitative ability of
screening test kits is limited and sometimes extremely variable.  In spite of
these shortcomings, a recent study compared the quantitation of spectinomycin
in the milk of a cow which had been dosed systemically and also by the
intramammary route.  A reasonable correlation was found between the milk level
of spectinomycin obtained by the Charm II assay and the levels determined by an
LC procedure using electrochemical detection.<P>

1.  Verification of label claims.<P>
We plan to investigate screening test performance problems when requested by
the Office of Surveillance and Compliance or CFSAN.<P>
2.  Characterization of quantitative screening tests.<P>
A number of screening tests rely on instrumental readings.  The precision and
accuracy of these devices will be measured to assess their utility for
determinative assays or research purposes such as pharmacokinetic studies.<P>
3.  Investigation of the additive effect.<P>
It is well known that many screening tests react to members of a particular
drug class with differing response factors.  The quantitative nature of this
interaction has not been well studied and needs complete characterization.<P>
4.  Comparison of screening tests to determinative procedures.<P>
We plan to continue the comparisons first examined in study 319.05 whenever a
commercial screening test exists for a newly developed determinative

 INTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAM

<br>
      Program:  321<br>
      HFV:  520<P>
A.  Title :<P>
Microbiology of the Animal Environment and its Effects on Food Product
Sanitation.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The purpose of this program of research is to investigate aspects of
microbiology associated with the production of food producing animals and
specifically to address problems which may be associated with the
microbiological quality of human foods derived from them.  Current activity is
oriented toward investigation of factors related to the ecology of <i>Salmonella</i>e
occurrence in poultry feeds and methods for use in recovering these organisms
from feed.  Specifically, the following objectives address current research
interests:<P>
1.  Investigate the viability of various <i>Salmonella</i> serotypes in feed.<P>
2.  Evaluate research methods for artificially contaminating feed.<P>
3.  Assess microbiological procedures for evaluating effectiveness of
<i>Salmonella</i> control agents in feed.<P>
4.  Assess the effectiveness of various methods for their ability to recover
<i>Salmonella</i>e from feed.<P>
C.  Background :<P>
Salmonellosis in humans is classified as a reportable disease by the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC).  This reporting system and three additional systems
(National <i>Salmonella</i> Surveillance System, Food Outbreak Surveillance System,
and Sentinel County Survey) provide data that are used by the CDC to describe
the epidemiology of salmonellosis.  These data systems have continued to
indicate increases in the incidence of this food-bourne disease.  The Centers
for Disease Control received reports of 48,154 cases of human salmonellosis in
1991.  This number is estimated to represent only 5% of total cases.  The
majority of reported cases resulted from consumption of foods of animal origin.
Common vectors of salmonellosis in man are beef, poultry, eggs, and dairy
products.  Animal feed is not considered a direct vector for salmonellosis in
humans; however, FDA recognizes that animal feed poses a potential means for
<i>Salmonella</i> to spread from feed to animals to the consumer.  Therefore, FDA
considers feed or feed components containing <i>Salmonella</i>e to be adulterated.<P>
Since CVM is responsible for protecting the animal feed supply and assuring its
safety, the Center has provided a goal of reducing <i>Salmonella</i>e in feed and feed
ingredients to as close to zero as possible.  Obviously, achieving this goal
and providing a working definition of "zero" will be impacted by various
factors such as sensitivity of methods used to recover the organism, sampling
schemes used in screening feeds, viability of the organism in complete feeds,
and effectiveness of various processes and treatments to reduce and control
these microbes in feed commodities.  The research conducted in this program
will address some of these issues.<P>
D.  Studies to be Continued in FY 95:<P>
None<P>
E.  Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :<P>
1.  Evaluate the effects that specific feed matrices have on the viability of
<i>Salmonella</i> serotypes that have been associated with contaminated feed and food
producing animals.<P>
The objective of this study is to determine if <i>Salmonella</i> serotypes have
different survival characteristics in different commodities and complete feed.
This is of interest because some <i>Salmonella</i> serotypes such as S. enteritidis
are not often reported as being recovered from poultry feed.  This is also
important in order to develop a method for evaluating <i>Salmonella</i>e control
techniques for feed.<P>
2.  Assess methods for producing contaminated feed for their ability to produce
feed that contains the target organism at concentrations that will allow
evaluation of <i>Salmonella</i>e detection methods and to evaluate effectiveness of
<i>Salmonella</i>e control procedures in feed.<P>
Methods of artificially producing contaminated feed include:  a) direct
application of a growing bacterial culture suspension, b) application of a
lyophilized suspension of bacteria to feed, and c) application of a
chalk-bacterial mixture to feed.<P>
The death rate of the target organism and the stability of its identification
profile will be used to evaluate the procedures.<br>
3.  Assess the utility of recently developed selective plating media to recover
<i>Salmonella</i>e from feed and feed commodities.<P>
The objective of this work will be to incorporate various new plating media and
cultural procedures into <i>Salmonella</i> identification schemes for use in feed and
feed matrices.  This work will attempt to provide sensitive and rapid methods
for use in feed and for use in research to investigate <i>Salmonella</i> control
procedure in feed.<P>

      Program:  322<br>
      HFV:  520<P>
A.  Title :<P>
Deposition of Feed Additives, Drugs, and Contaminants into the Milk of
Lactating Dairy Cows.<P>
B.  Objectives :<P>
The objectives of this program are to determine the amount of transfer of feed
additives, drugs and contaminants into milk and the factors affecting the
extent of transfer.  These data will provide pertinent information to be used
by CVM to support its responsibility of assuring human food safety. <P>
C.  Background :<P>
Resolution of food safety issues associated with contaminants in milk is
extremely important to the mission of CVM.  Information on the source, amounts,
and factors affecting contaminants in milk is necessary in order to develop
programs for the elimination of these contaminants in milk.  <P>
One contaminant of milk that has been identified is antibiotic residues
following therapeutic treatment (1).  Changes in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance
(PMO) required that, after January 1, 1992, each bulk milk tanker be tested for
residues of beta-lactam antibiotics.  The CVM, in cooperation with AOAC
Research Institute and A. D. Little, evaluated screening assays for detection
of beta-lactam residues in bulk tank/tanker milk.<P>
Several milk antibiotic residue rapid screening tests have been adapted for use
in detecting antibiotic residues in milk from individual animals.  These test
kits are termed "cowside" milk tests when they are to be used with milk from an
individual cow.  Reports in the literature have raised questions concerning the
validity of these tests for cowside use (2,3).  Cullor (2) has reported a high
rate of false positive results when using certain tests for milk from
individual cows.  A false positive indicates the presence of an antibiotic in
milk from untreated cows; therefore, the milk would be discarded even though it
is legal to sell and this would be a loss to the producer.  In Cullor's
studies, however, samples for analysis are taken from the foremilk, which
typically contains a higher concentration of somatic cells than total milk
collected (4, 5) and high somatic cell counts have been implicated as affecting
the outcome of the test kits (2).  A sample taken from the total milk produced
from a particular milking (a sample of composite milk) would be more
appropriate for detecting the presence of violative antibiotic residues, since
the composite milk represents the product that would be added to the bulk tank
and concentration of milk components due to the fraction of milk collected
would not be a factor.  In a study conducted at FDA, the selectivity rates
(defined as the percent of truly negative samples that are found by the assay
to be negative) of seven screening assays were evaluated with individual cow
milk collected from the weigh jar (6).  Except for one screening assay, the
selectivity rate for all assays was above 90%.  In order to further evaluate
the selectivity rates, the performance of the screening assays should be
evaluated comparing milk sampled from foremilk to milk sampled from total
composite milk.   <P>
Metabolic changes occur in the disease state that will affect the composition
and quality of the milk produced.  Mastitis would be the major disease
condition for which antibiotic treatment would be used and after which, milk
screening assays would be employed.  Somatic cell counts increase in milk
during mastitis and also components of plasma (i.e., bovine serum albumin,
immunoglobulin) are found in higher concentrations in mastitic milk compared to
normal milk (7) due to the inflammatory response.  Several components in
mastitic milk have been implicated as interferants in the various antibiotic
residue milk test methods.  Components that have been shown to affect the
results of some of the tests are somatic cells, lactoferrin, lysozyme,
microbes, and free fatty acids (8,9).  Depending upon the analytical principle
of the test, these components may have a major impact on the outcome of the
test, especially since these tests are to be used when an animal is recovering
from a health related condition and the milk may still contain these components
in relatively high concentrations.  <P>
D.  Studies to be Continued in FY 95 :<P>
1.  The effects of method of sampling and length of sample storage on the
outcome of rapid screening tests for milk from individual cows (study
322.02).<P>
The objectives of this study are to compare the selectivity rate of selected
screening assays using milk sampled from total composite milk to milk sampled
from quarter composite foremilk from individual cows and to determine if the
performance of the screening assays is affected by the length of storage of the
milk sample.<P>
E.  Studies to be Initiated in FY 95 :<P>
1.  Effect of mammary infection status on the performance of antibiotic
screening assays for milk from individual cows.<P>
The objective of this study is to determine if the performance of selected
screening assays is affected by secretions in milk from cows that are
recovering from naturally occurring mastitis subsequent to antibiotic
treatment.<P>
2.  Effect of udder inflammation on the milk discard period for commonly used
mastitis therapeutic treatments.<P>
3.  Comparison of chemical and microbiological methods for quantitation and
detection of cephapirin residues in milk.<P>
4.  Interaction of therapeutic treatments on clearance rate of antibiotics from
milk.<P>

antibiotics used for the treatment of mastitis. <P>

Environmental considerations.<p> 
Footnotes:<br>
1.Priority is based on human food safety and extent of known use in the
industry.<br>
2. Marker residue is the residue which will be monitored in the animal.  The
marker residue is a residue whose concentration is in a known relationship to
the concentration of the total residue in the last tissue to deplete to its
permitted concentration.  The marker residue can be the parent drug or any of
its metabolites.  The sensitivity listed is the target concentration for method
development.<br>
3. Method development is needed for this approved drug because of poor or
nonexistent approved method and extensive use in species for which the drug is
not approved.<br>
4 .Metabolism means that a metabolism and total residue depletion study need to
be completed.<br>
5. Multiresidue method is for determining flumequine, nalidixic, oxolinic, and
piromidic acid residue in catfish.  Method has been sent to DFS for method
trial collaboration.<br>
6. Multiresidue confirmatory method by GC/MS is for oxolinic acid, flumequine,
and nalidixic acid in catfish. <br>
NOTE: Method trial may not be necessary, depending on the outcome of the
validation results.  Method to be developed is for edible tissue.  For all fish
except catfish, the edible tissue is muscle plus adhering skin.  For catfish,
the edible tissue is  just muscle.<p>

<a name="RTFToC1">PREFACE</a></b>
<h3>Office of S&amp;C Annual Report FY 94</h3>
<P>
<hr>
<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine is composed of four Office organizations.
These are Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation, Office of Surveillance and
Compliance, Office of Science, and Office of Management.<P>
This is the fiscal year Annual Report of the Office of Surveillance and
Compliance (OS&amp;C).<P>
The OS&amp;C is a scientific law enforcement organization.  In its mission
within the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the OS&amp;C helps ensure animal
health and the safety of the food derived from animals.  We also help enable
the marketing of effective animal drugs, food additives, feed ingredients, and
animal devices that are safe to animals, humans, and the environment.  We
remove from the market products which have been determined to be unsafe or
ineffective under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
We accomplish our mission by working in partnership with Federal and State
agencies and by seeking the assistance of other Center customers. 
<b><P>
<a name="RTFToC2">STRATEGIC
PLANNING
</a></b>
<p>
Under the recently appointed leadership of Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, CVM has
begun work to develop a Strategic Plan.  The process was initiated in June 1994
and is continuing in 1995. The goal of this effort in OS&amp;C is to orient
ourselves into a more mission driven organization.  Our central mission is to
ensure the safety of the food supply by eliminating violative drug residues and
taking actions which encourage the increased availability of approved new
animal drugs.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC3">SCREENING
TESTS EVALUATION AND LABELING
</a></b>
<P>
The Office of Science in CVM has evaluated beta-lactam drug residue screening
tests for assay of residues in bulk commingled raw milk.  Other organizations
have participated in beta-lactam evaluations and in evaluations for assay of
non-beta-lactam residues as well.  Currently 15 beta-lactam screening tests
have been recommended to the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments
(NCIMS) for use by States and the milk industry.<P>
Drug residue screening tests are considered to be animal devices under the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).  The authority to regulate these
products is limited to post-marketing analysis of the labeling which must not
be false or misleading in any particular and must include adequate directions
for use. Devices which fail those requirements are deemed to be misbranded.<P>
In February 1994, OS&amp;C sent each manufacturer of the 15 beta-lactam
screening test kits a letter outlining these requirements and offering guidance
on complying with the FFDCA.<P>
This regulation of the drug residue milk screening tests ensures the use of
tests which meet a common standard and consistent detection of milk which
violates FDA established tolerances. Beta-lactam violative milk is thereby
prevented from reaching the consumer.  The industry has largely been in
compliance with this guidance.  
<b><P>
<a name="RTFToC4">HEARING
BEFORE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE
</a></b>
<P>
On September 28, 1994, the CVM testified before the Honorable Edolphus Towns,
Chairman of Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee, House
Committee on Government Operations. This Hearing marked the end of a two-year
General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation of the USDA/FSIS National Residue
Program (NRP).  FDA through the OS&amp;C and Field is responsible for
enforcement actions dealing with the violative drug residues which are
identified in the NRP.<P>
Under the NRP, FSIS reports violative drug residue findings to FDA for
follow-up on-farm investigations.  These investigations are carried out by FDA
Field personnel or by State officials following guidance that is issued by FDA.
The program has suffered lack of resources and the GAO reported that FDA had,
between 1989 and 1992, followed up on only 20% of 21,439 violations.<P>
GAO recommended that, while improvements could be made to FDA and USDA areas of
the program, fundamental changes should be considered.  The changes proposed by
GAO include greater use of industry-operated risk based assessments and FSIS
oversight to monitor the effectiveness of the program.  With this
recommendation, GAO endorsed use of HACCP in the meat industry and encouraged
Congress to provide FSIS with additional authority to access industry records
and for enforcement.<P>
While we can agree that improvements are possible, we note that violative
residues in meat have been declining in recent years, most of the producer
groups have implemented quality assurance programs, and FDA enforcement actions
are increasing.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC5">HAZARD
ANALYSIS CRITICAL CONTROL POINTS (HACCP)
</a></b>
<P>
HACCP is the name applied to this comprehensive food safety assurance program
for domestic or imported foods.  The OS&amp;C has contributed to FDA and USDA
HACCP initiatives during FY 1994.  In view of the possibility of a decline in
Federal and State resources, the Federal Government has examined alternatives
to traditional inspectional strategies and to ways of increasing the level of
food safety protection for the public.  These initiatives relate primarily to
means which might reduce the incidence of illness caused by food-borne
pathogens but the concept applies equally to chemical residues and physical
hazards.  The OS&amp;C interest relates to six human pathogens which might also
be found in the feed of food-producing animals, and to violative drug residues
in the edible tissues or other products of food-producing animals.<P>
On January 28, 1994, FDA published a proposed final rule to establish
procedures for the safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products.
OS&amp;C is involved in this proposal because of drug use and feed issues in
domestic aquaculture.  The comment period closed on May 29 and the comments are
being evaluated.<P>
On August 4, 1994, FDA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule (ANPR).
The comment period closed on December 2, 1994. Except for food regulated under
the Meat Inspection Act and Poultry and Poultry Products Inspection Act this
ANPR applies to all other landfood, as opposed to seafood.  The same August 4,
FEDERAL REGISTER carried an invitation to the food industry to participate in a
HACCP Pilot Program.  Letters of interest were requested by October 3, 1994.
The OS&amp;C is willing to work with a feed, rendering, or livestock
organization to begin the work of defining HACCP for a member of these
industries.  Several firms in the feed, rendering, or animal growing industries
are voluntarily evaluating the application of HACCP in their organizations.<P>
The Animal Protein Products Industry (APPI) has a "Hot Spot" salmonella control
program that is followed with beneficial results by many of the APPI
members.<P>
The feed industry, represented by the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA)
and the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA), has developed quality
assurance plans and is training personnel in the firms of member companies on
the prevention of hazards.<P>
OS&amp;C has participated in USDA/APHIS and FSIS considerations of HACCP.
Reports of the USDA deliberations are released to the public by USDA.<P>
The U.S. Animal Health Association (USAHA) and its Feed Safety Committee have
been very active in deliberations about HACCP.  In particular, since 1991,
USAHA has published Best Management Practices for:  <P>
"Salmonella Risk Reduction:  Integrated Guidelines for Table Egg Producers"<br>
"Salmonella Risk Reduction in Broilers"<br>
"Salmonella Risk Reduction in Turkeys"<P>
In 1990, CVM asked the USAHA to serve as the key scientific/regulatory forum
for Federal/State/Producer discussions of research findings and industry
experiences in the reduction of salmonella contamination in animal feeds.  The
results of this partnership have been highly successful in total and we want to
thank the individuals who serve as chairmen and group leaders for their
valuable contributions to the current success.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC6">CHANGING
MARKET DYNAMICS
</a></b><P>
Mergers or acquisitions among firms in the animal drug industry have been the
subject of seven (7) news releases in the March 1994 to January 1995 period.
While this period does not correspond with the FDA October-September fiscal
year which applies to much of the other information in this report, we feel it
is noteworthy because of the unusually large number of label changes induced by
this business activity.<P>
More than 300 products or 23% of the NADA approved and commercially available
products have been affected.  This is based on 1,429 NADA approvals excluding
products sizes and Type A Medicated articles.<P><b>
<a name="RTFToC7">EPIDEMIOLOGY
INITIATIVES
</a></b><P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC8">TRIMS
Reprogramming
</a></b>
<P>
We proceeded with a plan initiated in late FY93 to reprogram the Tissue Residue
Information Management System (TRIMS) data base and link it directly with
FSIS's Residue Violation Information System (RVIS) data base.  This conversion
of the TRIMS data base will speed the processing and increase the accuracy of
the information.  Also, establishment of this linkage potentially places the
Center in an excellent position for obtaining and analyzing data to address
pre-harvest considerations of food safety, an emerging public health issue, as
well as the traditional inspection processes.<P>
The contract for the reprogramming of the TRIMS data base was awarded to USDA's
Office of Information Resources Management's National Computer Center (NCC).
This group is developing an interactive version of the TRIMS data base using
the ORACLE DBMS which will run on the NCC Kansas City IBM.  The TRIMS upgraded
data base will be placed into the RVIS data base as distinct tables with a
distinct level of user access.  This can be done because both data bases share
common data and TRIMS data is derived from an extension of the National Residue
Program that is currently in operation.<P>
The TRIMS conversion offers significant efficiencies to FDA processes.  The
redesigned data base will eliminate current repetitive data acquisition steps
required by the independent data bases and will provide greater efficiencies in
queries, reports, and program tracking for FDA's compliance program 7371.006,
"Illegal Drug Residues in Meat and Poultry."  The conversion will also benefit
FSIS through FDA's ability to gather, store and analyze on-farm inspection data
more efficiently.<P>
By late September 1994, the first stage of the reprogrammed TRIMS was available
through the RVIS data base.  A training module on accessing TRIMS and printing
the revised data collection document was included in the September RVIS
training sessions at Fort Collins, Colorado.  Since October 1, 1994, Tissue
Residue Monitors are now able to print the revised document for FSIS samples
collected during FY95.  The document print function allows selection of a
specific sample identification number with linkage of up to five others with
remote printing of the associated historical data from RVIS.  The Tissue
Residue Branch will continue to provide full data entry services and all
Establishment Inspection Reports (EIRs) will continue to be submitted as
specified in the compliance program.  The TRIMS programming is expected to be
completed in FY 95.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC9">Tissue
Residues of Veterinary Drugs
</a></b>
<P>
Several analyses were performed on the TRIMS and RVIS data on drug residues in
food-producing animals for presentation to various audiences including the
Eleventh International Symposium of the World Association of Veterinary Food
Hygienists, the American Society of Animal Science Regulatory Agencies
Committee, the Ninth Annual Sunbelt Conference of Food Animal Educators, the
FDA-FSIS Southwest Regional Residue Meeting, the Pacific Regional Residue
Meeting, the Subcommittee on Drug Use in Food Animals, Board of Agriculture,
National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, and the AVMA Annual
Meeting.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC10">Analysis
of FY 93 Tissue Residue Data [1]</a>
 </b><P>
<B>[1]</B> This analysis was conducted on data from FY 93.
<P>
Under the Meat and Poultry Inspection Act, USDA's Food Safety Inspection
Service (FSIS) performs inspections of animals offered for slaughter for human
food.  As part of their inspection program, FSIS may collect samples of edible
tissues from animals to be analyzed for chemical contaminants, as well as for
other adulterants.  When FSIS finds levels of drugs or pesticides in edible
animal tissues which are above the tolerances that are set by FDA or the
Environmental Protection Agency, FDA is notified so that enforcement action can
be considered.  Based on a number of criteria which include the toxicity of the
chemical, the level found, permitted uses of the chemical, and manpower
availability, FDA or a State may conduct follow-up investigation to determine
the responsible individuals, prevent future occurrences of residues by that
person, provide official warning of the violation, and take necessary
enforcement actions.<P>
During Fiscal Year 93, FSIS reported 3,809 animals containing violative
residues.  FDA, in cooperation with participating States, followed up on 1,207
(approximately 32 percent) of the reported violations.<P>
We reviewed 1,207 FY 93 Establishment Inspection Reports (EIR's) containing
data captured during Field investigations conducted by FDA/CVM and State
officials and 1,256 records on extra-label drug use.  The principal findings
are outlined below.<P>
The drugs most frequently identified as causing antibiotic residues included:
penicillin (20 percent), streptomycin (10 percent), oxytetracycline  (10
percent), sulfamethazine (9 percent), tetracycline (4 percent), gentamicin (4
percent), and neomycin (3 percent).  Sulfamethazine was the most frequently
cited sulfonamide.  Thirty-five percent of the reported violative residues were
Calf Antibiotic and Sulfonamide Test (CAST) positive samples (see Table 1).<P>
In Fiscal Year 1993, the animal slaughter classes most often associated with
residues were culled dairy cows, veal calves (neonatal), and market hogs (see
Table II).   Residues associated with injectable drugs were investigated most
frequently.  lnjectable drugs accounted for approximately 46 percent of the
violations.  This was followed by the oral route (feed, water, and bolus) and
the intramammary infusion route (see Table III). Most of the drugs that caused
the residues were purchased from a feed/farm supply store or veterinarian.
They accounted for 31 percent and 26 percent of the drug purchases
respectively.<P>
The primary cause of residue violations was failure to adhere to the approved
withdrawal time.  Other causes included failure to keep proper animal
identification and treatment records and extra-label use/exceeding recommended
dosage.  The feeding of colostrum containing drug residues to bob veal was also
viewed as a possible risk factor in causing residue violations (see Table IV).
Veterinarians contributed to 3 percent of the violative residues via
extra-label use compared with 9 percent by the producer.  The failure of
producers to adhere to the withdrawal period recommended by the veterinarian
accounted for 2 percent of the primary causes of residue violations.<P>
The total number of residues has decreased each year since 1990. There have
been no major changes in the drug classes, slaughter classes, and drug use
patterns which have contributed to violative residues.  Ignoring labeled
withdrawal times continues to be a major source of drug residue violations.<P>

Monthly Interagency Residue Control Group (IRCG) meetings were very productive
this fiscal year.  Important highlights include discussions on electronic
identification implants involving representatives from Destron/IDI and Texas
Instruments as well as the usual IRCG participants; clenbuterol issues ranging
from illegal usage and residues to methodology, and arranging transfer of
technical expertise between FSIS and CVM personnel on the retinal epithelium

<a name="RTFToC12">Epidemiology
Training Program
</a></b>
<P>
Late in FY94, CVM was accepted for a preceptorship slot in the Public Health
Service (PHS) Epidemiology Training Program.  The purpose of this training
program, which began in 1979, is to attract medical professionals into the
field of epidemiology. This field has been identified as a manpower shortage
area for the future.  Recognizing this need, the PHS established a mechanism
for a small number of positions for the support of postdoctoral trainees, each
of whom is accepted for a three-year period of service.<P>
The first year of the program is an academic year, intended to enable the
fellows to acquire a broad educational background in epidemiology and
biostatistics, usually leading to the Masters of Public Health degree.  The
last two years of the program (the preceptorship) are expected to enable the
fellows to obtain experience in the practice of epidemiology and to enrich
their appreciation of its theoretical aspects as the basic science of
prevention.  The preceptor is required, at a minimum, to help the fellow plan
and conduct epidemiology studies, collect and analyze epidemiology data, and
prepare scientific papers and presentations.  FDA has established the
Epidemiology Training Program in the Commissioner's Office, such that the FTE
and the salary and training costs are currently from Office of the Commissioner
funds.<P>
CVM preceptors include representatives from OS&amp;C, and the Divisions of
Biometrics and Production Drugs in the Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation.
The CVM trainee will have the opportunity to participate in monitoring the
prevalence of residues in food animal tissues to ensure that consumers are not
exposed to unsafe levels of veterinary drugs and chemicals; analyzing
epidemiological data from follow-up investigations of illegal residues of
veterinary drugs in meat and poultry; analyzing data obtained from surveillance
systems designed to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria of food animals;
coordinating and disseminating information obtained from the Contaminant
Response System, a nationwide surveillance system designed to minimize exposure
from contaminants in animal feeds and other veterinary products; reviewing and
analyzing adverse drug experience reports and drug use data; and biometrical
analysis of clinical trials and other pre-approval study data for new animal
drug applications. The trainee will also be involved in interagency interaction
on tissue residue issues involving USDA, EPA, the FDA Districts, and States,
and collaborative projects with other FDA Centers.<P>
The first CVM trainee will be chosen in early FY95.  The trainee will enter the
School of Public Health of his or her choice in July 1995 and will begin the
last two years of the program at CVM in June 1996.<p>

In early April 1994, a significant number of cattle at several feedlots in
Kansas became ill and died after being fed milo distiller's dried grains (DDG)
from High Plains Corporation, Colwich, Kansas.  The DDG was being added to the
cattle feed as a protein supplement at a rate of 2 to 5 pounds per head per
day. Preliminary investigations by attending veterinarians, Kansas State
officials, and FDA failed to identify the causative factor or factors for the
cattle illness and death.  The suspect DDG had been produced when High Plains
utilized waste alcohol product in the manufacturing process.  Residues of
clarithromycin, erythromycin and the analog byproducts were identified in the
waste alcohol.  In mid May 1994, FDA initiated an epidemiological investigation
of feedlots that had used the suspect DDG product in cattle feed in order to
help identify the risk factors for the deaths and illness of the cattle fed the
questionable DDG.<P>
The investigative team met with the director of the Kansas Division of
Inspections, Kansas State Veterinarian, the Kansas Secretary of Agriculture,
and the Director of the Kansas State Diagnostic Laboratory.  A visit was also
made to the High Plains fermentation plant in Colwich, Kansas.  High Plains
managers described recycling the waste ethanol into the post-fermentation DDG
mash, followed by distilling to recapture the pure ethanol.<P>
Fifteen feedlots were investigated consisting of 41 pens of cattle.  All
feedlots investigated contained fewer than 3,000 animals with most being
backgrounder operations raising mixed breed heifers and steers.  Weights of
animals ranged from 333 to 1400 pounds with a mean weight of about 800 pounds.
There were no significant differences in feeding practices among the feedlots
other than use of DDG.  Ranges of DDG fed were from 0.0 to 6.59 lb/head/day
with a mean of 2.9 lb/head/day.  Ranges of monensin fed were from 0.0 to 317.0
mg/head/day with a mean of 187.2 mg/head/day.  The monensin daily intake was
consistently estimated to be within the FDA approved range.<P>
A total of 16,644 animals were present on the 15 farms.  Of these, 4,632 were
affected by the disease outbreak, yielding a morbidity rate of 27.8%.  Seven
hundred and six (706) of the 16,644 animals died in the outbreak for a
mortality rate of 4.2%.  The majority of the deaths (556) occurred in one
feedlot.  The case fatality rate was determined to be 15.2% and the case
recovery rate was 84.8%.  Thus, the outbreak had both low mortality and case
fatality rates.  Thirteen of the 41 total pens were identified as having
positive cases representing 7 feedlot producers.  The clinical signs exhibited
by the affected animals were similar to those seen in an animal suffering from
monensin toxicity.<P>
The attack rate for any animal receiving only monensin or only DDG was 0.
Thus, in order to be affected, the animal must have consumed both monensin and
DDG.  Moreover, increasing doses of monensin and DDG resulted in a greater
detrimental effect to the cattle.  Two farms were affected most with attack
rates of 97.3% and 84.9%.  The analysis of the data by pen or farm did not
identify any additional risk factors for this toxicosis.  The two variables
that were found to be necessary for illness or death were the presence of both
DDG and monensin.  Other ionophores were used too infrequently in the feedlots
investigated to analyze their involvement, if any.<P>
Logistic regression analysis was performed to confirm the association between
cattle illness and death and feeding DDG and monensin.  Although several
significant regressions were identified, serious violations of statistical
assumptions were detected.  Thus, the association between cattle deaths and the
feeding of DDG and monensin could not be statistically validated. Possible
explanations include the presence of a third, unidentified variable and our
inability to accurately assess exposure to DDG and the widely varying levels of
macrolide contamination in the DDG.  Properly conducted and appropriately
analyzed feeding trials are necessary to definitively determine the causative
agents of the Kansas cattle deaths.  Kansas State University undertook this
research.<P>

Resistance Monitoring
</a></b>
<P>
In response to the comments from the May 11 and 12 joint meeting of the
Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee and the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory
Committee, S&amp;C became involved in planning the development of a nationally
representative surveillance system for monitoring antibiotic resistance in
classes of bacteria associated with food-producing animals in order to
determine the frequency, characteristics, and trends of resistance determinants
present in these bacteria.  The system would be planned as an adjunct to a more
comprehensive human-based system, which is also being considered in response to
the FDA joint advisory committee meeting.  It is envisioned that the
surveillance system will provide baseline data from which to evaluate changes
in antibiotic usage practices, detect changes in frequency or extent of
antibiotic resistance in animals that may be useful in predicting or
identifying human disease outbreaks, and generate data that can be used to
determine the need for public health action or regulatory intervention, and
assess the effectiveness of any actions taken.  See page 33 for additional
details about the VMAC meeting.<P>

Advisory Team
</a></b>
<P>
This year's Surveillance Advisory Team (SAT) meeting was held June 15 at FSIS.
This is an annual review of compounds either included in or to be added to the
FSIS National Testing Program.  The interagency Team consists of
representatives from the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug
Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency.  CVM suggested adding
pirlimycin to the National Residue Program and removing morantel tartrate and
tylosin.   The Center reiterated last year's recommendation of adding
tilmicosin to the plan.  In addition to compound recommendations, several
method development issues were discussed including Beta-agonist screening,
tranquilizers, nitrofurans, fluoroquinolones, and oxytetracycline method
bridging.<P>
Bridging studies for new antibiotic methods in development at FSIS are critical
in maintaining continuity in our compliance program when new methods are being
cycled into use, and represent a major step forward in coordination of orderly
methods transition in our program.  <P>
