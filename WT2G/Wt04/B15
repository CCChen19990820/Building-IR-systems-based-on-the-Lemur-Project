<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Fuel System</B></FONT> </CENTER>   

                         
  
 <P>  The purpose of the fuel system is to provide a mixture of fuel and  
   air to the engine of the car. The air-fuel mixture must be in  
   proportion to the speed and load placed on the engine. Major parts of  
   the system include: fuel tank and cap, emission controls, fuel line,  
   fuel pump, fuel filter, carburetor, and intake manifold as well as  
   the fuel gauge, which indicates the amount of fuel in the tank.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Engine Fuel</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Engine fuel is mainly made up of hydrogen and carbon, mixed so that  
   it will burn with oxygen present, and will free its heat energy into  
   mechanical energy. Liquid fuels are ideal for internal combustion  
   engines, because they can be economically produced, have a high heat  
   value per pound, an ideal rate of burning, and can be easily handled  
   and stored. The most common engine fuels are gasoline, kerosene and  
   Diesel fuel oil.  
  
   <P>Gasoline has many advantages and is used to a greater extent than any  
   other fuel in internal combustion engines having spark ignition. It  
   has a better burning rate than other fuels, and, because it vaporizes  
   easily, it gives quick starting in cold weather, smooth acceleration  
   and maximum power.   
  
  <P> Diesel fuel oil ranks next to gasoline in quantity used. It can be  
   produced as cheaply as gasoline, but its use is limited to Diesel  
   type engines. The use of kerosene as a fuel is usually limited to  
   farm tractors, marine and stationary engines, all which operate at a  
   fairly constant speed. Its traits are such that it cannot be properly  
   mixed with air and controlled in variable speed engines.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Octane Rating</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  A gasoline's ability to resist detonation is called its "octane" or  
   anti-knock rating. Gasoline from asphaltic base crude oil produces  
   less knock than one from paraffinic base crude. Cracked gas has less  
   tendency to knock than straight run gas. All marketed gasolines are a  
   blend of straight run and cracked gasolines, so unless their blending  
   is controlled, the anti-knock qualities will vary.  
  
 <P> A mixture of iso-octane, which has a very high anti-knock rating, and  
   heptane, which makes a pronounced knock, is used as a reference fuel  
   to establish an anti-knock standard. The anti-knock value or octane  
   number is represented by the percentage of volume of iso-octane that  
   must be mixed with normal heptane in order to duplicate the knocking  
   of the gasoline which is being tested. These ratings range from 50 in  
   third grade gasolines to 110 in aviational fuels. The rating of 100  
   means a fuel having an anti-knock value equal to that of iso-octane.   
   If the octane rating of a gasoline is naturally low, the fuel will  
   detonate as it burns and power will be applied to the pistons in  
   hammer-like blows. The ideal power is that which pushes steadily on  
   the pistons, rather than hammer against them. The octane rating of a  
   gasoline can be raised by treating it with a chemical which is not a  
   fuel. The best chemical known is tetra-ethyl lead compound, which is  
   added to the gasoline.  
  
 <P> Tetra-ethyl lead is a liquid which mixes thoroughly with gasoline and  
   vaporizes completely. Ethylene dibromide prevents the tetra-ethyl  
   lead from forming lead oxide deposits on spark plugs and on valve  
   seats and stems. Red dye is added to identify an ethyl treated  
   gasoline and to warn against its being used as anything but an engine  
   fuel. In 1975, it became illegal to use a leaded gasoline except in  
   cars built prior to this time. With the addition of the catalytic  
   converter, it is undesirable to burn leaded fuel, because leaded fuel  
   will clog the converter and increase the back-pressure of the  
   exhaust.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Fuel Tank </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P> All modern fuel systems are fed through a pump, so the fuel tank is  
   usually at the rear of the chassis under the trunk compartment. Some  
   vehicles have a rear engine with the tank in the forward compartment.  
   The fuel tank stores the excess fuel until it is needed for operation  
   of the vehicle. The fuel tank has an inlet pipe and an outlet pipe.  
   The outlet pipe has a fitting for fuel line connection and may be  
   located in the top or in the side of the tank. The lower end is about  
   one-half inch above the bottom of the tank so that collected sediment  
   will not be flushed out into the carburetor. The bottom of the tank  
   contains a drain plug so that tank may be drained and cleaned.  
  
  <P> The gas tank of the early cars was placed higher than the engine. The  
   idea was that the gas would flow down to the engine. This arrangement  
   caused a problem when the car went uphill -- the gas flowed away from  
   the engine.   
  
   Solution: drive up the hill backwards!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Fuel Filter</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Clean fuel is important, because of the many small jets and passages  
   in the carburetor and openings in a fuel injector. To ensure this  
   cleanliness, fuel filters are installed in the fuel line. Fuel  
   filters can be located at any point between the fuel tank and the  
   carburetor. One may be in the tank itself, in the fuel pump or in the  
   carburetor. The most common placement is between the fuel tank and a  
   mechanical fuel pump. In this case, the fuel enters a glass bowl and  
   passes up through the filter screen and out through an outlet. Any  
   water or solid material which is trapped by the filter will fall to  
   the bottom of the glass bowl where it can be easily seen and removed.  
   Dirt particles usually come from scales of rust in the tank cars,  
   storage tanks or drums. Water comes from condensed moisture in the  
   fuel tanks.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                                Fuel Pump </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The fuel pump has three functions: to deliver enough fuel to supply  
   the requirements of an engine under all operating conditions, to  
   maintain enough pressure in the line between the carburetor and the  
   pump to keep the fuel from boiling, and to prevent vapor lock.  
   Excessive pressure can hold the carburetor float needle off its seat,  
   causing high gasoline level in the float chamber. This will result in  
   high gasoline consumption. The pump generally delivers a minimum of  
   ten gallons of gasoline per hour at top engine speeds, under an  
   operating pressure of from about 2 1/2 to 7 pounds. Highest pressure  
   occurs at idling speed and the lowest at top speed. Although fuel  
   pumps all work to produce the same effect, there are various types  
   that may operate somewhat differently.   
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Mechanical Fuel Pump </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The mechanical fuel pump differs in that it has a vacuum booster  
   section. The vacuum section is operated by the fuel pump arm;  
   otherwise, it has nothing to do with the fuel system. During the  
   suction (or first) stroke, the rotation of the eccentric on the  
   camshaft puts the pump operating arm into motion, pulling the lever  
   and diaphragm down against the pressure of the diaphragm spring and  
   producing suction (vacuum) in the pump chamber. The suction will hold  
   the outlet valve closed and pull the inlet valve open, causing fuel  
   to flow through the filter screen and down through the inlet valve of  
   the pump chamber.   
  
  <P>During the return stroke, the diaphragm is forced up by the diaphragm  
   spring, the inlet valve closes and the outlet valve opens to allow  
   fuel to flow through the outlet to the carburetor. The operating  
   lever is hinged to the pump arm, so that it can move down but cannot  
   be raised by the pump arm. The pump arm spring forces the arm to  
   follow the cam without moving the lever. The lever can only be moved  
   upward by the diaphragm spring. This process causes fuel to be  
   delivered to the carburetor only when the fuel pressure in the outlet  
   is less than the pressure maintained by the diaphragm spring. This  
   happens when the passage of fuel from the pump into the carburetor  
   float chamber is open and the float needle is not seated.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Electric Fuel Pump </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Electric fuel pumps have been used for many years on trucks, buses  
   and heavy equipment, and they have also been used as replacements for  
   mechanically operated fuel pumps on automobiles, but only recently  
   have they become part of a car's original equipment. The replacement  
   types usually use a diaphragm arrangement like the mechanical pumps,  
   except that it is actuated by an electrical solenoid.   
  
  <P> The electrically driven turbine type of pump, first used on the Buick  
   Riviera, was a great departure from the usual fuel pump design. It  
   uses a small turbine wheel driven by a constant speed electric motor.  
   The entire unit is located in the fuel tank and submerged in the fuel  
   itself. This pump operates continuously when the engine is running.  
   It keeps up a constant pressure which is capable of supplying the  
   maximum fuel demands of the engine. When less fuel is required, the  
   pump does not deliver at full potential, because the turbine is not a  
   positive displacement type like the mechanical pump.  Consequently,  
   the turbine will run without pumping fuel and so, needs no means of  
   varying fuel delivery rate like its mechanical counterpart. Since the  
   fuel can flow past the spinning turbine blades, there is no need for  
   pump inlet and outlet valves nor is there any need to vary its speed.  
  
  <P> A relay for the electric fuel pump is used to complete the circuit to  
   the fuel pump. This cuts off current to the fuel pump in the event of  
   an accident.   
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Vacuum Pump </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Several fuel pumps have a vacuum booster section that operates the  
   windshield wipers at an almost constant speed. The fuel section then  
   functions in the same way as ordinary fuel pumps. One difference is  
   that the rotation of the camshaft eccentric in the vacuum pump also  
   operates the vacuum booster section by actuating the pump arm, which  
   pushes a link and the bellows diaphragm assembly upward, expelling  
   air in the upper chamber through its exhaust valve out into the  
   intake manifold. On the return stroke of the pump arm, the diaphragm  
   spring moves the bellows diaphragm down, producing a suction in the  
   vacuum chamber. The suction opens the intake valve of the vacuum  
   section and draws air through the inlet pipe from the windshield  
   wipers.   
  
  <P> When the wipers are not operating, the intake manifold suction  
   (vacuum) holds the diaphragm up against the diaphragm spring pressure  
   so that the diaphragm does not function with every stroke of the pump  
   arm. When the vacuum is greater than the suction produced by the  
   pump, the air flows from the windshield wiper through the inlet valve  
   and vacuum chamber of the pump and out the exhaust valve outlet to  
   the manifold, leaving the vacuum section inoperative. With high  
   suction in the intake manifold, the operation of the wiper will be  
   the same as if the pump were not installed. When the suction is low,  
   as when the engine is accelerated or operating at high speed, the  
   suction of the pump is greater than that in the manifold and the  
   vacuum section operates the wipers at a constant speed. Some pumps  
   have the vacuum section located in the bottom of the pump instead of  
   in the top, but the operation is basically the same.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Air Cleaners</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Air cleaners are made to separate dust and other particles in the  
   incoming air before it enters the carburetor. Thousands of cubic feet  
   of air are drawn from within the car hood and passed through the  
   engine cylinders, so it is important that the air is clean.  
  
  <P> When driving on dirt or other dusty roads, dust particles are drawn  
   through the radiator and find their way into the engine if it is not  
   filtered and cleaned. Dust and other foreign materials in the engine  
   will cause excessive wear and operating problems.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Fuel Gauges</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Cars are equipped with fuel gauges which are operated along with the  
   vehicle's electrical system. There are two types: the thermostatic  
   type and the balancing coil type. The thermostatic type is made of a  
   standing unit, located in the fuel tank, and the gauge itself  
   (registering unit), which is located on the instrument panel. The  
   fuel gauge used in some cars and trucks is of the electrically  
   operated balanced coil type. These have a dash unit and a tank unit.   
   The dash unit has two coils, spaced about 90 degrees apart, with an  
   armature and integral pointer at the intersections of the coil axis.   
   The dial has a scale in fractions between "Empty" and "Full". The  
   tank unit has a housing, which encloses a rheostat, and a sliding  
   brush which contacts the rheostat. The brush is actuated by the float  
   arm. The movement of the float arm is controlled by the height of the  
   fuel in the supply tank. The height of the fuel (called variations in  
   resistance) changes the value of the dash unit coil so that the  
   pointer indicates the amount of fuel available. A calibrated friction  
   brake is included in the tank unit to prevent the wave motions of the  
   fuel from fluctuating the pointer on the dash unit. Current from the  
   battery passes through the limiting coil to the common connection  
   between the two coils, which is the lower terminal on the dash unit.   
   The current is then offered two paths, one through the operating coil  
   of the dash unit and the other over the wire to the tank unit. When  
   the tank is low or empty, the sliding brush cuts out all resistance  
   in the tank unit. Most of the current will pass through the tank unit  
   circuit because of the low resistance and only a small portion  
   through the operating coil to the dash unit. As a result, this coil  
   is not magnetized enough to move the dash unit pointer, which is then  
   held at the "Empty" position by the limiting coil.   
  
  <P> If the tank is partly full or full, the float rises on the surface of  
   the fuel and moves the sliding brush over the rheostat, putting  
   resistance in the tank unit circuit. More current will then pass  
   through the operating coil to give a magnetic pull on the pointer,  
   which overcomes some of the pull of the limiting coil. When the tank  
   is full, the tank unit circuit contains the maximum resistance to the  
   flow of the current. The operating coil will then receive its maximum  
   current and exert pull of the pointer to give a "Full" reading. As  
   the tank empties, the operating coil loses some of its magnetic pull  
   and the limiting coil will still have about the same pull so that the  
   pointer is pulled toward the lower reading. Variations in battery  
   voltage will not cause an error in the gauge reading because its  
   operation only depends on the difference in magnetic effect between  
   the two coils.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Fuel Lines</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Fuel lines, which connect all the units of the fuel system, are  
   usually made of rolled steel or, sometimes, of drawn copper. Steel  
   tubing, when used for fuel lines, is generally rust proofed by being  
   copper or zinc plated.   
  
  <P> Fuel lines are placed as far away from exhaust pipes, mufflers, and  
   manifolds as possible, so that excessive heat will not cause vapor  
   lock. They are attached to the frame, the engine, and other units in  
   such a way that the effect of vibration is minimal, and so that they  
   are free of contact with sharp edges which might cause wear. In areas  
   where there is a lot of movement, as between the car`s frame and  
   rubber-mounted engine, short lengths of gasoline resistant flexible  
   tubing are used.   
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Intake Manifolds</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  An intake manifold is a system of passages which conduct the fuel  
   mixture from the carburetor to the intake valves of the engine.   
   Manifold design has much to do with the efficient operation of an  
   engine. For smooth and even operation, the fuel charge taken into  
   each cylinder should be of the same strength and quality.   
  
 <P>  Distribution of the fuel should, therefore, be as even as possible.   
   This depends greatly upon the design of the intake manifold. Dry fuel  
   vapor is an ideal form of fuel charge, but present-day fuel prevents  
   this unless the mixture is subjected to high temperature. If the fuel  
   charge is heated too highly, the power of the engine is reduced  
   because the heat expands the fuel charge. Therefore, it is better to  
   have some of the fuel deposited on the walls of the cylinders and  
   manifold vents. Manifolds in modern engines are designed so that the  
   amount of fuel condensing on the intake manifold walls is reduced to  
   a minimum.  
  
  <P> In a V-8 engine, the intake manifold is mounted between the cylinder  
   heads. The L-head engine's manifold is bolted to the side of the  
   block, and the I-head manifold is bolted to the cylinder head.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Ram Induction Manifolds</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The ram induction manifold system consists of twin air cleaners, twin  
   four-barrel carburetors and two manifolds containing eight long tubes  
   of equal length (four for each manifold).  
  
  <P> This system was designed by the Chrysler Company to increase power  
   output by in the middle speed range (1800-3600 rpm). Each manifold  
   supplies one bank of cylinders and is carefully calculated to harness  
   the natural supercharging effect of a ram induction system. By taking  
   advantage of the pulsations in the air intake column caused by the  
   valves opening and closing, sonic impulses help pack more mixture  
   into the combustion chambers.   
  
  <P> In the Chrysler system, the air-fuel mixture from each carburetor  
   flows into a chamber directly below the carburetor, then passes  
   through the long individual intake branches to the opposite cylinder  
   bank. The right-hand carburetor supplies the air-fuel mixtures for  
   the left-hand cylinder bank, and the left-hand carburetor supplies  
   the right cylinder bank. The passages between the manifolds are  
   interconnected with a pressure equalizer tube to maintain balance of  
   the engine pulsations.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Manifold Heat Control</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Most engines have automatically operated heat controls which use the  
   exhaust gases of the engine to heat the incoming fuel-air charge  
   during starting and warm-up. This improves vaporization and mixture  
   distribution. When the engine is cold, all of the exhaust gas is  
   deflected to and around the intake manifold "hot spot". As the engine  
   warms up, the thermostatic spring is heated and loses tension. This  
   allows the counterweight to change the position of the heat control  
   valve gradually so that, at higher driving speeds with a thoroughly  
   warmed engine, the exhaust gases are passed directly to the exhaust  
   pipe and muffler.   
  
  <P> In the ram induction system, there is a heat control chamber in each  
   manifold to operate the automatic choke and to heat the fuel mixture  
   after warm-up. A heat control valve in each exhaust manifold will  
   by-pass the exhaust gas through an elbow to the intake manifold heat  
   control chamber. Heat outlet pipes then carry the gas down to the "Y"  
   connector under the heat control valve.   
  
  <P> Heat control is regulated by a coiled thermostatic spring mounted on  
   the exhaust manifold. A counterweight is mounted on the other end of  
   the heat control valve shaft and this counterweight, in conjunction  
   with the thermostatic spring, operates to close and open the heat  
   control valve.   
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Carburetor</B></FONT> </CENTER>   
 <P>  The purpose of the carburetor is to supply and meter the mixture of  
   fuel vapor and air in relation to the load and speed of the engine.   
   Because of engine temperature, speed, and load, perfect carburetion  
   is very hard to obtain.   
  
  <P> The carburetor supplies a small amount of a very rich fuel mixture  
   when the engine is cold and running at idle. With the throttle plate  
   closed and air from the air cleaner limited by the closed choke  
   plate, engine suction is amplified at the idle-circuit nozzle. This  
   vacuum draws a thick spray of gasoline through the nozzle from the  
   full float bowl, whose fuel line is closed by the float-supported  
   needle valve. More fuel is provided when the gas pedal is depressed  
   for acceleration. The pedal linkage opens the throttle plate and the  
   choke plate to send air rushing through the barrel. The linkage also  
   depresses the accelerator pump, providing added gasoline through the  
   accelerator-circuit nozzle. As air passes through the narrow center  
   of the barrel, called the "venturi", it produces suction that draws  
   spray from the cruising-circuit nozzle. The float-bowl level drops  
   and causes the float to tip and the needle valve to open the fuel  
   line.  
  
  <P> To cause a liquid to flow, there must be a high pressure area (which  
   in this case is atmospheric pressure) and a low pressure area. Low  
   pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. The average person refers  
   to a low pressure area as a vacuum. Since the atmospheric pressure is  
   already present, a low pressure area can be created by air or liquid  
   flowing through a venturi. The downward motion of the piston also  
   creates a low pressure area, so air and gasoline are drawn through  
   the carburetor and into the engine by suction created as the piston  
   moves down, creating a partial vacuum in the cylinder. Differences  
   between low pressure within the cylinder and atmospheric pressure  
   outside of the carburetor causes air and fuel to flow into the  
   cylinder from the carburetor.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Supercharger</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  A supercharger is a compressor. Hence, a supercharged engine has a  
   higher overall compression than a nonsupercharrged engine having the  
   same combustion chamber volume and piston displacement and will burn  
   more fuel. Unfortunately, the increase in power is not proportional  
   to the increase in fuel consumption. There are two general models of  
      superchargers, the Rootes type and the centrifugal type. The Rootes  
   "blower" has two rotors, while the centrifugal uses an impeller  
   rotating at high speed inside a housing.  
  
  <P> Superchargers can be placed between the throttle body of the  
   carburetor or fuel injection system and the manifold; or at the air  
   inlet before the throttle body. Racing cars usually have it located  
   between the throttle body and the manifold. This design has the  
   advantage that the fuel can be supplied through the throttle body  
   without modification to any part of the system. If the supercharger  
   is placed in front of the throttle body, fuel must be supplied under  
   sufficient pressure to overcome the added air pressure created by the  
   supercharger. The advantage of a supercharger over a turbocharger is  
   that there is no lag time of boost; the moment the accelerator pedal  
   is depressed, the boost is increased.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Turbocharger</B></FONT> </CENTER>   
 <P>  A turbocharger, or supercharger, can boost engine power up to 40%.  
   The idea is to force the delivery of more air-fuel mixture to the  
   cylinders and get more power from the engine. A turbocharger is a  
   supercharger that operates on exhaust gas from the engine.  
  
 <P>  Although turbochargers and superchargers perform the same function,  
   the turbocharger is driven by exhaust gases, while the supercharger  
   is driven by belts and gears. The turbocharger has a turbine and a  
   compressor, and requires less power to be driven than a supercharger.  
   The pressure of the hot exhaust gases cause the turbine to spin.  
   Since the turbine is mounted on the same shaft as the compressor, the  
   compressor is forced to spin at the same time, drawing 50% more air  
   into the cylinders than is drawn in without the turbocharger. This  
   creates more power when the air-fuel mixture explodes.  
  
 <P>  A turbocharged engine's compression ratio must be lowered by using a  
   lower compression piston, since an excessive amount of pressure will  
   wear on the piston, connecting rods, and crankshaft, and destroy the  
   engine. All of these parts then, as well as the transmission, must be  
   strengthened on a turbocharged engine or it will be torn apart by the  
   increased horsepower.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Breathers </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The breather is the positive crankcase ventilation system directing  
   atmospheric pressure to the crankcase. The atmospheric pressure then  
   pushes the blowby gases to a low pressure area. The air that is  
   directed into the crankcase must first be filtered; if it is not, the  
   dust and sand particles will destroy the engine parts.  When there is  
   too much blowby, it is routed back through the crankcase breather  
   element. It then enters the carburetor or throttle body with the  
   incoming fresh air to be burned in the cylinders. In addition, the  
   breather helps to keep the regular air filter cleaner for a longer  
   period of time, since blowby contains oil vapor from the crankcase.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Float Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P>Fuel in the carburetor must be maintained at a certain level under  
   all operating conditions; this is the function of the float circuit.   
   The needed fuel level is maintained by the float. When its attached  
   lever forces the needle valve closed, the flow of fuel from the pump  
   is stopped. As soon as fuel is discharged from the float bowl, the  
   float drops. The needle valve opens and fuel flows into the bowl  
   again. In this way, the fuel is level to the opening of the main  
   discharge nozzle. The float level must be set with a high degree of  
   accuracy. If the level is too low, not enough fuel will be supplied  
   to the system and the engine will stall on turns; if the level is too  
   high, too much fuel will flow from the nozzle.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Metering Rod</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  A metering rod varies the size of the carburetor jet opening. Fuel  
   from the float bowl is metered through the jet and the metering rod  
   within it. The fuel is forced from the jet to the nozzle extending  
   into the venturi. As the throttle valve is opened, its linkage raises  
   the metering rod from the jet. The rod has several steps, or tapers,  
   on the lower end. As it is raised in the jet, it makes the opening of  
   the jet greater in size. This allows more fuel to flow through the  
   jet to the discharge nozzle. The metering must keep pace with the  
   slightest change in the throttle valve position so that the correct  
   air-fuel mixture is obtained in spite of engine speed.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Choke Valve</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P>Chokes perform the fuel mixture adjustments necessary to start a cold  
   engine. When the fuel-air mixture is too cold, the engine won't start  
   properly, or will stall out periodically. The choke when engaged  
   (closed) the choke causes the fuel air mixture to be increased, or  
   "enriched". The choke is a special valve placed at the mouth of the  
   carburetor so that it partially blocks off the entering air. When the  
   choke plate closes, the vacuum below it increases, drawing more fuel  
   from the fuel bowl. The rich fuel mixture burns even at lower  
   temperatures, allowing the engine to warm up.  
  
 <P>  The manual choke is a knob on the dash, usually the push-pull type,  
   which extends from the choke on the carburetor to the instrument  
   panel. The driver closes the choke when starting the engine. The main  
   thing to know about a manual choke is to push it back in when the  
   engine has reached normal operating temperature. The trouble with the  
   manual choke is that the driver often forgets to open it fully. This  
   results in a rich fuel mixture which causes carbon to form in the  
   combustion chambers and on the spark plugs. To correct this problem,  
   the automatic choke was developed.  
  
  <P> The automatic choke relies on engine heat. The choke valve is run by  
   a thermostat which is controlled by exhaust heat. When the engine is  
   cold, the valve will be closed for starting. As the engine warms, the  
   exhaust heat will gradually open the choke valve. An automatic choke  
   depends on a thermostatic coil spring unwinding as heat is supplied.   
   As the engine warms up, manifold heat is transmitted to the choke  
   housing. The heat causes the bimetal spring to relax, opening the  
   valve.  
  
 <P>  An electric heating coil in the automatic choke shortens the length  
   of time that the choke valve is closed. As the spring unwinds, it  
   causes the choke valve in the carburetor air horn to open. This lets  
   more air pass into the carburetor. The coil is mounted in a well in  
   the exhaust crossover passage of the intake manifold. Movement of the  
   bimetal spring is relayed to the choke valve shaft by means of  
   linkage and levers.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Fuel Injection</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The carburetor, despite all it advances: air bleeds, correction jets,  
   acceleration pumps, emulsion tubes, choke mechanisms, etc., is still  
   a compromise. The limitations of carburetor design is helping to push  
   the industry toward fuel injection.   
  
  <P> Direct fuel injection means that the fuel is sprayed directly into  
   the combustion chamber. The fuel injected nozzle is located in the  
   combustion chamber.  
  
  <P> Throttle Body injection systems locate the injector(s) within the air  
   intake cavity, or "throttle body". Multi-point systems use one  
   injector per cylinder, and usually locate the injectors at the mouth  
   of the intake port.  
  
 <P>  The fuel injector is an electromechanical device that sprays and  
   atomizes the fuel. The fuel injector is nothing more than a solenoid  
   through which gasoline is metered. When electric current is applied  
   to the injector coil, a magnetic field is created, which causes the  
   armature to move upward. This action pulls a spring-loaded ball or  
   "pintle valve" off its seat. Then, fuel under pressure can flow out  
   of the injector nozzle. The shape of the pintle valve causes the fuel  
   to be sprayed in a cone-shaped pattern. When the injector is  
   de-energized, the spring pushes the ball onto its seat, stopping the  
   flow of fuel.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Mechanical Fuel Injection</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Mechanical fuel injection is the oldest of the fuel injection  
   systems. It uses a throttle linkage and a governor. It is now used  
   mainly on diesel engines. Hydraulic fuel injection is used by some of  
   the imports. Hydraulic pressure is applied to a fuel distributor as a  
   switching device to route fuel to a specific injector. The fuel from  
   the tank is carried under pressure to the fuel injector(s) by an  
   electric fuel pump, which is located in or near the fuel tank. All  
   excess is returned to the fuel tank.   
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Electronic Fuel Injection</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The principle of electronic fuel injection is very simple. Injectors  
   are opened not by the pressure of the fuel in the delivery lines, but  
   by solenoids operated by an electronic control unit. Since the fuel  
   has no resistance to overcome, other than insignificant friction  
   losses, the pump pressure can be set at very low values, consistent  
   with the limits of obtaining full atomization with the type of  
   injectors used. The amount of fuel to be injected is determined by  
   the control unit on the basis of information fed into it about the  
   engine's operating conditions. This information will include manifold  
   pressure, accelerator enrichment, cold-start requirements, idling  
   conditions, outside temperature and barometric pressure. The systems  
   work with constant pressure and with "variable timed" or "continuous  
   flow" injection. Compared with mechanical injection systems, the  
   electronic fuel injection has an impressive set of advantages. It has  
   fewer moving parts, no need for ultra-precise machining standards,  
   quieter operation, less power loss, a low electrical requirement, no  
   need for special pump drives, no critical fuel filtration  
   requirements, no surges or pulsations in the fuel line and finally,  
   the clincher for many car makers, lower cost.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Throttle Valve</B></FONT> </CENTER>   
  <P> All gasoline engines have a throttle valve to control the volume of  
   intake air. The amount of fuel and air that goes into the combustion  
   chamber regulates the engine speed and, therefore, engine power. The  
   throttle valve is linked to the accelerator (gas pedal). The throttle  
   valve is a butterfly valve that usually consists of a disc mounted on  
   a spindle. The disc is roughly circular, and it has the same diameter  
   as the main air passage in the throat or "venturi". In a carburetor,  
   the throttle valve is usually located at the bottom of the  
   carburetor, between the jet nozzle and the intake manifold. The  
   throttle spindle is connected to the accelerator in such a manner  
   that when the pedal is depressed, the valve opens. When the pedal is  
   released, the valve closes. Fuel injected engines use throttle valves  
   to regulate engine power, even though the fuel is also regulated  
   through the injectors.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Idle Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P> The fuel delivery in a carburetor tends to lag behind the motion of  
   the throttle. The basic carburetor operates when the throttle valve  
   is fully open or partially open, but not when it's closed. No driver  
   wants the engine to stop every time the foot leaves the accelerator;  
   such a car would be tiring and stressful to drive, even in the best  
   of road conditions, let alone in a traffic situation. To keep the  
   engine running smoothly and evenly when no power is needed, the idle  
   circuit was added inside the carburetor. The idle jet admits fuel on  
   the engine side of the throttle valve. Additional air is mixed with  
   this fuel through an air bleed. The result is an entirely separate  
   carburetor circuit which operates only when the throttle valve is  
   closed.   
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Venturi</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P>"Barrel" is a popular term for the carburetor throat. There is one  
   venturi in each throat. A two-barrel carburetor has a primary venturi  
   for part-load running and a secondary venturi for full-throttle; a  
   four-barrel carburetor has two primary and two secondary venturis.   
   The venturi tube is important in carburetion. A "venturi" is a tube  
   with a restricted section. When liquid or air passes through the  
   venturi tube, the speed of flow is increased at the restriction, and  
   air pressure is decreased, creating an "increase in vacuum" (a  
   reduction in ambient pressure). This causes fuel to be drawn into the  
   barrel. The venturi action is used to keep the correct air-fuel ratio  
   throughout the range of speeds and loads of the engine.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Cetane Rating (Ether)</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The delay between the time the fuel is injected into the cylinder and  
   ignition is expressed as a cetane number. Usually, this is between 30  
   and 60. Fuels that ignite rapidly have high cetane ratings, while  
   slow-to-ignite fuels have lower cetane ratings. A fuel with a better  
   ignition quality would help combustion more than a lower cetane fuel  
   during starting and idling conditions when compression temperatures  
   are cooler. Ether, with a very high cetane rating of 85-96, is often  
   used for starting diesel engines in cold weather. The lower the  
   temperature of the surrounding air, the greater the need for fuel  
   that will ignite rapidly. When the cetane number is too low, it may  
   cause difficult starting, engine knock, and puffs of white exhaust  
   smoke, especially during engine warm-up and light load operation. If  
   these conditions continue, harmful engine deposits will accumulate in  
   the combustion chamber.   
  <P>
   Pressurized cans of starter fluid are available in emergencies, but  
   are not desirable, because they tend to dry out the cylinders, and  
   are dangerous if used improperly. There are also liquid forms of  
   starter fluid available which can be added to the gasoline.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Fuel Additives</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Tetraethyl lead was used in some gasolines to reduce or prevent  
   knocking. However, in 1975, it became illegal to use leaded gasoline  
   except in cars built prior to this time. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether  
   (MTBE) is used in unleaded fuel to increase the octane. Gasoline  
   exposed to heat and air oxidizes and leaves a gummy film. Detergents  
   are now added to gasoline to prevent this. The detergents keep the  
   carburetor passages and fuel injectors free from deposits, which  
   could cause hard starting and problems in driving. Deposits also  
   restrict the flow of fuel and cause a rough idle, hesitation of  
   acceleration, surging, stalling, and lack of power.  
  
  <P> Alcohol is frequently used as an additive to commercial gasoline,  
   because it will absorb any condensed moisture which may collect in  
   the fuel system. Water will not pass through the filters in the fuel  
   line, so, when any water collects, it will prevent the free passage  
   of fuel. It also tends to attack and corrode the zinc die castings of  
   which many carburetors and fuel pumps are made. This corrosion will  
   not only destroy parts, but also clog the system and prevent the flow  
   of fuel. By using alcohol in gasoline, any water present will be  
   absorbed and pass through the fuel filter and carburetor jets into  
   the combustion chamber. Alcohol additives are often purchased and  
   added separately into the gas tank to prevent gas-line freeze and  
   vapor lock.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Alcohol as a Fuel</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The increasing cost of gasoline, and the new laws requiring  
   alternative fuels have turned the attention of car and truck  
   designers to substitutes. Chief among alternative fuels is alcohol.  
   Considerable research has been done, and is still carried out, for  
   alcohol in spark ignition engines. Alcohol fuels were used  
   extensively in Germany during WWII, and alcohol blends are used in  
   many vehicles at the present time.   
  
  <P> Methanol and ethanol are the forms of alcohol receiving the most  
   attention. Both are made from non-petroleum products. Methanol can be  
   produced from coal, and ethanol can be made from farm products such  
   as sugar cane, corn, and potatoes. Both alcohols have a higher octane  
   number than gasoline. High heat of vaporization, however, indicates  
   that the use of alcohol could give harder starting problems than  
   gasoline, which means a need for a larger fuel tank and larger jet  
   sizes in the carburetor. It requires less air for combustion, though,  
   which compensates for the high calorific values. In proportion, this  
   could result in practically the same air-fuel ratio for all three.  
  
  <P> Experimental tests have shown that alcohol-fueled spark ignition  
   engines can produce as much or slightly higher power than gasoline.  
   Alcohol fuels have a higher self-ignition temperature than gasoline,  
   which rates them better from a safety standpoint, but this same  
   quality bars them from use in a diesel engine which depends on the  
   heat of compression to ignite the fuel. At the present time, only  
   ethanol can be blended in small concentrations (10%) with gasoline.  
   Because of the high octane rating, alcohols can be used in relatively  
   high compression ratios, and experiments indicate that emissions from  
   engines fueled by alcohol would require the use of exhaust gas  
   recirculation controls.

                               Diesel Fuel</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Diesel fuels vary from highly volatile jet fuels and kerosene, to the  
   heavier furnace oil. Automotive diesel engines are capable of burning  
   a wide range of fuel between these two extremes. How well a diesel  
   engine performs with different types of fuel is dependent upon engine  
   operating conditions and the fuel characteristics. The classification  
   of commercially available fuel oils has been set up by the American  
   Society for Testing Materials. Grade 1D fuels range from kerosene to  
   what is known as intermediate distillates. Grades 2D and 4D each have  
   progressively higher boiling points and contain more impurities. The  
   fuels known as high-grade fuels, kerosene, and 1D fuels, contribute a  
   minimum of engine deposits and corrosion and have less impurities.   
   Refining the fuels removes the impurities, but it also lowers the  
   heat value. Therefore, the higher grade fuels develop slightly less  
   power than the same quantity of low-grade fuels. This is more than  
   offset by the cost of maintenance repairs in using low-grade fuel.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>              Liquiefied Petroleum Gas (LPG-Natural Gas)</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  A mixture of gaseous petroleum compounds, principally butane and  
   propane, together with smaller quantities of similar gases, is known  
   as liquified petroleum gas (LPG). LPG is used as fuel for internal  
   combustion engines, mostly in the truck and farm tractor fields. It  
   is chemically similar to gasoline, since it consists of a mixture of  
   compounds of hydrogen and carbon, but it is a great deal more  
   volatile. It is a vapor and when used as a fuel, a special kind of  
   carburetor is required. When LPG is stored or transported, it is  
   compressed and cooled so that it is a liquid. It is under tremendous  
   pressure and needs extremely strong tanks. LPG is made of surplus  
   material in the oil fields. It is becoming more widely used as an  
   increasing number of trucks and tractors are being fitted with the  
   equipment required to make use of it. Besides being low in cost, LPG  
   has the advantage of having a high octane value (93 for pure butane;  
   100 for propane). Since it is a dry gas, LPG does not create carbon  
   in an engine, and does not cause dilution of the engine oil. As a  
   result, maintenance and internal parts replacement is highly reduced.  
   Oil changes are also less frequent because it is a cleaner burning  
   fuel than gasoline. Other advantages are easy cold weather starting,  
   lack of exhaust odor, and elimination of evaporation.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Diaphragm</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> A diaphragm is a flexible partition or wall separating two cavities.   
   The lever can only be moved upward by the diaphragm spring. This  
   process causes fuel to be delivered to the carburetor only when the  
   fuel pressure in the outlet is less than the pressure maintained by  
   the diaphragm spring.  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Outlet and Inlet Valves</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The intake (or inlet) valve permits a fluid or gas to enter a chamber  
   and seals against its exit. The outlet valve works just the opposite;  
   permitting the pressurized fuel to flow out into the fuel lines to  
   the carburetor.  
     
   <P>A check valve above the fuel pump in the fuel line keeps the fuel  
   from flowing back into the fuel tank when the engine is shut down.  
   If this valve were not there, fuel starvation on start-up might  
   occur, since it takes longer for the electric fuel pump to get up  
   pressure in the fuel line than it does for a positive displacement  
   mechanical pump.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                     Pump Arm and Operating Lever</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The operating lever is hinged to the pump arm, so that it can move  
   down but cannot be raised by the pump arm. The pump arm spring forces  
   the arm to follow the cam without moving the lever. The lever can  
   only be moved upward by the diaphragm spring.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Air Filters</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Paper-element air filters were first introduced in 1957. The air  
   cleaner element is the disposable dry type, which is made up of a  
   cylindrical cellulose fiber material, pleated to permit the greatest  
   filter area. On each end of this cylinder, the fiber is embedded in  
   end plates to provide an efficient dust seal. On each side of the  
   fiber, rust resistant wire screen furnishes compressive strength. The  
   fine mesh located on the inner screen also acts as a flame arrester  
   in case of backfire. The fiber passes air through the filter with low  
   restriction, but any dust or dirt in the air is deposited on the  
   pleated outer surface. The filter fiber is flame proof and keeps its  
   filtering efficiency under normal concentrations of gasoline vapors,  
   engine oil and water vapor, but should be changed at normal  
   lubrication periods.  
  
 <P>  Air filters can be cleaned by blowing compressed air back through   
   the filter, but the danger exists that small holes can be created by  
   excessive pressure. For this reason, it is usually a good idea to   
   simply replace the filter element.  
  
  <P> Some air filters are of the washable variety, and can therefore be   
   washed clean and re-used.  
  
  <P> A good way to determine if your air filter is still OK is to look  
   through the filter on a bright day. If you can't see the sun through  
   the filter, it needs replacement.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Pintle Valve</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  <P>
   The pintle valve is a spring-loaded ball inside the injector of a  
   fuel-injection system. The injector coil creates a magnetic field,  
   which causes the armature to move upward. This action pulls the  
   pintle valve off its seat. Then, fuel under pressure can flow out of  
   the injector nozzle. The contour of the ball or pintle valve causes  
   the fuel to be sprayed in a cone-shaped pattern. When the injector is  
   de-energized, the spring pushes the ball onto its seat, stopping the  
   flow of fuel.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Variations in Resistance</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The height of the fuel in a tank causes the sending unit to send   
   variations in resistance, which changes the current to the dash unit  
   coil so the pointer indicates the amount of fuel available.   
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Calibrated Friction Brake</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> A calibrated friction brake is included in the fuel tank unit. This  
   prevents the wave motions of the fuel from fluctuating the pointer on  
   the dash unit, so that the fuel reading will correctly correspond to  
   the amount of fuel available in the tank.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                   Limiting Coil and Operating Coil</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  
  <P> Current from the battery passes through the limiting coil to the  
   common connection of two coils at the lower terminal on the dash  
   unit. The current is then offered a choice of two paths, one through  
   the operating coil of the dash unit and the other over to the tank   
   sending unit.   
  
  <P> When the fuel tank is low or empty, the sliding brush cuts out all  
   resistance in the tank unit. Most of the current will then pass  
   through the tank unit circuit because of the low resistance, and only  
   a small portion will pass through the operating coil to the dash  
   unit. As a result, this coil is not magnetized enough to move the  
   dash unit pointer, which is then held at the "Empty" position by the  
   limiting coil.   
  
  <P> When the tank is partly full or full, the float of the tank unit will  
   rise to the surface of the fuel and move the sliding brush over the  
   rheostat, putting resistance in the tank unit circuit. More current  
   will then pass through the operating coil to give a magnetic pull on  
   the pointer, which overcomes some of the pull of the limiting coil.   
   When the tank is full, the tank unit circuit contains the maximum  
   resistance to the flow of the current. The operating coil will then  
   receive its maximum current and exert pull of the pointer to give a  
   "Full" reading.   
  
 <P>  As the tank empties, the operating coil loses some of its magnetic  
   pull and the limiting coil will still have about the same pull so  
   that the pointer is pulled toward the lower reading.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Gaskets</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Gaskets compensate for small irregularities between two surfaces.   
   They are used to prevent fluids and gasses from leaking. In the case  
   of a cylinder head gasket, the combustion pressure is kept in the  
   cylinder, and engine coolant is kept within the passages of the water  
   jacket. The most common cause of gasket failure is overtightening of  
   the bolts that hold the gasket between the metal surfaces. To prevent  
   this, some manufacturers have incorporated a metal washer in the bolt  
   holes of the gasket, which limits the amount of force that can be  
   applied.  Some gaskets must be installed in a specific manner, while  
   others do not. Head gaskets require the mechanic to "torque" the head  
   bolts to specific tightness, and also require the bolts to be  
   tightened in a specific order.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Engine Valves</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  A valve is a device for controlling flow through an opening. The  
   internal combustion engine, which is basically an air pump, depends  
   on the efficient sealing of the valves in order to produce  
   compression.  The timing of when the valves open, and the duration of  
   their opening, affects engine operation. The cam dictates these two  
   factors.  The following terms describe the major components  
   associated with the valves.  
  
 <P>  "Valve clearance" is the gap between the end of the valve stem and  
   valve lifter or rocker arm to compensate for expansion due to heat.  
   Engines with hydraulic lifters often do not need valve clearance  
   adjustments because the lifters automatically take up the slack.  
  
 <P>  The "valve face" is the part of the valve which mates with and rests  
   upon some seating surface. The "valve head" is the portion of a valve  
   upon which the valve face is machined.   
  <P>
   The "valve lock" (also called the key, keeper, or washer) is a device  
   which holds the valve spring in place on the valve stem.   
  
 <P>  "Valve overlap" is an interval which is expressed in degrees   
   where both valves (intake and exhaust) in each cylinder are open at  
   the same time.   
  
 <P>  The "valve seat" is the part of the cylinder head upon which the   
   valve face rests. These are precision ground to mate with the valve  
   face and thereby seal the cylinder.  
  
  <P> The "valve spring" is attached to the valve to return it to its seat  
   after lift is released.   
  
 <P>  The "valve stem" is the longest portion of the valve which passes   
   through the valve guide.  
  
  <P> The "valve guide" is the sleeve through which the valve stem passes.  
   It is pressed or threaded into the cylinder head, and is self   
   lubricated by the composition of its materials. Older cars depend on  
   the lead in "Regular" gas to lubricate the guides.  
  
<P>   The "valve timing" refers to the relative position of a valve (either  
   open or closed) to the piston in its travel, in crankshaft degrees.  
  
  <P> The "valve train" is the complete set of mechanisms used to transmit  
   the rotating motion of the engine crankshaft to the reciprocating   
   valve stem, causing the valves to open.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Heat Exchanger</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P>The "heat exchanger" is a device that uses exhaust heat to aid in  
   fuel evaporation. It usually is built into the intake manifold as an  
   area where the hot exhaust gasses and fuel-air mixture come close to  
   each other.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                Barrel</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  "Barrel" is a popular term for a carburetor throat. There is one  
   venturi in each throat. A dual (or "two-barrel") carburetor has a  
   primary venturi for part-load running and a secondary venturi for  
   full-throttle; a four-barrel carburetor has two primary and two  
   secondary venturis.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Methanol and Ethanol</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Methanol and ethanol are two forms of alcohol fuel receiving the most  
   attention. Both are made from non-petroleum products. Methanol can be  
   produced from coal, and ethanol can be made from farm products such  
   as sugar cane, corn, and potatoes. Both alcohols have a higher octane  
   number than gasoline. High heat of vaporization, however, indicates  
   that the use of alcohol could give harder starting problems than  
   gasoline, which means a need for a larger fuel tank and larger jet  
   sizes in the carburetor. However, it requires less air for  
   combustion, which compensates for the high caloric values.  
  
 <P>  Ethanol is the most common fuel additive; it's an alcohol made from  
   vegetable matter. Some areas require the addition of oxygenates in  
   gasoline, because they reduce carbon monoxide emissions by as much as  
   39%. They also raise the octane level of the gasoline.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Baffle Plates</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P> "Baffle plates" are sometimes welded to the sides and bottom of the  
   inside of the fuel tank for reinforcement and to prevent the fuel  
   from surging and splashing. Baffle plates are notched or perforated  
   so that the fuel can still flow from one section to another.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Throttle Linkages</B></FONT> </CENTER>   
 <P>  The throttle cable, or linkage, controls the throttle valve by   
   connecting it to the accelerator pedal. Pressing on the pedal causes   
   the linkage to open the throttle plate and the choke plate. This   
   causes air to rush through the barrel.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Fuel Vapor Canister</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The fuel vapor canister is used by the vapor recovery system to trap   
   fuel from the carburetor float bowl and fuel tank. Starting the   
   engine causes the vacuum port in the canister to pull fresh air into   
   the canister to clean out the trapped fuel vapor. The trapped fuel   
   vapor is then fed into the carburetor to be burned.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Gas Pedal</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The gas, or accelerator, pedal is connected to the throttle valve by   
   the throttle cable, or linkage. Pressing on the pedal causes the   
   linkage to open the throttle valve, and thereby increase engine   
   speed. A return spring on the throttle valve returns the pedal to its  
   normal position when foot pressure pedal is released.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Vacuum Hoses and Motors</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Vacuum lines are a series of hoses, or tubing, to the intake   
   manifold. These hoses supply vacuum to various components of the  
   engine, such as the emissions control system.   
  
   <P>Most air conditioning systems have vacuum motors to open and close  
   the doors on the air conditioning ducts. A vacuum motor is just a  
   small diaphragm with connecting rods to activate the valves of the  
   system. They have the advantages of simplicity and quietness.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Lever Return Spring</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  A return spring, or restoring spring, is a coil spring that moves   
   something, such as a valve or diaphragm back to its normal position   
   and holds it there.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Diaphragm Return Spring</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The diaphragm return spring is a stiff coil spring that pushes the   
   diaphragm upward, flexing it in an upward direction.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Turbocharger Impeller</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The impeller is a wheel like device with a series of curved fins or   
   vanes. As the impeller whirls, the air is drawn in at the center and   
   thrown off at the rim; the air is then forced into the passage at   
   increased pressure. The impeller shaft connects the impeller with the  
   turbine.   
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Fuel Tank Filler Neck</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The fuel tank filler neck is a long tube that goes down to the center  
   of the gas tank. It is also equipped with vapor return lines. Some  
   filling stations collect the fuel vapor as you fill your car.  
  
   <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Fuel Rail</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The fuel rail is a fuel line that connects all of the injectors in a  
   multipoint fuel injected system. It is usually 3/4" in diameter and  
   allows a constant fuel supply to each of the injectors, which act   
   independently. The fuel rail is filled with pressurized fuel from the  
   fuel pump.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Diesel Fuel Pump</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Diesel fuel pumps are designed to inject a specific amount of fuel at  
   a very specific time. They control the injectors by the pressure  
   waves of the fuel that they pump. They are usually linked to the  
   crankshaft or the camshaft through a series of gears. These gears  
   allow the fuel pump to be driven directly by the crankshaft of the  
   engine. However, some are belt driven and some are chain driven. The  
   diesel fuel pump has mechanisms in it which allows more or less fuel  
   to be pumped. If less fuel is pumped into the cylinders, this slows  
   the engine. Pumping more fuel increases the speed of the engine.  
   Consequently, the fuel pump regulates the speed of the diesel engine.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Diesel Fuel Injector</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The diesel fuel injector is a pressure valve, but it has specific   
   components that allow it to disperse the diesel fuel in set patterns,  
   depending on the design of the valve. Diesel fuel injectors receive  
   the pressurized impulse from the diesel fuel pump, and allow the fuel  
   to enter the combustion chamber when it is needed. If the diesel fuel  
   injectors get clogged, engine performance suffers.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Glow Plugs and Control</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Glow plugs are used to warm the fuel mixture within the precombustion  
   chamber in a diesel engine. A glow plug is an electric resistance  
   wire within a small housing that is raised to a certain temperature  
   when the engine is started (or "cold"). The fuel plug gets the fuel  
   mixture up to the proper ignition temperature. Once the engine is  
   warmed up, the glow plug control senses the temperature difference  
   and turns off the glow plugs until they are needed again.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Precombustion Chamber</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The precombustion chamber of a diesel engine is a small cavity, much  
   like the combustion chamber, only it is contained within a small  
   area. It allows a preignition state to exist. Once the fuel in the  
   precombustion chamber ignites, it can then ignite the fuel- air  
   mixture in the combustion chamber itself. In cold weather, the   
   precombustion chamber enables diesel engines to start more readily,  
   since the glow plug can easily warm the small volume within it. Under  
   normal operating conditions, the precombustion chamber allows a lean  
   mixture to be used, because it concentrates and ignites it within the  
   precombustion chamber before it disperses into the combustion  
   chamber.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Air as Fuel</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The substance your car burns the most of is air. Fuel is mixed with  
   the air at ratios of around 14.6:1. For every gallon of gas you burn,  
   you burn many, many cubic feet of air. The number of molecules of air  
   entering the combustion chamber each time the intake valve opens will  
   vary with the temperature of the air. Cold air is much more dense  
   (the molecules are packed together) than warm air, so cars often  
   perform better in cool weather. If more air gets into the chamber,  
   more power is produced. For this reason, engines running at high  
   altitudes or in especially hot climates have to be specially tuned to  
   get enough air to run properly. If the air is compressed by a  
   turbocharger or supercharger, more of it can be packed into the  
   cylinders. The result is the production of greater power when this  
   air is ignited.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Fuel Filler Cap</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Although all of us know how to use the fuel filler cap, it is   
   actually more complicated than it looks. Inside the fuel filler cap   
   is a pressure release valve. This allows it to vent the fumes in the  
   gas tank if they build up to predetermined levels. Until the fumes  
   reach these levels, they are shunted through the charcoal canister  
   which collects the fuel from the air before the air escapes. When the  
   fumes build up above the predetermined (differing from car to car)  
   threshold level of the fuel filler cap's pressure release valve, they  
   are vented into the atmosphere. The fuel filler cap has a rubber  
   flange around the neck. This flange should be inspected for cracks or  
   inflexibility. If the flange does become cracked or inflexible, it  
   should be replaced to keep the environment clean.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Electric Car Controls</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Operation is much like driving a car with an automatic transmission;  
   there is an accelerator that controls forward movement, and a brake  
   that when applied, slows the vehicle and at the same time recharges  
   the batteries. A button is pressed for reverse. The GM Impact uses  
   alternating current (AC) motors and a converter for utlizing the  
   battery's power, which is DC. The car's main power source is a special  
   battery pack. The main obstacle of battery power is its power to  
   weight ratio. Lead batteries weighing the same as a full tank of  
   gasoline have much less usable energy for the car to draw from. Also,  
   as batterys lose their power, the performance drops gradually, which  
   could be dangerous in traffic. There are many different battery  
   types being developed, but the majority of designs use either nickel  
   cadmium or lead-acid. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.   
   Depending on their design and cost, the batteries can take anywhere  
   from 20 minutes to ten hours to recharge. They provide ranges from 30  
   to 100 miles on a single charge.    
     
  <P> Another important part of the electric car is the electronic control  
   system. The energy management control, which encompasses both  
   acceleration and deceleration, controls and monitors the power  
   flow, and alerts the driver of a drop in power.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Hybrid Electric Cars</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
     
  <P> Volvo has explored building "hybrid" electric cars. The turbine hybrid  
   gives you the best of both worlds; the option of running pure  
   electric for urban driving, or turning on the gas-powered turbine  
   engine in hybrid mode for cruising.  The hybrid mode helps to  
   overcome the limited range and performance of a pure electric car.   
   Volvo has a test car that can top 100 mph in hybrid mode, runs up to  
   415 miles without refueling, and gets 45 mpg at a constant 55 mph.

  <P> A large number of American firms are developing electric cars.  
   General Motors has taken the lead with an electric car that is slated  
   for mass production in the mid 1990's, the Impact.  
  
  <P> The Impact can go from 0-60 in 8 seconds, has a range of about 80  
   miles per charge, and only requires about 3 hours to recharge on any  
   220v circuit. Little routine maintenance is required, and the cost  
   will be competitive with conventional gas-powered cars.

  <P> The electric car, scheduled for mass production in the mid 1990's,  
   offers many advantages over traditional gas powered autos of today.  
   The most obvious advantage is exhaust free operation.  As smog levels  
   continue to increase at an alarming rate, the need to lower emission  
   levels becomes more and more important.  With the advent of electric  
   cars, a dramatic reduction in the nitrogen oxides (NOx), and  
   nonmethane organic gases such as carbon monoxide and hyrocarbons is  
   possible.  These gases are major contributors to the deterioration of  
   the ozone layer. Also, the reduction of particulates (tiny particles  
   of dust, soot, smoke, and other matter floating in the air) would be  
   cut to almost zero.

   Auto makers in California will be required to sell 150,000 alternative  
   fuel vehicles annually, starting in 1996.  Also, fleet vehicles in the  
   nation's most polluted cities will be required to begin using  
   alternative fuel vehicles beginning in 1998. Many states have also  
   passed legislation to promote the use of alternative fuel vehicles.   
   Sales tax rebates and mandates requiring the sale of electric cars to  
   account for a certain percentage of total car sales annually, just to

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>	Why Is It Called An "Automobile"?	</B></FONT></CENTER> 			
                     
   <P>First let us consider the name, "automobile." Now, a "car" could have  
   been called anything and, sometimes, it is. Oliver Evans applied for  
   a U.S. patent in Philadelphia in 1792 on a steam land carriage, which  
   he called the "oruktor amphibolos!" We could have been strapped with  
   that name forever, if it weren't for more reasonable individuals  
   working on the same concept.  
  
  <P> Martini was a 14th Century Italian painter, who had been trained in   
   engineering. He designed (on paper) a man-propelled carriage, mounted  
   on four wheels. Each wheel was powered by a hand-turned capstan   
   arrangement. Gearing was also provided to transmit the rotation of   
   each capstan to the wheel below. It may have looked good on paper,   
   but the four turners of the capstans couldn't have kept it up for   
   long before they fell over with exhaustion. It is lucky for us that   
   Martini did not name his invention after himself, as many inventors   
   do. If he had, and the word had survived to the present, it might be   
   a little confusing. If we were offered a "Martini," we might not know  
   whether to drive it or drink it! (Representatives of MADD and SADD   
   would probably tell us to park it!) We could be reading headlines   
   like: ORUKTOR ACCIDENT TAKES THREE LIVES or UNITED MARTINI WORKERS ON  
   STRIKE.
<P> The really historical (and fortunate) aspect of Martini's   
   design is the name that he gave it: "automobile," from the Greek   
   word, "auto," (self) and the Latin word, "mobils," (moving). "Car,"   
   on the other hand, comes from an ancient Celtic word, "carrus,"   
   meaning cart or wagon.  
  
   <P>George B. Selden, an attorney in Rochester, New York, applied for,   
   and finally received, a patent for a "road machine" in 1879. The   
   Duryea brothers (1895) called their products "motor wagons." In 1896,  
   Henry Ford introduced an experimental car labeled the "Quadricycle."   
   Newspapers used words like autometon, motor-vique, oleo locomotive,   
   autokenetic, buggyaut, motor carriage, autobaine, automotor horse,   
   diamote, motorig, mocole, and, of course, the horseless carriage. In   
   1895, H. H. Kohlsaat, publisher of the Chicago Times-Herald, offered   
   a $500.00 prize for the best name for the motorized vehicles of the   
   day. The judges picked "motorcycle" as the winner. "Quadricycle" was   
   a favorite, as was "petrocar." The word "automobile" wasn't even in   
   the running! But in 1897, The New York Times prophesied, "...the new  
   mechanical wagon with the awful name -- automobile...has come to  
   stay..."   
  
  <P> Many of the words that are associated with automobiles are derived   
   from the French; i.e, garage, chauffeur, limousine, and chassis are   
   just some examples.  
  
                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Where Did The Idea Come From?  
</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  <P> No one person can be credited for the invention of the automobile  
   that you are driving today. It has developed bit by bit from the  
   ideas, imagination, fantasy, and tinkering of hundreds of individuals  
   through hundreds of years.  
  
   <P>In the 13th-century, the English philosopher-scientist, Roger Bacon,  
   said that "cars can be made so that without animals they will move  
   with unbelievable rapidity." Oh, Roger, if you only knew! Bacon was  
   positive that these vehicles had existed in ancient times, but he  
   didn't know what propelled them.  
  
   <P>The Greeks apparently had their own Olympic assembly line. In the  
   "Iliad," Haephestus (the Roman "Vulcan"), was the god of fire and  
   invention. When he had time off from making thunder bolts and  
   beautiful jewelry for the vain goddesses, he built three-wheeled  
   vehicles, which moved from place to place under their own power.   
   Homer says they were "self-moved, obedient to the gods," and would  
   Homer lie? The really remarkable thing about this is that even as far  
   back as the Homeric era (8th-9th (?) century B.C.), man had already  
   imagined automobiles.  
  
  <P> The motorized vehicle is, indeed, a prime example of creeping  
   development; i.e., invention through slow accumulation of bits and  
   pieces over a time so long that it is hard to pin down its origin.   
   Thomas Russell Ybarra, in this century, wrote rhyming doggerel which  
   pointed to the automobile as a Roman invention. Those who care to can  
   point to two 15th-century Italians: Francesco di Giorgio Martini  
   (whose concept has been presented in another section) and Leonardi Da  
   Vinci. Da Vinci conceived an armor-plated war vehicle, the propulsion  
   system of which is much like that of Martini's. This particular  
   concept of Da Vinci did not contribute anything of value, not even a  
   name, as did Martini's.   
  
   <P>The important thing to remember is the automobile is not some recent  
   idea that popped up in the 19th-century, or the 18th, or even the  
   14th. It is a creation that has charmed imagination and inventiveness  
   before man was able to conceive how to make it go. Perhaps that is  
   why Homer placed it in the hands of the gods.  
  
               <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Ups and Downs in Automotive Progress</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P> As early as 1600, the Dutch, no strangers to wind power, had built a  
   wind-powered, sail-mounted carriage. These carriages were reported to  
   hold several passengers and move at speeds as high as twenty miles  
   per hour. These tests were abandoned in favor of small windmills  
   built onto the carriage, with mill vanes geared to the wheels. In  
   either case, whether equipped with sails or windmills, they never  
   caught on; mostly because they could not move except on the whim of a  
   breeze. However, they were probably the first real land vehicles to  
   move under power, other than that of animal or human muscle. While  
   the Dutch dreamed in terms of the wind, others were thinking of other  
   means of propulsion. In the 1700s, a Frenchman, Jacques de Vaucanson  
   (no relation to the Roman god, Vulcan), built a vehicle which was  
   powered by an engine based on the workings of a clock. What he  
   neglected to calculate was that any clock which was capable of moving  
   a vehicle with passengers would have to outweigh the load it was  
   carrying. Even winding such a clock motor would take great time and  
   greater effort than it was worth.  
  
 <P>  Inventors in England, France, Germany and other countries worked on  
   the idea of a compressed-air engine, but they were unable to find the  
   solution to self-propulsion in this means. However, in their efforts,  
   they contributed significant individual elements to the picture;  
   elements like valves, pistons, cylinders, and connecting rods, and an  
   emerging idea of how each of these elements related to the other. The  
   first invention that can truly and logically be called an  
   "automobile" was a heavy, three-wheeled, steam-driven, clumsy vehicle  
   built in 1769 by Captain Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, a French Army  
   engineer. (Cugat was actually born in Switzerland, but the French  
   don't want to hear about it.) This mechanism was slow, ponderous, and  
   only moved by fits and starts. In tests, it carried four passengers  
   at a slow pace - a little over two miles per hour - and had to stop  
   every twenty minutes to build a fresh head of steam. It was, however,  
   a self-powered, steerable, wheeled, people transporter, thereby  
   demonstrating that the idea of mobilization was workable. Unhappily,  
   Cugot's superiors were not men of vision and failed to appreciate the  
   potential of his creation. To show him how they really felt, they  
   disallowed him any funds for further development and transferred him  
   to other duties. Since they had paid good money for this contraption,  
   however, they preserved the vehicle, and it can still be seen in the  
   Paris museum, where it is displayed with proper national pride.   
  
 <P>  In the meantime, Great Britain, who believed themselves to be the  
   masters of steam, had begun to believe that they could put this same  
   steam on wheels. It was probably natural that they believed this;  
   Thomas Savery, an English engineer, had given the world its first  
   steam engine in 1698. This engine was crude (by our standards),  
   inefficient, and blew up at intervals. Thomas Newcomen, an English  
   blacksmith in 1711, turned out a better, less dangerous version of  
   the engine. Then, in 1679, James Watt, a Scottish instrument maker,  
   had patented a truly improved steam engine that became widely used in  
   British mills, mines, and factories. Sir Isaac Newton, in 1680,  
   conceived of the idea of a carriage propelled by a "rearwardly  
   directed jet of steam." (It didn't amount to much at the time, but  
   Sir Isaac's concept has become the means of rearwardly directed jets  
   to provide the thrust for rockets to probe space.) Then, in 1801, an  
   engineer in Cornwall, Richard Trevithick, built a road steamer, which  
   was first tested in a Christmas Eve snowfall. Two years later, he  
   built an improved model with drive wheels ten feet in diameter, which  
   proved to be capable of sustained, reliable performance at speeds up  
   to twelve miles per hour.  
  
  <P> Others were also working on steam propulsion in Germany, Denmark,  
   Sweden, France, and the United States. The Evans vehicle, the  
   "oruktor amphibolos" referred to earlier, was thirty feet long and  
   weighed fifteen tons. It was really intended for dredging the harbor  
   and was the world's first amphibious conveyance. On it first run in  
   1804, it clanked along on huge iron wheels, frightening Philadelphia  
   onlookers out of their skivvies, before entering the Schuylkill  
   River, where its propulsive energy was converted to a stern paddle  
   wheel. Another American inventor, Richard Dudgeon, was experimenting  
   with steam-mobiles. One was destroyed in a fire in 1858 in the famous  
   Crystal Palace in New York City; another, built about ten years  
   later, was banned from the streets by the civic leaders. Britain  
   actually was where the steamers made their greatest impact. By the  
   1830s, they had set up a limited network which provided both  
   passenger and freight service to a handful of cities. The public was  
   awed, amused, and sometimes bitter. Some complained that the road  
   steamers were noisy, which they were; and some complained that they  
   were dangerous, which was occasionally true. But, as is natural, the  
   loudest complaints came from vested interests, horse-drawn vehicles  
   and railroads, who were afraid of losing business. Because of the  
   pressure, in 1865, the British Parliament adopted the "Red Flag Act,"  
   which limited steamers to a speed of four miles an hour on the open  
   road and to two miles an hour in the city. It required a crew of  
   three men: one walking sixty yards ahead, with a red flag by day and  
   a lantern at night, to warn of the vehicle's approach. Stymied by  
   these restrictions, several British engineers turned their thoughts  
   and attention to electricity as a promising alternative to steam. One  
   can imagine that the automobile may have progressed very differently  
   if not for these restrictions.  
  
  <P> It takes courage to effect revolutionary changes of any kind, and  
   there were some formidable tinkerers in the horse-drawn carriage,  
   nineteenth century; men like William Murdock, William Henry James,  
   William Symington, Sir Goldsworthy Gurney and Walter Hancock, Charles  
   Dallery, Etienne Lenoir, Amedee Bollee-Pere, Siegfried Marcus, Thomas  
   Blanchard, William Janes, Nathan Read, Apollos Kinsey, Sylvester  
   Roper, Carl Benz, and Gottlieb Daimler.  
  
                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>     Shocking Developments</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The first electric-powered road vehicle is believed to have been  
   built in Scotland about 1839 by Robert Anderson, but it, along with  
   others within the next several years, were generally unsuccessful.   
   The steamer had to wait for a boiler to build up pressure and was  
   very noisy besides. The concept of an electrical engine that could  
   start immediately and run quietly was very attractive at that time.   
   There were disadvantages, however. Electric batteries were heavy,  
   bulky, unreliable, and needed recharging after a short run. In 1880,  
   there was a general improvement in the development of longer-lasting  
   batteries. There still existed, however, excessive weight and bulk of  
   the batteries and a need for frequent rechargings, although electric  
   cabs appeared on the streets of London in the late 1800s.  
  
  <P> Steamers and electric vehicles gained only restricted acceptance on  
   the continent as well. In France, the electric had a shining, brief  
   hour of public acclaim when Camille Jenatzy, driving a Jeantaud  
   electric, pushed the cigar-shaped vehicle to a record of sixty miles  
   per hour on April 29, 1899. The high-speed run, however, burned out  
   the specially fabricated batteries and the interest in electrics died  
   almost as soon as the cheers of the attending public.  
  
  <P> It was in America that steamers and electric cars gained their most  
   sustained measure of success. Eventually twenty different U.S. car  
   companies would produce electrics; and in the peak of popularity,  
   1912, nearly 35,000 were operating on American roads. But even  
   America could not shake the limitations of the bulky batteries and  
   the short ranges between recharging. Steamers were actually more  
   popular. More than 100 American plants were making steamers, the most  
   famous of which were the Stanley brothers factory in Newton,  
   Massachusetts. The "Stanley Steamer" had the affectionate nickname,  
   "The Flying Teapot," and with good reason. In 1906, a Stanley Steamer  
   was clocked at 127.6 miles per hour on the sands of Ormond Beach,  
   Florida. In spite of this, the steamers, along with the electrics,  
   were only living on borrowed time. Experiments were being made on an  
   automobile powered by a gasoline-fueled, internal-combustion engine,  
   and the steamers and electrics would not survive the impact of the  
   coming collision.   
  
  <P> Internal-combustion automobiles did not just burst forth on the scene  
   all of a sudden to crowd the electrics and steamers off the road. The  
   theories of internal-combustion engines had been on the way ever  
   since 1860, when Etienne Lenoir applied to the authorities in Paris  
   for a patent on his invention, an internal-combustion engine powered  
   by coal gas. Two years later, Lenoir hooked his engine to a carriage,  
   and, although it was crude, it worked. It worked so poorly and so  
   slowly (about one mile an hour), however, that he became discouraged  
   and abandoned his efforts.   
  
 <P>  In 1864, a resourceful Austrian in Vienna, Siegfried Marcus, built a  
   one-cylinder engine that incorporated a crude carburetor and a  
   magneto arrangement to create successive small explosions that  
   applied alternating pressure against the piston within the cylinder.   
   Bolting his engine to a cart, Siegfried geared the piston to the rear  
   wheels, and while a strong assistant lifted the rear of the cart off  
   the ground, Siegfried started the engine. The wheels began to turn  
   and continued to turn with each successive "pop." Marcus signaled the  
   assistant to lower the cart and watched it burp along for about 500  
   feet before it ran out of fuel. Ten years later, he built the new,  
   improved version of his motorcar, and then, mysteriously washed his  
   hands of the entire thing, saying it was a waste of time. (The second  
   model, which is preserved in an Austrian museum, was refurbished and  
   taken for a test run in Vienna in 1950. It reached a top speed of ten  
   miles per hour on level ground.)  
  
  <P> Although Lenoir and Marcus did not have the grit and determination to  
   pursue their enterprises, they made some valuable contributions to  
   the theory of internal-combustion engines. It would be overstating  
   the case to credit them with the creation of the internal-combustion  
   automobile, however.  
  
                  <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>         Get A Horse!</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The proud owner of a new horseless carriage often loaded his family  
   into the machine while the neighbors ogled with envy. Invariably, the  
   budding driver would over-dramatize the ritual of donning his gloves,  
   checking his equipment, and cranking the engine into sputtering,  
   back-firing action, while onlookers held their ears. With heads held  
   high, the driver and passengers would then begin their baptismal trek  
   into the country, beaming with arrogant satisfaction. They would take  
   the way which would lead them past the "right people," of course. If  
   ever there was a "thrill of a lifetime," this was it. But such were  
   the ways of life in those days that such joyous beginnings didn't  
   always have a happy ending.  
  
 <P>  Somewhere along the way, the tiny engine would start to cough and  
   sputter. The driver would assure his frightened passengers that there  
   was nothing to worry about, but the mechanical hiccuping continued.   
   The driver's assurances would waiver, and when the motor finally  
   died, the ego-deflated owner suffered the pangs of the damned. When  
   no amount of tinkering, kicking, or cursing would revive the engine,  
   the humiliating trip to the nearest farm would have to take place.   
   The farmer would probably be glad to add to the driver's mental  
   anguish by making remarks about "them new-fangled contraptions," but  
   with some degree of stability, he would harness his team and hitch it  
   to the front of the horseless carriage.   
  
 <P> Now gone were the proud airs; mother and daughter blushed with shame  
   as they were towed back homeward past their snickering neighbors.   
   Young sons usually enjoyed the experience, but father was ready to  
   explode. The team of horses, as slow, expensive, and old-fashioned as  
   they were, got the final horse laugh. It seems right, somehow, that  
   the term "horse-power" has continued to be a measurement of the  
   automobile's mechanical muscle. The animal has certainly contributed  
   so much to civilization that it needs some lasting remembrance with  
   the vehicle which unceremoniously dumped it from public favor. The  
   horse was not just replaced, he was caught up in a competitive  
   situation which saw him maligned by copyrighters, ridiculed by a new  
   strain of high-powered merchants, called auto dealers, and he was  
   even attacked by health authorities, who saw the motor car as an end  
   of manure heaps, disease-toting flies, and assorted other pollution.   
  
  <P> Anyone who has ever walked down-wind of a livery stable knows that  
   the horse had an aromatic drawback. It was also easy for the sly  
   advertiser to win over a public, who was plagued with a need for  
   sticky flypaper, insect traps, and foul-smelling sprays. No one  
   envisioned that the motor car would be all health and happiness,  
   either, but the economic argument was hammered home by automobile  
   publicists. They pointed out that each horse in the U.S. required the  
   production of five acres of land and twenty man-days of work per  
   year. Ransom E. Olds, writing in "Scientific American" before 1900,  
   took an swing at the horse when he advertised a new steam carriage:  
   "It never kicks or bites, never tires on long runs, and never sweats  
   in hot weather. It does not require care in the stable and eats only  
   while on the road." William A. White, a famed editor and horse-lover,  
   wrote, "...he makes no claim to speed, but his carburetor always  
   works, and while he has but two cylinders, he brings his guests back  
   in one piece at home rather than downtown at the undertaker's to be  
   assembled by total strangers..."  
  
 <P>  Stories of runaways, overturned buggies and other accidents due to  
   horses were widely exaggerated and overdramatized. Of 476 equine  
   accidents, analyzed by a prominent magazine, only two were reportedly  
   caused because the horses involved were frightened by automobiles.   
   This statistical whitewash was to refute the common complaint that  
   motor cars were scaring otherwise good, tame horses. The anti-horse  
   faction, always looking for new ammunition, made the most of a  
   vicious heat wave which hit New York City in July of 1911. About  
   1,200 horses dropped dead of heat exposure, and it was quickly  
   pointed out that motor cars and trucks continued to function without  
   difficulty or detriment to the health of the populace. The once  
   overwhelming notes of rebuttal began to flag, and in spite of the  
   fact that there were 25,000,000 horses in the country in 1912, Dobbin  
   was definitely "out," and the "Betsy" was "in."  
  
  <P> This transition from a centuries-old form of land transportation to  
   one of automobiles was not easy, and it did not just happen in a day  
   or two. The horse was, after all, an important part of the economy.   
   Feed and veterinary bills amounted to millions of dollars each year.   
   The Chicago Times reported that horseshoes in 1915 required enough  
   iron to build 60,000 motor cars. Harness makers, buggy-whip  
   companies, carriage builders, livery stable operators, blacksmiths,  
   an army of street cleaners, wheelwrights and even hitching-post  
   manufacturers were all affected by the technological development of  
   automobiles. These companies had to either re-tool and adapt to the  
   industry or face the realities of a declining business.  
  
   <P>The coming of WWI spurred the production of motor vehicles, and also  
   upped the need for horses and mules. After the signing of Armistice,  
   however, the final turning point came. From then on, it was really  
   downhill for the horse - not into oblivion, fortunately, but to a  
   minor role of race tracks, rodeos, show rings, riding clubs, and Wild  
   West movies. The horse retired to greener pastures (or to the glue  
   factory) and became only a legend in transportation and agriculture.  
  
                   <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> It's Just Another Statistic</B></FONT></CENTER>   
  
  <P> From the very first, automobiles have attracted each other like  
   magnets, even when there were only two in the same town. The first  
   incident (or accident) occurred when horse met car. The car-haters  
   over-dramatized the runaways and foretold all sorts of catastrophes  
   for the future. On the other hand, the motorists blamed it on the  
   horses and predicted a great new day of personal transportation. Each  
   side had an element of truth. There was no question that the  
   automobile was a boon to mankind, but it was also to prove to be a  
   killer of people, a destroyer of property, and the accomplice of  
   criminals.   
  
  <P> Even in the beginning of the automobile age, when numbers were few  
   and bad roads limited the amount of traffic, deaths due to accidents  
   in automobiles began to mount. Before the U.S. entered WWI, auto  
   accidents had killed more than 36,000 Americans. By comparison, only  
   22,424 had lost their lives in the Revolutionary War, the War of  
   1812, the Mexican War, and the Spanish-American War combined. This  
   trend to kill more people with cars than with weapons worsened as the  
   years rolled by.   
  
   <P>Before the turn of the century, anti-horseless carriage sentiments  
   began to express themselves in restrictive regulations. In the late  
   1890s, Louis Greenough and Harry Adams of Pierre, South Dakota, built  
   a homemade car out of an Elkhart wagon and a two-cylinder Wolverine  
   gas motor, hoping to haul passengers at the county fair. They were  
   not only denied permission to haul passengers, the authorities would  
   not even let them bring their contraption inside the city limits.   
   Automobiles were banned in the streets of many cities: Boston,  
   Chicago and Bar Harbor, Maine, to name a few. In Massachusetts, an  
   act to require that all cars be equipped with a bell which would ring  
   with each wheel revolution was voted down, as was one for shooting  
   off roman candles to warn of the vehicle's approach. There were laws  
   that required motorists to stop completely while buggies, surreys and  
   freight wagons dragged by. Speed limits as low as two and three mile  
   per hour were imposed by a few cities and towns. In some, night-time  
   driving was prohibited. In 1907, Glencoe, Illinois, built humps in  
   the streets to discourage speeding. Three years earlier, they had  
   stretched a steel cable across the road to stop the "devil wagons."  
   Most of this was antagonism rather than an attempt to accomplish  
   constructive regulations.   
  
  <P> While the jumble of confusing ordinances continued to plague pioneer  
   motorists, a new wrinkle was added: the "speed trap." In smaller  
   towns, particularly, marshals and other law officials lay in wait for  
   unsuspecting drivers, timing them by stop-watch or "by guess and by  
   gosh." Some lawmen were authorized to shoot at tires or to stretch  
   chains or wire across the road. Until the motorcycle became a police  
   vehicle, the local sheriff's office was somewhat limited in their  
   pursuit of fleeing cars, since they were either on foot or on  
   bicycles.   
  
  <P>Motorists tried to find ways to defend themselves. One way was by  
   organization, and in 1902, the American Automobile Association was  
   formed in Chicago to take up the pennant for the motor car operator.   
   That same year, the city passed an ordinance prohibiting the driver  
   of a car to wear "pince-nez" glasses. The A.A.A. proved to be a good  
   watchdog for its members as it fostered realistic regulations and  
   fought against abusive police action, especially the common practice  
   of arresting owners of expensive cars on the premise that such people  
   could afford to pay a stiffer fine.   
  
  <P> In the middle of this confusion, there seemed to be no stemming the  
   growing tide of accidents. It was a case of simple arithmetic; more  
   cars meant more collisions. With each year, too, the autos were made  
   faster and more powerful. Narrow roads with no shoulders and sharp,  
   unbanked curves simply couldn't accommodate speed runs, and from the  
   beginning, auto owners have had the desire to "see how fast she'll  
   go." Gradually, the automobile was accepted as a permanent fixture,  
   and traffic regulations shifted from anti-car priority to that of  
   anti-accident.   
  
  <P> On October 13, 1913, The National Council for Industrial Safety  
   opened a three-room headquarters in Chicago. The original emphasis  
   had been on the "industrial," but in that year, the Public Safety  
   Commission of Chicago and Cook County reported that in July, twenty  
   people had been killed by automobiles, eighteen of them children.  
   The commission launched an education program - with leaflets and  
   slides - in the schools and parks, and the new NCIS realized that the  
   motor car would have to be the subject of its most intense study. In  
   1914, the organization's name was changed to The National Safety  
   Council, and it began to the compile statistics on automobile  
   accidents. From 1913, when the death toll was 4,000, or 4.4% of a  
   100,000 population, it rose, in 1930, to 32,900, or 26.7%.   
  
  <P> The desire to "do something about it" was growing among Americans  
   everywhere; but the urge to find unfettered freedom in a fast car was  
   even stronger. In 1914, Detroit installed a manually-operated  
   stop-and-go sign. In August that year an electrical traffic signal  
   was put in operation at 105th and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.   
   The Ford Motor Company gave each car purchaser a card reminding him  
   to "Stop, Look, and Listen," at all railroad crossings. Magazines and  
   newspaper articles carried "don't drink and drive" cartoons; this  
   cooled off during the prohibition when "nobody" was drinking. But  
   bootleggers, in their big touring cars, and the bathtub gin guzzlers,  
   in their sporty rumble seat models, continued to add to the highway  
   toll.   
  
 <P> In 1924, the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety, whose  
   chairman was the Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, authorized a  
   committee to draft a uniform motor vehicle code for all forty-eight  
   states. Two years later, the laws were presented and adopted by the  
   second conference. The individual states didn't move so quickly, and  
   some adopted the package in their own time, but a standardized code  
   of laws was a major achievement of effective nation-wide traffic  
   regulations.  
  
 <P>  Die-hard horse-lovers saw the entire development with an "I told you  
   so" attitude. They knew that the nation was going to suffer for its  
   folly in permitting roads to be over-run with those mechanical  
   contraptions. They were snickering in the wilderness, however. The  
   automobile had a solid footing in America, and no amount of finger  
   pointing could make it go away. Men began to feel that buying a car  
   was like taking a bride, you just have to take what you get, for  
   better or for worse.  
  
                <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>   Internal-Combustion Inventors</B></FONT></CENTER>  
  
  <P>Lenoir and Marcus had shown the feasibility of the  
   internal-combustion engines, but both lacked faith in their own  
   enterprises and abandoned their efforts. Closest to the mark in the  
   judgment of historians is another pair of inventors who had faith in  
   the future of the motorcar as well as in themselves. They worked  
   doggedly (and unbeknownst to each other) to find the missing pieces  
   of a puzzle that had been plaguing automotive inventors through the  
   years: how to propel the horseless carriage.  
  
  <P> Carl Freidrich Benz and Gottlich Wilhelm Daimler worked separately  
   (and at almost the same moment) in Germany; each designing and  
   building the world's first commercially successful cars. These are,  
   for all intents and purposes, the direct linear antecedents of the  
   modern automobile.  
  
   <P>Benz's first creation was not very impressive, either in design nor  
   in initial road test. It was a fragile, carriage-like three-wheeler  
   with tubular framework, mounted on a Benz-designed, one-horsepower,  
   one-cylinder engine. The engine was a refinement of the four-stroke  
   engine designed by Nikolaus Otto (another German), who had refined  
   his from Lenoir's two-stroke engine. Even though Benz's creation was  
   awkward and frail, it incorporated some essential elements that would  
   characterize the modern vehicle: electrical ignition, differential,  
   mechanical valves, carburetor, engine cooling system, oil and grease  
   cups for lubrication, and a braking system. He obtained a patent on a  
   "carriage with gasoline engine" in 1886.  
  
  <P>About seventy-five miles from Carl Benz, Daimler worked diligently to  
   design a better internal-combustion engine. He was satisfied that he  
   had succeeded in 1833, when he took out a patent on what he believed  
   was a more efficient, four-stroke, gasoline-fueled engine. He first  
   mounted his engine on a sturdy bicycle, a two-wheeler, which ran  
   satisfactorily on its test run in 1885. This was the prototype of the  
   modern motorcycle. In 1887, Daimler, encouraged by this success and  
   by experience, installed his engine in a four-wheeled, two-passenger  
   vehicle. The engine had only a few more horsepower than Benz's, but  
   it was lighter and ran at a much higher speed - 900 rpm as compared  
   to Benz's 300 rpm. It was the first example of a high-speed,  
   internal- combustion engine.  
  
 <P>  Daimler and Benz argued heatedly concerning each other's claim to  
   fame and prestige. Daimler insisted that he had successfully tested  
   his engine on a bicycle before Benz had patented his tricycle and  
   had, in any case, been the first to patent a four-wheeled car. Benz  
   conceded that Daimler invented the motorcycle, but he insisted his  
   tricycle was the first motorcar. These claims are still argued to  
   this day by people who care; historians give both men a lot of  
   credit: Daimler for his high-speed engine; Benz for the features of  
   water cooling, electric ignition and differential gears. Benz and  
   Daimler continued separately and competitively, to develop improved  
   engines and refined vehicles to put them in. When Gottlich died in  
   1900, his company removed his name from the car he had created and  
   affixed "Mercedes," for Mercedes Jellinck, the daughter of an  
   influential distributor who lived in France. In 1926, when Carl Benz  
   was 82 (he lived three more years), the companies merged into one  
   firm. These two inventive giants, who worked so hard and lived less  
   than seventy-five miles apart, never met one another, but they poised  
   the world for entry into the Automobile Age. Just as the 19th-century  
   was making its way into the 20th, the world was little inclined to be  
   led in the direction of automobiles - except for those who had money  
   enough to indulge their fancies, and in France, where motorcar  
   production was beginning to assume some significant economical  
   measures.  
  
  <P> The wide boulevards of Paris, and the fine paved roads radiating out  
   of the French capital, were ideal settings for rich sportsmen to show  
   off their noisy toys. By 1895, there were so many self-propelled  
   vehicles puttering around the city that the French Academy coined a  
   new word to the French language to describe them. The word was  
   "automobile."  
  
  <P> One of the first vehicles to be officially designated an automobile  
   was a car which is now considered to be the real prototype of modern  
   cars. It was a Daimler-powered vehicle built in 1892 by the Parisian  
   carriage-making firm, Panhard and Levassor. The "Panhard" marked the  
   appearance of the automobile's classic design: engine in front,  
   supplying power to a gearbox behind it; gearbox connected by chain  
   drive to the rear drive wheels. It had four forward speeds and a  
   reverse, and an 1894 model made headlines when it covered a 750-mile  
   distance from Paris to Rouen in forty-eight hours at an average speed  
   of fifteen miles per hour.  
  
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>         Is It A Car? Is It A Plane? No, It's A Bicycle!</B></FONT></CENTER>   
  <P> Although the first automobiles were called "horseless carriages," and  
   they were, indeed, little more than motorized versions of horse-drawn  
   vehicles, the automobile owes much more to the bicycle than it does  
   to the buggy. It has been explained in a prior chapter that Daimler  
   tested his high-speed engine on a bicycle and developed the world's  
   first motorcycle. Bicyclists, too, generated the first movement for  
   good roads and set the stage for motoring in America.  
  
  <P> Automotive advancement in America was hampered by the need of roads.   
   Bicyclists, however, generated a national good roads movement in the  
   early 1890s, which culminated with the establishment of the U.S.   
   Office of Road Inquiry under the Department of Agriculture in 1893.   
   This later evolved into the Bureau of Public Roads.   
  
   <P>In fact, the American bicycle industry of the 1890s is really a  
   sponsor of the automobile industry. Many pioneers in automotives were  
   men who were experienced in manufacturing bicycles. Charles and Frank  
   Duryea introduced the first successful American internal- combustion  
   engine in 1893. Charles was a skilled bicycle mechanic. Alexander  
   Winston, a bicycle manufacturer, made the first American  
   high-performance car in 1897, a twelve-horsepower model that tested  
   out at 33.7 miles per hour. Henry Ford, a tinkerer, used many bicycle  
   parts, including a saddle, on his first "quadricyle" in 1896. There  
   were twenty-seven American bicycle manufacturers in 1890, and many of  
   these played significant roles in the development of the automobile.  
   The Pope Manufacturing Company opened a motor-carriage department in  
   1897 to produce Columbia cars, using the popularity of their Columbia  
   bicycles as a sales incentive. Another manufacturer, Rambler  
   bicycles, was so successful with their Rambler automobiles that they  
   concentrated solely on the cars and stopped producing bicycles  
   altogether.  
  
  <P>The first car manufacturers were dependent on the bicycle firms for  
   many of the parts they needed: lightweight tubing, gears, chain  
   drives, ball and roller bearings, wire wheels, pneumatic tires,  
   tools, and sometimes, even the space in which they needed to work.   
   The first car dealers were also recruited and converted from the  
   bicycle dealers. The best place to buy a really fine car at the turn  
   of the century was at the local bicycle shop.  
  
       <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                 America! America!</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
   <P>The greatest legend in the American automobile development is the   
   common belief that the car is an American institution. The American  
   car inventors were really Johnny-come-latelys, when it came to  
   producing the automobile, but once they got going, they made up for  
   all the centuries of lost time.  
  
 <P>  Although the automobile was becoming an increasingly familiar sight  
   in Europe in the 1890s, it was considered a freakish contraption in  
   the United States. Roads were poor and few. Americans finally became  
   receptive to the idea of the automobile when they realized that, with  
   a car, they could go where they wanted to go without having to use  
   the railroad.  
  
  <P> Detroit is not the original forge where the U.S. auto industry took  
   shape: Hartford, Cleveland, and at least a dozen other places have  
   better credentials. Many men and hundreds of hours of creating,  
   designing, and hard work went into the creation of American cars.  
   Several crude, experimental motorized buggies had been built in the  
   U.S. before the Duryea brothers built the first successful,  
   internal-combustion car in 1892-93.  
  
   <P>A carriage maker in Flint, Michigan, William C. Durant designed a   
   motorcar and went on to organize Buick, General Motors, and   
   Chevrolet. George M. Pierce made bird cages, bicycles and finally,   
   automobiles--Pierce-Arrows. Charles W. Nash made the Nash. In 1954   
   the Nash Kelvinator Corp. merged with the Hudson Motor Car Company to  
   become the American Motors Corporation.  
  
  <P> Car designers came from all areas and occupations. Some succeeded,   
   but most failed. Then, along came the son of a Michigan farmer. His  
   name was Henry Ford.  
  
   <P>In 1879, Henry Ford was sixteen years old when he got a job in   
   Detroit. In his spare time he built an internal-combustion engine   
   from plans he found in a magazine. It was a bicycle-wheeled,   
   tiller-steered two-seater, without brakes or reverse gear. It was so  
   noisy that it was condemned by the public as a nuisance.   
  
 <P> In 1898, he built an improved vehicle, but it failed in a year.   
   Finally he produced an automobile that was bigger, more powerful, and  
   much faster. A well-known bicycle rider drove the car in a race and  
   won. The publicity got Ford financial backing.  
  
  <P> The first popular car was a roadster, the "Oldsmobile," designed as  
   an economy car by Ransom E. Olds. This car had two seats and a   
   one-cylinder, three-horsepower engine.  
  <P>
   In 1900, only 8,000 cars were registered in the U.S. Olds introduced  
   quantity production, and became a very rich man. The car sold for  
   $650, about half the price of competitors. Sales zoomed from 425 in  
   1901, to 6,500 in 1905.  
  
  <P> Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903. Ford first brought  
   out the Model A: a small, two cylinder car with an eight- horsepower  
   engine, which sold for $850. The next year, the Model B Ford was  
   added, a four-cylinder, which sold for $2,000. In 1906, Ford added  
   the Model K, an important milestone.  
  
   In 1906, New York held two auto shows. In Madison Square Garden,   
   there were 220 exhibits; the 69th Regiment Armory show had 205   
   exhibitors. Ford's Model K, introduced at Madison Square Garden, was  
   big, heavy, expensive and a mistake. It could go 60 mph with its  
   six-cylinder, 40-horsepower engine. It sold for $2,800, $2,000 more  
   than a Cadillac. Ford lost money on every one sold, so he   
   concentrated on a light, simple, rugged model that could be sold   
   inexpensively; what he termed "the universal automobile."   
  
  <P> The new design was called the Model T. Adapted from the model N, it  
   was solidly constructed, and easy to operate and repair. Its chassis  
   was high to provide good clearance. A four-cylinder engine produced  
   20-horsepower in two forward speeds and a reverse. In 1909, the least  
   expensive Model T got about thirty miles to the gallon. Customers  
   responded to the advantages of the Model T, and new, plants were  
   constructed. Production increased from 10,000 in 1909 to 78,000 in  
   1912. In 1913, Ford found a better, faster way to build cars.  
  
 <P> In 1914, Ford opened the world's first auto assembly line. Production  
   jumped to 472,000; a car could be turned out in 93 minutes. In 1924,  
   when half of the cars in the world were Fords, the Model T sold for  
   $290 and profits piled up. The last "tin lizzy" (the 15,007,003rd)  
   rolled off the production line in 1927. It was truly the "universal  
   car," in every corner of the world.  
  
   <P>The eighteen-year supremacy of the Ford caused the disappearance of  
   many of the smaller car companies and the emergence of others. One of  
   the consolidators was the General Motors Corporation. William C.  
   Durant bought out the Buick Motor Company in 1904. He incorporated  
   General Motors in 1908 and merged Buick, Cadillac, Oldsmobile and  
   Oakland (Pontiac) into a single corporation. Ford's monopoly ended  
   after WWI; other manufacturers began to make cheaper, more attractive  
   cars. In 1916, the Chevrolet Motor Company put out a four-cylinder  
   model that eventually passed the Ford as the best-selling car in  
   America.  
  
   <P>Another strong competitor of the Model T was a tough four-cylinder   
   Dodge manufactured by John and Horace Dodge. By 1924, they assembled  
   1,000 cars per day. Four years later the company was purchased for  
   what was then a world's record price of $175,000,000 by Walter P.  
   Chrysler, of the Chrysler Corporation. In 1928 the Chrysler  
   Corporation started selling Dodges, DeSotos Plymouths, and Chryslers.  
  
  <P> By 1928, competition had forced new standard equipment. The self-  
   starter was invented in 1911, resulting in more drivers. The car had  
   gone from a wooden, open vehicle to a steel, fully enclosed   
   year-round sedan. The modern automobile was mechanically "complete"  
   by 1929, when 4,587,400 cars were sold in the United States. All the  
   major mechanical developments since then have been improvements or  
   refinements of existing systems.  
  
  <P> Henry Ford did not create the automobile nor the automobile industry.  
   When he built his first internal-combustion engine from magazine  
   plans in 1896 and mounted it in a carriage, others had already built  
   better motor vehicles than his crude attempt. Those others must yield  
   the stage to Henry Ford in one aspect; it was he who captained the  
   manufacturing revolution. He jacked up the world and slid four wheels  
   under it. He said he would democratize the automobile and when he was  
   through, just about everyone would have a car. He kept his word. Life  
   would never be the same again.  
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Name It and It's Yours</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P> By 1911 the automobile industry had come into its own. Securities of  
   automotive companies were listed in the New York Stock Exchange. The  
   Ford Motor Company had been formed, and by 1908 had introduced the  
   historic Model T. The Buick Motor Company, the Olds Motor Works, the  
   Cadillac Automobile Company and the Oakland Motor Car Company had  
   already achieved individual success - and had been combined with  
   other firms by William Crapo Durant into the General Motors Company.   
   Durant then lost control of the organization and moved on to another  
   career, building and selling a new automobile, which had been  
   designed by and named for Louis Chevrolet, a French race driver.   
   Another promoter, Benjamin Briscoe, had brought together some 130  
   companies to create the United States Motor Car Corporation. This  
   ambitious merger soon ran into financial difficulties and ran into  
   receivership in 1912. Michigan, and especially Detroit, were now  
   established as centers of automobile production.  
  
   The general public took to motorized vehicles like moths to a flame.   
   While the heads of companies were inventing, merging, maneuvering,  
   suing, counter-suing, promoting, failing, or amassing fantastic  
   wealth, curious Americans from Oregon to Maine were interested enough  
   to open their wallets. Dealerships were set up in livery stables,  
   blacksmith shops and general stores in the largest cities and in the  
   smaller towns. Some of the mechanically-minded individuals assembled  
   their own vehicles, while others turned to their favorite source of  
   supply for anything - the Sears, Roebuck catalog - to order a motor  
   buggy "so safe that a child could run it."  
  
 <P>  Many of those who contributed to the automotive industry have faded  
   from memory and into historic oblivion (or those whose ideas were  
   stolen, into oblivion itself). Others have been engraved into  
   automobile history on nameplates. Walter Chrysler, Louis Chevrolet,  
   David Dunbar Buick, Ransom E. Olds, Henry Ford, John and Horace  
   Dodge, The White, Mack, and Duesenberg brothers have not been  
   forgotten. John Mohler Studebaker, John North Willys, Harry Stutz,  
   William Crapo Durant, Edwin Ross Thomas, Francis and Freelan Stanley,  
   Johathan Dixon Maxwell, Charles W. Nash, James Ward Packard, Thomas  
   B. Jeffery, E. L. Cord, George N. Pierce, Albert Augustus Pope,  
   Howard C. Marmon and others like them have a niche in the automotive  
   annuals because their names graced the automobiles and radiator caps  
   of their era.  
  
  <P>Only an avid hobbyist or automotive historian is familiar with the  
   pioneers like H. Bartol Brazier of Philadelphia; J. L. Cato of San  
   Francisco; Dan J. Piscorski of St. Louis, Missouri; W. H. Kiblinger  
   of Auburn, Indiana; Percy L. Klock of New York; F. J. Fanning of  
   Chicago; C. Clarence Holden of Comanche, Texas; or J. A. Moncrieff of  
   Pawtucket, Rhode Island. They had cars named for them as well, but  
   for some reason, the vehicles failed to catch on and their creators  
   were ground into the oils of automotive history by more popular  
   models.  
  
  <P> In 1904, Graham Fisher and James A. Allison organized the Prest-O-  
   Lite Company and introduced a new system of acetylene gas headlights.  
   In 1908, the year of the Model T, C. Harold Wills developed the use  
   of vanadium steel for Ford. At the same time, Charles Y. Knight was  
   perfecting his sleeve-valve engine, and the Fischer brothers founded  
   a company which was to gain fame as a producer of closed auto bodies.  
   Scientific experimentation of Charles Franklin Kettering of the  
   Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company helped bring about such  
   innovations as the electric starter and ethyl gasoline. Harvey S.  
   Firestone, B. F. Goodrich, Arthur W.  Grand and others worked with  
   rubber to overcome deficiencies in tire construction. Edward G. Budd,  
   a young Philadelphia engineer, is credited with the idea for  
   all-steel bodies for automobiles. Before this time, many of the  
   manufacturers had been carriage makers and used the same techniques  
   and designs they had previously used for horse-drawn vehicles. The  
   heat of early-day motors caused wood to warp and weakened the glue  
   which held it together. Rough roads made joints give way so that the  
   automobile creaked and groaned. Budd left a good job to pursue his  
   idea with his own company; in 1912, he finally convinced the Oakland  
   and Hupmobile people to try his all-steel body frames, and the next  
   year he received his first large contract from John and Horace Dodge.  
  
  <P> Arthur O. Smith, the son of a Milwaukee blacksmith and bicycle parts  
   manufacturer, shifted his interests from bicycles to the new-fangled  
   horseless carriage. He sold his first pressed steel frames to the  
   Peerless Motor Company early in the 20th century and when other auto  
   builders became interested, he offered a house and lot to a foreman  
   who could increase his production to twelve frames per day. It was  
   then that he was visited by Henry Ford. Ford ordered 10,000 Model T  
   frames for delivery in four months; a challenge that was accepted,  
   and by 1921, the A. O. Smith Corporation was capable of producing  
   Ford's first order in a single day.  
  
 <P> Hundreds of ideas have come from unknown mechanics who achieved  
   neither fame nor pay for their contributions. The automobile, as it  
   progressed, was a product of many hands, of revolutionary concepts,  
   and of simple, almost unnoticed upgrading. In the end, the one who  
   received the most for these challenges and changes was the motorist,  
   whose interest, money, and enthusiasm have forced the auto-moguls to  
   upgrade, perfect, and add to previous achievements in order to stay  
   in the competition.  
  
 <P>  The Cadillac is named after the man who, in the 1700's, founded   
   Detroit. His name was Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac.

       <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>      The Social Impact of The Automobile  
</B></FONT></CENTER> 

  <P> Once the world climbed into the driver's seat and stepped on the gas,  
   it hardly ever looked back. Art Buchwald wrote, "Americans are broad-  
   minded people. They'll accept the fact that a person can be an  
   alcoholic, a dope fiend, a wife beater, and even a newspaperman, but  
   if a man doesn't drive there's something wrong with him." Automobiles  
   became more than just toys for the rich, they became a part of  
   day-to-day living in, from, and to the work place. And it is in  
   America that the long ride has been the zippiest, the zestiest, and  
   the zaniest, because it is in America that automobiles started a  
   social revolution almost as revolutionary as that of the motorized  
   industry itself.  
  
  <P>  One of the first social changes cars brought about was in mating  
   habits. It didn't take young people in America long to realize that  
   there was a lot more they could accomplish in a backseat than on the  
   front porch. Besides, it would be more private and a good deal more  
   comfortable. Motorized courtship had been established even before the  
   Model T offered a love nest within everyone's price range. Gus  
   Edwards' popular "In My Merry Oldsmobile" contained two very  
   provocative lines: "You can go as far as you like with me, In our  
   merry Oldsmobile." Ford's Model T just gave the merry Oldsmobile an  
   enormous amount of company at prices the common person could afford.   
   In 1944, John Steinbeck noted in "Cannery Row": "Most of the babies  
   of the era were conceived in the Model T Ford, and not a few were  
   born in them." And it wasn't just in America.  
  
  <P>  A survey of 6,000 British girls by the London "Woman" revealed that  
   half of them regularly make love in parked cars. In Los Angeles, a  
   business called "Tail Dating" became popular. The motorist paid a fee  
   to receive a bumper sticker in popular day-glo colors. If one driver  
   spots another car on the road with a driver that sparks his or her  
   interest, and also sports the bumper sticker, the license number can  
   be phoned in to "Tail Dating" to set up a meeting. The automobile  
   manufacturers had no qualms about using sex appeal to sell their  
   product. In 1924, a Jordan firm named one of its models the  
   "Playboy." Its ad campaign showed a handsome cowboy and a beautiful  
   girl driving "somewhere West of Laramie." A Brewster used the same  
   tactics when they produced a heart-shaped radiator grille. Some car  
   companies turned out models with seats that folded down to become a  
   double bed. Things haven't really changed much, except the fold-down  
   seat has become a more comfortable van with all the luxuries of a  
   motel.  
  
  <P>  Automobiles opened up the possibility of farm children going to town  
   schools, where they were provided with better facilities and greater  
   educational choices. It also gave farm communities the ability to  
   shop at will, rather than once or twice a year. Town was within  
   shopping range and there were also clubs, theaters, and numerous  
   other activities that the average farm family had previously been  
   denied. If one got tired of it, he could always get back to the quiet  
   of the country.  
  
  <P>  The feminists' movement, which had been dragging its feet ever since  
   the 1820s, had a rapid growth from the automobile. In 1898, Genevra  
   Delphine Mudge drove a Waverly Electric in New York to become the  
   nation's first known female motorist. The following year she became  
   the country's first female racing driver by competing in a Locomobile  
   in a New York race meet. She skidded into five people standing on the  
   sidelines, knocking them down, but not seriously hurting them. She's  
   now only a footnote in automotive history as the first American woman  
   to have an automobile accident. It was also in 1898 that Chicago  
   began requiring licenses in order to drive, and one of the first to  
   be licensed was a woman. The Women's Motoring Club of New York was  
   chartered before Henry Ford had even begun to produce the Model T. In  
   1909, the president, Alice Ramsey, and three members left New York in  
   an open-bodied Maxwell-Briscoe and drove to San Francisco in 59 days.  
   Women were not a real part of the automotive scene, however, until  
 <P>   Henry Leland produced a self-starter in a 1912 Cadillac.  Eliminating  
   the physical strain of hand-cranking, he removed a large physical bar  
   from women drivers and, perhaps, men as well, since he was prompted  
   to this creation because his friend died of injuries he had received  
   from the kickback of a hand crank.  
  
 <P>   The automobile gave America a new look and something new to look at  
   as well. Escaping railroad schedules and the fixed routes of public  
   transportation, Americans could go wherever and whenever they wanted  
   and stay or leave at will. They took advantage of this opportunity by  
   the thousands. Overcrowded hotels and stage stops developed into  
   road-side cabins and then courts and finally, into motels for the  
   convenience of the motorist who was on his way to someplace else and  
   only needed a stopover to rest for the night.  
  
 <P>   Businesses looked around and saw the multitude on cars on the roads  
   and followed after them. First there were a smattering of service  
   stations; then they spread across the country like insects as more  
   and more people owned wheels. Every junction of the road had a gas  
   station, and eventually they were on each corner of the junction.  
   The speed of the vehicles picked up sharply and station owners were  
   soon watching them fly by to the next stop, so they started building  
   eye-catching structures, and because man does not live on gasoline  
   alone, they erected diners and cabins and assorted other roadside  
   businesses, which now provide everything from swimming pools and  
   paper, disposable swim suits to breath sprays.  
  
   <P> Some salute the car for improving the American breed by providing  
   such extended mating territories. This may be argued, but the car  
   surely did alter the pattern of movement. People began to leave the  
   beaten path, which had previously been unknown. The car introduced a  
   country to itself, enabling travelers to discover and to understand  
   regional differences and common values.  
  
 <P>   The placid beauty of the open road and the changing scenery began to  
   be spoiled by old tires, food wrappings, pop and beer bottles (and  
   then cans), by bodies of animals who could not outrun the charging  
   vehicle, by deserted service buildings and finally, by road signs  
   designed to catch the motorist`s eye several miles ahead of his  
   arrival, so that he had time to consider stopping before he had  
   already sped past.  
  
  <P>  One advertising man instituted the now famous Burma Shave jingles,  
   which were spaced out to match the speed of the traffic. Tourist  
   cabins were upgraded into more lavish courts, and then into motels.   
   Diners began to improve and highway food chains made an appearance  
   with some control over menu and sanitary conditions.  
  
  <P>  Unfortunately, the lure of money brings all kinds of money makers,  
   some of them not so desirable: beer joints, hot dog stands, "wild  
   animal" shows, fortune tellers, souvenir shops, and now automobile  
   scrap heaps lining the edges of every town and city. Signs became  
   bigger and some were lighted in flashing neon.  
  
  <P>  People trying to get out of the congestion of the city fled in droves  
   to the suburbs. Somehow they envied the farmer who could come in and  
   shop and return to the solitude of the country. They breathed the  
   fresh air and cooked on open grills, and talked about the country  
   life, encouraging more people to move into the suburbs, all bringing  
   their outdoor grills, lawn mowers, automobiles, boats, trailers, and  
   other paraphrenalia, until there was eventually as many people in the  
   suburbs as there were in the city. Then the "suburbanites" demanded  
   some of the advantages of the city. They needed churches, schools,  
   fire departments, markets, drugstores, hardware stores and gasoline  
   stations, until there was soon as much congestion and stress as they  
   had left behind. Shopping malls sprang up everywhere, serving  
   everything from french fries to wedding gowns, and electric rails  
   swept the population into the city in the morning and back to the  
   suburbs in the evening. They finally began to realize that they had  
   not escaped the city at all; they had merely moved to the  
   "residential area."  
  
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Oh, Henry!</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
 <P>   There being more people and, therefore, more money in the cities, it  
   is natural that the first effects of the automobile should be felt  
   there. In 1899, the Akron police threw away their horse-drawn paddy  
   wagons and replaced them with motorized versions. In the same year,  
   an enterprising citizen in Boston opened "a stable for renting, sale,  
   storage, and repair of motor vehicles" - the country's first garage.   
   Curbs along the city streets began to furnish hand-cranked gasoline  
   pumps, bringing an end to the dangerous practice of open containers  
   in hardware stores, and the nation's first regular service station  
   opened in Pittsburgh in 1913, an all night drive-in that began slowly  
   but soon picked up a lot of business.  
  
  <P>  The first automobile showroom opened in New York City in 1900 and  
   these were soon found in all city centers all over the country. The  
   used car lot followed shortly after for those who would surrender the  
   class and gloss of a new car for a much smaller price.  
  
  <P>  It had been the custom for companies to display their goods on the  
   cash-on-the-barrelhead basis, unless it was a major purchase, such as  
   a piano, which could be bought on an installment plan. In 1911, the  
   Studebaker Company offered automobiles on a deferred payment plan.   
   This was soon followed (in some cases, reluctantly) by other car  
   companies. In less than ten years, 50% of all cars sold in America  
   were bought on time payments. Other businesses, seeing the powerful  
   draw this had on consumers, also started selling their merchandise on  
   the installment plan (what the Britishers term "the never-never"),  
   putting almost all of America "on the books."  
  
 <P>   Cities now had to face the problem of traffic and traffic jams, as  
   more and more people became car owners. Traffic policemen were soon  
   organized, and in 1914, Cleveland installed the first traffic light,  
   and soon there became a need for traffic management. There is always  
   someone standing in the wings, waiting to find a way to make a buck.  
   As the load of traffic became heavier and parking space limited,  
   parking garages were built to care for the overflow; then the  
   unadorned parking lot was installed. In 1935, city officials  
   discovered that there was money to be made in this, and came up with  
   parking meters.  
  
   <P> The Great Depression of 1929 gave the nation a thorough understanding  
   of just how important the automobile had become. People began to  
   realize that cars were not just a convenience that would take them  
   from here to there a little faster: they were a fixation, part of the  
   body and soul of everyday life. No matter how poor and needy those in  
   the depression became, they would not give up their cars. If forced  
   to choose between gasoline and beans, the average man may decide the  
   gasoline was more important. Replacement parts were scavenged and  
   repairs were improvised from whatever could be found. Will Rogers  
   said that Americans would be the first people to go to the poor house  
   in an automobile.  
  
 <P>   In 1924, an innkeeper in California put up a flashing sign that was  
   to spread across the nation. He combined hotel and motor to coin the  
   word, "motel." At the same time, in Florida, businesses began to bow  
   to the motorists needs by establishing curb service dining with bell  
   hops, so that the driver would not even need to leave his car. They  
   coined the word, "drive-in." The government (always the last to act)  
   installed curbside mailboxes, equipped with chutes angled out to  
   receive letters. These were first put up in Houston in 1927. In  
   Camden, New Jersey, on June 6, 1933, the first drive-in movie was  
   shown in a field large enough to hold 500 cars on a 40 x 50 foot  
   screen. At their peak, there were more than 4,000 drive-in movies  
   across America.  
  
   <P> Thanks to drive-ins, we now have the privilege of sitting in our cars  
   to do everything. We can draw money from the bank account, have our  
   prescriptions filled, pay utility bills, have clothes cleaned, have  
   film developed, return library books, or buy a bottle of wine. Dallas  
   has a drive-through pawn shop, where you can sell whatever is worth  
   anything to drive straight to the gas station and fill up. There are  
   some drive-through supermarkets. In some cities, church-goers can  
   pick up their drive-through breakfasts and continue down the road to  
   attend drive-in worship services. There are at least two cities that  
   furnish drive-through funeral parlors. The automobile has become an  
   inbred necessity to life in America, thanks to Henry Ford's assembly  
   lines and his "universal automobile."  
  
   <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>             Did Anyone Get That License Number?</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P>  After the end of WWII, teenagers, trying to find their individualism,  
   made their cars into hot rods, low-riders and high-riders. They put  
   chrome on everything that would hold it, and painted everything that  
   was paintable - often with florescent colors, and otherwise extended  
   their efforts to make their car their "own." Many people hung a pair  
   of oversized dice from their mirror in an effort to show   
   independence. Some displayed logos of their school or club. Then came  
   the bumper sticker. The bumper sticker was first held on with wires  
   and probably said, "Buy War Bonds." After the war, the stickers  
   actually began to stick. Probably due to our need to "do (or say) our  
   own thing." Nearly every car now has a message; some subtle, some  
   clever, and some down-right obnoxious.   
  
 <P>   In 1901, Connecticut passed laws regulating the registration and  
   speed of motor vehicles. That same year, New York state required  
   "that every vehicle shall have the separate initials of the owner's  
   name placed upon the back thereof in a conspicuous place." That was  
   fine when there were only 954 cars involved, but when registrations  
   increased, the variety of lettering and location of the initials was  
   so great that the state amended the decree and required that assigned  
   registration numbers be shown on plates or leather pads. The state  
   collected a $1.00 fee and assigned the owner a number. He had to buy  
   brass numerals, bolt them to a strip of leather, and attach his  
   homemade tag to his car. In 1903, Massachusetts issued the first  
   official state-made license plates, heavy porcelain-enameled white on  
   dark blue tags. Other states followed suit with variations of metal,  
   leather, wooden shingles, sheet metal and some do-it-yourself styles.  
   The first state driver's license laws were passed by Rhode Island in  
   1908 and then New Hampshire in 1909.  
  
  <P>  When the states took over the production of license plates, they used  
   their prison population for the actual work - rehabilitating their  
   inmates for a position for which there was no job on the outside.   
  
  <P>  In 1937, Connecticut offered the first "vanity tags." Other states,  
   seeing an opportunity to get more money for no more service, followed  
   suit. They soon found that personalized license plates could become a  
   giant problem. Just a few letters, chosen by some clever motorist,  
   could produce an embarrassing sentiment to the issuing office. After  
   a few incidents, they hired staff to carefully review each request so  
   that it would not reflect badly on the state. It is now prestigious  
   to buy a license plate or "Vanity tag" in order to display a personal  
   message. These, as the car itself once was, are symbols of status.   
  <P>  Losing tags to a thief is not unusual. Authorities report that these  
   prestige license plates are being stolen in increasing numbers. To  
   make matters worse, motorists are discovering that it doesn't pay to  
   be too smart. The more clever and creative a tag is, the more apt it  
   is to be stolen. On the other hand, the owner may derive some  
   pleasure and comfort from this implied salute to his creativity.  
  
         <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>              Drive It Or Park It!</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P>  By the 1970s, it was clear that the thrill had disappeared for some  
   of us. At last America's love affair with the automobile was cooling  
   and it was now just a marriage of convenience. Some would still say  
   that nothing has changed; that America still loves the automobile, in  
   spite of social observers who might say that love of a machine is a  
   sickness. It's just that the automobile can now be seen for what it  
   was intended to be in the first place: something to get us from point  
   A to point B in a faster, more comfortable way. We understand now  
   that the car is just another mechanical appliance. We also understand  
   the price we pay in having that appliance for convenience: we must  
   cope with inflated prices from car companies, petroleum producers,  
   and special interest lobbies; we must also cope with an environment  
   which has been degraded, as well as with product unreliability that  
   drains our pockets and consumes our time.   
  
  <P>  The numbers of cars are awesome in size. There are about 130,000,000  
   passenger cars on the streets and highways of the country. There are  
   40,000,000 other types of vehicles who vie with the automobiles for  
   almost 4,000,000 miles of roadway. Consider Belgium, Denmark, France,  
   Great Britain, Holland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and West  
   Germany - whose combined populations are about 40,000,000 more than  
   that of the United States, and where automobiles are as available and  
   affordable as they are in America; they also had cars before we did.  
   In spite of this, there are 29,000,000 fewer cars in those countries  
   combined than in the United States. America owns about 40% of all  
   the motor vehicles in the world. Four of every ten American families  
   own two or more vehicles.   
  
  <P>  Once every seven minutes, someone somewhere in New York, tired of  
   fighting or nursing their cars, abandons it on the city's streets.   
   Illegal parking plagues the world. Paris police say that 1/3 of all  
   cars on that city's streets at any given time are parked illegally.  
   Japan will not even register a car unless the owner can prove that he  
   has bought or rented a parking space to put it in. Washington, New  
   York, Philadelphia, and other American cities are so frustrated and  
   overcome by parking tickets that they hire collection agencies to try  
   to collect some of them. Chicago has $500,000,000 worth of unpaid  
   tickets and writes another 4,000,000 every year. Then there are the  
   staggering amounts paid for policemen, administration, judges,  
   besides the enormous sum paid to keep the highways in good condition.  
   The car may not use any oats while it is parked, but it creates huge  
   problems for society.  
  
 <P>   Casper, Wyoming, with a population of 1,000, has 729 vehicles. Los  
   Angeles has 3,040 cars per square mile. Larger cities have cramped  
   living space into cubicles to build mass-transport highways and ramps  
   that clog the air with pollution from the exhaust pipes. 2/3 of Los  
   Angeles is taken up with streets, ramps, freeways, parking facilities  
   and garages. This is not to mention that many of the houses include  
   garage attachments. Automobile density is worsening each day. The  
   U.S. Government has imposed a Clean Air act to eliminate some of the  
   smog and lethal gases, but catalytic converters, while suppressing  
   some emissions, are substituting others which cause cancer, according  
   to Swiss research.  
  
  <P>  Besides the 44,175 people killed in automobile accidents in 1984,  
   1,600,000 other received injuries, 150,000 of them permanent. During  
   nine years of war in Viet Nam, the total American dead was only about  
   2,000 greater than the number killed on the highway in 1983, and the  
   wounded was less than 1/10 of those disabled in automobile accidents  
   that year. More Americans have died in automobile accidents than have  
   been killed in all the wars that America ever fought, making the love  
   of the automobile a dark romance, to say the least. What does it cost  
   to run the automobile? Well, in spite of "falling" gas prices and  
   increased fuel efficiency, a study released by Hertz Corporation in  
   1985 says that the average cost is 45.67 cents per mile for a compact  
   and 59.77 cents for a standard-sized car. If you drive 10,000 miles a  
   year, and include depreciation, insurance, licensing, repairs,  
   accessories, gas and oil, the total comes to over $4,500 per year for  
   a compact and almost $6,000 for a standard. (And that was in 1985!)  
   You can see then that driving a car is not just a "free-wheeling"  
   lark, but has become a big bite out of the old pocketbook.  
  
   <P> Some economists state that one worker in every five (others say seven  
   or six) workers in the U.S. labor force is employed by some activity  
   related to automobiles. The modern car is made up of some 14,000  
   parts. These parts are fashioned out of steel, glass, rubber, chrome,  
   and aluminum, among countless other elements.

  <P>  Since horses were quite frightened of cars, they were a great worry   
   for the first drivers. Uriah Smith, the founder of the Horsey   
   Horseless Carriage Company in Battle Creek, Michigan had a solution.   
   His motor car came with a wooden, life-sized horse head on the front.  
   No mention was made of the fact that this did nothing to quiet the   
   noise of the engine.

<P>    The Ford Model T (introduced in 1908) sold for about $290 without   
   extras. Because it was so simple, it lent itself to becoming the most  
   adaptable car in history. Some of the aftermarket extras included   
   tool chests, rubber hood silencers, tire-patching kits flower vases   
   and clamp-on dash lights.  
  
 <P>  A farmer could reasonably afford a set of tractor wheels to fit a   
   model T. If he needed to use his car in the fields, he could mount   
   the tractor wheels and hitch up his plow, or whatever.  
  
 <P>   The car made an excellent power plant. If you jacked up the rear   
   wheel and removed the tire, you could attach a belt from the wheel to  
   your buzz saw to cut wood.  
  
 <P>  Model T's were used to generate electricity, pump water, grind feed,   
   shear sheep, shred corn, churn butter and grind sausage.   
  
  <P>  The Model T was the first snowmobile in the 20's. A special   
   undercarriage was developed, the front wheels were moved to the rear,  
   and each double set of wheels was fitted with steel caterpillar   
   treads. After steel sled runners were attached to the front axle, the  
   snowmobile was ready for the farmers and woodsmen in the deep   
   northern snows.  
  
         <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>        The Ferocious FAAS Organization</B></FONT></CENTER>  
  
   In rural Pennsylvania at the turn of the century, a group of farmers   
   formed the "Farmers' Anti-Automobile Society," (or FAAS as we would   
   know it today) to set down some rules for car owners.  
  
 <P>   Automobiles traveling at night must send up a rocket (Roman candle)   
   every mile, wait ten minutes (for the road to clear) and then proceed  
   (with caution) while blowing the horn.  
  
  <P>  If a driver sees horses coming, he must pull over to the side of the   
   road, stop and cover his car with a camouflage cover.  
  
 <P>   If a horse refuses to pass a car on the road, the driver must   
   dismantle the car and hide the pieces in the bushes.  
  
 <P>   FAAS members, as well as members of the community were also   
   encouraged to spend Sundays to chase automobiles, shout and shoot at   
   drivers, as well as threaten them with arrest.

<H1>The Brake System (An Overview)</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Brake System</B></FONT></CENTER>

   
<P>
The braking system is the most important system in your car. If your brakes fail, the result can be disastrous. Brakes are actually energy conversion devices, which convert the kinetic energy (momentum) of your vehicle into thermal energy (heat). When you step on the brakes, you command a stopping force ten times as powerful as the force that puts the car in motion. The braking system can exert thousands of pounds of pressure on each of the four brakes. In modern systems, the master cylinder is power-assisted by the engine. All newer cars have dual systems, with two wheels' brakes operated by each subsystem. That way, if one subsystem fails, the other can provide reasonably adequate braking power. Safety systems like this make modern brakes more complex, but also much safer than earlier braking systems. 
<P>
The brake system is composed of the following basic components: The "master cylinder" which is located under the hood, and is directly connected to the brake pedal, converts your foot's mechanical pressure into hydraulic pressure. Steel "brake lines" and flexible "brake hoses" connect the master cylinder to the "slave cylinders" located at each wheel. Brake fluid, specially designed to work in extreme conditions, fills the system. "Shoes" and "pads" are pushed by the slave cylinders to contact the "drums" and "rotors" thus causing drag, which (hopefully) slows the car. 
<P>
In recent years, brakes have changed greatly in design. Disc brakes, used for years for front wheel applications, are fast replacing drum brakes on the rear wheels of modern cars. This is generally due to their simpler design, lighter weight and better braking performance. The greatest advantage of disc brakes is that they provide significantly better resistance to "brake fade" compared to drum type braking systems. Brake fade is a temporary condition caused by high temperatures generated by repeated hard braking. It occurs when the pads or shoes "glaze" due to the great pressure and heat of hard use. Once they cool, the condition subsides. Disc brakes allow greater air ventilation (cooling) compared to drum brakes. Drum brakes are not internally ventilated because if they were, water could accumulate in them. Disc brakes can rapidly fling off any water that they are exposed to, and so they can be well ventilated. 
<P>
"Boosters" are present in "power brake" systems, and use the engine's energy to add pressure to the master cylinder. "Anti-lock" (ABS) systems, originally developed for aircraft braking systems, use computer controlled valves to limit the pressure delivered to each slave cylinder. If a wheel locks up, steering input cannot affect the car's direction. With ABS, no matter how hard the pedal is pressed, each wheel is prevented from locking up. This prevents skidding (and allows the driver to steer while panic-braking). 
<P>
As impressive as these advances are, the basic process of converting a vehicle's momentum into (wasted) heat energy has not changed since the days of the horse and buggy. To stop a horse drawn carriage, the driver would pull on a lever which would rub on the wheel. But today, with the advent of regenerating brakes on electric vehicles, new ways of recapturing this lost energy are being developed. In these types of electric cars, when you step on the brakes, the motor switches into "generator mode", and stores the car's momentum as chemical energy in the battery, to be used again when the light turns green!
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Disc Brakes</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
Disc brakes use a clamping action to produce friction between the "rotor" and the "pads" mounted in the "caliper" attached to the suspension members.  Inside the calipers, pistons press against the pads due to pressure generated in the master cylinder. The pads then rub against the rotor, slowing the vehicle. Disc brakes work using much the same basic principle as the brakes on a bicycle; as the caliper pinches the wheel with pads on both sides, it slows the bicycle. Disc brakes offer higher performance braking, simpler design, lighter weight, and better resistance to water interference than drum brakes. 
<P>
Disc brakes, like many automotive innovations, were originally developed for auto racing, but are now standard equipment on virtually every car made. On most cars, the front brakes are of the disc type, and the rear brakes are of the "drum" type. Drum brakes use two semi-circular shoes to press outward against the inner surfaces of a steel drum. Older cars often had drum brakes on all four wheels, and many new cars now have 4-wheel disc brakes. 
<P>
Because disc brakes can fling off water more easily than drum brakes, they work much better in wet conditions. This is not to say that water does not affect them, it definitely does. If you splash through a puddle and then try to apply the brakes, your brakes may not work at all for a few seconds! Disc brakes also allow better airflow cooling, which also increases their effectiveness. Some high performance disc brakes have drilled or slotted holes through the face of the rotor, which helps to prevent the pads from "glazing" (becoming hardened due to heat). Disc brakes were introduced as standard equipment on most cars in the early seventies.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Pedal</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The brake pedal, in case you're one of those people who don't use it, is located on the left side of the accelerator pedal. In cars with manual transmissions, it is between the accelerator and clutch pedals. The brake pedal is connected to the master cylinder via a pushrod. The brake pedal is solidly mounted to the firewall, and works as a force-multiplying lever. Stepping on the brake pedal pushes a piston within the master cylinder, thereby pressurizing the hydraulic brake lines. The hydraulic pressure pushes the brake shoes and pads against the brake drums and rotors, thus slowing the wheels. If the car's engine quits while driving, the power assist (booster) fails. In this event, the brake pedal's mechanical leverage allows the driver to generate sufficient pressure to stop the car, although in a longer distance. It is a good idea to test the difference between power assisted and manual braking in a safe area. 
<P>
The brake pedal gives feedback to the driver which can be beneficial to good maintenence, and therefore potentially save your life. If the pedal pulses when pressed, the usual culprit is a warped rotor, which is potentially destructive to the caliper. If the pedal squishes down when pressure is applied, a dangerous leak is likely present (even if fluid does not drip out anywhere). Your brake pedal should not move more than a small amount when you press it, no matter how hard it is pressed. It should not feel sponge-like: a spongy pedal spells trouble in the braking system. With the car parked and the engine running, press the brake pedal firmly and hold the pressure. If the pedal sinks slowly, a leak is present.
<P>
A good rule of thumb is this: ANY changes in the "feel" of your brake pedal should be a cause for serious concern. Remember, with brakes, there is NO excuse for poor maintenance.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Drums</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The brake drum is a heavy flat-topped cylinder, which is sandwiched between the wheel rim and the wheel hub. The inside surface of the drum is acted upon by the linings of the brake shoes. When the brakes are applied, the brake shoes are forced into contact with the inside surface of the brake drums to slow the rotation of the wheels. 
<P>
The drums are usually covered with fins on their outer surfaces to increase cooling. They are not cooled internally, because water could enter through the air vent cooling holes and braking would then be greatly impaired. 
<P>
Drum brakes are found on the rear wheels of most older cars, but they are increasingly being fazed out in favor of rear disc brakes. Drum brakes were standard equipment on all four wheels of most cars until the early 70's.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Calipers</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The caliper works like a C-clamp to pinch the pads onto the rotor. It straddles the rotor and contains the hydraulic "slave cylinder" or "wheel cylinder" piston(s). One caliper is mounted to the suspension members on each wheel. The caliper is usually mounted onto the spindle, allowing it to deliver the torsional force of the wheel to the chassis via the control arms. Brake hoses connect the caliper to the brake lines leading to the master cylinder. A "bleeder valve" is located on each caliper to allow air bubbles to be purged from the system. 
<P>
"Floating caliper" disc brakes, the most common variety, allow the caliper to move from side to side slightly when the brakes are applied. This is because only one pad moves (in relation to the caliper). Some calipers contain two or four seperate pistons. These calipers are fixed in place; i.e., there is no lateral movement like the floating caliper, the pistons take up the slack on each side of the rotor. These are called "dual cylinder" or "dual piston" calipers, and are standard equipment on many performance cars.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheel (Slave) Cylinders</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Wheel cylinders, also called the "slave" cylinders, are cylinders in which movable piston(s) convert hydraulic brake fluid pressure into mechanical force. Hydraulic pressure against the piston(s) within the wheel cylinder forces the brake shoes or pads against the machined surfaces of the drum or rotor. There is one cylinder (or more in some systems) for each wheel. Drum brake wheel cylinders are usually made up of a cylindrical casting, an internal compression spring, two pistons, two rubber cups or seals, and two rubber boots to prevent entry of dirt and water. This type of wheel cylinder is fitted with push rods that extend from the outer side of each piston through a rubber boot, where they bear against the brake shoes. In disc brakes, the wheel cylinder is built into the caliper. All wheel cylinders have bleeder screws (or bleeder valves) to allow the system to be purged of air bubbles. 
<P>
As the brake pedal is depressed, it moves pistons within the master cylinder, pressurizing the brake fluid in the brake lines and slave cylinders at each wheel. The fluid pressure causes the wheel cylinders' pistons to move, which forces the shoes or pads against the brake drums or rotors. Drum brakes use return springs to pull the pistons back away from the drum when the pressure is released. On disc brakes, the calipers' piston seals are designed to retract the piston slightly, thus allowing the pads to clear the rotor and thereby reduce rolling friction.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Parking (Emergency) Brakes</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The parking brake (sometimes called the emergency brake) is a cable-activated system used to hold the brakes continuously in the applied position. The parking brake activates the brakes on the rear wheels. Instead of hydraulic pressure, a cable (mechanical) linkage is used to engage the brake shoes or discs. When the parking-brake pedal is pressed (or, in many cars, a hand lever is pulled), a steel cable draws the brake shoes or pads firmly against the drums or rotors. The release lever or button slackens the cables and disengages the brake shoes. The parking brake is self adjusting on most systems. An automatic adjuster compensates for lining (brake shoe) wear. On many cars, the parking brake is used to re-adjust the brake shoes as they wear in, or when the shoes are replaced. In these systems, the adjustment is made by repeatedly applying the parking brake while backing up. 
<P>
The parking brake can be useful while driving up hills: If you're driving a manual transmission car, and you pull up to a stop on an incline, you might notice that you don't have enough feet to operate the clutch, brake, and gas at the same time. In other words, you will likely roll backwards slightly while getting started again. If a someone pulls up right behind you, this can be a problem. Your parking brake is useful in this situation: Apply the parking brake after you stop. When you want to go, release the clutch while pressing the gas, and release the parking brake. This keeps you from having to quickly switch your left foot from the brake to the clutch, or your right foot from the brake to the gas pedal. A little practice, and you'll be able to do it smoothly. Also, remember if you pull up behind someone who is stopped on a hill, give them extra room to roll back a little. Especially if it's a truck. 
<P>
Some cars have no parking brake release! They automatically release the parking brake when the car is placed in drive or reverse.  
<P>
Remember, it's a good idea to test the parking brake periodically and keep it in good condition. It may save your life if the main braking system fails!
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Drum Brakes</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Drum brakes are an older design, but are still in use, although many cars now use 4-wheel disc brakes. One advantage of drum brakes is that they can easily be set up to be mechanically activated by a pull cable (for use as parking brakes). Drum brakes are usually quite sufficient for rear brakes because most of the car's weight transfers to the front wheels during hard braking. The reduced weight on the rear wheels makes the higher performance of disc brakes somewhat unnecessary. 
<P>
The working parts of a drum brake are contained inside the brake drum. The drum is attached to the hub of the wheel and revolves with it. Inside the drum are a pair of curved brake shoes that are held close to the drum by retractor springs. The shoes and actuator linkages are mounted to the backing plate behind the drum. When the brake pedal is pressed, fluid is pressurized in the wheel cylinders. Pistons in the wheel cylinders then push outwards against both shoes, overcoming the retractor spring tension and pressing the shoes against the drum. The friction of the shoes against the drum slows the wheel. When pressure is removed from the brake pedal, the retractor springs force the shoes back to their normal (released) position. As the linings of the shoes wear down and become thinner, the "self adjuster" keeps them close to the drum without touching until applied.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Pads and Brake Shoes</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Brake pads and brake shoes are composed of a friction lining material mounted onto metal backing plates. Brake linings are designed to have a specific coefficient of friction. The linings contact the drums and discs, create drag, and thereby retard the speed of the vehicle. The lining material is designed to wear down faster than the rotors and drums they rub against, so that they are the only part that usually has to be replaced. When worn out pads and shoes are replaced, the drums and rotors are re-machined (a small amount of metal is removed from their surfaces) so that the brake shoes and pads will "break in" properly. 
<P>
Because of intense friction and heat produced in braking, brake linings were first composed of heat-resistant asbestos compound. When it was discovered that breathing dust containing asbestos fibers can cause serious bodily harm, asbestos pads were replaced with other types. There are now three basic types of materials used in brake linings: (1) non-asbestos organic, which is usually made from filler materials and high temperature resins; (2) metallic; and (3) semi-metallic, which are composed of finely powdered iron or copper, graphite, and small amounts of inorganic filler and friction modifiers. The first and third types of brake lining are used for conventional brake service. Under extreme braking conditions (sports cars, ambulances, police cars), the metallic type of linings are used, because they provide more constant frictional characteristics (reduced brake fade) than the other two. Organic pads and shoes wear down the rotors and drums less than semi-metallic or metallic pads, but also wear down quicker themselves, requiring more frequent replacement. 
<P>
Most pads and shoes have "wear indicators" built into them, or into the hardware which holds them in place. The wear indicators cause a squealing noise when the linings wear down to a the level of the indicator. Mechanical wear indicators (small metal tabs) allow the driver to know when their brakes are needing replacement before serious damage occurs. When the pads or shoes wear out completely (past the wear indicators) and the backing plates contact the drums or discs for extended periods of time, the damage which results can require replacement of the rotor or drum, which is MUCH more expensive than the shoes and/or pads! Some advanced braking systems have electronic wear indicators built into the linings, which allow the driver to be warned by a light on the dash.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Master Cylinder</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The master cylinder displaces hydraulic pressure to the rest of the brake system. It holds THE most important fluid in your car, the brake fluid. It actually controls two seperate subsystems which are jointly activated by the brake pedal. This is done so that in case a major leak occurs in one system, the other will still function. The two systems may be supplied by seperate fluid reservoirs, or they may be supplied by a common reservoir. Some brake subsystems are divided front/rear and some are diagonally separated. When you press the brake pedal, a push rod connected to the pedal moves the "primary piston" forward inside the master cylinder. The primary piston activates one of the two subsystems. The hydraulic pressure created, and the force of the primary piston spring, moves the secondary piston forward. When the forward movement of the pistons causes their primary cups to cover the bypass holes, hydraulic pressure builds up and is transmitted to the wheel cylinders. When the brake pedal retracts, the pistons allow fluid from the reservoir(s) to refill the chamber if needed.  
<P>
Electronic sensors within the master cylinder are used to monitor the level of the fluid in the reservoirs, and to alert the driver if a pressure imbalance develops between the two systems. If the brake light comes on, the fluid level in the reservoir(s) should be checked. If the level is low, more fluid should be added, and the leak should be found and repaired as soon as possible. BE SURE TO USE THE RIGHT BRAKE FLUID FOR YOUR VEHICLE. Use of improper brake fluid can "contaminate the system". If this occurs, ALL of the seals in the brake system will need replacement, and that is usually a VERY expensive operation. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Warning System</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The brake warning system has been required standard equipment since 1970, and is connected to the master cylinder. It monitors differences in pressure in the brake lines of the two hydraulic sub-systems, and alerts the driver with a light if an imbalance occurs. When you turn the key to the Ignition position, the brake warning light on the dash comes on during a "self-test". You should not drive a car if the warning light does not come on during the startup self test. 
<P>
The brake system is divided into two sub-systems to increase safety. A pressure differential switch, connected to the warning light, is positioned between the two. If a major leak occurs, and therefore pressure in one of the lines is sharply reduced, pressure from the other side forces a piston to move, activating the pressure differential switch and turns on the dashboard warning light. 
<P>
There are two types of pressure differential switches; mechanical or hydraulic. Mechanical switches are activated by excessive brake travel. Hydraulic switches are activated by a difference in pressure between the front and rear system. When pressure in one of the lines is sharply reduced, pressure from the other side forces a piston to move. A plunger pin then drops into a groove in the piston, activating a switch that turns on a dashboard warning light. 
<P>
The brake warning light is also connected to the brake fluid level sensors in the master cylinder reservoir(s). If the brake warning light comes on, the fluid level should be checked. If the level is low, more fluid should be added, and the leak should be found and repaired as soon as possible. BE SURE TO USE THE RIGHT FLUID.  
<P>
<B>NEVER IGNORE THE BRAKE WARNING LAMP, AND ALWAYS NOTE WETHER IT WORKS DURING THE STARTING SELF-TEST.</B> 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Brakes</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Power brakes (also called "power assisted" brakes) are designed to use the power of the engine and/or battery to enhance braking power. The four most common types of power brakes are: vacuum suspended; air suspended; hydraulic booster, and electro-hydraulic booster. Most cars use vacuum suspended units (vacuum boosters), which employ a vacuum-powered booster device to provide added thrust to the foot pressure applied.  
<P>
In a vacuum booster type system, pressure on the brake pedal pushes forward a pushrod connected to the pistons within the master cylinder. At the same time, the pushrod opens the vacuum-control valve so that it closes the vacuum port and seals off the forward half of the booster unit. The engine vacuum line then creates a low-pressure vacuum chamber. Atmospheric pressure in the control chamber then pushes against the diaphragm. The pressure on the diaphragm forces it forward, supplying pressure on the master cylinder pistons. 
<P>
Hydraulic booster systems usually tap into the power steering pump's pressure, and use this power to augment pressure to the master cylinder. Electro-hydraulic booster systems use an electric motor to pressurize a hydraulic system which augments pressure to the master cylinder. This allows the vehicle to have power assisted brakes even if the engine quits. 
<P>
You may wish to compare the difference between power and non-assisted braking in a safe area; while driving slowly, turn the ignition key off (don't turn it into the locked position, because the steering wheel will lock, which is highly unsafe.) As the car coasts along, press the brakes hard. The force of your foot is now the only thing stopping the car. The safe driver is always ready to apply the total force needed to stop their vehicle, even if the engine quits (thereby removing the power assist).
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Originally developed for aircraft, ABS basically works by limiting the pressure to any wheel which decelerates too rapidly. This allows maximum stopping force to be applied without brake lockup (skidding). If standard brakes are applied too hard, the wheels "lock" or skid, which prevents them from giving directional control. If directional control (steering) is lost, the vehicle skids in a straight line wherever it is going. ABS allows the driver to steer during hard braking, which allows you to control the car much better. In the old days, drivers had to know how to "pump" the brakes or sense the lockup and release foot pressure in order to prevent skidding. This meant that if only one wheel lost traction and started to skid, the driver would have to reduce braking force to prevent a skid. The advantage of ABS is that the brakes on the wheels with good traction can be used to the fullest possible amount, even if other wheels lose traction. 
<P>
In operation, the wheelspeed sensors at each wheel send electronic pulse signals to the control unit. If wheel lockup (rapid deceleration) is detected during brake application, the computer signals the valve unit to limit the hydraulic pressure to the wheel cylinder. This is usually accomplished by diverting the fluid into a small reservoir. The fluid is later pumped out of the reservoir and returned to the main fluid reservoir when the brakes are not being applied. 
<P>
The anti-lock brake system tests itself every time the vehicle is started and every time the brakes are applied. The system evaluates its own signals. If a defect is detected, the system then turns off, leaving normal braking unaffected.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Caliper Piston Seals</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The caliper piston seals are designed to keep the fluid pressure behind the pistons, and to retract the pistons enough to allow the brake pads to just barely clear the rotor, thus reducing rolling resistance. The seals should NEVER leak. If a leak is detected, it must be repaired immediately, because the fluid which escapes can defeat braking power by getting on the disc, and the pressure loss can affect brake safety.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Push Rods</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A push rod is a connecting link in an operating mechanism which transfers mechanical force in only one direction. Two examples are; the push rod between the valve lifter and rocker arm on an overhead valve engine, and another is the push rods which apply pressure to the brake shoes from the slave cylinder pistons.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rotors (Discs)</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The rotor (also called the disc) is clamped by the brake pads in order to slow the vehicle. The rotor is a heavy circular steel plate attached to the wheel providing a two-sided braking surface. Pressurized fluid in the brake lines flows into one or more "slave" cylinders in each caliper. The fluid pressure is exerted against the slave pistons, which force the brake pads against the surface of the disc. As the pads clamp onto the rotor, intense heat is generated, which can in extreme conditions actually cause the rotor to glow red hot! The rotor often has a series of radial vents built into it which allow it to be cooled by ambient air. Ventilation ducts directed to the disc allow the intense heat that is generated by the brake to be transferred to the air quickly. 
<P>
The surfaces of the rotor are "turned" (re-machined) whenever the brake pads are replaced in order to remove the "glazed" surface which forms on the rotors. The turning process also "trues" the disc (makes it perfectly flat) which eliminates the pulsations which are experienced when the rotor is warped. Warped rotors give a slight tugging when the brakes are applied, and send a pulsing sensation back through the brake pedal. Rotors have "minimum thickness" which means if the rotor has been turned several times, it may become too thin to resurface, and therefore require replacement.  
<P>
Semi metallic brake pads give better performance, longer replacement intervals and reduced "fade", but they also wear down the rotor more quickly than organic (non-metallic) pads.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Parking Brake (Emergency Brake)</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
When the parking brake lever (or in some cars a pedal) is applied, it pulls a cable which connect to the manual actuators inside the rear brakes. This lever is the only thing between you and the hospital if your hydraulic brakes fail, so it is a good thing to practice using it, and to maintain it diligently. This lever or pedal is known as the emergency brake, for just that reason.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Booster</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The brake booster is a vacuum powered or hydraulic device that is attached to the master cylinder in what are referred to as "power brake" systems. Brake boosters are designed to assist braking force from the pedal, not to provide all of the braking force. This is done as a safety feature in case the engine quits, cutting off the booster's power supply. The function of the brake booster is to add to the power delivered to the brake system by your foot. "Vacuum boosters" tap into the vacuum created by the engine, and use the difference between atmospheric pressure and the vacuum created by the engine to assist braking. 
<P>
In hydraulic booster systems, the booster is supplied with hydraulic power, usually drawn from the power steering pump. Some brake boosters use electric motors to generate the hydraulic power, allowing them to remain effective even without the engine running.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Hoses</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The master cylinder is connected to each wheel by brake lines and hoses. Brake hoses are specially constructed flexible tubes with metal ends for transmitting fluid under extreme pressure. These hoses are used to connect the calipers to the metal brake lines, allowing the caliper to move when the wheel turns or goes up and down. The entire hydraulic system is filled with brake fluid, which is pressurized by the movement of the master cylinder's pistons. This fluid is very important. Always use only the recommended fluid. 
<P>
When you remove a wheel, these hoses are easily visible. If the hoses appear cracked or brittle, they should be replaced immediately. Close inspection of the brake hoses is a good way to prevent catastrophe!
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Fluid</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Brake fluid is a special liquid for use in hydraulic brake systems, which must meet highly exact performance specifications. It is designed to be impervious to wide temperature changes and to not suffer any significant changes in important physical characteristics such as compressibility over the operating temperature range. The fluid is designed to not boil, even when exposed to the extreme temperatures of the brakes.  
<P>
Different types of brake fluid are used in different systems, and should NEVER be mixed. Most cars use "DOT 3" or "DOT 4" brake fluid. Some newer cars use silicone brake fluids. These should NEVER be mixed together, because the seals in each car are designed to work with only their specific fluid types. For example, the mixing of "Silicone" brake fluid and conventional glycol based DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluids should be avoided, as the two fluid types are not miscible (they will not mix together). DOT 3 brake fluids and DOT 4 brake fluids can be mixed. 
<P>
One of the WORST things that can happen to your car is if the brake fluid becomes contaminated, because the seals are designed to work with only pure brake fluid. "System contamination" means that all of the piston seals and hoses are deteriorating, and therefore must be replaced, a MAJOR expense. So, be VERY careful what you put in the master cylinder reservoir! 
<P>
It should be noted that brake fluid is highly corrosive to paint, and care should be used not to get it on your car's finish. 
<P>
The brake fluid in your car should be changed every ______ to prevent corrosion of the braking system components.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Lines</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
Brake lines are small steel tubes with special internal coatings to prevent rust and corrosion. These tubes connect to the master cylinder, and then run under the car to each of the wheels. At the wheel, a "brake hose" connects the brake line to the caliper or wheel cylinder. As the brake pedal is pressed, the master cylinder forces the brake fluid throughout the brake lines and into the wheel (or brake) cylinders. This pressure causes the slave cylinder pistons to move, forcing the shoes and pads against the drums and rotors to slow the vehicle.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Return Springs</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The return springs force the brake shoes slightly back (inward) away from the drum when the brake is released. These springs, along with the other brake hardware, should be replaced every other time the brake shoes are replaced.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Backing Plate</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The backing plate is a round, stamped steel disc, used to keep water out of the drum/rotor, and in drum brakes as a mount for the wheel cylinder. It is bolted to the end of the rear axle housing for drum brakes and to the spindle in disc brakes. The backing plate is the foundation for the wheel cylinder and brake shoe assembly. Some backing plates have air scoops built in to allow better cooling of the brakes.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Anchor Pins and Shoe Retainers</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The anchor pin is a strong metal pin mounted to the backing plate, which prevents the shoes from turning along with the wheel when the brakes are applied. Shoe retainers are small spring clips of various designs used to hold the brake shoes against the backing plate. These pins insure shoe alignment and prevent them from rattling.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Adjusters</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Brake adjusters are a type of device that adjusts the drum-to-lining clearance as the shoes' linings wear down. All modern cars have "automatic adjusters" which automatically adjust the clearance. The three main types of adjustment systems are; cable, link, and lever. Some systems can operate (adjust themselves) only when braking in reverse, usually when the parking brake is engaged. Others adjust when braking in the forward direction. Still others operate when braking in either direction. Older cars used adjusters, but they had to be manually adjusted at regular intervals.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Vacuum Valve (Vacuum Control Valve)</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The vacuum control valve allows vacuum from the engine into one side of the booster diaphragm, and keeps normal atmospheric pressure on the other side. As the pressure from the pedal reaches a certain level, the valve closes, allowing the vacuum to build up in the front half of the booster. The pressure of the diaphragm pushes against the pushrod, and transfers to the master cylinder.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Vacuum from the Engine</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Engine intake manifold vacuum is used for augmenting the foot's braking power in vacuum assisted power brakes. This vacuum is created by the pistons as they draw downward, sucking air into the cylinders. When you push the brake pedal down, the vacuum control valve lets the engine draw a vacuum in the front section of the booster unit. The atmospheric pressure on the other side of the diaphragm provides significant additional braking force. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Filler Cap (Brake Fluid Reservoir Cover)</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
The cap on the brake fluid reservoir has a hole for air, or is vented, to allow the fluid to expand and contract without creating a vacuum or causing pressure. A rubber diaphragm goes up and down with the fluid level's pressure, and keeps out any dust or moisture. If the cap's seal becomes distorted, it usually indicates a brake fluid contamination problem. 
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Master Cylinder Pistons</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
Two closely fitted pistons are located inside the master cylinder. The inner part of the piston is pressed against a rubber primary cup that prevents fluid from leaking past the piston. The outer end of the piston is pressed against a rubber secondary cup. This prevents the fluid from getting out of the master cylinder. The inner piston also has several little bleeder ports; these pass through the through the head to the base of the primary cup. Both of the piston assemblies are in the cylinder, and are kept there by a stop plate (or snap ring) in the end of the cylinder. A push rod, connected to the brake linkage, applies pressure to the pistons. 
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Booster Air Inlet Filter</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
As the vacuum booster engages, the air chamber in the front of the booster is allowed to fill with air from the passenger compartment through the booster air inlet filter. The normal air pressure around us pushes the diaphragm of the booster after passing through the filter. This filter keeps the inside of the booster from getting airborne debris inside of it.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Bleeder Valves</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
Since the brake system is filled with fluid, it must be occasionally "bled". (the old fluid is released in order to install new fluid). This is also done to remove any air bubbles that have gotten into the system (usually when any of the brake parts are changed). All hydraulic brakes have bleeder valves on or near the slave cylinders. These valves are opened while the brake pedal is pressed, causing the brake fluid to flow out as well as any air bubbles present. When the brake fluid comes out without any air bubbles, the mechanic seals the bleeder valve and tops off the brake fluid reservoir. Bleeder valves can also be found on the side of the master cylinder. These are used for the same purpose; getting air bubbles out of the master cylinder assembly. If you have air bubbles in your fluid, your pedal will feel softer than normal, and braking power will be reduced, so it is a good idea to have your brakes bled and the fluid changed according to your owner's manual.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Balance Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The balance valve allows the mechanic to adjust the maximum brake pressure to the rear wheels of the car. This is done because the rear wheels don't have as much weight on them during the braking action of the car, and may lock up during use. During braking, most of the weight of the car shifts to the front wheels. If this happens without a proportioning valve, or balance valve acting on the system, the rear brakes tend to lock up. The balance valve allows you to decrease pressure to the rear wheels in all situations where the brakes are used. This valve is not needed on ABS systems, because each wheel is prevented from locking individually. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Cooling Ducts</B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
In high performance cars, small brake cooling ducts are built into the body work near the front and/or rear wheels. On the air dam, the duct is a small opening with a small tube that runs to the backing plate. This allows cool air to be piped direcly onto the brakes, thus reducing brake fade and increasing braking potential. Brakes tend to "fade" (lose their effectiveness) if they get extremely hot. Lots of cars have very small sheet metal projections formed into the backing plate that serve as an air scoop for the front disc brakes.

<H1>The Cooling System (Overview)</H1></CENTER>  

<BR><BR> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Cooling System</B></FONT></CENTER>  

<P> 
The purpose of the engine's cooling system is to remove excess heat from the engine, to keep the engine operating at its most efficient temperature, and to get the engine up to the correct temperature as soon as possible after starting. Ideally, the cooling system keeps the engine running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are.  
<P>
As fuel is burned in the engine, about one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted into power. Another third goes out the exhaust pipe unused, and the remaining third becomes heat energy.  
<P>
A cooling system of some kind is necessary in any internal combustion engine. If no cooling system were provided, parts would melt from the heat of the burning fuel, and the pistons would expand so much they could not move in the cylinders (called "seize").   
<P>
The cooling system of a water-cooled engine consists of: the engine's water jacket, a thermostat, a water pump, a radiator and radiator cap, a cooling fan (electric or belt-driven), hoses, the heater core, and usually an expansion (overflow) tank.   
<P>
Fuel burning engines produce enormous amounts of heat; temperatures can reach up to 4,000 degrees F when the air-fuel mixture burns. However, normal operating temperature is about 2,000 degrees F. The cooling system removes about one-third of the heat produced in the combustion chamber.  
<P>
The exhaust system takes away much of the heat, but parts of the engine, such as the cylinder walls, pistons, and cylinder head,  absorb large amounts of the heat. If a part of the engine gets too hot, the oil film fails to protect it. This lack of lubrication can ruin the engine.  
<P>
On the other hand, if an engine runs at too low a temperature, it is inefficient, the oil gets dirty (adding wear and subtracting horsepower), deposits form, and fuel mileage is poor-- not to mention exhaust emissions! For these reasons, the cooling system is designed to stay out of the action until the engine is warmed up.  
<P>
There are two types of cooling systems; liquid cooling and air cooling. Most auto engines are cooled by the liquid type; air cooling is used more frequently for airplanes, motorcycles and lawnmowers.  
<P>
Liquid cooled engines have passages for the liquid, or coolant, through the cylinder block and head. The coolant has to have indirect contact with such engine parts as the combustion chamber, the cylinder walls, and the valve seats and guides. Running through the passages in the engine heats the coolant (it absorbs the heat from the engine parts), and going through the radiator cools it.  After getting "cool" again in the radiator, the coolant comes back through the engine. This business continues as long as the engine is running, with the coolant absorbing and removing the engine's heat, and the radiator cooling the coolant.  
<P>
A cooling system pressure tester is used to check the pressure in the cooling system, which allows the mechanic to determine if the system has any slow leaks. The leak can then be found and fixed before it causes a major problem.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Thermostat</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Just like your body needs to warm up when you begin to exercise, your car's engine needs to warm up when it starts its exercise.  
<P>
The thermostat provides control for your engine's warm-up period.  
<P> 
The thermostat is located between the engine and the radiator. This little temperature-sensitive spring valve stays closed during engine warm-up. When the thermostat is closed, it prevents coolant from leaving the engine and circulating through the radiator until the correct running temperature is reached. The correct running temperature for most engines is between 180 degrees F and 200 degrees F. When the right temperature is reached, the spring valve opens, allowing coolant to circulate through the radiator to be cooled-- almost like our bodies begin to perspire after we've warmed-up.  
<P>
The temperature at which the thermostat is designed to open is called its rating, and may be stamped on the body. The 180 Degrees F thermostat begins to open at (you guessed it!) 180 Degrees F and is fully opened at 200 degrees F. Different engines use different temperature thermostats.  
<P>
Some high range thermostats maintain engine operating temperatures above 200 degrees F. This causes the engine to burn up more pollutants and aids in emissions control. However the range for your thermostat depends on the type of your engine, load requirements, weather, and other variables.  
<P>
Most thermostats are the "pellet" type; the name comes from the wax pellet that expands as the engine coolant warms. The pellet's expansion forces the valve open. Thermostats occasionally get "stuck shut" which cuts off the cooling capacity of the radiator, at least partially. This often occurs after an engine has overheated for some other reason, such as when the water pump fails, or if a large coolant leak develops. For this reason, car makers usually place the thermostat in an accessible position.  
<P>
Depending on the air temperature, the engine should take from five to fifteen minutes to warm up. If your engine takes a long time to warm up, or if it always runs hot, you might need to test the thermostat. A malfunctioning thermostat can cause excessive engine wear and waste fuel. A good time to have your thermostat checked is just before summer or winter.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Expansion (Overflow) Tank</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Several cooling systems make use of a clear plastic container, which is connected to the overflow tube from the radiator. This container provides extra storage space for the coolant when it expands and is called the expansion, or overflow tank. It is also known as the coolant reservoir, or overflow canister.  
<P>
As the engine heats up, the coolant inside it expands. Without the expansion tank, the coolant would flow out of the overflow tube and be lost from the cooling system onto the street. Instead, the coolant flows into the expansion tank.  
<P>
Since a vacuum is created in the cooling system when the engine cools, the vacuum causes some of the coolant in the expansion tube to be sucked back into the system. Because a cooling system with an expansion tank is virtually a closed system, the coolant can flow between the system and the expansion tank as it expands and contracts. This way, no coolant is lost if the system is functioning properly.
<P>
Another function of the expansion tank is to remove air bubbles from the cooling system. Coolant without air-bubbles is much more efficient than coolant with air bubbles, because it absorbs heat much faster.  
<P>
The advantage of the expansion tank is that while the level of coolant contained in it rises and falls, the radiator is always full.  
<P>
Older cars can easily be fitted with expansion tanks, simply by mounting the tank near the radiator, connecting it to the overflow tube, and replacing the radiator cap.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator Cap (Pressure Cap)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The radiator cap acts as more than just a "lid" for your radiator; it keeps your engine cool by sealing and pressurizing the coolant inside it.  
<P>
What makes the radiator cap special is that it is designed to hold the coolant in your radiator under a predetermined amount of pressure. If the coolant was not kept under pressure, it would start to boil, and soon you would have boiled all of your coolant away.  
<P>
However, the radiator (or pressure) cap prevents this from happening by exerting enough pressure to keep the coolant from boiling. Normally, water (coolant) boils at 212 degrees F, but if the pressure is increased, the boiling temperature is also increased. Since the boiling point goes up when the pressure goes up, the coolant can be safely heated to a temperature above 212 degrees F without boiling.   
<P>
What makes this important is that the higher the temperature of the coolant is, the greater the temperature gap between it and the air temperature is. This is the principle that causes the cooling system to work; the hotter the coolant is, the faster the heat in it moves to the radiator and the air passing by. So, a cooling system under pressure takes heat away from the engine faster, which makes it more efficient.  
<P>
If your cooling system is under too much pressure, it can "blow its  top"! To prevent this, the radiator cap has a pressure relief valve.  The valve has a preset rating that allows it to take just up to a  certain amount of pressure. When you turn the cap on the filler neck of the radiator, you seal the upper and lower sealing surfaces of the filler neck. The pressure relief valve spring is compressed against the lower seal when you lock the cap.  
<P> 
The radiator filler neck has an overflow tube right between the two sealing surfaces. If the pressure in the cooling system exceeds the preset rating of your cap, its pressure relief valve allows the lower seal to be lifted from its seat. Then the excess pressure (coolant, air) can squish through the overflow tube to the ground or the coolant reservoir.
<P>
Once enough pressure has been released (the caps preset rating), the pressure relief valve is again closed by the spring.  
<P>
The pressure cap can be tested with a cooling system pressure tester, using an adapter, to make certain that it is living up to its pressure rating. It should be replaced if it fails the test.  
<P>
Note: Most radiator pressure caps are not meant to be removed. Coolant should always be added through the expansion (overflow) tank. NEVER REMOVE THE RADIATOR CAP FROM A HOT ENGINE. REMOVING THE PRESSURE CAN CAUSE STEAM TO SHOOT OUT AND SERIOUSLY BURN YOU.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Cooling Fans</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The reason the coolant goes into the radiator is to allow air to pass through it and cool the coolant. When you are driving fast enough, the air rushes through the grille of the car and passes through the radiator core. If you aren't driving fast enough to push air through the radiator, then the fan will pull the air through.  
<P>
The fan improves cooling when you are driving at slow speeds, or if the engine is idling. It is usually mounted on the water pump shaft, and is turned by the same belt that drives the water pump and the alternator, although it can be mounted as an independent unit. Most independently mounted fans are electric.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Belt Powered Fans</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P> 
The fan's activity is not always necessary, and it takes power from the engine to spin. For this reason a thermostatic control, or fan clutch, is often used to reduce drive torque when it isn't needed (variable-speed fan). A different type of fan uses centrifugal force to move its flexible plastic blades, by flattening them when the engine rpm is high (flexible-blade fan). The less angle the blades have, the less power they use. The idea of these units is to save horsepower and reduce the noise the fan makes.  
<P>
A fan can have from four to six blades to suck the air through the radiator. Often the radiator has a shroud for the fan to keep it from recirculating the same hot air that has collected behind the radiator. Many fans have irregularly spaced blades to reduce resonant noise.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Electric Fans</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P> 
Front-wheel drive engines mounted transversely usually use electric fans to cool the engine. The radiator is located in the usual place, but an electric motor drives the fan. A thermostatic switch is used to turn the fan on and off at predetermined temperature settings, which it senses. The exception to this is air conditioning. If you turn on the air conditioner, you bypass the thermostatic switch, and the fan runs continuously. If you turn off the air conditioner, the thermostatic switch is re-activated, and goes back to turning the fan on and off, according to its instructions. Many cars have one electric fan for normal cooling and a separate one just for when the air conditioner is on.  
<P> 
There are some really nice features about the electric fan. The nicest feature is that you don't have to keep an eye on the treacherous old fan belt -- there isn't one, so you don't have to worry about its health and fitness. It's also quieter, and less of a power drain on the engine. They also help your engine by continuing to cool it after it's turned off.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>V-Belt (Fan Belt)</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The fan (drive) belt wedges neatly into the different pulley grooves. The belt uses the tension and friction to turn the auxiliary devices.  
<P>
The fan belt is usually V-shaped, so it is also called a V-belt.  The fan belt friction comes from the sides of the belt and the sides of the pulley grooves to transmit power from one pulley to the other through the belt. Since the sides of the belt are used for transmission of power, the sides have very large surface areas.  The reason that the belt does not slip is because of the wedging action of the belt as it curves into the pulley grooves.  
<P>
Because your belts are so essential to so many parts of your engine, it is a very good idea to periodically check their condition. Check for cracking, splitting, or fraying, especially before summer.  Also, check the tightness of the belt and have it adjusted according to your owner's manual specifications.  Belts have a tendency to loosen with use. On the other hand, you don't want the belt to be too tight, or it will put too much pressure on the accessory bearings and cause them to die an early death. If a belt is over three years old, have it replaced even if it looks good.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator Shroud</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
If the fan that pulls air through the radiator core to cool the engine coolant is too far back, it will end up recirculating the same hot air that has collected behind the radiator. For this reason, the radiator often has a shroud.  
<P>
The radiator shroud prevents the recirculation of air around the fan. It is usually a plastic hood that encloses the fan to guide the air through the core, and stop it from coming back around and through the fan again. It also protects you from the fan blades!  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator Hoses</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Hoses are used to connect the engine and the water pump to the radiator. Radiator hoses are made of flexible rubber; size varies depending upon the type of engine. Smaller hoses run to the heater core, these are known as (you guessed it) heater hoses.  
<P>
Three types of hoses are; the common hose, the molded or shaped hose, and the accordion type hose. All of these hoses may have spiral wire in their construction. Spiral wire can be molded or inserted into the hoses, in the required shape, when the hose is constructed.  
<P>  
The common hose is straight and cannot take much bending before collapsing. It is made of rubber with fabric reinforcement.  
<P>
Molded or shaped hoses are the same as the common hose with one exception. They will not collapse when bent, because all of the bends that they need are already molded into them.  
<P> 
Accordion type hoses not only put up with all kinds of severe bending, but they also absorb some of the vibration between the engine and the radiator.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Water (Coolant) Jackets</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
When our bodies feel cold, we put on a jacket. Our car engines wear permanent jackets for the opposite reason-- to keep cool!   
<P>
The water jacket is a collection of passages within the block and head. These passages let the coolant circulate around the "hot spots" (valve seats and guides, cylinder walls, combustion chamber, etc.) in order to cool them off.  
<P>
The engine block is actually manufactured in one piece with the water jackets cast into the block and cylinder head. At normal operating temperature, the water pump forces the coolant through the head gasket openings and on into the water jackets in the cylinder head. It flows around in there, cooling everything off by absorbing the heat. After doing its thing, the coolant flows through the upper hose to the radiator where it releases the heat.  Then, the water pump sends it back down into the engine's water jackets to continue the cooling process.  
<P>
On the sides of the engine are "freeze" or "expansion" plugs, which are sheet metal plugs pressed into a series of holes in the block. These are designed to hold the pressure of the cooling system, but to pop out if the coolant in the block ever freezes.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Heater Core</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The heater core is a smaller version of the radiator that is used to keep your toes warm when it's cold outside.  
<P>
The heater core is mounted under the dash board. Some of the hot coolant is routed through this little radiator, by more hoses. A small electric fan is also mounted there especially for the purpose of directing the heat inside the car. To turn this fan on, you use a switch called "fan" or "blower," located on your control panel.  The principle is exactly the same as the one used in the radiator for your engine, except that the heat is released inside the car instead of outside. Most engines use the heater core to warm the air coming from the air conditioner if the dash setting is not on "cold". More efficient designs don't do this because it makes the engine work harder than it has to. They cycle the compressor on and off to lessen the cooling output.  
<P>
If your car is running hot, turning the heater on will help to reduce the heat in the engine. Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Fan Clutch</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The fan clutch is a small fluid coupling with a thermostatic device that controls a variable-speed fan. The fan clutch ensures that the fan will rotate at just the right speed to keep the engine from overheating, and reduces drive to the fan when it is no longer needed.  
<P>
The fan clutch has a fluid coupling partly filled with silicone oil designed for just that purpose. If the temperature of the air passing through the radiator rises, the heat alerts a bimetal coil spring to "uncoil" or expand. When it expands, it allows just a little more oil to enter the fluid coupling, so the fluid coupling starts to rotate the fan. If the air coming through the radiator is cool, the opposite happens; the coil spring contracts, the oil leaves the fluid coupling and the fan slows. Slowing the fan when it is not needed reduces fuel consumption, makes less noise and saves engine power.  
<P>
Sometimes a flat bimetal strip spring is used instead of a coil spring; it bows out and in when the temperature rises and drops, letting oil in and out of the fluid coupling.   
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Freeze Plugs (Expansion Plugs)</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Freeze plugs (also called "blind" or "expansion core" plugs) are small steel plugs used to seal the holes in the engine block and head made in casting. They expand and flatten as they are driven into place, and make a tight seal. These are designed to hold the pressure of the cooling system, but to pop out if the coolant in the block ever freezes.  
<P>
If you have a leak in your cooling system, freeze plugs are one of the areas to have checked.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Temperature Sending Units</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Since it is critical for you to keep an eye on the temperature of the coolant in your cooling system at all times, your car will have either a gauge or a warning light located on the instrument panel or dashboard (see temperature gauge). The question is, how does the  information about your coolant get to the gauge? It gets there, or is sent by the temperature sending unit.  
<P>
The temperature sending unit is a device that is placed so that it can determine the temperature of the engine coolant. Simply put, its resistance to electricity changes with increases and decreases in the temperature of the coolant. The electric resistance changes control the movement of the indicator needle on the temperature gauge. If you have an indicator light, or lights, these changes will cause the bulb to be connected to the battery if the temperature of your coolant gets too high. If this happens, the light goes on.  
<P>
There are two types of sending units. One type uses a Bourdon tube instrument, a capillary tube filled with a special gas, and a capsule, or bulb. The other type uses an electric sender receiver.  
<P>
The Bourdon tube type works by having one end of the tube attached to the gauge fitting, and the free end fastened to the needle indicator. A Bourdon tube is a round, hollow metal tube. Putting pressure on the hollow end causes it to try to straighten, so that the other end moves the needle on the gauge. Because it is placed in an engine water jacket, the pressure from the coolant temperature causes it to move, which, in turn forces the other end to move the gauge needle. When the coolant cools, the lack of pressure allows the needle to swing back to cold on the gauge.  
<P>
The electric sender receiver type has a bimetal thermostat in the dashboard. This thermostat is linked to the gauge needle, so that when the engine gets warmer and passes more current, the thermostat, getting hotter itself, bends. When the thermostat bends, it moves the gauge needle, which indicates that the coolant temperature is rising. As it cools off, the thermostat "unbends" again, and the needle drops back to the cold indicator.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Temperature Gauge</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Some cars have temperature gauges, and some have indicator lights. The purpose of these temperature viewing devices is one of extreme importance to you while operating your vehicle, because you need to monitor the temperature of your coolant at all times.  
<P>
The temperature gauge, or indicator light, is installed on the dash or control panel of your car. If this light comes on, it indicates that something has gone terribly wrong in your engine.  
<P>
A temperature gauge gives you more of a complete picture. It  gradually moves from "Cold", when you start your engine, up toward the "Hot" indicator. Usually this type of gauge will have some type of marking (like RED) to show you when you are approaching the danger zone. When your engine is happy, it will usually move up to (and stay put) somewhere in the middle. If it advances into the "red" zone, STOP and let it cool down. Give the engine a rest for half an hour with the hood up. DON'T REMOVE THE RADIATOR CAP UNTIL THE ENGINE COOLS OFF. Don't pour water over the engine, this can crack the block. When the engine has cooled off, check the water level, start the engine, then fill it up with water or antifreeze.  When you get to a service station, have the problem fixed as soon as possible.
<P>
Temperature increase can sometimes indicate problems not directly involved with the cooling system.  
<P>
Some vehicles have indicator lights instead of gauges. These are more difficult to monitor, since nothing much happens until there is a problem. Indicator lights are located in the control panel or dashboard. Some cars have a "Cold" indicator light. This will go on when you start the car, and go out when normal operating temperature has been reached. The "Hot" light goes on when the car is overheating. This light is designed to light up at 5 to 10 degrees F below the coolant's boiling point. This light tells you to STOP before the engine is damaged, let it cool down, and have the problem discovered and fixed.  
<P>
Indicator lights have one other feature, called "prove-out." This means that when you turn the key in the ignition switch, the lights should go on for just a moment to "prove" that they are functioning, and that the bulbs haven't burned out. It is very important for you glance at them each time you start your car to make sure that they are in working order. Suppose your "Hot" indicator light bulb has burned out. If your engine is overheating, it won't be able to tell you. As a result, you'll go driving on your merry way to engine damage city without a clue. Your first clue will be a "knocking" or "pinging" sound during acceleration, and at that point, it's usually too late to prevent serious damage.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Oil Coolers</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Engine oil gets quite hot as it removes heat from the cylinder walls, pistons, and other engine parts, so we need to have a way to cool the oil off. Usually this happens when the airstream passes over the oil pan. Also, the cooling system is doing its job of keeping the engine temperature down so that the oil doesn't have too much to contend with. Routinely, the oil loses some heat as it goes through the oil filter and also as the whole engine gives off heat. For all of these reasons, it's unusual for the oil to become overheated.  
<P>
However, there are some situations when special equipment needs to be added to keep the oil temperature down. Heavy duty engines, and normal duty engines that are carrying heavy loads are often equipped with oil coolers. Also, almost all air-cooled engines have oil coolers.  
<P> 
There are several types of oil coolers. One type fits between the oil filter and engine block. It's a compartment passageway made up of thin disks. The oil is forced through this passage, where engine coolant circulates around it, and cools it off.  
<P>
A different type of oil cooler "borrows" a small section of the coolant radiator and gets cooled off the same way as the coolant does; forced air from the grille and the fan.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Transmission Fluid Cooler</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
As it is possible for the transmission fluid in automatic  transmissions to overheat, causing reduction in performance and transmission damage, a transmission fluid cooler is a must. Manual transmissions (with the exception of racing car type vehicles) do not generally need transmission fluid coolers.  
<P>  
The transmission fluid cooler is either a "borrowed" section of the engine's coolant radiator, or a separately mounted little tube with fins. The fluid is forced to flow through one of these arrangements, and consequently, cooled.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Tube Type Transmission Fluid Cooler</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The tube type of transmission fluid cooler is usually located in the radiator's end cap. Because of its location it is immersed in and cooled by the engine's coolant. Then, when the transmission fluid passes through it, the fluid is cooled. Two metal tubes, called the transmission cooler lines, are attached to the outlet tank of the radiator and carry the fluid between the transmission and the fluid cooler.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Auxiliary Transmission Fluid Cooler</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>  
Vehicles that are factory equipped with packages for towing often also come equipped with an auxiliary fluid cooler. This cooler is mounted in front of the radiator and connected with the trans- mission. The auxiliary cooler is like a small engine coolant radiator.   
<P> 
Both types of transmission fluid coolers ask the engine cooling system to do a bigger job; the tube type transfers the heat to the coolant. The auxiliary type, since it is mounted in front of the radiator, warms the air before it passes through the radiator.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The radiator is a device designed to dissipate the heat which the coolant has absorbed from the engine. It is constructed to hold a large amount of water in tubes or passages which provide a large area in contact with the atmosphere. It usually consists of a radiator core, with its water-carrying tubes and large cooling area, which are connected to a receiving tank (end cap) at the top and to a dispensing tank at the bottom. Side flow radiators have their "end caps" on the sides, which allows a lower hood line.  
<P>
In operation, water is pumped from the engine to the top (receiving) tank, where it spreads over the tops of the tubes. As the water passes down through the tubes, it loses its heat to the airstream which passes around the outside of the tubes. To help spread the heated water over the top of all the tubes, a baffle plate is often placed in the upper tank, directly under the inlet hose from the engine.   
<P>
Sooner or later, almost everyone has to deal with an overheating car. Since water is readily available, it is not beyond the ability of most people to add some to their radiator if it's low. BUT PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN OR SERIOUS BURNS CAN RESULT. Here are a few pointers for dealing with an overheated radiator:  
<OL>
	<LI>Turn off the A/C. If the car is not seriously overheating, this will reduce the engine's temperature. The AC evaporator is located in front of the radiator, and it adds heat to the air going to your engine. The hotter the incoming air is, the less efficient the radiator will be.  
	<LI>Turn on your heater (set on highest temperature setting, with blower on highest setting). This will be uncomfortable for you, but it will cool the engine by transferring the heat to the air. Roll down the windows, and remember how 'hot' you'll get if your engine needs replacement!  
	<LI>If you're stuck in traffic, pull over and stop. Unless you're moving, very little cool air reaches the radiator. Open the hood and let the engine cool off. This takes time, so be patient. Use the time to go get a jug of water or antifreeze.
	<LI>Check the overflow tank coolant level. If it's empty, the radiator is probably low on coolant.  
	<LI>Check the pressure of the system by wrapping a cloth around the upper radiator hose and squeezing it. If it's still under pressure (hot) it will not squeeze easily. Wait until it does.
	<LI>If the coolant is low, start the engine, and slowly add the water or coolant necessary to fill it up. THE ENGINE MUST BE RUNNING. ADDING COOLANT TO A WARM ENGINE CAN CRACK THE BLOCK. By running the engine, the coolant keeps moving and reduces the chances of this type of damage occurring.  
</UL> 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Water Pump</B></FONT></CENTER>  

<P>
Water pumps come in many designs, but most include a rotating impeller, which forces the coolant through the engine block.  In most rear wheel drive cars, the fan is installed on the end of the water pump shaft. Many water pumps have a spring-loaded seal to avoid leakage of water around the pump shaft. Modern pumps are fitted with pre-packed ball bearings, which are sealed at each end to eliminate the need for lubrication.   
<P>
Impeller type water pumps must turn rapidly to be efficient, and worn or loose drive belts can permit slippage which is not easily detected.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Coolant Bypass</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The bypass hose allows coolant to recirculate within the engine,  without passing through the radiator, as it does when the engine is  warmed up and the thermostat opens. The bypass hose connects the thermostat housing and the water pump. The water enters the bypass tube through the bypass valve, when such a valve is fitted.   
<P>
The bypass valve is sometimes operated thermostatically; it closes off the bypass hose when a certain temperature is reached. This increases the circulation of the coolant within the engine. Many cars don't need a bypass valve, because there is plenty of coolant going through the radiator hoses due to the thermostat.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Coolant (Antifreeze)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Coolant (antifreeze) is a complex chemical liquid that allows the engine to run at higher and lower temperatures than plain water would otherwise allow. It helps prevent freezing in cold climates, so that cars can operate in sub zero temperatures, and boils at a higher temperature than water. This gives the car more flexibility in accommodating temperature ranges. It also serves to lubricate the water pump as it flows through. Some antifreeze compounds are specially formulated for aluminum radiators. Coolant is supposed to be kept somewhere between 20 and 60 percent of the mixture in your car, depending on the car and climactic conditions. Too strong of an antifreeze mixture can cause leaks in your car's cooling system.   
<P>
Coolant is extremely poisonous and should never be poured out on the ground. Animals are very attracted to it's sweet smell and drink it.
<P>
This will kill them. Keep antifreeze in a safe place, where young children will not have access to it; it is poisonous to them as well as animals.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Heat Transfer</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
When air passes over an object, it can accumulate heat energy or  deposit heat on the object. This is thermal convection in action. The radiator is designed to transfer the coolant's heat energy to the air.  
<P>
As air passes through the radiator, the heat in the coolant actually passes through the metal and is absorbed by the air. When the air reaches the far side of the radiator, it is at a greater temperature and the coolant is at a lower temperature because it dissipated its heat into the air. The same principle is at work within the transmission cooler of a radiator, if the car has an automatic transmission. The transmission fluid flowing through the cooler gives off it's heat to the coolant within the radiator, which then gives off it's heat to the air flowing through the radiator.   
<P>
Disc brakes and various other parts which need cooling dissipate heat directly into the air without using water. Some types of cars, such as Volkswagens, use air cooled engines. These eliminate the need for water by having more engine surface area through the use of cast fins. These allow the air to pass over a large surface area of the engine and thus transfer heat directly to the air.
<P>
As your car travels down the road, the air that passes through the  radiator grille either exits through the floor of the engine compartment, or it may pass out through the sides of the car, through what are known as gills. These side vents allow the air, which is compressed within the engine compartment to exit to an area which is of relatively low pressure rather than trying to force it under the car where there isn't as much room for it.   
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Hose Clamps</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
The clamps used to secure the ends of radiator hoses come in a variety of designs. Most use a simple one piece design, which has no adjustment when installed. The other major design uses a screw drive to allow  a wide size range and greater adjustability. These types are better in some ways, but if they are overtightened, they can cut through the hoses.

<FONT SIZE=5><B><H1>Drive Train (An Overview)</H1></B></FONT> </CENTER> 

<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Drive Train</B></FONT> </CENTER> <BR> <BR> 

  
   <P> The drive train serves two functions: it transmits power from the  
   engine to the drive wheels, and it varies the amount of torque.  
   "Power" is the rate or speed at which work is performed.  "Torque" is  
   turning or twisting force. Multiple ratio gearboxes are necessary  
   because the engine delivers its maximum power at certain speeds, or  
   RPM (Rotations Per Minute). In order to use the same engine RPM's at  
   different road speeds, it is necessary to change the "Gear Ratio"  
   between the engine and the drive wheels. Just like a bicycle, the car  
   has to switch gears in order to move at a wide range of speeds.  
   Unlike your bicycle, the car's drivetrain also has to allow you to  
   back up. (Well, you could push it backwards if you ate your Wheaties)  
  
   <P> There are actually two sets of gears in the drive train; the  
   transmission and the differential. The transmission allows the gear  
   ratio to be adjusted, and the differential lets the drive wheels turn  
   at different speeds.   
     
  <P>  Manual transmissions usually have four or five speeds, and often have  
   "overdrive", which means that the output shaft can turn faster than  
   the input shaft for fuel economy on the highway. Some use an electric  
   clutch and a switch that controls whether the overdrive is engaged or  
   not. An interesting development on a few cars is the "clutchless"  
   manual transmission, which uses a stick shift and an automatic  
   electric clutch. Speed and position sensors, mini computers, and  
   throttle controls keep the engine from over-revving when the driver  
   shifts gears. As with many automotive "inventions", this is an old  
   idea which may now reach feasibility due to the computer revolution.  
     
   <P> Automatic transmissions commonly use three forward gears to blend  
   speed and torque. In the case of a three-speed transmission, first  
   gear delivers maximum torque and minimum speed for starting. Second  
   gear offers medium torque and speed for acceleration and hill  
   climbing. Third gear allows maximum speed with minimum torque for  
   highway travel. A reverse gear permits backward movement.  
  
   <P> A transmission is a speed and power changing device installed at some  
   point between the engine and driving wheels of a vehicle. It provides  
   a means for changing the ratio between engine RPM (Revolutions Per  
   Minute) and driving wheel RPM to best meet each particular driving  
   situation.   
  
   <P> Some types of drive train layouts use a "Transaxle", which is  
   simply a combination of the transmission and the differential. These  
   are usually found on front wheel drive cars, but are also used on  
   mid- and rear-engine cars. Some exotic cars have their engine in the  
   front, and a transaxle in the rear of the car for better weight  
   balance.  
  
  <P>  Torque is derived from power. The amount of torque obtainable from a  
   source of power is proportional to the distance from the center of  
   rotation at which it is applied. It is logical, then, that if we have  
   a shaft (in this case, the crankshaft) rotating at any given speed,  
   we can put gears of different sizes on the shaft and obtain different  
   results. If we put a large gear on the shaft, we will get more speed  
   and less power at the rim than with a small gear. If we place another  
   shaft parallel to our driving shaft and install gears on it in line  
   with those on the driving shaft, we can obtain almost any desired  
   combination of speed or power within the limits of the engine's  
   ability. That is exactly what an automobile transmission does by  
   means of gears and other devices.  
  
  <P>  There are two types of transmissions; manual and automatic. If you  
   have a manual transmission, you have to shift the gears yourself,  
   usually with a stick located on your console and the clutch pedal.  
   If you have an automatic transmission, the mechanism changes without  
   any help from you. This is accomplished through a system that works  
   by oil pressure. Each shift of the gears is controlled by a shift  
   valve; the gears shift change depending on speed, the road, and load  
   conditions.  
  
   <P> Another basic component of all drive trains is some form of a clutch.  
   it allows the engine to continue rotating while the gears and wheels  
   are stationary. Automatic transmission cars use a "torque converter"  
   in lieu of a clutch.   
  
   <P> From the back of the engine to where the rubber meets the road, the  
   drivetrain encompasses one of the most complicated systems of your   
   car. Some people say looking at a transmission "makes their brain  
   hurt".   
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Manual Transmission</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The manual transmission provides a means of varying the relationship  
   between the speed of the engine and the speed of the wheels. Varying  
   these gear ratios allows the right amount of engine power at many  
   different speeds.   
  
   <P> Manual transmissions require use of a clutch to apply and remove  
   engine torque to the transmission input shaft. The clutch allows this  
   to happen gradually that so that the car can be started from a  
   complete stop.  
  
  <P> Modern manual transmissions do not disengage any of the forward drive  
   gears, they are simply connected to their shafts through the use of  
   "synchronizers". Reverse is achieved through reverse idler gears,  
   which are engaged to move the car backwards.   
  
  <P>  Some manual transmissions have an "overdrive." An overdrive is a   
   mechanical unit bolted to the rear of the transmission. It is usually  
   known as fifth gear. When you use it, it will reduce the engine speed  
   by about one-third, while maintaining the same road speed.  
  
  <P>  Chrysler came out with the first overdrive transmission in 1934.  
  
     <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                            Transmission Gears</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Most cars have from three to five forward gears, and one reverse  
   gear. The transmission changes the ratio of the engine speed and the  
   wheels by connecting gears in various combinations. If a gear with 10  
   teeth is driving a gear with 20 teeth, the drive would be said to  
   have a 2:1 ratio.  
   
  <P>  First gear connects the engine power to the drive wheels via a pair  
   of reduction gear sets, which gives increased power and reduced  
   wheelspeed when the car is beginning to move. This means the engine  
   is turning much faster than the output shaft, typically around a 4:1  
   ratio. Intermediate speeds are delivered by changing the gear ratio  
   closer to 1:1. Final drive is usually accomplished by directly  
   linking the input and output shafts, giving a 1:1 gear ratio. Using a  
   moveable set of different sized gears, it's possible to get several  
   degrees of torque output. The differential pinion, driven by the  
   drive shaft, turns the ring gear, which acts like a single speed  
   transmission. This further reduces RPM's and increases torque by a set  
   ratio.  
  
  <P>  Gears work exactly like levers. A small gear driving a larger one  
   gives an increase in torque, and a decrease in speed, and vise-versa.  
  
  <P>  Transmission gears are heat-treated, high quality steel. They have  
   smooth, hard teeth, cut on precision machinery while red hot. There  
   are many types of gear teeth, but most transmissions use spur and  
   helical gears. Most of the gears are the helical type, because they  
   last longer and are more quiet than spur gears. There has to be  
   enough room (a few thousandths of an inch) between the gear teeth for  
   lubrication, expansion, and any irregularities in size.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>          Transmission Oil</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The transmission needs lubrication to keep all of the gears and  
   shafts running smoothly. This is accomplished by partially filling  
   the transmission housing with thick transmission gear oil.  When the  
   gear gears spin, they fling the fluid around and lubricate all of the  
   parts. Oil seals at the front and rear stop the fluid from leaking  
   out of the housing.  
  
 <P>   Fluid levels should be checked when you change your oil, or if you  
   notice difficulties or differences in shifting. This can indicate  
   that the level of fluid might be low.   
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Gear Shift Mechanism</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  What causes the transmission to shift? It's shifted by shifter forks,  
   also known as sliding yokes. These resemble the oarlocks you find in  
   a row boat. and they ride in a groove in the clutch sleeve and  
   sliding gear. Shifter forks are connected to a cam and shaft  
   assembly. The cam assembly is kept in the selected gear by spring  
   loaded steel balls that jump through notches (in the cam assembly)  
   and hold the shifter forks in that gear. The shafts (of the cam and  
   shaft assembly) go through the housing and are fastened to shift   
   levers.  
  
  <P>  The shifter forks move the synchronizers which engage the gears to  
   the shafts they ride on.  
  
   <P> The shift levers are connected to a control on the steering column or  
   a shift stick located on the floor. Both of these are powered by --  
   you!   
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                            Speedometer Cable</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P> 
   The speedometer cable is connected to the gearbox output shaft, the  
   transmission shaft, or differential. The rotation of these shafts is  
   used to measure the speed and record mileage. This information is  
   sent back through the cable where it is recorded on the speedometer.  
  
  <P>  The speedometer and odometer are driven by a cable housed in a   
   flexible casing. This cable is connected to a gear in the  
   transmission. Speedometer cables break as the result of age, lack of  
   lubrication, or because the cable casing has sharp bends. It also  
   breaks from too much friction in the speedometer head.   
  
      <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              The Clutch</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The clutch allows you to connect and disconnect the engine and the  
   transmission, both starting up and during shifts. Friction plates  
   route the rotation of the engine crankshaft to the gears, and then to  
   the wheels. It takes the rotation up slowly, so that you aren't off  
   to a screeching start. In a manual transmission, you disengage the  
   clutch when you press the pedal down. The pedal works the thrust pad,  
   and it presses levers in the middle of the clutch cover. Doing all  
   this lifts the pressure plate away from the clutch plate. The  
   flywheel (which is turned by the crankshaft from the transmission  
   shaft) gets disconnected.  
  
  <P>  When you lift the clutch pedal, springs force the pressure plate and  
   clutch plate against the flywheel. The clutch plate friction linings  
   allow it to slide before becoming engaged. The sliding causes a  
   smooth start instead of a jolt.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                             The Clutch Plate</B></FONT> </CENTER>
   <P>
   The clutch plate is a thin, steel, disc. Its center is connected to  
   the transmission input shaft by a grooved piece of metal, or hub. The  
   disc is covered with material that is similar to the break linings.   
   This material allows the clutch to slip smoothly and quietly.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Flywheel</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The flywheel is a fairly large wheel that is connected to the  
   crankshaft. It provides the momentum to keep the crankshaft turning  
   between piston firings.  
  
   <P> The flywheel is the base for the entire clutch attachment. The side  
   of the flywheel that the clutch is attached to is smooth, so that it  
   provides a surface for friction. The clutch assembly is mounted to  
   the flywheel, sandwiching the clutch plate in between.  A bearing,  
   called the "pilot bearing" is installed in a hole in the center of  
   the flywheel. This lubricated bearing, either a ball bearing or a  
   bronze bushing, is used to support one end of the clutch shaft, which  
   is also the transmission input shaft. Around the flywheel is the ring  
   gear, which the starter motor turns when the key is turned.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                 The Clutch Pedal, Cables and Levers</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  
  <P>  One way to activate the throw-out fork of the clutch is by using a  
   system of levers and cables. These levers and cables are connected  
   between the clutch pedal and the throw-out fork. When you press the  
   clutch pedal with your foot, the pressure is transmitted to the fork  
   through the cable and lever arrangement.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Hydraulic Clutch</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  
  <P>  Another method used to activate the clutch throw-out fork is the  
   hydraulic clutch. This method is often used when the mechanical  
   design of the car makes it difficult to use levers and cables. It is  
   also used to multiply force, reducing driver fatigue.  
  
  <P>  With a hydraulic clutch, when you press the clutch pedal, it moves a  
   small cylinder called the "master" cylinder. Pressure is created in  
   the master cylinder which is, in turn, transmitted to the "slave"  
   cylinder. The slave cylinder is attached to the throw-out fork by a  
   small adjustable rod, so when pressure is exerted on the slave  
   cylinder, it operates the fork. Both master and slave cylinders are  
   designed in such an uncomplicated way that they are easy to attach  
   with hydraulic tubing.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           The Differential</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The differential is the thing that works both drive axles at the same  
   time, but lets them rotate at different speeds so that the car can  
   make turns. When a car makes a turn, the outer wheel has to turn  
   faster than the inner wheel, due to the difference in the length of  
   the paths they take. The differential is located between the two  
   wheels, and is attached to each wheel by a half-shaft rotated through  
   a bevel gear. Four-wheel drive cars have a separate differential for  
   each pair of wheels.  
  
  <P>  A grooved, or splined, axle side gear is positioned on the splined  
   end of each axle. The side gears are driven by "spider" gears, which  
   are little gears mounted on a shaft attached to the differential  
   case. As it is supported by the differential case, the side gear can  
   turn inside the case.  
  
  <P>  The differential case can be turned, revolving around the axle gears.  
   The differential pinion (a pinion is a small gear that either drives  
   a larger gear or is driven by one) shaft turns the ring gear, which  
   is fastened to the differential case. The propeller shaft (drive  
   shaft) connects the transmission output shaft to the differential  
   pinion shaft. The turning differential case is mounted on two large  
   bearing holders. These bearings are called carrier bearings.  
  
   <P> The propeller shaft rotates the ring gear pinion, and the pinion  
   turns the ring gear. The ring gear then turns the differential case  
   and pinion shaft, but the axle side gears will not turn. By passing  
   the differential pinion shaft through two differential pinion gears  
   that mesh with the side gears, the case will turn and the axle side  
   gears will turn with it. During turns, the side gears turn at rates  
   dictated by the radius of the turns, and the spider gears then turn  
   to allow the outer wheel to turn faster than the inner one.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Differential Fluids</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  For lubrication fluid, a very heavy oil, must be used in rear axle  
   housings. Special hypoid oils are used in the differential case.  
   Even another type of fluid, or oil must be used in a positraction  
   type differential.  
  
  <P>  The oil is circulated by the ring gear, and flung all over all the  
   parts. Special troughs, or gullies are used to bring the oil back to  
   certain spots, like the ring and pinion area and the piston bearings.  
   The fluid is kept in with gaskets and oil seals. The bottom of the  
   housing has a drain plug, and another filler plug is located part way  
   up the housing. The housing must never be filled above this plug.  
  <P> 
   The housing fluid lubricates some of the outer bearings, but others  
   have lubrication fittings for the injection of wheel bearing grease.  
   A hand gun, not a pressure grease gun must be used to grease these  
   bearings (sparingly). A pressure grease gun could inject grease into  
   the brakes-- greasy brakes are inefficient at best!  
  
   Finally, some bearings are filled with grease at the factory and are  
   sealed. These never require attention unless they are defective.

                        Positraction Differentials</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  A positraction differential is a special traction differential. Its  
   purpose is to improve the way your differential performs under  
   adverse conditions. When one wheel starts to slip, these  
   differentials transfer the torque to the wheel that is not slipping.  
   The car can then continue to go forward. There are several different  
   kinds of positraction differentials, but all of them are based on a  
   friction device to provide resistance to normal differential  
   operation.  
  
  <P>  A positraction differential provides better traction, which is handy  
   when roads are slippery. It also lends itself to fast acceleration.  
 <P>  
   One type uses four differential pinions instead of two, with two  
   pinion shafts. It also uses a series of four clutch discs. The  
   differential pinions run into resistance when they try to turn the  
   axle side gears. The resistance gets transferred to the pinion shafts  
   driving the pinions. The shafts are forced to slide up little ramps.  
   This action moves both shafts outward. The pinions cause the clutches  
   to lock.  
  
  <P>  Other types use cone clutches, or disc clutches under pressure from  
   coil springs. By restricting the differential action, torque is  
   delivered to the slipping wheel.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           The Drive Shaft</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The drive shaft, or propeller shaft, connects the transmission output  
   shaft to the differential pinion shaft. Since all roads are not  
   perfectly smooth, and the transmission is fixed, the drive shaft has  
   to be flexible to absorb the shock of bumps in the road.  Universal,  
   or "U-joints" allow the drive shaft to flex (and stop it from  
   breaking) when the drive angle changes.  
  
  <P>  Drive shafts are usually hollow in order to weigh less, but of a  
   large diameter so that they are strong. High quality steel, and  
   sometimes aluminum are used in the manufacture of the drive shaft.  
   The shaft must be quite straight and balanced to avoid vibrating.  
   Since it usually turns at engine speeds, a lot of damage can be  
   caused if the shaft is unbalanced, or bent. Damage can also be caused  
   if the U-joints are worn out.  
   <P>
   There are two types of drive shafts, the Hotchkiss drive and the  
   Torque Tube Drive. The Hotchkiss drive is made up of a drive shaft  
   connected to the transmission output shaft and the differential  
   pinion gear shaft. U-joints are used in the front and rear. The  
   Hotchkiss drive transfers the torque of the output shaft to the  
   differential. No wheel drive thrust is sent to the drive shaft.  
   Sometimes this drive comes in two pieces to reduce vibration and make  
   it easier to install (in this case, three U-joints are needed).The  
   two-piece types need ball bearings in a dustproof housing as center  
   support for the shafts. Rubber is added into this arrangement for  
   noise and vibration reduction.  
  
  <P>  The torque tube drive shaft is used if the drive shaft has to carry  
   the wheel drive thrust. It is a hollow steel tube that extends from  
   the transmission to the rear axle housing. One end is fastened to the  
   axle housing by bolts. The transmission end is fastened with a torque  
   ball. The drive shaft fits into the torque tube. A U-joint is located  
   in the torque ball, and the axle housing end is splined to the pinion  
   gear shaft. Drive thrust is sent through the torque tube to the  
   torque ball, to transmission, to engine and finally, to the frame  
   through the engine mounts. That is, the car is pushed forward by the  
   torque tube pressing on the engine.

                      The Universal Joint (U-joint)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The Universal joint (U-joint) is used to connect the drive shaft to  
   the transmission output shaft and the differential pinion gear shaft.  
   This joint must be flexible enough to allow changes in the driving  
   angle (road incline) and the drive shaft. This way, the torque is  
   constantly transmitted when the rear axle is moving up and down.  
   Smaller U-joints are used to route the turning motion of the steering  
   wheel through the steering column to the steering box.  
  
   <P> There are two types of U-joints, the cross and roller type and the  
   ball and trunnion type. The cross and roller type is used the most;  
   it allows the drive shaft to bend. The ball and trunnion type less  
   frequently used; it allows the drive shaft to bend and also permits  
   backward and forward motion of the drive shaft.  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                 Constant Velocity Joints (CV Joints)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> Front wheel drive cars need u-joints which not only allow up and down  
   motion, but steering motion as well. the angle at which they turn  
   requires a different design than the standard U-joint.  
  
  <P>  Constant velocity, or CV joints are universal joints that are able to  
   transfer torque at large angles efficiently. These joints transfer  
   power very smoothly. They are comprised of four basic parts: 1. The  
   outer section, which has grooves machined on its inner surface, 2.  
   the bearings, which are usually in a "cage", 3. the inner ball, which  
   has grooves on its outer surface for the bearings to ride in, and 4.  
   a rubber boot to protect the unit from dirt and moisture.   
  
   <P> A common cause of CV joint failure is cracks in the CV boot. As dirt  
   enters the CV joint, its parts grind themselves until a clicking  
   noise is heard when turning, or until they fail completely. The boots  
   should be replaced as soon as cracking is visible in their rubber  
   folds.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Front Wheel Drive</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Many cars use a front drive axle. Most front-wheel drive axles are  
   constructed the same way as rear-wheel drive axles, with one  
   exception. A front-wheel axle assembly must provide a way to turn the  
   wheels as well as drive them.   
  
  <P>  The clutch or torque converter sends the power on to the transmission  
   input shaft. Next, the power is sent on to the differential by gears  
   or chains (belts). It goes through the differential gears through the  
   axle and CV Joints and finally to the front wheels.  
  <P>  Front wheel drive was not new in the eighties when it became popular.  
   Front wheel drive was introduced by the Pennington Car Company in   
   1900. Before that, steamers and electric cars had used it for years.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>2-Wheel Drive </B></FONT> </CENTER>
     
  <P>  The engine, clutch and gearbox are usually mounted on the frame at  
   the front of the vehicle. The rotating motion produced by the  
   crankshaft at the front of the vehicle is transmitted either to the  
   two wheels at the rear (rear wheel drive), or the two wheels at the  
   front (front wheel drive). Some cars are manufactured with rear  
   mounted engines that drive the rear wheels, and front mounted engines  
   that drive the front wheels.  
  
   <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>4 Wheel Drive</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  4-wheel drive vehicles use live front and rear drive axles. When  
   the front drive axle receives power from the transfer case, along  
   with the rear drive axle, the vehicle can function well on off-road  
   terrain (sand, rocks, mud, snow, etc.). A 4-wheel drive vehicle has  
   one drive axle that is automatically in use. The operator of the  
   vehicle has to activate and deactivate the second live drive axle.

   <P> All-wheel drive vehicles use live front and rear drive axles. When  
   the front drive axle receives power from the transfer case, along  
   with the rear drive axle, the vehicle can function well on off-road  
   terrain (sand, rocks, mud, snow, etc.). A 4-wheel drive vehicle has  
   one drive axle that is automatically in use. The operator of the

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Automatic Transmissions</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> An automatic transmission is much easier to drive than a manual  
   transmission, because you don't have to use a clutch pedal or  
   gearshift lever. An automatic transmission does the work all by  
   itself. The first automatic transmission appeared in 1939.  
  
  <P>  Automatic transmissions automatically change to higher and lower  
   gears with changes in the car's speed and the load on the engine.  
   These transmissions are also aware of how far down you have pushed  
   the gas pedal, and shift accordingly.  
  
  <P>  The system is operated by transmission fluid pressure; shift valves  
   control the gear changes. A "governor" controls the shifting of the  
   gears. It's linked to the output shaft and throttle valve and  
   controls the transmission fluid supply, at different pressures, to  
   the shift valve. Here's how it works: the output shaft turns the  
   governor. The faster the car goes, the faster the governor turns. Oil  
   is sent from the pump to the shift valves by centrifugal force from  
   the governor. The shift valves move out, and send the transmission  
   fluid to the gear shifting mechanisms in the transmission. When you  
   slow down, the valves move in, and send the transmission fluid in the  
   opposite direction. This action changes the gears.  
  <P> 
   By routing the pressure to the clutches and brake bands, the  
   different gears are selected.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                             Torque Converter </B></FONT> </CENTER>
                               
   <P> The torque converter is a type of fluid coupling between the engine  
   and the gearbox to even out speed changes. The torque converter also  
   multiplies engine torque.  
  
  <P>  The torque converter is used as a clutch to send the power (torque)  
   from the engine to the transmission input shaft. It has three parts;  
   an impeller connected to the engine's crankshaft, a turbine to turn  
   the turbine shaft which is connected to the gears, and a stator  
   between the two. The torque converter is filled with transmission  
   fluid that is moved by the impeller blades. The stator's vanes catch  
   the oil thrown off from the impeller, and use it to move the turbine's  
   blades. When the impeller spins above a certain speed, the turbine  
   spins, driven by the impeller.  
  
   <P> In some designs, the torque converter locks the impeller and the  
   turbine together when at highway speeds, which increases efficiency.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Brake Bands</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> A brake band is made of steel, and has a friction lining. One end of  
   the band is attached a servo actuating rod.   
  <P>
   A servo actuating rod is a hydraulic piston (a cylinder with a piston  
   inside it) that is open at one end to allow oil to flow in.  The  
   piston is normally in the released position because it's kept that  
   way by a spring. However, when pressurized oil is sent to the  
   cylinder, the oil forces the piston forward. This causes the brake  
   band to tighten, and this locks the brake.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Transmission Fluid</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Transmission fluid is a special kind of oil used only for   
   transmissions. It circulates through and lubricates the gears. Check  
   your car's owner's manual for the type to use.  No other type of oil  
   should ever be used in your transmission.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                          Automatic Gear shifting</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Almost all automatic transmissions use a pair of gear groups called  
   epicyclic, or planetary gears. Each group consists of; an outside  
   "ring" gear, a shared "sun" gear in the center, and a set of "planet  
   gears", which mesh in between the sun and the ring gear. Planet gears  
   are so named because each one turns on its own axis as they orbit the  
   sun gear, like planets do. Each group of planet gears is held in a  
   "planet gear carrier". By clamping the ring gears, the sun gear, and  
   the carriers together in various combinations, and by locking some of  
   them in stationary positions, it is possible to achieve three forward  
   gear ratios, and reverse as well.   
  <P> 
   Single epicyclic gear sets work like this:  
  <P>          
   To increase torque:  
   When the ring gear is stopped, and the power is applied to the sun  
   gear, the planet gears are forced to go around the sun gear. This  
   makes the pinion gears revolve more slowly around the inside gears,  
   and drive from the carrier will have lower speed and increased torque.  
  
   <P> To reverse the torque's direction:  
   If the planet gear carrier is stopped, and torque is applied to the  
   sun gear, the planet gears are forced to turn by the sun gear. This  
   makes the ring gear revolve, but more slowly than the ring gear,  
   which increases the torque, and in the opposite direction as the sun  
   gear, giving reverse.  
  
  <P>  If two members of the gear set are locked together, planetary action  
   is stopped and the gear set turns as one unit. When this happens,  
   there are no increases or decreases in torque transmission.  
  <P> 
   In order to have more than 2 forward speeds, two sets of epicyclic  
   gears are needed. By changing the number of teeth (size) of one set  
   of planetary gears, 4 forward speeds can be produced.   
  
 <P>   The clutches within the transmission are used to connect the input  
   torque, and the brake bands are used to lock the sun gear or the rear  
   planet carrier.  One way bearings serve to allow power flow in certain  
   directions only, working as clutches. All of the clutches and brake  
   bands are powered by hydraulic pressure, and regulated by the logic  
   circuit which is connected to the governor and/or directly to a  
   computer-controlled valve assembly. The transmission senses gas pedal  
   position and drive selector position, and engages the proper clutches  
   and bands for you to "Get out of Dodge".  
  <P> 
   The details of automatic transmission functions are vast, and  
   different designs are introduced by the many automakers with great  
   regularity. Some common principles shared by virtually all automatics  
   are: fluid clutches, brake bands, one way bearings (one way  
   clutches), and epicyclic gears. This crazy diagram is a simplified  
   version of but one design among many, and if you think it's hard to  
   understand, don't feel bad. It is!  
  
  <P>  In this type of transmission, to give first gear, the forward drive  
   clutch (C) locks the turbine shaft to the front ring gear. At the  
   same time, the second planet carrier brake band (D) locks the rear  
   planet carrier in place.  The power from the turbine shaft flows  
   through the front ring gear, which turns the front carrier, which  
   turns the sun gear. This reduces the RPM's and increases torque one  
   time. The second reduction/multiplication happens when the sun gear  
   turns the rear planet gears, each of which rotate within their  
   stationary carrier.  This causes the second ring gear to turn. The  
   second ring gear transfers its torque to the output shaft through the  
   second one-way clutch.  (Does your brain hurt yet?)  
  
 <P>   Second gear is accomplished by engaging the sun gear brake band (B)  
   and the forward-drive clutch (C). This gives one reduction in RPM.  
  
  <P>  Third gear (Drive) is engaged by locking the reverse-high clutch (A)  
   and the forward-drive clutch (C). This gives a 1:1 (direct) ratio  
   between the input and output shafts.  
  
  <P>  When reverse is selected, the reverse-high clutch (A) and the second  
   carrier brake band (D) are locked. This reverses the torque  
   direction, and reduces the ratio (twice) for use in backing up the  
   car.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Gears and Gear Ratios</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
 <P>  Gears are wheels with teeth that mesh together. This can happen  
   either directly (the wheels touch each other) or indirectly (a chain  
   might be used to make one gear turn the other). Sometimes a screw  
   (worm gear) or a shaft with teeth (a rack) acts in place of one of  
   the wheels. In your car, a gear is a combination of gear wheels that  
   are designed to produce certain speeds.  
  
  <P>  The gear ratio is dependent on the size of the two gear wheels  
   working together. The larger wheel will always rotate more slowly  
   than the smaller wheel (the smaller wheel has to turn faster to keep  
   up with the larger wheel). This means that the greater the size  
   difference between the two gear wheels, the greater the variance in  
   speed and force between the two wheels. For example, if the smaller  
   gear turns three times for every one turn of the larger wheel, the  
   gear ratio would be 3 to 1 (3:1).  
  <P>
   This fundamental principle is at work in the transmission in our  
   autos. The mechanical elements and complexity of manual transmissions  
   and the even more complex automatic transmissions are just a more  
   sophisticated version of a bicycle's derailleur gears.  The purpose  
   of all three types of transmissions is to use the relatively stable  
   power output from our engines, or bodies, to the varying power needed  
   to begin and sustain motion.  
  
  <P>  If you have ever tried to pedal a multi-speed bike uphill in the  
   "wrong" gear, you have felt this principle at work. Our legs tire  
   quickly because too much is demanded from them. We can either stop  
   and walk, or stop and fall over. A better answer is to shift to an  
   easier (lower) gear. "Downshifting" the gear allows the power from  
   our bodies to be leveraged, or multiplied; the pedals will turn  
   faster with less effort. What becomes confusing at this point is that  
   shifting downward INCREASES the gear ratio. It's easier to go uphill  
   at a 10 to 1 (10:1) ratio than it is with a five to one (5:1) ratio.  
   With a 2 to 1 (2:1) gear ratio, the engine turns twice to turn the  
   wheels once. Gear ratios are determined by the number of teeth on  
   them. A gear with 20 teeth meshing with a gear with 60 teeth would  
   yield a 3:1 ratio.  
  
  <P>  By moving the shift lever, we have increased the number of pedal  
   revolutions needed to turn the rear wheel, but decreased the amount  
   of effort required to turn the wheel.  
  
   <P> Both the amount of power and the RPM's (revolutions per minute)  
   needed to turn our bicycle or car wheels are controlled by gears or  
   sprockets of varying sizes.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Throw-Out Bearing</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The release lever operating mechanism of the clutch is known as the  
   throw-out bearing. This is a ball bearing, mounted on a sleeve or  
   collar, and it slides back ad forth on a hub. The hub is part of the  
   transmission front bearing retainer.  
  
  <P>  The factory fills the throw-out bearing with grease, so it doesn't  
   usually need service. Some cars use a graphite type, which is a ring  
   of graphite that presses against a plate attached to the clutch  
   levers.  
  
  <P>  The sleeve with the throw-out bearing moves in and out by means of a  
   throw-out fork; it rotates on a ball pivot stud.  
  
  <P>  When you disengage the clutch, the clutch pedal is all of the way  
   down. The throw-out fork forces the throw-out bearing into contact  
   with the pressure plate release levers, which pull the pressure plate  
   from the clutch disc to release it. Once released, the flywheel and  
   pressure plate continue to turn.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Synchronizers (Synchros)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
   <P>
   "Synchros" are synchronizers inside the transmission. These are the   
   actual parts that move when you move your gear shift from side to   
   side and back and forth. Their job is to connect the gears of the   
   transmission to the shafts that they ride on and lock them together.  
   This must be done at a gradual rate or the gears will grind. The  
   synchronizer drives a cone shaped metal piece against the gear and  
   starts the gear spinning. It accelerates it to the speed of the  
   output shaft. When the gear reaches the speed of the output shaft,  
   the synchro meshes completely with both of them and directs drive  
   through its splines from the gear to the output shaft or vice versa.  
   Some cars allow you to shift without pressing the clutch. If you  
   shift gears slowly, the synchro will do the entire job and you never  
   have to press the clutch. This comes in handy if you've sprained your  
   left ankle.

  <P> The transmission housing is metal casting which is shaped to   
   accommodate the gears within the transmission. On one end it has a   
   flange that is bolted on to the back end of the clutch. On the other  
   end, it has a seal where the output shaft protrudes going to the  
   drive shaft.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Clutch Bell Housing</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The clutch bell housing is a stamped or cast metal part which houses  
   the clutch and connects the transmission housing to the back of the  
   engine. The clutch bell housing has a pivot point mounted to it where  
   the clutch throw-out bearing lever arm is mounted.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       One-way Clutch Bearings</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  One-way clutch bearings allow shafts to be driven in only one   
   direction; it allows one shaft to "freewheel" if it is spinning in   
   the opposite direction from the direction at which the clutch is   
   designed to engage. The one-way clutch bearing is designed very much  
   like the roller bearing, but the rollers are allowed to move up small  
   ramps. When the shaft turns in direction that locks the clutch, the  
   rollers roll up small ramps and wedge into cavities. When this  
   happens, the clutch locks and the shaft will drive the gear, or the  
   gear will drive the shaft. These bearings are used extensively in  
   automatic and manual transmissions-- allowing gears to be engaged  
   depending on their direction of rotation.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                                 Governor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P> 
   The governor is a device that senses the speed of the output shaft   
   and sends signals to the hydraulic control valve assembly telling the  
   transmission that it's time to shift.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Park Locking Ring</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> When you put your car in "Park", the shift mechanism makes the park  
   locking ring engage with a large metal pin. This prevents the output  
   shaft from turning. This way, your car cannot roll away without  
   permission.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Roller Bearings</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Roller bearings are constructed almost the same way as ball bearings,  
   but they have cylindrical shaped bearings instead of spherical shaped  
   bearings. This gives them a greater load bearing area. They are used  
   in wheel bearing applications. They consist of: 1. an inner "race"  
   which is a hardened ring that is slightly tapered on the outside and  
   2. an outer race, a hardened ring that is slightly tapered on the  
   inside and 3. a set of rollers contained in a cage. These bearings  
   must not be crushed together, (the angle of assembly drives them  
   together) creating friction if they are tightened too far. Roller  
   bearings need to be repacked periodically with fresh grease to insure  
   a long life.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Idler Gears</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
 <P>   Idler gears are small gears which are not directly linked to   
   anything. They are used to reduce or increase rotation speeds, and   
   reverse directions of rotation. If three gears are connected in a   
   string, the center gear would be considered an idler gear.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                    Differential Inspection Cover</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The differential inspection cover is mounted to the rear end of the  
   differential housing. It has to be removed for inspection of the rear  
   end components. It is usually mounted by ten or twelve bolts. It  
   usually has a drain plug halfway up the back of the inspection cover.  
   This is used both as an indicator of the capacity of the rear end and  
   as a filling point. When the rear end is filled with oil, it comes up  
   to the level of the drain plug.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Thrust Bearings</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Thrust bearings are similar to ball bearings except that the plates  
   that the balls ride between are designed as flat washers. The balls  
   riding between these washers reduce side-to-side load. These are used  
   inside of the transmission, rear end and many other areas of the car.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Ring Gear</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The ring gear is a large gear connected to the differential case.  
   The differential case is turned by a ring gear attached to a pinion  
   gear and shaft. The propeller shaft connects the transmission output  
   shaft to the differential pinion shaft. It is connected to the ring  
   gear pinion shaft.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Drive Wheel/Axle</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The drive wheel is the end of the axle shaft; it has lugs protruding  
   from it. The lugs are separate pieces that are mounted in the drive  
   wheel. The drive wheel bolts onto the brake drum and the wheel rim of  
   the car itself. It is usually a disc about six or seven inches in  
   diameter. Occasionally the drive wheel and the axle shaft are all one  
   piece.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                     Transmission Fluid Dip Stick</B></FONT> </CENTER>
   <P>
   The transmission fluid dip stick is a long metal rod that goes into  
   the transmission. The purpose of the dip stick is to check how much   
   transmission fluid is in the transmission.  
  
   <P> The dip stick is held in a tube; the end of the tube extends into the  
   transmission. It has measurement markings on it. If you pull it out,  
   you can see whether you have enough transmission fluid, or whether  
   you need more by the level of fluid on the markings. Most manual  
   transmissions do not have dipsticks, instead they use a filler hole  
   which is at the same level as the correct oil level. When the oil is  
   topped up or refilled, the mechanic simply adds oil until the filler  
   hole's level is reached.

                  4 Speed Transmission (Rear Wheel Drive)</B></FONT> </CENTER>

   <P> In this animation, the red gears and shafts represent the path of the  
   power being transferred within a four speed manual transmission. As the  
   shifter goes through the shift pattern, the shifter forks move the  
   synchronizers, which couple the shafts to the gears.  Reverse is  
   accomplished by moving the reverse gear into mesh with its idler gears.  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                             Front Wheel Drive</B></FONT> </CENTER>
   <P> This animation shows how the power is transferred from the pistons to the  
   wheels in a front wheel drive powertrain. The pistons turn the crankshaft  
   that (via the clutch) drives the transmission, which adjusts the torque  
   and speed of the rotation of the differential, which drives the two  
   driveshafts that deliver the power to each of the wheels of the car.  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                    The Differential (Rear Wheel Drive)</B></FONT> </CENTER>

  <P> This animation demonstrates how the power from the drive shaft turns the  
   ring gear, which is fastened to the spider gear carrier. As the spider  
   gears turn, they force the drive axle gears to turn as well. But if one  
   wheel wants to go faster (such as when turning), the spider gears turn on  
   their own axles, allowing each drive axle gear to turn at its own rate.

<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Electrical System</B></FONT> </CENTER>

  
  <P>  When the automotive industry was in its infancy, it used electricity  
   only to ignite the fuel inside the engine. By the late 1920's, the  
   electric starter replaced the hand crank, electric headlights made  
   acetylene lamps obsolete and the braying of the electric horn drowned  
   out the squeak of the hand-squeezed air horn. Today, an automobile  
   requires an elaborate electrical system of circuits just to produce,  
   store, and distribute all the electricity it requires simply for  
   everyday operation.   
  
   <P> The first major component in the electrical system is the battery.  
   The battery is used to store power for starting, and for running  
   auxiliary devices such as clocks, radios and alarms when the engine  
   is off. The next major component is the starter motor, which is used  
   to start the engine. The third component is a charging device powered  
   by the engine, known as the alternator.  It powers the electrical  
   system when the car is running, and restores the charge within the  
   battery. With these basic components, the car maintains its supply of  
   electricity. A device called the voltage regulator keeps the power  
   level stabilized, and the fuse box keeps minor problems from becoming  
   major ones.   
  
    <P>Many different auxiliary electrical devices are used in modern cars,  
   such as: radios, cellular phones, rear window defrosters and electric  
   door locks, as well as a vast array of motors powering everything  
   from the moonroof on down.  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Battery</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The car's initial source of electricity is a battery, whose most  
   important function is to start the engine. Once the engine is  
   running, an alternator takes over to supply the car's electrical  
   needs and to restore energy to the battery.   
  
   <P> A 12-volt storage battery consists of layers of positively and  
   negatively charged lead plates that, together with their insulated  
   separators, make up each of six two-volt cells. The cells are filled  
   with an electricity-conducting liquid (electrolyte) that is usually  
   two-thirds distilled water and one-third sulfuric acid. Spaces  
   between the immersed plates provide the most exposure to the  
   electrolyte. The interaction of the plates and the electrolyte  
   produces chemical energy that becomes electricity when a circuit is  
   formed between the negative and positive battery terminals.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Starter</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The starter converts electricity to mechanical energy in two stages.   
   Turning on the ignition switch releases a small amount of power from  
   the battery to the solenoid above the starter. This creates a  
   magnetic field that pulls the solenoid plunger forward, forcing the  
   attached shift yoke to move the starter drive so that its pinion gear  
   meshes with the engine's crankshaft flywheel. When the plunger  
   completes its travels, it strikes a contact that permits a greater  
   amount of current to flow from the battery to the starter motor. The  
   motor then spins the drive and turns the meshed gears to provide  
   power to the crankshaft, which prepares each cylinder for ignition.   
   After the engine starts, the ignition key is released to break the  
   starting circuit. The solenoid's magnetic field collapses and the  
   return spring pulls the plunger back, automatically shutting off the  
   starter motor and disengaging the starter drive.  
  
   <P> When the starter is not in use, the drive unit is retracted so that  
   its pinion is disengaged from the flywheel. As soon as the starter is  
   activated, the forward movement of the solenoid plunger causes the  
   shift yoke to move the drive in the opposite direction and engage the  
   pinion and flywheel. The pinion is locked to its shaft by a clutch  
   that unlocks if the engine starts up and the flywheel begins turning  
   the pinion faster than its normal speed. By allowing the pinion to  
   spin freely for a moment, the clutch protects the motor from damage  
   until the drive is retracted.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                         Alternator or Generator</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
    <P>The alternating-current generator, or alternator, is the electrical  
   system's chief source of power while the engine is running. Its shaft  
   is driven by the same belt that spins the fan. It converts mechanical  
   energy into alternating-current electricity, which is then channeled  
   through diodes that alter it to direct current for the electrical  
   system and for recharging the battery.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Spark Plug</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
 <P>  A spark plug is a device, inserted into the combustion chamber of an  
   engine, containing a side electrode and insulated center electrode  
   spaced to provide a gap for firing an electrical spark to ignite  
   air-fuel mixtures.  
  
   <P> The high-voltage burst from the coil via the distributor is received  
   at the spark plug's terminal and conducted down a center electrode  
   protected by a porcelain insulator. At the bottom of the plug, which  
   projects into the cylinder, the voltage must be powerful enough to  
   jump a gap between the center and side electrodes through a thick  
   atmosphere of fuel mixture. When the spark bridges the gap, it  
   ignites the fuel in the cylinder.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Spark Plug Wear</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The spark plugs ignite the fuel mixture in the cylinders by means of  
   a burst of high-voltage electricity carried from the distributor. The  
   ability of the spark to ignite the fuel is badly affected if the  
   plugs are damaged or the spark gaps are abnormal. It is therefore  
   important to examine used spark plugs closely and to clean them  
   periodically. The gaps of old and new plugs should also be checked  
   before installing them. There are three basic types of spark plug  
   fouling: "carbon" fouling, "high speed" or "lead" fouling, and  
   "oil/carbon" fouling.   
  
  <P>  Carbon fouling is caused from low-speed operation or a fuel mixture  
   that is too rich. It causes missing or roughness and creates soft  
   black soot that is easily removed. Lead fouling is caused by  
   tetraethyl lead used in some fuels and by extended high speed  
   operation. Lead compounds which are added to the gasoline have a bad  
   effect on some spark plug insulators. At high temperatures, it is a  
   good conductor and may give good results under light loads, but often  
   fails under full loads and high combustion temperatures. In some  
   cases, it is possible to run the engine at a speed just below the  
   point where missing will occur; then, increase the speed (always  
   keeping below the missing speed) to burn off the lead fouling. Lead  
   fouling appears as a heavy, crusty formation, or as tiny globules.   
  
   <P> The third type of fouling is found on engines that are so badly worn  
   that excess oil reaches the combustion chamber past the piston ring,  
   or the valve guides.   
  
   <P> In all cases of fouling or wear, it is best to replace the plugs. To  
   avoid having to replace plugs one at a time as they wear out, always  
   replace the entire set, even though only one plug may be bad. Plugs  
   should normally be replaced about every 12,000 miles.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                                   Coil</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The coil is a compact, electrical transformer that boosts the  
   battery's 12 volts to as high as 20,000 volts. The incoming 12 volts  
   of electricity pass through a primary winding of about 200 turns of  
   copper wire that raises the power to about 250 volts. Inside the  
   distributor, this low-voltage circuit is continuously broken by the  
   opening and closing of the points, each interruption causing a  
   breakdown in the coil's electromagnetic field. Each time the field  
   collapses, a surge of electricity passes to a secondary winding made  
   up of more than a mile of hair-like wire twisted into 25,000 turns.  
   At this point, the current is boosted to the high voltage needed for  
   ignition and is then relayed to the rotor.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Distributor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The distributor is separated into three sections: the upper, middle,  
   and lower. In the middle section, the corners of the spinning breaker  
   cam strike the breaker arm and separate the points some 160 miles an  
   hour. (standard ignition) High-voltage surges generated by the action  
   of the coil travel to the rotor that whirls inside a circle of  
   high-tension terminals in the distributor cap. At each terminal,  
   current is transferred to wires that lead to the spark plugs. Two  
   other devices - the vacuum advance and the centrifugal advance -  
   precisely coordinate the functions of the points and the rotor  
   assembly as the requirements of the engine vary.  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Lighting Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The automobile lighting circuit includes the wiring harness, all the  
   lights, and the various switches that control their use. The complete  
   circuit of the modern passenger car can be broken down into  
   individual circuits, each having one or more lights and switches. In  
   each separate circuit, the lights are connected in parallel, and the  
   controlling switch is in series between the group of lights and the  
   fuse box. The parking lights, are connected in parallel and  
   controlled by a single switch. In some installations, one switch  
   controls the connection to the fuse box, while a selector switch  
   determines which of two circuits is energized. The headlights, with  
   their upper and lower beams, are an example of this type of switch.   
   Again, in some cases, such as the courtesy lights, several switches  
   may be connected in parallel so that any switch may be used to turn  
   on the lights.  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Main Lighting Switch</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The main lighting switch (sometimes called the headlight switch) is  
   the heart of the lighting system. It controls the headlights, parking  
   lights, side marker lights, taillights, license plate light,  
   instrument panel lights, and interior lights. Individual switches are  
   provided for special purpose lights such as directional signals,  
   hazard warning flashers, back up lights, and courtesy lights. The  
   main lighting switch may be of either the "push-pull" or "push-pull  
   with rotary contact" types. A typical switch will have three  
   positions: off, parking, and headlamps. Some switches also contain a  
   rheostat to control the brightness of the instrument panel lights.   
   The rheostat is operated by rotating the control knob, separating it  
   from the push-pull action of the main lighting switch.  
  
  <P> When the main lighting switch completes the circuit to the headlamps,  
   the low beam lights the way for city driving and for use when meeting  
   oncoming traffic on the highway. When the dimmer switch is actuated,  
   the single filament headlamps go "on," along with the high beam of  
   the two filament headlamps. The next actuation of the dimmer switch  
   returns the headlighting system to low beams only on the two filament  
   lamps. Some cars are equipped with an electronic headlight dimming  
   device, which automatically switches the headlights from high beam to  
   low in response to light from an approaching vehicle or light from  
   the taillight of a vehicle being overtaken. The dimmer switch in the  
   automatic headlamp dimming system is a special override type. It is  
   located in the steering column as part of a combination dimmer, horn,  
   and turn signal switch. The override action occurs when a slight pull  
   toward the driver on the switch lever provides high beam headlights  
   regardless of the amount of light on the sensor-amplifier.  
  
   <P> For some years there has been discussion about the advantages of a  
   polarized headlight system. Such a system comprises headlights which  
   produce polarized light in a particular plane. The windscreens of all  
   cars would be fitted with polarizing glass, which would be oriented  
   so that glare from an approaching vehicle would be essentially  
   eliminated, while the forward vision would still be kept at the  
   present levels. The advantages the system appear attractive, but the  
   practical problems of making the transition are very great, since it  
   would not be practical to convert all existing vehicles to this type  
   of lighting. Also, any benefits would only be marginal because glare  
   itself is not a frequent cause of accidents. However, many cars now  
   have refracting or colored glass to cut down on glare.  
  
   <P> Due to recent legislation, newer cars in Texas with the dimmer switch  
   mounted on the steering column will have to be refurbished with  
   standard floor-mounted dimmers. Too many Aggies are being found in  
   the ditch with their legs caught in the steering wheel.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Directional Signal Switch</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P>
   The directional signal switch is installed just below the hub of the  
   steering wheel. A manually controlled lever projecting from the  
   switch permits the driver to signal the direction in which he wants  
   to turn. Moving the switch handle down will light the "turn signal"  
   lamps on the left front and left rear of the car, signaling a left  
   turn. Moving the switch upward will light the turn signal lamps on  
   the right (front and rear), signaling a right turn. With the switch  
   in a position to signal a turn, lights are alternately turned "on"  
   and "off" by a turn signal flasher. Incorporated in the directional  
   signal switch is a "lane change switch mechanism." This feature  
   provides the driver the opportunity to signal a lane change by  
   holding the turn lever against a detent, then releasing it to cancel  
   the signal immediately after the maneuver is completed.   
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Stoplight Switch</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> In order to signal a stop, a brake pedal operated "stoplight switch"  
   is provided to operate the vehicle's stop lamps. In addition to  
   lighting the conventional rear lights, the switch also operates the  
   center high-mounted stop lamp, that became mandatory on later models.  
   Cruise control equipped vehicles may also utilize a vacuum release  
   valve. In this case, both the vacuum release valve and the stoplight  
   switch are actuated by movement of the brake pedal.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                 Horn</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P>The car horn on passenger cars provides the driver with a means of  
   sounding an audible warning signal. The horn electrical circuit  
   generally includes: battery, fuse or fusible link, horn relay,  
   horn(s), steering column wiring harness, horn switch, and body sheet  
   metal. Often, a cadmium plated screw is used to ground the horn to  
   the body of the vehicle. Horns usually are located in the forward  
   part of the engine compartment or in the front fender well. The horn  
   switch is built into the steering wheel or incorporated into the  
   multi-functional switch lever, which includes turn signal and

   <P>
   The ancient Greeks had a word for it. Records show that as early as  
   600 BC the attractive properties of amber were known. Thales of  
   Miletus (640-546 BC), one of the "seven wise men" of ancient  
   Greece, is credited with having observed the attraction of amber for  
   small fibrous materials and bits of straw. Amber was used by these  
   people, even as it is now, for ornamental purposes. Just as the  
   precious metals had their names of gold and silver, so amber had its  
   name: "electron." It was later shown that the same effect can be  
   obtained by rubbing a rod of glass or hard rubber with a  
   handkerchief. Many other nonmetallic materials are found to have this  
   property, which is known as "static electricity."  
  
   <P> All electrified materials behave either as glass or rubber. Glass has  
   a "positive" charge and hard rubber has a "negative" charge. If you  
   electrify two strips of hard rubber by rubbing them with fur, they  
   will repel each other. Two glass rods will behave the same way.  But,  
   if you electrify a rod of rubber and suspend it near an electrified  
   rod of glass, they will attract each other. One of the most important  
   laws of electricity is "Bodies with similar charges repel each other;  
   bodies with opposite charges attract each other." A positive charge  
   is designated with a (+); a negative charge by the sign (-).   
  
   <P> Although people have controlled electricity for many years, no one  
   can explain exactly what it is. Many different theories have been  
   given as to the nature of electricity through the years, but the  
   modern one is the "Electron theory." In short, the electron theory  
   proposes that all matter consists of tiny particles called molecules.  
   These molecules are made up of two or more smaller particles called  
   atoms. The atoms are then divided into smaller particles called  
   protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles are all the same in  
   matter, whether in gas, liquid, or solid. The different properties or  
   characteristics of the matter take form according to the arrangement  
   and numbers of these particles which make up the atom. The proton has  
   a natural positive charge of electricity; the electron has a negative  
   charge; and the neutron has no charge at all, but just adds weight to  
   the matter.  
  
   <P> Protons and neutrons form the central core of the atoms about which  
   the electrons rotate. The electrons carry small negative charges of  
   electricity, which neutralize the positive charges of the protons.   
   The simplest atom of all is the hydrogen atom. It consists of one  
   positive proton and one negative electron. Other atoms, such as those  
   forming copper, iron, or silicon, are much more complicated. Copper,  
   for example, has 29 electrons circling about its nucleus in four  
   different orbits. While protons are much smaller than electrons in  
   size, they contain the bulk of the mass of every atom. One proton,  
   for example, weighs nearly two thousand times as much as an electron.  
   The electrons therefore are light particles or objects around a small  
   but relatively heavy nucleus.  
   <P>
   It is difficult to conceive the size of the atom. Research by  
   physicists has established that the mass on one electron is about  
   .000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,911 of a gram. If you assume  
   that one proton in a hydrogen atom is the size of a baseball in  
   Kansas City, then the electron would have an orbit which would reach  
   from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific. Along with the extremely  
   small size of electrons and protons, they are separated by relatively  
   vast distances.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Conductors and Insulators</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Not all substances are good conductors of electricity. As a general  
   rule, metals are good conductors whereas nonmetals are poor  
   conductors. The poorest of conductors are commonly called  
   "insulators," or "nonconductors." Aluminum, copper, gold, iron,  
   mercury, nickel, platinum, and silver are examples of good  
   conductors. Amber, glass, mica, paper, porcelain, rubber, silk, and  
   sulfur are all nonconductors. The difference between a conductor and  
   an insulator is that in a conductor, there are free electrons,  
   whereas in an insulator, all of the electrons are tightly bound to  
   their respective atoms. In an uncharged body, there are an equal  
   number of positive and negative charges. In metals, a few of the  
   electrons are free to move from atom to atom, so that when a  
   negatively charged rod is brought to the end of the conductor, it  
   repels nearby free electrons in the conductor, causing them to move.   
   They in turn repel free electrons in front of them, giving rise to a  
   flow of electrons all along the conductor. There are a large number  
   of substances that are neither good conductors of electricity nor  
   good insulators. These substances are called "semi-conductors." In  
   them, electrons are capable of being moved only with some difficulty,  
   i.e., with considerable force.

                Electricity In Motion (Electrical Current)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  When an electric charge is at rest it is spoken of as "static  
   electricity," but when it is in motion, it is referred to as an  
   "electric current." In most cases, an electric current is described  
   as a flow of electric charge along a conductor. To make an electron  
   current flow continuously along a wire, a continuous supply of  
   electrons must be available at one end and a continuous supply of  
   positive charges at the other. This is like the flow of water through  
   a pipe: to obtain a continuous flow, a continuous supply of water  
   must be provided at one end and an opening for its escape into some  
   receptacle at the other. The continuous supply of positive charge at  
   the one end of a wire offers a means of escape for the electrons. If  
   this is not provided, electrons will accumulate at the end of the  
   wire and the repulsion back along the wire will stop the current  
   flow.  
  
   <P> The rate at which the free electrons drift from atom to atom  
   determines the amount of electrical current. In order to create a  
   drift of electrons through a circuit, it is necessary to have an  
   electrical pressure, or "voltage." Electric current, then, is the  
   flow of electrons. The more electrons in motion, the stronger the  
   current. In terms of automotive applications, the greater the  
   concentration of electrons at a battery or generator terminal, the  
   higher the pressure between the electrons. The greater this pressure  
   (voltage) is, the greater the flow of electrons.  
  
  <P>  In modern electric car designs, the drive motors are often used as  
   the brakes also, allowing them to switch over into performing as  
   generators, which charge the batteries with the energy generated.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Electromagnetic Principles</B></FONT> </CENTER></B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The connection between electricity and magnetism was made by Oersted,  
   a Danish scientist, in 1820. He had frequently demonstrated the  
   nonexistence of a connection between electricity and magnetism. His  
   usual procedure was to place a current-carrying wire at right angles  
   to, and directly over, a compass needle to show that there was no  
   effect of one on the other. One occasion, at the end of his lecture,  
   he placed the wire parallel to the compass needle and saw the needle  
   move to one side. When he reversed the current in the wire, the  
   needle, to his amazement, deviated in the opposite direction. Thus a  
   great discovery concerning electromagnetism was made quite by  
   accident.  
  
  <P> There is no actual knowledge as to why some materials have magnetic  
   properties and others have not. The "electron theory" generally is  
   accepted as the best explanation of magnetism. It is also known as  
   the "domain theory."   
  
   <P> According to the theory, an electron moving in a fixed circular orbit  
   around the proton creates a magnetic field with the north pole on one  
   side of the orbit and a south pole on the other side. It is assumed  
   that the orbiting electron carries a negative charge of electricity,  
   which is the same as electrical current flowing through a conductor.   
   Current flow, then, is from negative to positive. When a number of  
   magnetized orbiting electrons exist in a material, they interact with  
   each other and form "domains," or groups of atoms having the same  
   magnetic polarity. However, these domains are scattered in random  
   patterns throughout and the material is, in effect, demagnetized.   
   Under the influence of a strong external magnetic field, domains  
   become aligned and the total material is magnetized. The strength of  
   its magnetic field depends on the number of domains that are aligned.  
   In magnetic substances, the domains align themselves in parallel  
   planes and in the same direction when placed in a magnetic field.  
   This arrangement of the electron-created magnets produces a strong  
   magnetic effect.   
  
   <P> If you stroke a piece of hardened steel with a magnet, the piece of  
   steel itself will become a magnet. (Steel railroad tracks laid in a  
   north-to-south direction become magnetized because they lie parallel  
   to the magnetic lines of the earth.) Much stronger magnets and  
   magnetic fields can be produced by electrical means. Placing a piece  
   of steel in any strong magnetic field will cause it to become  
   magnetized.  
  
   <P> A magnetized field surrounds any conductor carrying an electrical  
   current. The discovery of that fact resulted in the development of  
   much of our electrical equipment. The "field of force" is always at  
   right angles to the conductor. Since the magnetic force is the only  
   force known to attract a compass needle, it is obvious that a flow of  
   electric current produces a magnetic field similar to that produced  
   by a permanent magnet. Not only is the field of force at right angles  
   to the conductor, but the field also forms concentric circles about  
   the conductor. When the current in the conductor increases, the field  
   of force is increased. Doubling the current will double the strength  
   of the field of force.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                 The Left-Hand Rule (Magnetic Effect)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Oersted's experiment has been interpreted to mean that "around every  
   wire carrying an electric current there is a magnetic field." The  
   direction of this field at every point, like that around a bar  
   magnet, can be mapped by means of a small compass or by iron filings.  
   If a wire is mounted vertically through a hole in a plate of glass or  
   other suitable nonconductor, and then iron filings are sprinkled on  
   the plate, there will be a lining-up of the filings parallel to the  
   magnetic field. The result shows that the magnetic lines of force or  
   "lines of induction" are concentric circles whose planes are at right  
   angles to the current.   
  
  <P>  The "left-hand rule" used in electromagnetism can always be relied  
   upon to give the direction of the magnetic field due to an electron  
   current in a wire. Derived from experiment, the rule states: "if the  
   current-carrying wire were to be grasped in the left hand, the thumb  
   pointing in the direction of the electron current, negative (-) to  
   positive (+), the fingers will point in the direction of the magnetic  
   induction."  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                  Magnetic Properties of A Solenoid</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  
  <P>  Shortly after Oersted discovered the magnetic effect of a  
   current-carrying wire, Ampere found that a loop or coil of wire (a  
   single loop or a coil of several turns of wire) acted as a magnet. A  
   coil of wire of this kind is sometimes referred as a "solenoid," or  
   as a "helix." The magnetic lines of force in a solenoid are such that  
   one side or end of the coil acts like a "N" magnetic pole and the  
   other side or end like a "S" magnetic pole. At all points in the  
   region around a coil of wire carrying a current, the direction of the  
   magnetic field, as shown by a compass, can be predicted by the  
   left-hand rule. Inside each loop or turn of wire, the lines point in  
   one direction, whereas outside they point oppositely. Outside the  
   coil, the lines go the same way they do about a permanent bar magnet,  
   whereas inside the coil they go from "S" to "N". Not only does one  
   coil of wire act like a magnet, but two coils will demonstrate the  
   repulsion and attraction of like and unlike poles.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Electronics (Solid State)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Electronics refers to any electrical component, assembly, circuit, or  
   system that uses solid state devices. "Solid state" means that these  
   devices have no moving parts, other than electrons. Examples of solid  
   state devices include semiconductor diodes, transistors, and silicon  
   controlled rectifiers. These and many more have broad application in  
   automotive electronics.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Semiconductors and Diodes</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P> 
   Semiconductors are made from material somewhere between the ranges of  
   conductors and nonconductors. Semiconductors, basically, are designed  
   to do one of three things: (1) stop the flow of electrons, (2) start  
   the flow of electrons, or (3) control the amount of electron flow. A  
   semiconductor diode is a two-element solid state electronic device.   
   It contains what is termed a "P" type material connected to a piece  
   of "N" material. The union of the "P" and "N" materials forms a PN  
   junction with two connections. The "anode" is connected to the P  
   material; the "cathode" is connected to the N material. A diode is,  
   in effect, a one-way valve. It will conduct current in one direction  
   and remain non conductive in the reverse direction. When current  
   flows through the diode, it is said to be "forward biased." When  
   current flow is blocked by the diode, it is "reverse biased." When a  
   diode is reverse biased, there is an extremely small current flow;  
   actually, the current flow is said to be "negligible." When the P and  
   N are fused together to form a diode, it can be placed in a circuit.  
   The P material is connected to the positive side of the battery and  
   the N material is connected to the negative side of the battery.  
   Connected in this manner, current will flow. If connected in the  
   reverse manner, current will not flow.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Transistors and Resistors</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> A transistor is a solid state device used to switch and/or amplify  
   the flow of electrons in a circuit. A typical automotive switching  
   application would be a transistorized ignition system in which the  
   transistor switches the primary system off and on. An amplifying  
   application could be in a stereo system where a radio signal needed  
   strengthening.  
  
  <P>  A transistor is a three-element device made of two semiconductor  
   materials. The three elements are called "emitter," "base," and  
   "collector." The outer two elements (collector and emitter) are made  
   of the same material; the other element (base) is different. Each has  
   a conductor attached. The materials used are labeled for their  
   properties: "P" for positive, meaning a lack of electrons. It has  
   "holes" ready to receive electrons. "N" is for negative, which means  
   the materials has a surplus of electrons. The movement of a free  
   electron from atom to atom leaves a hole in the atom it left. This  
   hole is quickly filled by another free electron. As this movement is  
   transmitted throughout the conductor, an electric current is created  
   from the negative to the positive. At the same time, the "hole" has  
   been moved backward in the conductor as one free electron after  
   another takes its place in a sort of chain reaction. "Hole flow" is  
   from positive to negative. Current flow in a transistor, then, may be  
   either electron movement or hole flow, depending on the type of  
   material, and this determines the type of transistor it is as well.  
  
  <P>  In most 12 volt systems, a resistor is connected in series with the  
   primary circuit of the ignition coil. During the cranking period, the  
   resistor is cut out of the circuit so that full voltage is applied to  
   the coil. This insures a strong spark during cranking, and quicker  
   starting is provided. The starting circuit is designed so that as  
   long as the starter motor is in use, full battery voltage is applied  
   to the coil. When the starter is not cranking, the resistance wire is  
   cut into the circuit to reduce the voltage applied to the coil. If  
   the engine starts when the ignition switch is turned on, but stops  
   when the switch is released to the run position, it can indicate that  
   a resistor is bad and should be replaced.   
  
   <P> At no time should the resistor be bypassed out of the circuit, as  
   that would supply constant battery voltage and burn out the coil.  
   The resistor and resistor wires should always be checked when the  
   breaker points are burned, or when the ignition coil is bad.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Ignition Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  An ignition circuit consists of two sub-circuits: the primary, which  
   carries low voltage; and the secondary, which carries high voltage.   
   The primary circuit, controlled by the ignition key, releases 12  
   volts of electricity from the battery or alternator through the coil  
   to a set of breaker points in the lower part of the distributor, or  
   to the relay in electronic ignition applications. When the points or  
   relay are closed, current flows through the chassis back to the  
   battery, completing the circuit. When the points or relay are open,  
   the flow stops, causing a high-voltage surge to pass from the coil  
   through a rotor in the top of the distributor to the spark plugs.  
   Once the car has started, the voltage regulator protects the battery  
   from being overcharged by the alternator. The condenser absorbs part  
   of the low-voltage current when the points are open.  
                    
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                 Computerized and Electronic Ignition</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  In an electronic ignition, a rotating reluctor and magnetic-pickup  
   coil replace the traditional cam, breaker points and condenser in the  
   distributors of cars equipped for electronic ignition. This system  
   reduces the time between tune-ups. The high spots of the reluctor  
   interrupt the magnetic field of the pickup coil and the permanent  
   magnet. These interruptions, or pulses, are transmitted from the  
   pickup to a nearby electronic control unit. There, the pulses signal  
   a transistor to break the low-voltage sub-circuit and release high  
   voltage from the coil to the spark plugs.  
  
  <P>  The short-lived electronic ignition system was a transition from the  
   points and condenser system to the computerized ignition system. It  
   came into widespread use in the mid-1970s, but there are still a few  
   engines that use electronic ignition.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Starting Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P> 
   The starter circuit is activated when the ignition switch is turned  
   on. This opens a second switch in the solenoid, permitting a second  
   flow of electricity from the battery to the starter motor.  
   <P>
   The engine cranking circuit is made up of a battery, starting motor,  
   ignition switch, and electrical wiring. When the ignition switch is  
   placed in the "start" position, the solenoid windings are energized  
   and the resulting shift lever movement causes the drive pinion gear  
   to engage the flywheel ring gear, and cranking takes place. When the  
   engine starts, an overrunning clutch (part of the drive assembly)  
   protects the armature from too much speed until the switch is opened.  
   At this time, a return spring causes the pinion gear to disengage  
   from the flywheel.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Spark Plug Wires</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The spark plug wire carries 20,000 or more volts from the distributor  
   cap to the spark plug. Spark plug wires are made of various layers of  
   materials. The fiber core, inside the spark plug wire carries the  
   high voltage. The older design of spark plug wires used a metallic  
   wire to carry the high voltage. This caused electrical interference  
   with the radio and TV reception. Some spark plug wires have a locking  
   connection at the distributor cap. The distributor cap must first be  
   removed and the terminals be squeezed together, and then the spark  
   plug wire can be removed from the distributor cap.  
  <P> 
   To reduce interference with radio and TV reception, ignition systems  
   are provided with resistance in the secondary circuit. Resistor spark  
   plugs or special resistor type ignition cable may be used.   
  
  <P>  To work effectively in modern ignition systems, it is important that  
   the resistor ignition cable is capable of producing a specifically  
   designed resistance. The cable must also have enough insulation so  
   that it can withstand heat, cold, moisture, oil, grease, and chafing.  
   High tension electricity passing through a cable builds up a  
   surrounding electrical field. The electrical field frees oxygen in  
   the surrounding air to form ozone, which will attach to the rubber  
   insulation if it is not properly protected. Ozone causes the rubber  
   to deteriorate and lose its insulating qualities. Electrical losses  
   will seriously weaken the spark at the plug gap.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Distributor Cap</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  As the rotor rotates inside the cap, it receives the high voltage  
   from the ignition coil, then passes it to the nearest connection,  
   which is a metal projection in the cap, which is connected to a spark  
   plug.   
  <P> 
   The distributor cap should be checked to see that the sparks have not  
   been arcing from point to point within the cap. The inside of the cap  
   must be clean. The firing points should not be eroded, and the inside  
   of the towers must be clean and free from corrosion.   
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Distributor Rotor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
    <P>A distributor rotor is designed to rotate and distribute the high  
   tension current to the towers of the distributor cap. The firing end  
   of the rotor, from which the high tension spark jumps to each of the  
   cap terminals, should not be worn. Any wear will result in resistance  
   to the high tension spark. The rotor with a worn firing end will have  
   to be replaced.  
  
   <P> Rotors are mounted on the upper end of the distributor shaft. In this  
   connection, the rotor must have a snug fit on the end of the shaft.   
   On another design, two screws are used to attach the rotor to a plate  
   on the top of the distributor shaft. Built-in locators on the rotor,  
   and holes in the plate, insure correct reassembly. One locator is  
   round; the other is square.  
   <P>
   The rotor is driven directly by the camshaft, but is "advanced"  
   (turned) by the centrifugal advance mechanism. Advancing the spark  
   timing allows the engine to run efficiently. A vacuum advance is also  
   fitted on some cars for the same reason.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Condenser</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Primary current produces a magnetic field around the coil windings.   
   This does not occur instantly, because it takes time for the current  
   and the magnetic field to reach maximum value. The time element is  
   determined by the resistance of the coil winding or the length of  
   time the distributor contacts are closed. The current does not reach  
   the maximum because the contacts remain closed for such a short time,  
   and more so at higher engine speeds. When the breaker points begin to  
   open, the primary current will continue to flow. This condition in a  
   winding is increased by means of the iron core. Without an ignition  
   condenser, the induced voltage causing this flow of current would  
   create an arc across the contact points and the magnetic energy would  
   be consumed in this arc. As a result, the contact points would be  
   burned and ignition would not occur. The "condenser" prevents the arc  
   by making a place for the current to flow. As a result of condenser  
   action, the magnetic field produced and continued by the current flow  
   will quickly collapse. It is the rapid cutting out of magnetic field  
   that induces high voltage in the secondary windings. So, if the  
   condenser should go bad, the high voltage needed to jump the gap at  
   the spark plugs will not be possible. This could cause a no-start  
   condition or a driving problem.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                  Breaker Point (Standard) Ignition</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
    <P>The ignition distributor makes and breaks the primary ignition  
   circuit. It also distributes high tension current to the proper spark  
   plug at the correct time. The distributor is driven at one half  
   crankshaft speed on four cycle engines. It is driven by the camshaft.  
  <P>  Distributor construction varies with the manufacturers, but the  
   standard model is made of a housing into which the distributor shaft  
   and centrifugal weight assembly are fitted with bearings. In most  
   cases, these bearings are bronze bushings.   
  
  <P>  In standard ignition, the contact set is attached to the movable  
   breaker plate. A vacuum advance unit attached to the distributor  
   housing is mounted under the breaker plate. The rotor covers the  
   centrifugal advance mechanism, which consists of a cam actuated by  
   two centrifugal weights. As the breaker cam rotates, each lobe passes  
   under the rubbing block, causing the breaker points to open. Since  
   the points are in series with the primary winding of the ignition  
   coil, current will pass through that circuit when the points close.  
   When the points open, the magnetic field in the coil collapses and a  
   high tension voltage is induced in the secondary windings of the coil  
   by the movement of the magnetic field through the secondary windings.  
  
   <P> The design is to provide one lobe on the breaker cam for each  
   cylinder of the engine; i.e., a six cylinder engine will have a six  
   lobe cam in the distributor; and an eight cylinder engine will have  
   an eight lobe cam, so every revolution of the breaker came will  
   produce one spark for each cylinder of the engine. However, on a four  
   cycle engine, each cylinder fires every other revolution so the  
   distributor shaft must revolve at one half crankshaft speed. After  
   the high tension surge is produced in the ignition coil by the  
   opening of the breaker points, the current passes from the coil to  
   the center terminal of the distributor cap. From there, it passes  
   down to the rotor mounted on the distributor shaft and revolves with  
   it. The current passes along the rotor, and jumps the tiny gap to the  
   cap electrode under which the rotor is positioned at that instant.     
   This cap electrode is connected by high tension wiring to the spark  
   plug. As the rotor continues to rotate, it distributes current to  
   each of the cap terminals in turn.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                     Battery Vents and Vent Plugs</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Vent plugs of various designs are used. Generally, the vent plugs are  
   baffled so gas can escape, but electrolyte splashed into the vent  
   will drain into the cell. The plugs may be screw type or push-in  
   type. The push-in type may be a single plug or a gang vent plug  
   (three-plug manifold). Most maintenance-free batteries do not vent  
   plugs. Instead, the gas is vented through baffled passages and small  
   vent holes in the cover. Most conventional batteries have flame  
   arrestor vent plugs. In maintenance-free batteries, the flame  
   arrestors are located at the exits of the baffled passages.  
  
  <P>  Only distilled water should be added to the battery.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Battery Charging Methods</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Battery charging methods vary, based on several considerations: (1)  
   electrical capacity of the battery being serviced; (2) temperature of  
   electrolyte; (3) battery state of charge at start of charging period;  
   and (4) the age and condition of the battery.   
  
  <P>  When preparing to charge a battery, be aware of all the precautions  
   that should be observed during the charging operation. Be familiar  
   with the manufacturer's battery charger guide, and follow all the  
   step-by-step instructions in the sequence given by the manufacturer.   
   Ideally, use an automatic battery charger that senses battery voltage  
   and automatically shuts off - or almost shuts off - when the battery  
   reaches or approaches the fully charged state. These chargers include  
   temperature sensing and generally sense polarity to help avoid sparks  
   if the charger clamps are connected in reverse.  
  
  <P>  Battery charging methods include "high rate fast charging", "constant  
   potential charging", "constant current slow charging", and "trickle  
   charging."  
  
  <P>  "High rate fast charging" provides a high charging rate for a short  
   time. Usually, the intent of a fast charge is to give the battery the  
   "boost" it needs until the vehicle charging system can bring it to a  
   full state of charge.  
  
  <P>  The fast charging rate should be limited to 60 amperes for 12 volt  
   batteries. Usually, the rate is set at 40 to 60 amperes for 30  
   minutes. To completely recharge a battery, the high rate fast charger  
   should be adjusted to "slow charge," preferably at the rate of one  
   ampere per positive plate per cell. For a battery with nine plates  
   per cell, 4 (+) and 5 (-), the charging rate would be four amperes.  
   <P>
   "Constant Potential Charging," as the name implies, maintains the  
   same voltage on the battery throughout the period of the charge. As a  
   result, the current is automatically reduced as the battery  
   approaches full charge. This features cuts the amount of overcharge  
   the battery can receive, so batteries in good condition will not be  
   damaged by this method of charging. If the battery is badly sulfated,  
   the temperature may rise soon after it is placed on charge. These  
   batteries should be placed on "slow charge."  
  
  <P>  "Constant current charging" uses a low charging rate for a relatively  
   long time. Charging rates of three to five amperes or one percent of  
   cold cranking rating are typical, as is one ampere per positive plate  
   per cell. Constant current slow charging periods as long as 24 hours  
   may be needed to bring the battery to full charge.  
  
  <P>  "Trickle charging" is designed to charge batteries at a rate of  
   approximately one ampere. Trickle charges are used primarily for  
   maintaining displays and stocks of batteries in fully charged  
   condition. Common practice is to leave the batteries on a trickle  
   charge during the day and take them off charge during the night. In  
   that way, the danger of severe overcharging is lessened.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Jump Starting An Engine</B></FONT> </CENTER>
 <P>  
   Jump starting an engine is a very common procedure, which for most  
   cars is safe, but some cars cannot handle the power surges involved.  
   If in doubt, check your owner's manual. Jumper cables are used to  
   transfer power from a good (booster) battery to a discharged battery.  
   The key to safe and effective jump starting is the correct hookup of  
   the jumper cables. The operation is common enough - and relatively  
   safe, provided proper precautions are taken.  
  
  <P> <P>  First, turn off your ignition to avoid draining any power that may be  
   left in the battery. Park a vehicle that has a fully charged battery  
   of the same voltage near the disabled car so that the two cars do not  
   touch. The jumper cables to be used should not have to reach across  
   either engine, where they might drop accidentally into the fans.   
   Using old gloves or a rag, remove the cell caps from both batteries.   
   Cover the holes with clean rags to contain any splashing acid.  
   Another reason for doing this is that a chemical reactions inside a  
   battery may produce hydrogen gas. Removing the caps allows the gas to  
   escape. CAUTION: In extremely cold weather, look into the cells to be  
   sure the battery fluid is not frozen. If it is, pockets of hydrogen  
   gas may have formed and the gas could explode when the jumper cable  
   is attached. Thaw out the battery before using the jumper.  
  
   <P> Attach the ends of one jumper cable to the positive posts of both  
   batteries. Next, attach one end of the second cable to the post of  
   the charged battery. Ground the other end by clipping it to a clean,  
   unpainted part of the disabled car's engine, car frame, or other  
   clean metallic part. Be sure all four cable clips are so positioned  
   that they cannot accidentally contact each other or drop onto moving  
   parts once the engine turns over and begins to run.   
  
 <P>   CAUTION: Be sure to attach the second cable as directed, not to the  
   ground post of the discharged battery. This is because a few sparks  
   occur when this final connection is broken after the car starts. If  
   the connection is made on the battery itself, the sparks could ignite  
   any hydrogen gas that has accumulated.  
  
  <P>  Allow the discharged battery to charge up for a few minutes. It can  
   be determined if current is flowing by removing the ground cable  
   temporarily, sparks indicate current. SPARKS CAN IGNITE BATTERY  
   FUMES. DO NOT MAKE SPARKS NEAR THE BATTERY.  
  
  <P>  With the assisting vehicle's engine running, and all the accessories  
   in both cars turned off, start the disabled car's engine.   
  
  <P>  Remove the negative (ground) cable from the problem car's engine and  
   then from the post on the booster battery. Disconnect the first cable  
   from the positive posts of the two batteries. Remove the rags from  
   the vent caps on both batteries and dispose of them. Replace the vent  
   caps.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Voltage Regulator</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The alternator produces the electricity needed to charge the battery  
   and to operate electrical equipment. Its output, however, continues  
   to rise as its speed increases, so the charging system must be  
   provided with a voltage regulator.  
  
  <P>  Voltage regulators are in their third phase of development. First,  
   there were electromagnetic voltage regulators, which were used in  
   both dc and alternator charging systems. Then came electronic voltage  
   regulators, which are still used in most late model applications.   
   They are solid state devices, which did away with wire-wound coils,  
   contact points, and bimetallic hinges. They appear to be more  
   reliable, durable, and less affected by temperature change. Now, in  
   some cars, the voltage regulator function has become part of the  
   engine computer control system.   
  
 <P>   Regardless of the kind, the voltage regulator controls voltage and  
   current output of the alternator by automatically cutting resistance  
   in or out of the field circuit to keep it in a safe value. Varying  
   the resistance alters the amount of current passing through the  
   field. When the battery becomes fully charged, the resistance is cut  
   into the field circuit and the charging rate is decreased.  
   <P>
   Electromagnetic regulators, which are used on many dc generator  
   charging systems, consist of three elements: cutout relay, current  
   regulator, and voltage regulator. Others may use a cutout relay and a  
   step-voltage control unit or a cutout relay with a vibrating voltage  
   regulator or a combination of the cutout relay with a current-voltage  
   unit.   
  
  <P>  In electromagnetic regulators, the voltage regulator unit limits  
   voltage output by controlling the amount of current applied to the  
   rotating field. The field relay on these regulators connects the  
   alternator field windings and voltage regulator windings directly to  
   the battery. The conventional cutout relay unit has been eliminated  
   by the diodes in the alternator. The current regulator has also been  
   eliminated by the current-limiting characteristic of the alternator  
   design.   
  
  <P>  Basically, in a transistorized or an electronic regulator, the  
   transistor is switched on and off to control the alternator field  
   current. The frequency of switching depends on the alternator speed  
   and accessory load, with the possibility that the on-off cycle may be  
   repeated as often as 7000 times per second. The transistorized units  
   have a voltage limiter adjustment. The electronic units are factory  
   calibrated and sealed. They are also nonadjustable. When the ignition  
   switch is turned off, the solid state relay circuit turns off the  
   output stage, and turns off all current flow through the regulator.  
   With that, there is no current drain on the battery. The field  
   current overprotection stage protects the regulator against damage  
   that could be caused by a "short" in the field circuit.  
     
  <P>  Voltage regulator units have been replaced by functions with two  
   engine computer modules on some late model Chrysler Corporation  
   applications. The regulator functions are shared by circuits in the  
   power and logic modules in the engine spark control computer. It is  
   claimed that this prevents the possibility of "blowing" computer  
   circuits if a charging system terminal is accidentally grounded. In  
   operation, the field is turned on by a driver in the power module.   
   The logic module also checks battery temperature as a means of  
   determining and controlling alternator output voltage to control the  
   amount of current allowed to pass through the alternator field  
   windings.

                          The Move to Computers</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Ever since the car was first invented, a breaker point ignition has  
   been used to transform battery voltage into 20,000 volts to fire the  
   spark plugs. With government intervention and regulation, a system  
   more advanced than breaker points was needed. This system had to meet  
   emission control levels, gas mileage, and provide a smooth and  
   continuous operation. The answer was found in an on-board computer  
   system. The computer found on modern cars has two components. One is  
   the hardware and the other is the software.  
  
  <P>  The computer hardware on an automobile uses a Central Processing Unit  
   (CPU), which, when made in an integrated circuit, is referred to as a  
   microprocessor. The integrated circuit (IC) combines transistors,  
   diodes, and capacitors, which are placed on a tiny chip of  
   semiconductor material that is smaller and thinner than an eraser on  
   a pencil. The material used most of the time is silicon. Silicon,  
   like any semiconductor, does not conduct electricity until either  
   voltage, a magnetic field, heat, or light is directed to the  
   semiconductor. A program instructs the microprocessor on what to do.  
  
  <P>  The computer software on a car carries a program. The program tells  
   the computer what to do, and when to do it in a specific sequence.   
   The program is stored in a permanent memory, which is referred to as  
   Read Only Memory (ROM). The computer knows only what is placed in its  
   memory. General Motors has another variation, which is called the  
   Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM), which can be readily removed  
   and replaced, while the ROM cannot. This makes it less expensive if  
   the memory should become defective. Only the PROM has to be  
   replaced, not the entire microprocessor.   
  <P> 
   The microprocessor contains a ROM (or PROM) and a RAM. RAM stands for  
   Random Access Memory, which can be accessed without going through a  
   specific sequence. The technician interfaces with the RAM whenever  
   trouble codes are accessed. Not all computerized ignition systems  
   have trouble codes, however.   
  
  <P>  Some computers have the ability to learn. This is referred to as an  
   adaptive memory. When a value falls outside of a specified limit, due  
   to engine wear, the adaptive memory makes a slight adjustment in the  
   program to compensate. The car must be driven from 20 to 30 miles, as  
   it takes the computer this long to learn. Any time that power is  
   disconnected to the computer, it will have to relearn everything.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                        Fuses and Circuit Breakers</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  A fuse block is usually connected between the battery and the main  
   lighting switch. It is generally mounted on the driver's side of the  
   firewall. When a short circuit or overload occurs in a circuit, the  
   fuse burns out and opens that circuit so no further damage will  
   result. Too much current will open a circuit breaker's terminals,  
   indicating there is something wrong in that circuit. The circuit  
   breaker then remains open until the trouble is corrected.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Headlamp Delay Switches</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
 <P>   Headlamp delay systems automatically control headlamp "on-off"  
   operation after the ignition switch and main lighting switch have  
   been turned off. The system, controlled by the driver, provides a  
   light-on situation on a time-delay basis, so that the occupants will  
   have the convenience of headlights after leaving the vehicle. The  
   system automatically delays switching off the headlights for a period  
   of time preselected by the driver. The system can also be switched to  
   a light sensitive, automatic on-off control of the headlamps and  
   other exterior lamps. A light sensitive photocell is mounted in an  
   area exposed to outside light. With the main lighting switch off and  
   the automatic control on, the system will turn on the headlamps when  
   natural outside light diminishes.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Fog Lights</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P>  Fog lights are gaining popularity again, both in original equipment  
   and later installation. Standard equipment lamps generally are built  
   into the front bumper or suspended below the bumper. Aftermarket fog  
   lights are available in kits that include the lamps, halogen bulbs,  
   impact resistant plastic covers, and a prewired harness with in-line  
   fuse holder and switch. The yellow lenses allow better vision in   
   foggy weather. If driving in patchy fog, do not use high beams, as   
   their light simply bounces straight back, reducing visibility.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Stoplight Switch</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> In order to signal a stop, a brake-pedal operated stoplight switch is  
   provided to operate the vehicle's stop lights. Besides lighting the  
   rear lamps, the switch also operates the center high-mounted light  
   that became mandatory on later models. Cruise control equipped  
   vehicles usually use a vacuum release valve. In this case, both the  
   vacuum release valve and the stoplight switch are turned on by  
   movement of the brake pedal.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Wires and Cables</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Wires and cables are conductors of electricity. Usually, they are  
   made of annealed copper and are used to carry electricity to the  
   various electrical devices and equipment on passenger cars and  
   trucks. Wires and cables must be the right size for the application  
   and must have proper insulation. If the wire or cable is too small in  
   cross section or too long for its size, its resistance will be too  
   great and valuable voltage will be lost. This will then result in  
   poor operation of the electrical device in the connecting circuit.  
  
   <P> Wire size and length determines the resistance of the wire. Wire and  
   cable sizes are expressed by a gauge number, which indicates the  
   cross-sectional area of the conductor. The cross-sectional area of  
   the wires is given in metric size or circular mils. The diameter is  
   given in decimals of an inch. A circular mil is a unit of area equal  
   to the area of a circle one mil in diameter. A mil is a length unit  
   equal to .001 inches. The larger the diameter of the wire or cable,  
   the smaller the gauge size number.  
  
  <P>  Cables are made of several strands of wire. The cross-sectional area  
   is equal to the circular mil area of a single strand times the number  
   of strands. Special gauges are available for measuring the gauge size  
   of wires and cables. Many multi-purpose electrician's pliers feature  
   wire size holes for stripping, cutting, and crimping operations. When  
   comparing cables, consider that the external diameter of insulated  
   wire or cable has nothing to do with its current-carrying capacity.   
   Thick insulation will make a small gauge wire look much larger. It is  
   important that only the size of the metal conductors are compared.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Battery Cables</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Battery cables connect the battery to the rest of the starting and  
   charging circuits. A starting motor which is cranking an engine will  
   draw about 200 amps of current, so the battery cables must be of  
   sufficient size to carry such heavy current.   
  
  <P>  Since the cables are close to the battery and could corrode, it is  
   important that the cables make good electrical contact with the cable  
   clamps. In the same way, clamps must make good electrical contact  
   with the battery posts. Any looseness or corrosion between the cable  
   and its clamp, or between the cable clamp and battery, will result in  
   high resistance and consequent voltage drop.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Windshield Wipers </B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  There are three types of motors that can be used for windshield  
   wipers. The permanent "magnet" motor has two ceramic magnets that are  
   cemented to the field frame and does not use field windings. It needs  
   less energy than the other types of motor design, but the switch must  
   be wired in series, creating many areas of resistance. The "shunt  
   wound" motor provides a very consistent speed, but doesn't provide  
   much torque upon starting. The "compound" motor wiper has a strong  
   starting torque and provides consistent speed, but it is the most  
   expensive.  
  
  <P>  Most cars have an intermittent wiper system, which permits the driver  
   to select a delayed wipe that operates only every few seconds. A  
   representative wiper/washer unit is the wiper assembly, which  
   incorporates a depressed park system that places the wiper blades  
   below the hood line in the parked position. The relay control uses a  
   relay coil, relay armature, and switch assembly. It controls starting  
   and stopping of the wiper through a latching mechanism. An electric  
   washer pump is mounted on the gear box section of the wiper. It is  
   driven by the wiper unit gear assembly.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Windshield Washers</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  All cars use an electric pump-operated windshield washer with a  
   positive displacement washer pump. On some, the motor is placed in  
   the washer reservoir, while on others, it is driven by a wiper motor.  
   When the pump is attached to the wiper motor, the four lobe cam  
   starts a spring-loaded follower, but the pump does not operate all  
   the time that the wiper motor is running. This is because the pumping  
   mechanism is locked out and pumping action occurs.   
  
  <P>  A plunger is pulled toward the coil, allowing the ratchet pawl to  
   engage the ratchet wheel, which begins to rotate, one tooth at a  
   time. Each lobe of the cam starts the follower. The follower moves  
   the piston actuator plate and piston away from the valve assembly and  
   compresses the piston spring, creating a vacuum in the pump cylinder  
   through the intake valve. As the high point of each cam lobe passes  
   the follower, the piston spring expands, forcing the piston toward  
   the valves. This pressurizes the washer solution so it flows out the  
   exhaust valves to the spray nozzles.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Speedometer and Odometer</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The analog speedometer used on cars indicates the speed of the car  
   and records the distance the car has traveled. A speedometer is  
   driven by a flexible cable connected to the speedometer pinion in the  
   transmission. Speedometers are calibrated in miles per hour and/or in  
   kilometers. The instrument also records the distance traveled,  
   recorded in miles or kilometers. That portion of the instrument is  
   known as the odometer. Most odometers record the total distance  
   traveled. Some also record the distance of individual trips.  These  
   can be reset to zero.  
  
  <P>  The speedometer and odometer are driven by a cable in a casing. The  
   cable is connected to a gear at the transmission. This gear is  
   designed for a specific model, tire size, and rear axle ratio. The  
   speed indication of an analog speedometer works on the magnetic  
   principle. It includes a revolving permanent magnet driven by the  
   cable connected to the transmission. The magnet sets up a rotating  
   magnetic field which exerts a pull on the speed cup, making it  
   revolve in the same direction. The movement of the speed cup is  
   slowed and held steady by a hairspring attached to the spindle of the  
   speed cup. The speed cup comes to rest where the magnetic drag is  
   just balanced by the retarding force created by the hairspring. The  
   hairspring also pulls the pointer of the instrument back to zero when  
   the magnet stops rotating. As the speed of the magnet increases, due  
   to movement of the car, the magnet drag on the speed cup increases  
   and pulls the speed cup further around. In that way, a faster speed  
   is indicated by the pointer on the face of the dial. The magnetic  
   field is constant, and the amount of movement of the speed cup is  
   always proportional to the speed at which the magnet is being  
   rotated.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                   Digital Speedometer and Odometer</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  
 <P>   Unlike the analog speedometer, the digital speedometer is operated by  
   a vehicle speed sensor. It puts out electrical pulses to be processed  
   by the computer. The computer turns on segments of a display to form  
   numbers, which is the speed of the car.  
  
  <P>  The digital odometer chip can be replaced if it is defective without  
   replacing the entire speedometer cluster, but a new odometer will  
   register zero mileage. If the entire cluster has to be replaced,  
   however, the old odometer chip can be transferred to the new cluster,  
   displaying the current mileage, because the chip retains the mileage  
   in its memory.  
  
   <P> As far as the instruments of a car, new devices are being considered  
   which allow certain information, for example, the vehicle's speed, to  
   be displayed by creating an image on the windshield. The image would   
   appear to be some distance ahead of the car, so that the driver need   
   not re-focus his eyes to read it. The so-called heads-up display  
   device would therefore allow the driver to be able to monitor his  
   speed and other functions of the car without having to scan downwards  
   from his forward view.

                        Tachometer and Tach Block</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> A tachometer is designed to give the speed of a rotating part in  
   revolutions per minute (rpm). For automotive use, the tachometer is  
   made for measuring the speed of the engine.   
  
  <P>  One lead of the tachometer is connected to the primary terminal of  
   the distributor. The other lead is connected to ground. The control  
   is set for low range to test curb idle and fast idle. The control is  
   set for high range to make tests at speeds above 1200 rpms. A "tach  
   block" is a block with exposed terminals to hook up test equipment or  
   to connect to an electrical circuit.

  <P>  The electrical unit for measuring work is called a "joule." One joule  
   is equal to one ampere flowing for one second under the pressure of  
   one volt. An electrical force may exist without work being done. This  
   is the condition that exists between the terminals of a battery when  
   no equipment is connected to them. When a piece of equipment is  
   connected to the terminals of the battery, current will flow and work  
   will be done.   
  
  <P>  "Power" is the rate of doing that work. The mathematical formula for  
   power can therefore be given as: power = work/time. In the same way,  
   we can find a mathematical formula for electrical power: Electrical  
   power = electrical work/time. A "watt" is an electrical unit of  
   power. The watt is equal to one joule of electrical work per second,  
   giving us the formula:  
  
   <P> Watt = joules/seconds = volts x amperes x seconds/seconds.  
  <P> 
   In an automotive lighting circuit, the current is 8 amperes and the  
   voltage is 12. Therefore, the number of watts being used is:           
  
               8 (amps) x 12 (volts) = 96 watts.  
  
   <P> The unit for measuring mechanical power is called "horsepower." In  
   experimentation, it has been found that one horsepower is equal to  
   746 watts.  
  
  <P>  The first car on the moon was electric, and it took ten years to  
   design. The cost was something around sixty million dollars. It went  
   with the Apollo 15 space crew in 1971.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                   Distributorless Ignition System</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P> The Distributorless Ignition System (DIS) uses several electronic  
   sensors instead of a distributor. It also uses one coil for every two  
   cylinders. The components in the system are:  
 <UL TYPE=disc> 
   <LI>1. Crankshaft timing sensor  
   <LI>2. Camshaft sensor  
   <LI>3. DIS Ignition module  
  <LI> 4. Ignition coil packs 
</UL>  
  <P> 
   The crankshaft timing sensor consists of a single Hall effect  
   magnetic switch activated by 3 vanes on the crankshaft damper and  
   pulley assembly. This sensor sends a signal that feeds timing and rpm  
   information to the DIS and EEC-IV module.  
  
  <P>  The camshaft sensor is driven by the camshaft; it provides   
   information on the cylinder position for the ignition coil and fuel  
   system.  
  
  <P>  The DIS ignition module receives the signal from the crankshaft  
   sensor and the camshaft sensor. It also receives the spark signal  
   from the EEC-IV module. This module's major purpose is to use the  
   information supplied to it to control the ignition coils. The reason  
   it does this is to ensure that they fire in the correct sequence. The  
   DIS module also controls the engine dwell.  
  
  <P>  The ignition coil pack has multiple ignition coils. The DIS module  
   controls these coils by means of coil leads. The ignition coils fire  
   two spark plugs simultaneously; one on the compression stroke and one  
   on the exhaust stroke.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Armature</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> An armature is part of an electrical device which includes many  
   current-carrying windings, which rotate within a magnetic field. It  
   is supported in bearings which are set inside end plates. It usually  
   has a ball bearing at the pulley end and a bronze bushing at the  
   other end. If it is turned with a pulley and driven by a V-belt from   
   the crankshaft pulley, it is a generator. If power is fed to the   
   armature it is called a motor.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Oil Gauge</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> One of your car's most important measuring devices is the oil gauge.  
   It lets you know the pressure in the oil pump; it is a direct  
   indicator of the "survivability" of your engine. If the oil gauge  
   gives very low readings, it means that your oil pressure has dropped.  
   When the oil pressure drops, the oil is not forced into the nooks and  
   crannies that it needs to visit, and your engine soon grinds to a  
   halt.  
  
  <P>  Some cars don't have oil gauges; instead they have warning (or   
   "idiot") lights that light up when the oil pressure drops below a   
   certain preset threshold. Since the light doesn't come on until the  
   oil pressure is extremely low, it is a good idea to check the light  
   bulb often; it's the only thing standing between you and a "Post  
   Toastie" engine.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Ammeter</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The Ammeter tells the driver whether the electrical system is  
   charging, discharging, or staying "level". The gauge should dip when  
   the engine is started, then go up as the alternator re- charges the  
   battery. After a few minutes, it should go to its middle position.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Bimetallic Arm</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Bimetallic arms are used in gauges to deflect the needle when the arm  
   experiences a different current. This occurs because different metals  
   expand and contract at different rates. When current flows through  
   them, they warm, and consequently expand. A gauge has current flowing  
   through its bimetallic arm that pushes and moves the indicator  
   needle.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Indicator Needle</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The indicator needle is the pointer on your gauge that shows you the  
   gauge's current reading. Examples of indicator needles are those  
   found in your speedometer, temperature gauge, tachometer and oil  
   pressure gauge.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Running Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER>
   <P>
   As your car drives down the road, it goes through a little routine.  
   Once the battery is back up to its optimum level, the car runs solely  
   on the alternator. The energy generated by the alternator is  
   sufficient to operate everything on your car. The alternator supplies  
   energy to your headlights, wipers, distributor, radio, electric  
   windows, etc., while you are driving.  
  
  <P>  This is accomplished by the belt that drives the alternator. The   
   alternator generates the electricity. The electricity flows through  
   the voltage regulator, which keeps the electricity at a reasonable  
   voltage level for the car to deal with. Next, the electricity travels  
   to the various appliances you are using. One of these is the  
   distributor, which consumes electricity to ignite the spark plugs as  
   the car runs.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Charging Circuit</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> If the battery hasn't quite gotten "up to snuff" -- or if it's in a  
   "discharge state" (as it is when you first start your car) -- the  
   alternator provides electricity, through the voltage regulator, to  
   charge up the battery. This means that the hardworking alternator has  
   to power your accessories and the distributor at the same time as it  
   charges your battery.  
  
  <P>  The voltage regulator prevents the alternator from charging the   
   battery above its normal level; this protects the battery.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Grounding Points</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Almost everything that is powered electrically in your car is   
   grounded to the frame or the body of the car. These are called   
   "grounding points" and serve to complete the power loop for sending  
   electricity around within the car.  
  
  <P>  Example: current from the positive wiring from the positive terminal  
   of the battery, or fuse box, travels to a light bulb. Once the  
   current has passed through the filament of the light bulb, it passes  
   through the housing of the light bulb and grounds to the frame. The  
   negative battery terminal is also grounded to the frame, which causes  
   the frame to serve as a gigantic piece of wire.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Battery Terminals</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The battery terminals are the points on the battery to which you   
   connect your wires. Some cars have the "post" type that use clamps.  
   <P> This type is slowly being phased out by the "side-mount" type of  
   terminals which use a bolt to screw into the side of the battery and  
   clamp on the battery wire.   
  
  <P>  Battery terminals are a problem in many cars, because vapors from  
   battery acid causes corrosion to form on the lead surfaces and copper  
   wiring associated with the battery wires. It is a good idea to clean  
   these periodically, but wash your hands thoroughly after cleaning the  
   terminals because the corrosion on the terminals is also acidic.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Electromagnet</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  An electromagnet is a magnet made by wrapping a coil of wire around   
   an iron or steel bar. When current is flowing through the coil, the   
   bar becomes magnetized. It remains magnetized as long as the current   
   continues to flow.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Headlights</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> Headlights are mounted on the front of your car, to light the road   
   ahead of you. They have reflectors and special lenses.  
  
   <P> A headlight is usually the sealed beam construction type. This means  
   that the filament, reflector and lens are fused together into an  
   airtight unit. Installation and removal are easily accomplished   
   because of prongs that fit into a wiring socket.  
  
  <P>  The most popular type of headlight is the halogen type, because it   
   provides such good illumination. Adjusting screws allow you to aim,   
   or change the direction of the headlight's beam. If you replace a   
   halogen bulb, remember that it is filled with pressurized gas   
   (halogen) and can produce flying fragments if shattered. Wear   
   protective glasses for changing a halogen lamp, and always throw out  
   the old one in the protective carton that comes with the new one.  
  
  <P> Delay headlights are lights that keep the headlights on for about 30  
   seconds after you have turned the ignition off. This feature is nice  
   for finding your way into your house, or in a strange parking lot.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Hazard Lights</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The hazard warning flasher actuates the hazard warning system. When  
   the control knob is operated, all front and rear turn signal lamps  
   light and flash together. The hazard warning switch control knob  
   generally is mounted on the upper portion of the steering column. The  
   flasher usually is located under the instrument panel on near the  
   fuse block.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Position Sensor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P> 
   Position sensors give input to the computer about the location of a  
   moving part by varying the resistance in an electrical circuit.  
  
   <P> The computer sends a reference current through a circuit (made by a   
   contact needle). The contact needle pivots over a resistor wire known  
   as a "zigzag" wire. When the moving part moves, the needle goes to  
   the left or the right. This alters the circuit's resistance which  
   then changes the current returning to the computer. For example: when  
   the needle moves to the left, the current goes through more of the  
   resistor. The return flow decreases proportionately.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Crankshaft Position Sensor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The crankshaft position sensor is designed to record the rate at which  
   the crankshaft is spinning. This sensor consists of a toothed metal  
   disk mounted on the crankshaft and a stationary detector that covers  
   a magnetic coil that the current passes through. As the metal teeth  
   move past the coil, its magnetic field is disturbed. This causes a  
   stream of pulses in the current. The computer can calculate the  
   crankshaft's speed from the frequency of the pulses.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Knock Sensor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  <P> 
   The knock sensor is designed to sense when fuel is burning unevenly  
   and causing "knocking" or irregular vibrations in the engine.  
  
  <P>  The knock sensor consists of an electric coil that is wound around two  
   ceramic rods with a magnet in the center. Engine vibration makes the   
   ceramic rods vibrate. This disturbs the coils magnetic field and  
   alters the current passing through the coil. This disturbance returns  
   to the computer as a signal pattern that the computer analyzes. The  
   computer then determines whether the vibrations are characteristic of  
   engine knocking.  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Oxygen Sensor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The oxygen sensor, inserted into the exhaust manifold, is a hollow  
   tube. This tube is divided into inner and outer compartments by a  
   U-shaped rod coated with platinum. The exhaust gas enters the outer  
   compartment through a series of slits. Air is available to the inner  
   compartment through a vent at the other end. An electrical signal is  
   generated by the platinum in response to the difference in oxygen  
   content on either end of the rod. The strength of the signal lets the  
   computer know how much oxygen is in the exhaust. From this  
   information, the computer can tell how well the fuel is burning.  
  
   <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Engine Speed Sensor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The engine speed sensor sends information to the computer telling it  
   how fast the car is traveling.  
  
  <P>  The engine speed sensor is designed to record the rate at which the   
   crankshaft is spinning. This sensor consists of a toothed metal disk   
   mounted on the crankshaft and a stationary detector that covers a   
   magnetic coil that the current passes through. As the metal teeth move  
   past the coil, its magnetic field is disturbed. This causes a stream  
   of pulses in the current. The computer can calculate engine speed  
   from the number of rotations of the crankshaft. The number of  
   rotations are reported by the frequency of the pulses from the engine  
   speed sensor.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Airflow Sensor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The airflow sensor measures the air that goes into the engine through  
   the intake manifold.   
  
  <P>  A small air stream is diverted past two small wire coils. The first  
   wire coil is the temperature measuring coil. This coil measures the  
   air temperature. The second coil is the heating coil. This coil is  
   heated to a fixed level above the normal temperature by the computer.  
   As the diverted air cools the second coil, its resistance decreases.  
   The computer detects the change and boosts the current to the heating  
   coil so that it is restored to the correct temperature and  
   resistance. The amount of current required by the computer to keep  
   the coil at the right temperature indicates the rate of air flow.

   <P>The radio antenna is what receives the radio waves from your favorite  
   stations. Usually they are simple telescoping metal rods mounted to  
   the roof or fenders. Some cars use windshield antennas, which are  
   tiny wires which are inside the glass of the windshield. Other cars  
   have power antennas, which protrude automatically when the radio is  
   turned on, and retract when the radio is turned off.

<FONT SIZE=5><B><H1> The Emission Control System</H1></B></FONT> </CENTER> 

<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Emission Control System</B></FONT> </CENTER> 

                     

  <P> The purpose of the emission control system is just that; it controls  
   the emissions and exhaust from your vehicle. The idea is to turn the  
   harmful gases your car manufactures into harmless ones that don't  
   ruin the environment, or us. Some of the problem gases are:  
 <UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>  hydrocarbons (unburned)  
<LI>  carbon monoxide  
<LI> carbon dioxide  
<LI>  nitrogen oxides  
<LI>  sulfur dioxide  
<LI>  phosphorus  
<LI> lead and other metals  
</UL> 
  
  <P> To help control these substances, we (along with federal regulations)  
   have made changes in our gasoline to eliminate them.  Also, with a  
   push from federal regulations, we have developed ways, varying from  
   state to state, to test emissions, that have caused automotive  
   manufacturers to develop better, safer emission systems.  
  
 <P>  Although emissions control systems vary between manufacturers and  
   vehicles, they all have the same goal and use many of the same  
   methods. The addition of computers to ignition systems allows the  
   engine to monitor and adjust itself continuously, so it just isn't  
   true that emission controls lower the amount of mileage we get from  
   fuel.  
  
   <P>The best news is that emission controls have reduced carbon monoxide  
   and hydrocarbon emissions by about ninety-six percent from  
   pre-control vehicles. That's almost a hundred percent!  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Tailpipe</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The tailpipe is a long metal tube attached to the muffler. It sticks  
   out from under the body of your car, at the rear, in order to  
   discharge the exhaust gases from the muffler of your engine into the  
   air outside the car.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Muffler</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
 <P> Exhaust gases leave the engine under extremely high pressure. If  
   these gases escaped directly from the engine the noise would be  
   tremendous. For this reason, the exhaust manifold sends the gases to  
   a muffler where they go through metal plates, or tubes, with a series  
   of holes. The pressure of the gases is reduced when they pass through  
   the muffler, so they go out of the tail pipe quietly.  
  
   <P>The muffler is made of metal and is located underneath the body of  
   the car. It's connected between the tail pipe and the catalytic  
   converter.  
  
 <P>  There are two types of muffler design. One type uses several baffled  
   chambers to reduce noise. The other type sends the gases straight  
   through perforated pipe wrapped in metal or fiberglass.  This type of  
   muffler is designed for the purpose of reducing back pressure and,  
   consequently, makes slightly more noise.  
  
  <P> Since a muffler cannot reduce the noise of the engine by itself, some  
   exhaust systems also have a resonator. Resonators are like little  
   mufflers, and are usually the "straight through" type. They are added  
   at the end of the exhaust system to take care of any noise that has  
   made it through the muffler.  
  
  <P> The muffler quiets the noise of the exhaust by "muffling" the sound  
   waves created by the opening and closing of the exhaust valves. When  
   an exhaust valve opens, it discharges the burned gases at high  
   pressures into the exhaust pipe, which is at low pressure. This type  
   of action creates sound waves that travel through the flowing gas,  
   moving much faster than the gas itself (up to 1400 m.p.h.), that the  
   muffler must silence. It generally does this by converting the sound  
   wave energy into heat by passing the exhaust gas and its accompanying  
   wave pattern, through perforated chambers of varied sizes. Passing  
   into the perforations and reflectors within the chamber forces the  
   sound waves to dissipate their energy.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       The Catalytic Converter</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> When your engine burns fuel, it produces gases that are bad for the  
   environment. These noxious gases are hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide  
   and nitrogen oxides. To prevent the engine from polluting the  
   environment with these gases, we include a catalytic converter in our  
   emission systems.  
  
  <P> The catalytic converter is installed in the exhaust line, between the  
   exhaust manifold and the muffler, and makes use of chemicals that act  
   as a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that causes a reaction  
   between other chemicals without being affected itself. In the case of  
   the catalytic converter, the chemicals it contains cause a reaction  
   in the pollutants in the exhaust. The pollutants are changed from  
   harmful gases to harmless ones before they are let into the  
   environment through the tail pipe.  
  
 <P>  Basically, the harmful gases enter the catalytic converter, a kind of  
   stainless steel container. The converter is lined with chemicals such  
   as aluminum oxide, platinum and palladium. These chemicals cause the  
   carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to change into water vapor and  
   carbon dioxide. Some converters have a third lining of chemicals,  
   platinum and rhodium, that reduce nitrogen oxides (three-way, dual  
   bed converter).  
  
 <P>  The reason that leaded gas cannot be used in an engine with a  
   catalytic converter is that the lead coats the chemicals in the  
   converter. This makes them unable to do the job anymore, since the  
   chemical lining can't come in contact with the pollutants. At first,  
   this was a big disappointment, because lead acted as a lubricant and  
   helped to reduce wear on some of the engine parts.  Luckily for our  
   engines and the environment (not to mention us), car manufacturers  
   soon got around the problem by making tougher parts and coating them  
   with special metal.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            The EGR Valve</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is used to send some of the  
   exhaust gas back into the cylinders to reduce combustion temperature.  
   Why would we want to do this?  
  
  <P> Nitrous oxides (nasty pollutants) form when the combustion   
   temperature gets above 2,500 degrees F. This happens, because at such  
   temperatures, the nitrogen in the air mixes with the oxygen to create  
   nitrous oxides. Did you ever have two friends that were fine by  
   themselves but just awful when they got together? Well, our good  
   friend, the sun, is just like that. When it's sunny, the nitrous  
   oxides from the exhaust get together with the hydrocarbons in the air  
   to form our not-so-good friend, smog. That's when the EGR valve comes  
   in handy.  
  
  <P> By recirculating some of the exhaust gas back through the intake  
   manifold to the cylinders, we can lower the combustion temperature.  
   Lowering the combustion temperature lowers the amount of nitrous  
   oxide produced. Consequently, less of it comes out the tail pipe.  
  
 <P>  There are two types of EGR valves. One operates through the use of a  
   vacuum, and the other operated through the use of pressure. Both  
   types allow the exhaust gas in to lower the combustion temperature  
   when it gets too high.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              PCV Valve</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The process of combustion forms several gases and vapors; many of  
   them quite corrosive. Some of these gases get past the piston rings  
   and into the crankcase. If left in the crankcase, these substances  
   would cause all kinds of bad things (rust, corrosion, and formation  
   of sludge), so they have to be removed. Back in the old days, they  
   used to be dumped out into the atmosphere through a tube. Once we  
   realized what a problem pollution was in the sixties, the PCV  
   (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system was developed to take the  
   place of the old "dump tube."  
  
  <P> The PCV system uses a hose connected between the engine and the  
   intake manifold to draw these gases out of the engine's crankcase and  
   back into the cylinders to burn with the regular fuel. The only  
   problem to solve is how to keep these gases from going willy-nilly  
   into the manifold and upsetting the required air-fuel ratio. The  
   solution to this problem is the PCV valve.  
  
  <P> The PCV valve controls the release of crankcase gases and vapors to  
   the intake manifold. The valve is kept closed by spring action when  
   the engine is at rest. When the engine is running normally, the low  
   vacuum it creates allows the valve to open and release crankcase  
   vapors and gases into the intake manifold for burning. If the engine  
   is idling or you are slowing down, the vacuum level rises and pulls  
   the valve plunger into the valve opening. This partially blocks off  
   the opening so that only a small amount of vapors and gases can be  
   drawn into the intake manifold.  
  
  <P> One really comforting feature of the PCV valve is its behavior in the  
   event of a backfire. If your car backfires in the manifold, the  
   pressure makes the spring close the valve completely. With the valve  
   closed, there is no chance that the flame can move into the crankcase  
   and cause an explosion.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Air Pump</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P>The air pump sends (or pumps) compressed air into the exhaust  
   manifold and in some cases to the catalytic converter. The oxygen in  
   the pressurized air helps to burn quite a bit of any unburned  
   hydrocarbons (fuel) and therby converts the poisonous carbon monoxide  
   into good old carbon dioxide.  
  
 <P>  A belt from the engine drives the air pump. It has little vanes  
   (thin, flat, curved fins) that draw the air into the compression  
   chamber. Here, the air is compressed and sent off to the exhaust  
   manifold where it speeds up the emissions burning process.  Stainless  
   steel nozzles are used to shoot the air into the exhaust manifold,  
   because they will not burn.  
  
 <P>  Some engines use a pulse air injection system. This system uses  
   pulses of exhaust gas to operate an air pump that delivers air into  
   the exhaust system.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                   The Exhaust Manifold and Header</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The exhaust manifold, usually constructed of cast iron, is a pipe  
   that conducts the exhaust gases from the combustion chambers to the  
   exhaust pipe. It has smooth curves in it for improving the flow of  
   exhaust.  
  
  <P> The exhaust manifold is bolted to the cylinder head, and has   
   entrances for the air that is injected into it. It is usually located  
   under the intake manifold.  
  
  <P> A header is a different type of manifold; it is made of separate  
   equal-length tubes.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                   Manifold to Exhaust Pipe Gaskets</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> There are several types of gaskets that connect the exhaust pipe to  
   the manifold.  
  
  <P> One is a flat surface gasket. Another type uses a ball and socket  
   with springs to maintain pressure. This type allows some flexibility  
   without breakage of the seal or the manifold. A third type is the  
   full ball connector type, which also allows a little flexibility.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Exhaust Pipe Hangers</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P>Hangers hold the exhaust system in place. They give the system  
   flexibility and reduce the noise level. The hanger system consists of  
   rubber rings, tubes and clamps.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Catalysts</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The materials within a catalytic converter vary between cars.   
   Catalytic converters are designed to do different things, depending  
   on the design of the converter.   
  
  <P> Some catalytic converters use what is called an "oxidation "   
   catalyst; this usually consists of ceramic beads coated with platinum  
   to reduce hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Through the catalytic  
   action, the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are "burned" to create  
   water vapor and carbon dioxide. This type of catalytic converter  
   needs an input of oxygen, so oxygen is usually injected into the  
   cylinder head, or directly into the exhaust header or manifold.  
  
  <P> Newer catalytic converters have a two part design. The front half is  
   a "three-way" catalyst, which burns various pollutants, and reduces  
   hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen into water,  
   carbon dioxide and nitrogen. These converters require exact fuel air  
   mixtures in order to maintain efficient exhaust reduction. The rear  
   section of these converters is the normal oxidation catalyst that  
   further reduces hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Air from the air  
   pump is injected into the center of these converters. Here the air is  
   allowed to mix with the exhaust before it passes into the oxidation  
   catalyst, where it burns off its toxic chemicals and reduces  
   emissions.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Exhaust Pipe</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The exhaust pipe is the bent-up or convoluted pipes you will notice  
   underneath your car. Some are shaped to go over the rear axle,  
   allowing the rear axle to move up and down without bumping into the  
   exhaust pipe; some are shaped to bend around under the floor of the  
   car, connecting the catalytic converter with the muffler. Exhaust  
   pipes are usually made out of stainless steel, since the high heat  
   conditions involved with the muffler system will cause rust.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Reverse-flow Muffler</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P>The reverse-flow muffler is oval-shaped and has multiple pipes. Four  
   chambers and a double jacket are used to accomplish muffling of the  
   exhaust noise. Exhaust gases are directed to the third chamber,  
   forced forward to the first chamber, from where they travel the  
   length of the muffler and are exhausted into the tail pipe.  
  
<BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Straight Through Muffler</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The straight through muffler has a central tube, perforated with  
   several openings which lead into an outside chamber packed with a  
   sound absorbing (or insulating) material. As the exhaust gases expand  
   from the perforated inner pipe into the outer chamber, they come in  
   contact with the insulator and escape to the atmosphere under  
   constant pressure. Because of this, the expanding chamber tends to  
   equalize or spread the pressure peaks throughout the exhaust from  
   each individual cylinder of the engine.  
  
  <P> A V-8 engine requires two exhaust manifolds and either one or two  
   mufflers and often accompanying resonators. If one muffler is used,  
   the exhaust pipe from one manifold meets the other one in the form of  
   a "Y".  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Dual Exhaust System</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The advantage of a dual exhaust system is that the engine exhausts  
   more freely, thereby lowering the back pressure which is inherent in  
   an exhaust system. With a dual exhaust system, a sizable increase in  
   engine horsepower can be obtained because the "breathing" capacity of  
   the engine is improved, leaving less exhaust gases in the engine at  
   the end of each exhaust stroke. This, in turn, leaves more room for  
   an extra intake of the air-fuel mixture.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Air Conditioning and Heating System</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> Not only do we depend on our cars to get us where we want to go, we   
   also depend on them to get us there without discomfort. We expect the  
   heater to keep us warm when it's cold outside, and the air   
   conditioning system to keep us cool when it's hot.  
  
   <P>We get heat from the heater core, sort of a secondary radiator, which  
   is part of the car's cooling system. We get air conditioning from the  
   car's elaborate air conditioning system.   
  
 <P>  Despite its relatively small size, the cooling system has to deal   
   with an enormous amount of heat to protect the engine from friction   
   and the heat of combustion. The cooling system has to remove about   
   6,000 BTU of heat per minute. This is a lot more heat than we need to  
   heat a large home in cold weather. It's good to know that some of  
   this heat can be put to the useful purpose of keeping us warm.  
  
  <P> Air conditioning makes driving much more comfortable in hot weather.   
   Your car's air conditioner cleans and dehumidifies (removes excess   
   moisture), the outside air entering your car. It also has the task of  
   keeping the air at the temperature you select. These are all big   
   jobs. How do our cars keep our "riding environment" the way we like   
   it?  
  
  <P> Most people think the air conditioning system's job is to add "cold"  
   air to the interior of the car. Actually, there is no such thing as  
   "cold," just an absence of heat, or less heat than our bodies are  
   comfortable with. The job of the air conditioning system is really to  
   "remove" the heat that makes us uncomfortable, and return the air to  
   the car's interior in a "un-heated" condition.  Air conditioning, or  
   cooling, is really a process of removing heat from an object (like  
   air).  
  
 <P>  A compressor circulates a liquid refrigerant called Refrigerant-12  
   (we tend to call it "Freon," a trade name, the way we call copy  
   machines "Xerox" machines). The compressor moves the Refrigerant-12   
   from an evaporator, through a condenser and expansion valve, right   
   back to the evaporator. The evaporator is right in front of a fan   
   that pulls the hot, humid air out of the car's interior. The   
   refrigerant makes the hot air's moisture condense into drops of   
   water, removing the heat from the air. Once the water is removed, the  
   "cool" air is sent back into the car's interior. Aaaaaah! Much   
   better.   
  
  <P> Sometimes we worry when we catch our car making a water puddle on the  
   ground, but are relieved to discover that it's only water dripping  
   from the air conditioning system's condenser (no color, no smell, and  
   it dries!).  
  
  <P> Note: Refrigerant-12 is extremely dangerous. Many special precautions  
   must be taken when it is present. It can freeze whatever it contacts  
   (including your eyes), it is heavier than air and can suffocate you,  
   and it produces a poisonous gas when it comes in contact with an open  
   flame.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Dash Controls</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> Most or all of the control panel of your car is located on the  
   dashboard behind the steering wheel. Sometimes it extends onto the  
   car's console, between the two front seats, and onto your steering  
   column. Little duplicate fragments of the control panel are scattered  
   around the interior of your vehicle, such as automatic door locks,  
   extra light switches, etc.  
  
  <P> The dash controls enable you to operate your headlights, turn  
   signals, horn, windshield wipers, heater, defroster, air  
   conditioning, radio, etc. All of the vehicle's controls should be  
   within the reach of the driver.  
  
  <P> The control panel also contains all of your gauges; gas, temperature,  
   tachometer, etc. These enable you to monitor the operating conditions  
   of your engine and charging system, fuel level, oil pressure and  
   coolant temperature. Warning lights come on to alert you to dangerous  
   coolant temperatures, or loss of oil pressure.  
  
  <P> In 1924 the Nash Co. introduced the electric clock as an accessory.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                 Relays</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
 <P>  A relay is an electromagnetic device in which contacts are made and  
   subsequently broken. An example of this would be your car's horn.  
  
  <P> By natural law, the farther electrical current travels, the lower its  
   voltage becomes. Your car horn has to be connected to the car battery  
   in order to sound. The shortest distance between two points is a wire  
   connecting your horn to your battery. The only problem with this  
   arrangement is that connecting the two would give you a permanent  
   horn blast when you turned the key in your ignition.  
  
 <P> This is an unacceptable arrangement, so a relay is included in the  
   connection. The relay stops the horn from sounding until you activate  
   the relay by pressing the horn. The relay then allows the horn to  
   connect to the battery, or complete the circuit, and it sounds. As  
   soon as you stop pressing the horn, the relay breaks the connection,  
   or circuit, and presto-- no more horn!  
  
  <P> Relays, with switches, are used for most of the equipment that  
   depends on the battery for an energy source. This includes  
   headlights, taillights, radio, etc.  
  
  
  <P> In 1922, a Model T was the first car equipped with a radio. In 1927,  
   the first commercially produced car radio came on the scene.  
  
   A "relay" is any switching device operated by a low current circuit  
   that controls opening and closing of another circuit of high current  
   capacity. The purpose of the "cutout relay" is to prevent the battery  
   from discharging through the generator when the engine is stopped or  
   turning over slowly. A "field relay" connects the alternator field  
   windings and voltage regulator windings directly to the battery.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Compressor</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
 <P>  The compressor used to air condition your car works in a similar way  
   to the one in the refrigerator in your kitchen. The job of the  
   compressor is to move liquid refrigerant around in a pipe. The  
   compressor pumps, or forces, the liquid from the evaporator into a  
   condenser and expansion valve, and then back to the evaporator.  
  
  <P> There are three common types of compressors:  
 <UL TYPE=disc>
   <LI>Two cylinder reciprocating piston type  
  <LI> Four cylinder RADIAL type  
  <LI> Six cylinder AXIAL type  
</UL> 
  
 <P>  The engine drives the compressor with a belt. In action, the   
   compressor takes the low pressure refrigerant from the evaporator and  
   compresses it according to speed and air temperature. The inlet side  
   is known as the low (pressure) side and the outlet side is known as  
   the high (pressure) side.  
  
 <P>  The compressor compresses the refrigerant, and raises its temperature  
   higher than that of the surrounding air. Then, the compressor forces  
   the refrigerant into the condenser.   
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Condenser</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
 <P>  The condenser is a long tube that goes back and forth through a  
   multitude of cooling fins, quite similar to the evaporator in  
   structure. The condenser is mounted in front of the radiator to take  
   advantage of the forced air provided by the fan and the motion of the  
   car.  
  
 <P>  As the highly pressurized refrigerant (vapor) flows into the   
   condenser, it gives off heat and warms the condenser. This causes the  
   condenser to be hotter than the forced air coming through the  
   condenser. The condenser hands its heat off to the forced air and  
   turns the refrigerant back into cool liquid in the expansion valve,   
   where it heads back to the evaporator.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             The Evaporator</B></FONT></CENTER> 
 <P> 
   The evaporator is a long tube, or coil, that goes back and forth  
   through a multitude of cooling fins. It is quite similar to the  
   condenser in structure.  
  
  <P> The refrigerant is a liquid when it enters the evaporator. A fan  
   blows warm air over the evaporator. The warm air causes the liquid  
   refrigerant to boil. This means that it absorbs the heat from the  
   warm air. Once it has absorbed the heat from the warm air, the warm  
   air isn't warm anymore. The same blower that blows the warm air (that  
   is now "cool" air) over the evaporator, keeps on blowing it into the  
   interior of your car, and you have -- air conditioning!  
  
  <P> The evaporator also removes the moisture from the air coming through  
   its fins and turns it into water. The water just drains off.  
  
  <P> The temperature of the evaporator coil can go from 33 degrees F to 0  
   degrees F. If it goes below 32 degrees F, the moisture that's  
   supposed to drain off the coils will freeze. This makes for a very  
   (surprise!) inefficient system, so a thermostatic switch is used to  
   connect and disconnect it to the compressor as necessary.  
  
    <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Expansion Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> The expansion valve determines the correct amount of refrigerant  
   going into the evaporator, and it lowers the pressure of the  
   refrigerant.  
  
  <P> When the compressor starts, the expansion valve opens and the liquid  
   refrigerant flows through a strainer in the high pressure liquid  
   inlet. Once in the expansion valve, the refrigerant is correctly  
   pressurized. As the evaporator calls for more refrigerant, the  
   expansion valve allows the required amount of low pressure liquid  
   refrigerant into the coils.  
  
  <P> The expansion valve maintains the delicate balance between the heat  
   load and the cooling efficiency of the evaporator.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                    Discharge/Suction Service Valves</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
 <P> Discharge and suction service valves allow the air conditioning  
   system to be emptied and filled. These valves also provide places  
   where the system can be checked with pressure gauges.  
  
  <P> Note: Some systems use a Schrader valve in place of the discharge and  
   suction valves. This is a spring-loaded valve which looks rather like  
   the valve in a tire.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          The Compressor Relay</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> A capillary tube from a cycling switch lets the switch know what the  
   temperature is in the evaporator. This switch turns the compressor on  
   and off to keep the evaporator temperature at about 32 to 45 degrees  
   F. The relay switch keeps moisture from freezing on the evaporator  
   core.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                     Electric Air Conditioning Fan</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P> Sometimes an extra electric fan is placed in front of the condenser  
   to provide an extra flow of air during warm weather, or for times  
   when the car has to idle for a long time. You activate and deactivate  
   the air conditioning fan when you turn it on and off at the control  
   panel.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Compressor Belt</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
 <P>  The compressor is engine driven by a belt on the front of the  
   crankshaft.   
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Heater/AC Blower Motor</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P> The blower motor is the motor that turns the electric fan in an air  
   conditioning or heating system.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Air Ducts</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> The air ducts control the passage of hot or cold air into the  
   interior of the car. They are operated by a control on the dash,  
   either manually or automatically.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                Controls</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> Most air conditioning/heating systems have three possible air  
   settings. One is to recirculate the air that is in the car, a second  
   is to use only air from the outside of the car, and a third is to mix  
   some of the outside air with the air recirculating inside the car.  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                            Compressor Clutch</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P>The air conditioning compressor has an electromagnetic clutch that   
   can engage or disengage the compressor pulley. The compressor pulley   
   always turns when the engine is running, but the compressor only runs  
   when the pulley is engaged to the compressor driving shaft.  
  
 <P>  When this system is activated, current runs through the   
   electromagnetic coil. The current attracts it to the armature plate.   
   The strong magnetic pull draws the armature plate against the side of  
   the turning pulley. This locks the pulley and the armature plate   
   together; the armature plate drives the compressor.  
  
 <P>  When the system is deactivated, and current stops running through the  
   electromagnetic coil, flat springs pull the armature plate away from   
   the pulley.  
  
  <P> The magnetic coil does not turn since its magnetism is transmitted   
   through the pulley to the armature. The armature plate and hub   
   assembly are fastened to the compressor drive shaft. When it's not   
   driving the compressor, the clutch pulley turns on a double row of   
   ball bearings.

   <P>The low pressure line is a hose, or tube containing refrigerant that   
   connects the evaporator to the air conditioning system's compressor.   
   The compressor draws the low pressure refrigerant from the evaporator  
   in through the low pressure line in order to compress it.

 <P>  The high pressure line is a hose, or tube containing refrigerant that  
   connects the air conditioning system's compressor to the condenser.   
   The compressor forces the compressed refrigerant into the condenser   
   through the high pressure line.

  <P> Inside the air conditioner's refrigerant compressor is a drive ring  
   made of a friction material that is mounted to both sides of the  
   "swash" or "wobble" plate. As the swash plate rotates, the friction  
   material pushes the ball bearings (mounted to the pistons) back and  
   forth.

                  The Car and the Environment (Overview)</B></FONT></CENTER>
  <PRE>
   Most of us know that cars are the number one cause of air pollution,  
   but most of us never do anything about it until someone makes us.   
   This usually happens because of a law. We buy gas that causes less  
   harmful emissions, because that's what's for sale now. Scientists  
   tell us that if we don't do something soon, we will be unable to  
   repair the damage that we are causing to our planet. What are some of  
   the things we can do to help?  
  
   1. Buy a fuel-efficient car and keep it that way  
  
   Good gas mileage isn't just a way to save money. It's also a way to  
   stop pollution. Since the world just isn't set up for you to start  
   riding a bike everywhere, you're probably going to be using a car.  
   Choose a car that is friendly to the environment when you purchase  
   one. Use the most recent EPA gas Mileage Guide to check  
   fuel-efficiency, and don't get any optional equipment that wastes  
   fuel that you don't need.   
  
   2. Keep your car tuned up  
  
   A car that is badly tuned releases more pollutants into the air. If  
   you keep track of your gas mileage, you'll know when something is  
   wrong and can have it fixed. A badly tuned car uses almost 10% more  
   gas than a well-tuned car. Other ways to waste gas are:  
  
   Idling your car unnecessarily: If you are stopped for longer than a  
   minute, it is more fuel efficient to turn off your engine.  
  
   Using dirty fuel filters. Dirty fuel filters waste gas.  
  
   Carrying unnecessary weight in your car. The heavier your car is, the  
   more gas it uses.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Air Conditioner Maintenance</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>   In November of 1990, the Clean Air Act was signed into Federal law.  
   This law requires a complete phase out of chlorofluorocarbons  
   (commonly known as CFCs) and other ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs)  
   by the year 2000, although it might be revised to 1997 or sooner.  
   What does this have to do with your air conditioner?  
  
 <P>  Your air conditioner uses a CFC based refrigerant, known as R-12, or  
   freon. This law means that there won't be much R-12 left by the year   
   2000, and what is left will be very expensive, because of a tax that   
   will reach about $5.00 per pound.   
  
  
 <P>  Why are they doing this to us? We like our cars to have air  
   conditioning. This is being done because of the terrible damage CFC  
   based refrigerant is doing to the ozone layer. In the U.S., the  
   largest single source of ozone damaging emissions is from our  
   automobile air conditioners. It's been estimated that car air   
   conditioners used over 48,000 metric tons of R-12 in 1989 -- this   
   is 21% of all CFC use in the U.S.  
  
  <P> Of course, this causes a big problem for both us and our mechanics.  
   We won't be able to go out and buy a can to "top-off" our systems.  
   The new laws specify that all refrigerant will have to be recaptured  
   and recycled when we have repairs made. Of course, this will take  
   expensive and specialized equipment. Our mechanics will have to make  
   sure that there are no leaks, and fix them if there are, before they  
   can add any R-12 to our air conditioning systems.  Naturally, this  
   cost will be passed along to us.  
  
  <P> Recovered refrigerant will be recycled. Capturing refrigerants and  
   restoring them for reuse is not only environmentally sound, but  
   mechanically safe. Each molecule of CFC in the atmosphere has a 120  
   year life that will destroy tens of thousands of ozone molecules.  
   This means that a CFC molecule released in 1991 will still be  
   damaging the ozone layer in 2100.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Gas Ecology</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> There are many ways that we can reduce pollution by observing good  
   gas ecology -- that is using our cars in fuel efficient ways.  
  
  <P> Don't move the car unless you are going somewhere. Plan ahead.  
   Starting the car up just to move it a short distance produces more  
   pollutants than hours of driving on the freeway.  
  
  <P> Don't use your heater until the car is warmed up. The engine will  
   warm more quickly, because it won't be losing heat to warm you.  
  
 <P>  Try to drive within 35-45 miles per hour when possible. Driving at  
   slower speeds reduces engine efficiency and causes more pollutants.  
  
  <P> Don't make fast starts or stops. Fast starts can burn more than 50%  
   more gas than regular acceleration (as well as cause 50% more  
   emissions). When a big burst of gas enters the engine, much of the  
   catalytic converter's job is bypassed and the unburned gas comes out  
   the tailpipe or is sent into the converter. Rapid acceleration is  
   only called for in emergency or passing situations. Stopping rapidly  
   also leaves the engine with a lot of unburned gas to deal with. This  
   results in damage to the converter and pollution.  
  
  <P> Try not to idle. At bank lines and fast food places with over thirty  
   second waits, turn the engine off, and restart it. It is more fuel  
   efficient, and causes less pollution. The only time that idling is a  
   good thing is after a long, fast run. Idling the engine for a minute  
   or so after one of these helps get rid of any hot spots and fuel  
   vapors.  
  
 <P>  Keep to steady speeds on the highway. Changing speeds produces more  
   pollution and uses more gas.  
  
  <P> Don't use the air conditioner unless you have to. It makes your  
   engine work harder, uses more gas, and causes more pollution.  
  
 <P>  Most evaporative emissions get into the atmosphere when we put gas in  
   our cars. Make sure your gas cap is the right one, and in good  
   working order. Gas caps don't cost that much, but are very important  
   in anti-pollution.  
  
  <P> Since gasoline expands, never overfill your tank. It will wind up  
   leaking out.  
  
  <P> Use known brands of gas. Poor quality gas will not save you money.  
   Instead, it will foul your engine and cause it to function badly.  
   Try several different brands and octane ratings to find out which  
   makes you car the happiest, and stay with it.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Fuel Conservation</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P> In addition to the ways mentioned to be "gas-ecological," there are  
   other ways that you can conserve fuel.  
  
 <P>  Don't drive around the parking lot for hours waiting for a convenient  
   space to "open up." Americans do this all of the time.  Just think of  
   the gas that we could save (not to mention pollution) if we all just  
   parked in the first spot we could find, and walked!  It would  
   probably save time, too (the reason we're so intent on finding a  
   "close" parking spot in the first place).  
  
 <P>  Use carpools, vanpools and public transportation. Although this means  
   that you'll have to give up some of your "freedom," it doesn't  
   necessarily mean that in the long run. If you don't do it now, by  
   your own freedom of choice (the pollution situation won't go away on  
   its own) soon regulations may order you to give up your freedom. If  
   this happens, it won't be on your schedule. It will be on the law's  
   schedule. They might order you not to drive on Tuesdays, and it won't  
   be voluntary. You'll be a "lawbreaker" if they catch you, and  
   punished accordingly. Don't wait for that to happen. If we all take  
   some sort of voluntary action now, it won't have to happen.  
  
  <P> Use a bicycle, and/or respect those who do  
  
 <P>  Bicycles are a great means of transportation. Remember when you were  
   too young to drive? You didn't think anything of getting where you  
   needed to go on your bike. It worked just fine. You got exercise, and  
   didn't pollute anything.  
  <P>
   We are seeing more and more cyclists on the road these days, but we  
   tend to resent them. We think that they are in our way. They are, but  
   they are also cutting down on pollution. Try to think that if they  
   were in a car, you might not make it through the next light because  
   they would be in front of you. Realize that there aren't many good  
   roads for bicycles and that if there were, the cyclists would be even  
   happier to be on them than you would. Don't think of them as your  
   adversaries. Just be glad they're not in cars.  
  
  <P> Think about riding a bicycle yourself. If it wasn't for the danger of  
   short-tempered, mean-spirited drivers, cycling could be a great form  
   of exercise -- with a purpose. It's also great for the environment.  
   There are lots of trips you make that would be ideally suited for a  
   bicycle. If more of us rode them, then better bicycle routes would be  
   demanded by the taxpayers. This would make it better all around for  
   both bicyclists and motorists. More people would bike, and less  
   people would drive. More people would be healthy and feel better, and  
   so would the environment.  
  
  <P> Call Ahead  
  
<P>  If you aren't sure they have what you want, call stores to find out  
   before you drive there. Don't drive from store-to-store -- call from  
   store-to-store. You can even do price comparisons that way.  Call  
   before you "drop-in" on someone to make sure they're home (they'll  
   appreciate that, anyhow). Using your phone can save you hours of  
   driving, parking and walking around.  
  
 <P>  Use Your Legs  
  
 <P>  Why is it, that even if we only live a mile from work, we drive  
   anyhow? Sometimes we have too much to carry, or it's raining, or we  
   have to do some errands. This isn't true all of the time. The truth  
   is, we just don't think of walking anymore.  
  
  <P> Zillions of people are out walking these days -- it's called   
   "recreational walking," and it's all the rage. To do recreational  
   walking, the rule is, you have to wear special clothes and shoes, and  
   use your "spare" time for it to "count." Right? Wrong. You can walk  
   in any kind of clothes (although you might want to wear your  
   "special" shoes and carry your "work" shoes) and actually save some  
   of your "spare" time for something else. Try to work walking into   
   your regular schedule, lose weight, feel better and help the   
   environment.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Recycling Oil</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> People who change their own automobile oil remove at least 200  
   million gallons of oil each year. This oil is still useful, if it is  
   recovered, but only about 10% of it is recovered and recycled.  
   Usually, the oil gets thrown in the trash in containers, or poured  
   out someplace where it can find its way into our drinking water.  
   This is not only a problem, but a waste, since the oil can be cleaned  
   up and used again.  
  
 <P>  Not only does this oil find its way back to our sources of drinking  
   water, it also pollutes our lakes and streams. Used oil should be put  
   in leak-proof containers.  
  
  <P> Different states have different ways of dealing with the oil to be  
   recycled, but in general there are always places to drop off your  
   used oil. If you don't know of one, call your local garage, or call  
   your city or county to find out how you can have your old oil  
   reclaimed and recycled. If you don't have time to let your fingers do  
   the walking, at least ask your mechanic for ideas. Oil is a valuable  
   resource; wars are fought over it. Don't let it be lost for its  
   proper use, and instead be put to the use of ruining the environment.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Recycling Coolant</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Although coolant isn't as bad for the environment as used motor oil,  
   you should still make sure that you dispose of it in the proper  
   manner. It is very toxic, so keep it away from childern and pets.  
   Place it in leak-proof containers and find out where to take it for  
   recycling. Most cities have oil recycling, but not coolant recycling.  
   Write to your local officials if they don't.  
  
   <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Recycling Tires</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> This is a tough one, but one that is serious enough for several  
   companies to have begun looking for answers. Something like 240  
   million tires are discarded in the U.S. each year. These tires pose a  
   very serious threat to the environment. Aside from taking up huge  
   amounts of landfill space, they tend to rise to the top. Tires catch  
   on fire very easily, and this can result in a very dangerous   
   situation.  
  
  <P> Only about 20% of used tires are suitable for retreading. Some old  
   tires wind up padding docks and swinging in back yards, but until  
   recently, most of them have just been piling up. Recently,  
   entrepreneurs have been trying to find uses for old tires. They are  
   shredding them for fuel, mixing them with highway asphalt and using  
   them to soften airport runways. One company uses the tires for rubber  
   mats, garbage cans and other products.  
  
 <P>  Since tire disposal costs are skyrocketing, state and city   
   regulations are going to have a big effect on how it's done. Disposal  
   costs range from twenty five to fifty cents a tire. One state has  
   begun to have a surcharge on new tire sales in order to finance  
   disposal.  
  
  <P> What can you do right now? Try to make your tires last as long as is  
   safely possible. Buy long-lasting, fuel efficient tires. Check with  
   your dealer about "rolling resistance" and mileage performance before  
   you buy tires. Keep your tires properly inflated, balanced and  
   rotated.  
  
 <P>  Don't dispose of tires yourself. If they can't be recapped, give them  
   to the dealer where you buy your new tires and request that they be  
   properly disposed of.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Recycling Batteries</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
  <P> Old car batteries contain nasty chemicals that can be hazardous to   
   your health. They should not be thrown away, and there's no need to.  
   The easiest (why take it home with you) way to recycle a battery is  
   to trade it in when you get a new one. Since carrying auto batteries  
   around is a pretty heavy duty job, this is the best way.  
  
 <P>  If this method doesn't work out for you, for some reason (most people  
   don't buy new batteries until the old ones quit), get your yellow  
   pages. Find "Battery Repairing and Rebuilding" and sell it to someone  
   listed there.  
  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                            Emissions Testing</B></FONT></CENTER>  
  <P> Many states require emissions tests on vehicles. This means that you  
   drive to a facility where the test people take a sample of your  
   emissions and run it through some analysis. The results are printed,  
   and you pass or fail depending on the percentage of toxic emissions  
   that turn up in your car's sample.  
  
  <P> The only way to "study" or prepare for this test is to take good care  
   of your car, including its emission system. If you use preventative  
   maintenance, and keep your car tuned properly, you will pass. If you  
   tamper with your emissions system, you will not pass. You can have  
   your car checked independently before your emissions test if you want  
   to resolve problems before going to the emissions test station.  
  
  <P> One other good thing to do is to save your printouts from the test  
   from year to year. If you compare them, you will be able to monitor  
   your car (if its score is getting worse) and catch any problems  
   before the emissions people catch you.

<FONT SIZE=5><B><H1>The Steering/Suspension System (Overview)</H1></B></FONT></CENTER>  <BR>

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>The Steering/Suspension System</B></FONT></CENTER>   <BR><BR>
 
  
   <P>"Suspension," when discussing cars, refers to the use of front and  
   rear springs to suspend a vehicle's "sprung" weight. The springs used  
   on today's cars and trucks are constructed in a variety of types,  
   shapes, sizes, rates, and capacities. Types include leaf springs,  
   coil springs, air springs, and torsion bars. These are used in sets  
   of four for each vehicle, or they may be paired off in various  
   combinations and are attached by several different mounting  
   techniques. The suspension system also includes shocks and/or struts,  
   and sway bars.  
     
   <P>Back in the earliest days of automobile development, when most of the  
   car's weight (including the engine) was on the rear axle, steering  
   was a simple matter of turning a tiller that pivoted the entire front  
   axle. When the engine was moved to the front of the car, complex  
   steering systems had to evolve. The modern automobile has come a long  
   way since the days when "being self-propelled" was enough to satisfy  
   the car owner. Improvements in suspension and steering, increased  
   strength and durability of components, and advances in tire design  
   and construction have made large contributions to riding comfort and  
   to safe driving.  
  
   <P>Cadillac allegedly produced the first American car to use a steering  
   wheel instead of a tiller.  
  
  <P> Two of the most common steering mechanisms are the "rack and pinion"  
   and the standard (or recirculating-ball) systems, that can be either  
   manual or assisted by power. The rack and pinion was designed for  
   sports cars and requires too much driver muscle at low speeds to be  
   very useful in larger, heavier cars. However, power steering makes a  
   heavy car respond easily to the steering wheel, whether at highway  
   speeds or inching into a narrow parking place, and it is normal  
   equipment for large automobiles.  
  <P>
   The suspension system has two basic functions, to keep the car's  
   wheels in firm contact with the road and to provide a comfortable  
   ride for the passengers. A lot of the system's work is done by the  
   springs. Under normal conditions, the springs support the body of the  
   car evenly by compressing and rebounding with every up-and-down  
   movement. This up-and-down movement, however, causes bouncing and  
   swaying after each bump and is very uncomfortable to the passenger.  
   These undesirable effects are reduced by the shock absorbers.   
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Shock Absorbers</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                               
  
 <P>  In the past, a wide variety of direct and indirect shock absorbing  
   devices were used to control spring action of passenger cars.  Today,  
   direct, double-acting hydraulic shock absorbers and shock absorber  
   struts have almost universal application.  
  <P>
   The operating principle of direct-acting hydraulic shock absorbers is  
   in forcing fluid through restricting openings in the valves.  This  
   restricted flow serves to slow down and control rapid movement in the  
   car springs as they react to road irregularities. Usually, fluid flow  
   through the pistons is controlled by spring-loaded valves. Hydraulic  
   shock absorber automatically adapt to the severity of the shock. If  
   the axle moves slowly, resistance to the flow of fluid will be light.  
   If the axle movement is rapid or violent, the resistance is stronger,  
   since more time is required to force fluid through the openings. By  
   these actions and reactions, the shock absorbers permit a soft ride  
   over small bumps and provide firm control over spring action for  
   cushioning large bumps. The double-acting units must be effective in  
   both directions because spring rebound can be almost as violent as  
   the original action that compressed the shock absorber.  
  
  <P> In the 1930s, there was a school for chauffeurs of the Rolls Royce.  
   Since the car had a reputation to maintain for its smooth and quiet  
   ride, the students had to pass a special test. They were required to  
   drive a Phantom II model with a glass of water on the radiator  
   without spilling a drop!  
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Coil Springs</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                              
  
  <P> Compression type coil springs may be mounted between the lower  
   control arm and spring housing or seat in the frame. Other front  
   suspension systems have the coil springs mounted above the upper  
   control arms, compressed between a pivoting spring seat bolted to the  
   control arm and a spring tower formed in the front end sheet metal.  
   When coil springs are used in both front and rear suspension, three  
   or four control arms are placed between the rear axle housing and the  
   frame to carry driving and brake torque. The lower control arms pivot  
   in the frame members and sometimes support the rear coil springs to  
   provide for up-and-down movement of the axle and wheel assembly.   
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Leaf Springs

  <P> Front leaf springs are used with solid axle beams in most truck  
   applications. Corvettes use single-leaf, filament-wound, glass/epoxy  
   front and rear springs mounted transversely; i.e., they are crosswise  
   to the vehicle's centerline. Rear leaf springs are used on trucks and  
   some passenger cars. Single leaf or multi-leaf springs are usually  
   mounted longitudinally over the front axle beam or under the rear  
   axle housing. The spring center bolt fastens the leaves together, and  
   its head locates the spring in the front axle beam or saddle on the  
   rear axle housing. U-bolts clamp the spring firmly in place and keep  
   it from shifting.  Eyebolts, brackets, and shackles attach it to the  
   frame at each end. Leaf springs also serve as control arms, locating  
   the rear end in position and transferring force to the chassis.

        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Torsion Bars</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                                
  
  <P> Torsion bar suspension uses the flexibility of a steel bar or tube,  
   twisting lengthwise to provide spring action. Instead of the flexing  
   action of a leaf spring, or the compressing-and-extending action of a  
   coil spring, the torsion bar twists to exert resistance against  
   up-and-down movement. Two rods of spring steel are used in this type  
   of suspension. One end of the bar is fixed solidly to a part of the  
   frame behind the wheel; the other is attached to the lower control  
   arm. As the arm rises and falls with wheel movement, the bar twists  
   and absorbs more of the road shocks before they can reach the body of  
   the car. The bar untwists when the pressure is released, just like a  
   spring rebounding after being compressed.  
 <P>
     Adjusting the torsion bars controls the height of the front end of  
   the vehicle. The adjusting bolts are located at the torsion bar  
   anchors in the front crossmember. The inner ends of the lower control  
   arms are bolted to the crossmember and pivot through a bushing.   
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Shock Absorber Struts</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                            
  
  <P> A strut is a structural piece designed to resist pressure in the  
   direction of its length. On typical "MacPherson Strut" use, the  
   shock absorber is built into the strut. Most shock absorber struts  
   are hydraulic units. Some MacPherson systems used on Ford vehicles  
   are equipped with low-pressure, gas-filled shock struts. They are  
   nonadjustable and nonrefillable. Like the hydraulic shock struts,  
   faulty units must be replaced as an assembly. Another similar  
   front suspension system is called the "hydraulic shock strut." This  
   strut serves as a shock absorber and replaces the upper control  
   arm. The coil spring, however, is located between the lower control  
   arm and the body structure instead of being mounted directly on the  
   strut.

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Steering Systems</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                            
  
  <P> The manual steering system incorporates: 1. steering wheel and  
   column, 2. a manual gearbox and pitman arm or a rack and pinion  
   assembly, 3. linkages; steering knuckles and ball joints; and 4. the  
   wheel spindle assemblies.   
  
  <P> In Pittman arm systems, the movement inside the steering box causes  
   the Pitman shaft and arm to rotate, applying leverage to the relay  
   rod, which passes the movement to the tie rods.   
  
  <P> Power steering systems add a hydraulic pump; fluid reservoir; hoses;  
   lines; and either a power assist unit mounted on, or integral with, a  
   power steering gear assembly.  
  
 <P>  There are several different manual steering gears in current use. The  
   "rack and pinion" type is the choice of most manufacturers. The  
   "recirculating ball" type is a past favorite because the balls act as  
   a rolling thread between the wormshaft and the ball nut. Another  
   manual steering gear once popular in imported cars is the "worm and  
   sector" type. Other manual gears are the "worm and tapered pin  
   steering gear" and the "worm and roller steering gear."   
  
  <P> The steering wheel and column are a major source of injury to the  
   driver, and a range of energy-absorbing and non-intrusion designs  
   have been developed. There is great variation in these designs, some  
   of which are now thought to be not fully effective.   
  
   <P>Energy-absorbing columns have to serve two functions. First, they  
   must stop the steering wheel and column from being pushed to the rear  
   as the front of the car is crushed in an impact. Before such designs  
   were invented, a common feature of driver injury was for the chest to  
   be impaled by the steering column. The energy-absorbing column must  
   also provide the driver with a tolerable impact as he moves forward  
   and strikes the wheel with his chest. At that point in the crash, the  
   column should build up the load on the driver's chest to a tolerable  
   level, and then deform under that load to give a "ride-down" for the  
   driver.  
  
  <P> Several design problems are presented in providing this system. One  
   major problem is that collapse of the column due to the frontal crush  
   of the car should not hinder its performance for providing ride-down  
   for the driver's chest. The system must also be so designed that  
   under crash conditions, the wheel stays in such a position that it  
   will strike the driver's chest and not move upwards into the region  
   of his face, or downwards into his abdomen.   
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Steering Linkage </B></FONT></CENTER>   
                            
  
 <P>  The steering linkage is made of interconnected parts which move every  
   time the steering wheel is turned. The rotating movement of the  
   steering column activates mechanisms inside the steering box. Tie rod  
   ends, which join the key parts, pass on the steering wheel's motion  
   no matter what the angle of the linkage or the vibration from the  
   road. In a pitman arm steering setup, the movement inside the  
   steering box causes the Pitman shaft and arm to rotate, applying  
   leverage to the relay rod, which passes the movement to the tie rods.  
   The steering arms pick up the motion from the tie rods and cause the  
   steering knuckles to  turn the wheels. The steering linkages need  
   regular maintenance for safe operation, such as lubrication and  
   inspection. Faulty steering links can cause tire wear at the least,  
   and complete loss of control of the vehicle at worst. "Popping"  
   noises (when turning the wheels) usually indicate worn out steering  
   linkages.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Rack and Pinion Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                      
  
 <P>  A typical rack and pinion steering gear assembly consists of a pinion  
   shaft and bearing assembly, rack gear, gear housing, two tie rod  
   assemblies, an adjuster assembly, dust boots and boot clamps, and  
   grommet mountings and bolts. When the steering wheel is turned, this  
   manual movement is relayed to the steering shaft and shaft joint, and  
   then to the pinion shaft. Since the pinion teeth mesh with the teeth  
   on the rack gear, the rotary motion is changed to transverse movement  
   of the rack gear. The tie rods and tie rod ends then transmit this  
   movement to the steering knuckles and wheels.

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Recirculating Ball Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                     
  
  <P> With the manual recirculating ball steering gear, turning forces are  
   transmitted through ball bearings from a "worm gear" on the steering  
   shaft to a sector gear on the pitman arm shaft. A ball nut assembly  
   is filled with ball bearings, which "roll" along grooves between the  
   worm teeth and grooves inside the ball nut. When the steering wheel  
   is turned, the worm gear on the end of the steering shaft rotates,  
   and movement of the recirculating balls causes the ball nut to move  
   up and down along the worm. Movement of the ball nut is carried to  
   the sector gear by teeth on the side of the ball nut. The sector gear  
   then moves with the ball nut to rotate the pitman arm shaft and  
   activate the steering linkage. The balls recirculate from one end of  
   the ball nut to the other through ball return guides.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Worm and Sector Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                      
  
 <P>  The manual worm and sector steering gear assembly uses a steering  
   shaft with a three-turn worm gear supported and straddled by ball  
   bearing assemblies. The worm meshes with a 14-tooth sector attached  
   to the top end of the pitman arm shaft. In operation, a turn of the  
   steering wheel causes the worm gear to rotate the sector and the  
   pitman arm shaft. This movement is transmitted to the pitman arm and  
   throughout the steering train to the wheel spindles.  
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Worm and Tapered Peg Steering </B></FONT></CENTER>   
                     
  
  <P> The manual worm and tapered peg steering gear has a three-turn worm  
   gear at the lower end of the steering shaft supported by ball bearing  
   assemblies. The pitman shaft has a lever end with a tapered peg that  
   rides in the worm grooves. When the movement of the steering wheel  
   revolves the worm gear, it causes the tapered peg to follow the worm  
   gear grooves. Movement of the peg moves the lever on the pitman shaft  
   which in turn moves the pitman arm and the steering linkage.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Worm and Roller Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                       
  
 <P>  The manual worm and roller steering gear is used by various  
   manufacturers. This steering gear has a three-turn worm gear at the  
   lower end of the steering shaft. Instead of a sector or tapered peg  
   on the pitman arm shaft, the gearbox has a roller assembly (usually  
   with two roller teeth) that engages the worm gear. The assembly is  
   mounted on anti-frictional bearings. When the roller teeth follow the  
   worm, the rotary motion is transmitted to the pitman arm shaft,  
   pitman arm and into the steering linkage.

        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                               
  
   <P>Over the years, power steering has become a standard equipment item  
   on many automobiles. The demand for this system has caused power  
   steering to be installed on over 90% of all domestic new car  
   production. All systems require a power steering pump attached to the  
   engine and driven by a belt, a pressure hose assembly, and a return  
   line. Also, a control valve is incorporated somewhere in the  
   hydraulic circuit. "Power steering" is really "power assisted  
   steering." All systems are constructed so that the car can be steered  
   manually when the engine is not running or if any failure occurs in  
   the power source.   
  
  <P> Most power steering pumps contain a flow control valve, which limits  
   fluid flow to the power cylinder to about two gallons per minute, and  
   a relief valve which limits pressure according to system demands.  
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Rack and Pinion</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                           
  
 <P> Power rack and pinion steering assemblies are hydraulic/ mechanical  
   unit with an integral piston and rack assembly. An internal rotary  
   valve directs power steering fluid flow and controls pressure to  
   reduce steering effort. The rack and pinion is used to steer the car  
   in the event of power steering failure, or if the engine (which  
   drives the pump) stalls.  
  
   <P>When the steering wheel is turned, resistance is created by the  
   weight of the car and tire-to-road friction, causing a torsion bar in  
   the rotary valve to deflect. This changes the position of the valve  
   spool and sleeve, thereby directing fluid under pressure to the  
   proper end of the power cylinder. The difference in pressure on  
   either side of the piston (which is attached to the rack) helps move  
   the rack to reduce turning effort. The fluid in the other end of the  
   power cylinder is forced to the control valve and back to the pump  
   reservoir. When the steering effort stops, the control valve is  
   centered by the twisting force of the torsion bar, pressure is  
   equalized on both sides of the piston, and the front wheels return to  
   a straight ahead position.  
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Integral Power Steering Gears</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                        
  
  <P>A representative of an integral power steering gear is used on  
   certain General Motors rear-wheel drive cars and on American Motors  
   four-wheel drive. This power steering gear uses a recirculating ball  
   system in which steel balls act as rolling threads between the  
   steering worm shaft and the rack piston. The key to its operation is  
   a rotary valve that directs power steering fluid under pressure to  
   either side of the rack piston. The rack piston converts hydraulic  
   power to mechanical force. The rack piston moves up inside the gear  
   when the worm shaft turns right. It moves down when the worm shaft  
   turns left. During these actions, the steel balls recirculate within  
   the rack piston, which is power assisted in movement by hydraulic  
   pressure. (See also Manual Recirculating Ball Steering)

        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Steering Hoses</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                           
  
  <P> The power steering hoses are used to transmit hydraulic fluid under  
   pressure from the pump to the power cylinder and to return. Besides  
   this, the hoses must provide the proper amount of expansion to absorb  
   any shock surge and offer enough restriction to the fluid flow to  
   keep the pump cavity full of fluid at all times.  
  
 <P>  Power steering hoses are specially designed rubber hoses with metal  
   fittings at each end which screw together with your power steering  
   system. They contain power steering fluid at high pressures, and  
   allow the system to circulate the fluids between the pump and the  
   power cylinders.

        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Tires</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                                  
  
   <P>A tire is a tubular corded carcass covered with rubber or synthetic  
   rubber, which is mounted on a wheel and inflated to provide traction  
   for moving a vehicle and for assisting the brakes in stopping it.  
   Today`s tires, when properly inflated, will absorb bumps on a road's  
   surface and give a safe, comfortable ride, while providing a  
   reassuring grip on the road at all speeds.  
  <P>
   There are two basic types of tire: the tubeless tire for passenger  
   cars and light-duty trucks; and those requiring inner tubes for  
   medium and heavy-duty trucks.   
  
 <P> 1830, Charles Goodyear experimented with turning raw rubber into a  
   more solid and useful product. He bought a load of raw rubber from a  
   shoe factory on credit and couldn't pay. He wound up in debtor's  
   prison and started his experiments. He finished his sentence, and  
   kept on experimenting.   
  
 <P>  In 1839, Goodyear invited some friends over to a fund-raiser for his  
   experiments. He showed them a ball of rubber that he had hardened on  
   the surface to prove to them that his experiments were worthy of  
   their money. At this point he accidentally threw the rubber ball into  
   the hot wood stove. While he was scraping the ball off with a knife,  
   he realized that the rubber had hardened into just the right texture.  
   This was the start of "vulcanization" and the rubber tire industry.  
  
   <P>Tires have changed a great deal since the 1950s. New rubber  
   components have been introduced into tire compounds which improve the  
   skid resistance. Recently new types have been developed to cope with  
   the dangers of sudden deflation. One of the most interesting of these  
   is a tire mounted on a relatively narrow wheel, so that the tire can  
   be run totally deflated without damage to the tire side walls. In  
   addition, the tire contains a special liquid which, when the tire is  
   run under the deflated condition, vaporizes and generates a pressure  
   so that the tire will partially reinflate.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Tire Types and Markings</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                        
  
  <P> Size, shape, materials, and construction are all factors that will  
   govern tires' longevity as well as the ride they furnish. The first  
   and most important rule in choosing tires is to follow the directions  
   and recommendations in the owner's manual. Check out the information  
   embossed on the sidewall as well. This information can help the owner  
   choose a set of tires that will suit both the car and the driver's  
   personal needs. The markings on a tire will give the weight (load),  
   size designation, serial number, tire type, carcass cords, DOT, and  
   profile size. Other markings on the tire will probably be the brand  
   name and the name of the tire.  
  
 <P> The "size designation" is a combination of one letter and four  
   numbers and is a three-part code.   
  
 <P>  The letter denotes the sidewall-to-sidewall width of the tire; the  
   two numbers grouped with the letter refer to the height-to-width  
   ratio; and the numbers following the dash indicate in inches the  
   diameter of the wheel rim the tire will fit. To replace the tire, the  
   own will find the sizes that will fit the car specified in the  
   owner's manual.  
  
  <P> As to "tire type," government regulations require that every  
   passenger tire be stamped either "tubeless" or "tube-type," but more  
   than 90% of the passenger cars are tubeless. "Belted" would indicate  
   that a tire has extra strength in its construction. In addition, if  
   the tire were a radial, it would be designated as such - a necessary  
   precaution because radials should not be mixed with other tire types  
   except when the radials are used as the pair on the rear axle.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Bias Ply Tires</B></FONT></CENTER>   
  <P>                             
   There are three general methods of arranging or laying down the tire  
   plies. They may be laid down "on the bias," "on the bias and belted,"  
   or "radially."  
  
  <P> The standard, and least expensive, tire is a bias ply. In this type  
   of ply, the cord strips are arranged diagonally (i.e., at a bias) to  
   the center line of the tread and alternate plies are reversed to  
   cross at a 30 or 40 degree angle. The result is a uniformly firm  
   body, which will wear satisfactorily at moderate speeds, with  
   sidewalls that can stand curb bruises. In fast driving or hard  
   turning, however, the tread elements squirm together and spring  
   apart, producing heat that weakens the tires.  
  
 <P> A veterinarian named John Dunlop in Belfast, Ireland gets credit for   
   inventing the pneumatic tire. In 1888 he tried making better tires   
   for his son's bicycle by using linen-covered sheet rubber. Although   
   he was granted a patent for bicycle and tricycle tires, he sold his   
   idea in 1889. The man he sold it to was named Harvey du Cros, Jr.,   
   who started the Dunlop Rubber Company. Dunlop himself was never part  
   of the company.

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Tire Rotation</B></FONT></CENTER>   
  
  
 <P>  The tire-rotation procedures charted below are not as difficult as  
   they seem. At any given time, only one chart will pertain to any car.  
   First find the number and type of tires you will be rotating.  Then  
   read down the column at the left. The top entry on the left is for  
   regular rotation without snow tires. The second and third rows are  
   for snow tire rotation. Remember, if radial tires are used in the  
   front, then the snow tires should be radial also. When storing tires,  
   it is a good idea to record its position on the inner face of each  
   one, using chalk or tape. This will help when remounting the tire.

 <P> The tire valve is really an air check that opens under air pressure  
   and closes when pressure is removed. The inner valve or "valve core,"  
   acts as a check valve for the air. Positive sealing is provided by  
   the "valve cap," which contains a soft rubber washer or gasket. It is  
   this gasket, pressed against the end of the "valve stem," that seals  
   the air in the tire. The careless practice of operating tires without  
   the valve cap should not be followed, because, without the valve cap  
   in place, there is usually a slow leak of air from the tire, causing  
   the tire to run in an underinflated condition. If air should leak out  
   around the base of the valve, it will be necessary to install a new  
   tire valve assembly. This is easily accomplished with a special  
   lever-type tool.

  <P> "Sprung" weight is a term used to describe the parts of an automobile  
   that are supported by the front and rear springs. They suspend the  
   vehicle's frame, body, engine, and the power train above the wheels.  
   These are quite heavy assemblies.  
  
  <P> The "unsprung" weight includes wheels and tires, brake assemblies,  
   the rear axle assembly, and other structural members not supported by  
   the springs.

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Sway Bar </B></FONT></CENTER>   
                                
  
  <P> Some cars require stabilizers to steady the chassis against front end  
   roll and sway on turns. Stabilizers are designed to control this  
   centrifugal tendency that forces a rising action on the side toward  
   the inside of the turn. When the car turns and begins to lean over,  
   the sway bar uses the upward force on the outer wheel to lift on the  
   inner wheel, thus keeping the car more level.  
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Control Arms  
</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                               
  <P> A control arm is a bar with a pivot at each end, used to attach   
   suspension members to the chassis.  
  
   <P>When coil springs are used in both front and rear suspension, three  
   or four control arms are placed between the rear axle housing and the  
   frame to carry driving and brake torque. The lower control arms pivot

 <P>  A "worm gear" is a shaft with very coarse thread, which is designed  
   to operate or drive another gear or a portion of a gear. The special   
   shape of the gear allows the rotation direction to be turned when the  
   gears engage with minimal friction.  
  
  <P> An example is found inside the steering box, where the steering shaft  
   turns a worm gear that is screwed into a large nut. The nut moves  
   back and forth on friction-reducing ball bearings, which are  
   continuously recirculated by dropping into the nut's bored channels  
   and emerging at the opposite side. Power to move the nut comes from  
   pressurized fluid entering from a pump through rotary valves that  
   open in response to the steering wheel. The worm gear engages the  
   cross shaft through a roller or by a tapered pin.

   <P>A Pitman shaft is a column extending from the steering sector, which  
   attaches to the Pitman arm, which moves the tie rods.  Depending on  
   the turn direction, the fluid from a pump moves a piston forward or  
   backward. This action moves a nut, which turns the Pitman shaft and  
   steering linkage. The movement inside the steering box causes the  
   Pitman shaft and arm to rotate, applying leverage to the relay rod,  
   which passes the movement to the tie rods.

</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                               
  <P> The key to the operation of power steering is a "rotary valve" that  
   directs power steering fluid under pressure to either side of the  
   rack piston. The rack piston converts hydraulic power to mechanical  
   force. Friction from the wheel causes a torsion bar in the rotary  
   valve to deflect. This changes the position of the valve spool and  
   sleeve, directing fluid under pressure to the proper end of the power  
   cylinder. The difference in pressure on either side of the piston  
   (which is attached to the rack) helps move the rack to reduce turning  
   effort.

  <P>
   The tubeless tire is designed so that the air is sealed within the  
   rim of the wheel and the tire casing. When an inner tube is used in  
   the tire casing, the air is contained within the tube, while the  
   casing is mainly used to protect the tube and provide traction. A  
   tubeless tire is composed of a carcass, sidewall, and tread.

  <P>The carcass is the entire tire structure except the sidewall and  
   tread. The carcass is made up of layers of cord materials such as  
   rayon, nylon, polyester, fiber glass, or steel wire strands. The  
   cords are laid parallel in layers and impregnated with rubber to form  
   plies.  
  
  <P> The foundation of a tire is a strong but resilient fabric carcass  
   made up of paired plies (or layers) of rubberized fibers called  
   cords. Whatever material the fibers are - nylon, polyester, rayon,  
   fiberglass, or steel strands - they must be identified under the  
   "carcass cords" identification. Polyester does not "flat spot" after  
   standing, as nylon does, causing temporarily bumpy rides; nor does it  
   deteriorate when wet, as rayon can do. Fiberglass, while not as  
   durable as steel, affords a smooth and quiet ride.

   <P>The "tread" is the portion of the tire that comes in contact with the  
   road. Treads are grooved traction surfaces around the circumference  
   of the tire. The grooves and ribs formed during the manufacturing  
   process are carefully engineered to provide good traction on wet and  
   dry roads, control when cornering, minimum distortion at high speeds,  
   reduced rolling resistance, and increased wear resistance. The  
   sidewall and tread material is applied after the plies have been  
   arranged and vulcanized in place.  The tread and tire are designed to  
   place the full width of the tread on the road when the tire is  
   properly inflated. The variety of tread patterns is very broad. In  
   fact, one publisher has produced a tread pattern identification guide  
   that illustrates over 3000 patterns.

   indicators are located in several positions around the circumference  
   of the tire. As long as the tread grooves are at least 1/16 deep, the  
   grooves are unbroken. When tread depth reaches that point, the tread  
   wear indicators will appear as solid strips across the tire. These  
   strips interrupt tread continuity and are clearly visible upon  
   inspection. The tire should be replaced when this occurs.

  <P> The body plies of belted-bias tires criss-cross diagonally, like  
   those of bias-ply tires, to ensure strong sidewalls. The added belts  
   are two or more cord strips that are cut on the bias and alternated,  
   in herringbone fashion, around the perimeter of the tire between the  
   body plies and the tread. Belts not only strengthen the tire against  
   impact and puncture damage, but also serve to stiffen the tread so  
   that it has less tendency to squirm on the road.

   plies. They may be laid down "on the bias," "on the bias and belted,"  
   or "radially."   
  
  <P> The body cords of radial tires run at right angles (radially) to the  
   center line of the treads; the belt cords are laid in a herringbone  
   pattern. The radial body cords allow sidewalls to flex so that the  
   tread maintains maximum surface contact with the road during turns,  
   whereas the stiff sidewalls of bias-type tires would lift the edges  
   of the tread. Radials are well suited to high-speed driving, but some  
   may produce noise or roughness at low speeds.   
  
   <P>A flat tire used to be expected on every journey in the early days of

   load-carrying and tire-pressure capacities are spelled out. A tire at  
   the maximum safe air pressure of 32 pounds per square inch can carry  
   up to 1,620 pounds. The total weight of a fully loaded car should not

  <P> Excessive or uneven tread wear results from underinflation, rapid  
   stops, fast acceleration, misalignment, and unbalanced conditions.   
   Road surface condition also affects tire life. Gravel roads and  
   rough-finished concrete will wear tires quickly. Smooth concrete and  
   asphalt surfaces aid in promoting maximum tire life. Normal wear  
   causes the tire tread to be reduced evenly and smoothly; but there  
   are several types of abnormal tire wear that should be avoided or  
   corrected.   
  
   <P>Abnormal wear includes: (1) spotty wear; (2) overinflation wear; (3)  
   underinflation wear; (4) toe-in wear; (5) toe-out wear; (6) camber  
   wear; and (7) cornering wear.  
  
  <P> When considering any tire tread wear condition and what caused it,  
   remember excessive or uneven wear usually results from a combination  
   of conditions. Tires wear at a different rate on all four wheels due  
   to driving conditions, weight of the vehicle, power on the driving  
   wheels, crown of the road, alignment of wheels, overloading the  
   vehicle, tire inflation, and probably most important of all, driving  
   habits of the person behind the steering wheel.  
  
  <P> Fast starts, quick stops, high speeds, and fast turns all take their  
   toll on tire life. Safe and conservative driving habits will promote  
   maximum tire life and economy.

  <P> Spotty wear results from a combination of conditions, including the  
   design of the tire tread. Underinflation and incorrect camber are the  
   main factors, along with toe-in and toe-out wear. Imbalance of the  
   wheel can also cause this problem.

  <P> Overinflation causes tires to wear excessively at the center of the  
   tread surface, and there is usually a little wear on the outer edges  
   of the tire. This causes early failure at the center ribs and breaks  
   in the tire sidewall.

  <P> Important in the ease of steering the car is the correct setting of  
   toe-in. Toe-in is a term used to specify the amount (in fractions of  
   an inch) that the front wheels are closer together in front that at  
   the rear, when measured at hub height. Precision testing equipment  
   and careful measurement and correction will prevent any slipping or  
   scuffing action between the tires and the road.   
  
  <P> If toe-in is incorrect, the tires will be dragged along the road,  
   scuffing and featheredging the treadribs. Changes in road or load  
   conditions will affect more than one steering angle, and uneven tread  
   wear patterns will result. Changes in road or load conditions will  
   affect more than one steering angle, and uneven tread wear patterns  
   will result. Also, toe-in will change when other angular adjustments  
   are made. Because of this, front wheel toe-in should be measured  
   first and uneven tread wear patterns corrected last on all wheel  
   alignment jobs.  
 <P>
   <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Toe-out Tread Wear</B></FONT></CENTER>                       
    
  
 <P>  It is obvious that driving conditions make it impossible to keep the  
   front wheels parallel at all times. Regardless of how accurately the  
   front wheels are positioned for straight ahead driving, they could be  
   out of their correct relative positions on turns. Considering that  
   the outside wheel is approximately five feet farther away from the  
   point about which the car is turning, it must turn at a lesser angle  
   and travel in a greater circle than the inside wheel. This condition  
   is called toe-out turns, which means that each front wheel requires a  
   separate turning radius to keep the inside tire from slipping and  
   scuffing on turns. Toe-out turns is the relationship between the  
   front wheels which allows them to turn about a common center. To  
   accomplish this, the steering arms are designed to angle several  
   degrees inside of the parallel position. The exact amount depends on  
   the tread and wheelbase of the car and on the arrangement of the  
   steering control linkage.  Unless toe-out is aligned correctly, the  
   tires will have a scrubbing action on the road surface. This will  
   produce a featheredge on the outer edges of the tread ribs.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Camber Tread Wear</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                            
 <P>  Too much camber (inward or outward tilt of the wheel at the top) will  
   produce wear on one side of the tire tread. If there is too much  
   positive camber, the tread wear will be on the outer ribs. If there  
   camber is negative, the wear will occur on the inner side of the tire  
   tread. If there is excessive wear on both inner and outer areas of  
   the tread, it probably was caused by too much skidding on turns.

      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheel Alignment</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                              
  
 <P>  Aligning a vehicle's front wheels is the job of balancing the  
   steering angles with the physical forces being exerted. The steering  
   angles are; caster, camber, toe-in, steering axis inclination, and  
   toe-out on turns. The physical forces are gravity, momentum,  
   friction, and centrifugal force. Since so many factors are involved  
   in front wheel alignment, it is also called front end alignment,  
   steering alignment, steering balance, or steering geometry. Alignment  
   is more than just adjusting the angularity of the front wheels. With  
   steadily increasing production of front wheel drive vehicles with  
   independent rear suspension, four wheel alignment is often required.   
  
  <P> For ideal wheel alignment, certain conditions would have to be met.  
   Both front tires will be the same brand, size, and type. Each will  
   have the same degree of tread wear, and be inflated with the same  
   pressure. Each wheel is properly and equally adjusted for angularity,  
   each tire will maintain the same area of tread contact on a smooth  
   road surface. Obviously, it is impossible to maintain all these  
   requirements.  
  
 <P>  The steering control rods are used to adjust toe-in and toe-out.  The  
   upper and/or lower control arms are adjusted to affect the camber  
   angle. Caster is usually not adjustable.  
  
  <P> With all the weight balance factors to be checked out and corrected,  
   it is obvious that wheel alignment is more than just an adjustment of  
   the steering angles. The whole theory of wheel alignment revolves  
   around balanced weight distribution on the wheels and proper tire  
   tread contact with the road surface while the vehicle is in motion.  
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheel Balance and Unbalance</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                        
  
  <P> It is important to check to see that the wheel and tire assemblies  
   are in balance before aligning the vehicle. "Static" balance is the  
   equal distribution of weight around the wheel and tire assembly.  
   "Dynamic" balance is the equal distribution of weight on each side of  
   the vertical centerline of the wheel and tire assembly.  
  
  <P> "Unbalance" (or imbalance) exists when the weight is distributed  
   unequally around the horizontal axis of the wheel and tire assembly.  
   Unbalance can exist in the tire, wheel, brake drum or rotor, or even  
   in the hub. It also occurs in any combination of these components.  
   Unbalance can be detected with the aid of special equipment, which  
   usually indicates the proper location for wheel weights to restore  
   the proper balance. Even with regular maintenance, however, uneven  
   tire wear can result from drivers' habits, such as side wear from  
   excessive cornering speeds. To counteract uneven wear that leads to  
   unbalance, the tire industry recommends that tires should be rotated  
   every six to eight thousand miles.

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Caster Alignment </B></FONT></CENTER>   
                             
  
  <P> Caster is the steering angle that uses the weight and momentum of the  
   car's chassis to lead the front wheel in a straight path. In wheel  
   alignment, caster is the backward tilt or the forward tilt of the  
   steering axis that tends to stabilize steering in a straight  
   direction. It places the weight of the vehicle either ahead of or  
   behind the area of tire-to-road contact. "Positive" caster is the  
   angular amount that the upper ball joint is farther back than the  
   lower joint. "Negative" caster is the condition when the upper ball  
   joint is farther ahead than the lower one. The "caster angle" is the  
   number of degrees (or fraction of a degree) that the steering axis is  
   tilted backward or forward from the vertical axis of the front  
   wheels.

  <P> "Static" balance is the equal distribution of weight around the  
   wheel and tire assembly. If the unbalance of a wheel lies in the  
   plane of wheel rotation, it is known as static (or kinetic)  
   unbalance. This condition causes the wheels to bounce. The wheel  
   lifts off the road, then slams down during each revolution. This  
   will result in flat spots on the tire tread and worn ball joints,  
   tie rod ends, steering gears, and shock absorbers. Bouncing could  
   also set up a heavy vibration in the chassis and affect the  
   steering balance.

       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Steering Balance</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                             
  
 <P> Steering control of a vehicle in motion is maintained by keeping the  
   vehicle's tires in close contact with the road surface. Tire to road  
   contact is influenced by the condition of the tire treads, tire  
   inflation, wheel balance, weight on the wheels, shock absorber  
   action, spring action, and wheel angularity. A balanced condition  
   between these elements will establish a perfect pivot point from  
   which the front wheels can rotate with the least friction. The point  
   on the tread of each front tire is the target of all steering angle  
   adjustments. Anything that tends to increase the area of tire tread  
   contact with the road will increase the rolling resistance, and the  
   car will steer to that side.  
  <P>
        <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Car Weight Balance  
</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                             
 <P>  One of the preliminary steps in wheel alignment is to check the  
   accuracy of attachment of the wheels to the vehicle. All ball joints,  
   control arm bushings and steering links must be in good condition in  
   order to properly align the wheels.  The frame must be checked to  
   see that it is not bent. The axles and wheels must be located  
   properly in relation to the frame or body. This involves making a  
   series of measurements to establish the parallel and right angle  
   relationships between the frame and wheels. The most important part  
   of this car weight balance relationship is a straight, undistorted  
   frame.  
  
 <P>rst, an accurate centerline must be established. Then, if straight  
   lines are drawn through the center of both rear axles and both front  
   spindle locations, they must be parallel to each other and form right  
   angles with the centerline of the frame. Next, when the wheels are  
   attached to the front spindles and rear axles, the rear wheels should  
   be parallel to the centerline of the frame.  Also, the front wheels  
   in their straight ahead position should be parallel to this line.  
   This is necessary so that each wheel will roll straight and true in  
   relation to the frame centerline.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheelbase Balance </B></FONT></CENTER>   
                            
  
 <P> Another important factor when locating axles and spindles for wheel  
   balance is the wheelbase measurement. Wheelbase is the distance  
   between the center of the front wheel and center of the rear wheel.  
   This distance (left front to left rear, right front to right rear  
   with wheels in the straight ahead position) must be exactly the same  
   on each side for proper weight balance. Correct wheelbase contributes  
   to the ability of the car's rear wheel to follow directly in line  
   with the front wheels (called "track").  Shorter wheelbases allow  
   sharper turning radiuses, and longer wheelbases give a smoother ride  
   and increased stability.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Tread Width in Wheel Balance</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                        
  
 <P> Tread width is a key measurement with respect to weight balance and  
   rear wheel track. Tread width is the distance between the center  
   points of the left tire tread and right tire tread as they come in  
   contact with the road. While the front and rear wheels may have  
   different tread widths, each front wheel must be the same distance  
   from the centerline of the frame and each rear wheel must be the same  
   distance from the centerline. This parallel relationship establishes  
   a balance between the front and rear, and between the right and left.  
   While this balance may not mean true equal weight at these points, it  
   does mean that a balanced distribution of weight and stress has been  
   acquired for the proper setting of front wheel angles.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Rear Wheel Track Alignment </B></FONT></CENTER>   
                       
  
  <P>The rear end is secured by a number of control arms, making it  
   possible for the unit to move up and down, but not side to side.  
   These arms can usually be adjusted, allowing the rear end to be   
   aligned with the rest of the car.  
  
   The growing popularity of front wheel drive and four wheel drive  
   vehicles has sharply increased the need for correct alignment of all  
   four wheels. In fact, some designs require "camber" and "toe-in"  
   adjustments on all four wheels. The four wheel alignment is required  
   so that correct rear wheel track is established.   
  
 <P>  The front wheels steer the vehicle, but the rear wheels direct it.   
   The rear wheels determine the "thrust line" which, in effect, is the  
   rear rolling direction. When the thrust line is made to agree with  
   the vehicle frame's centerline (by aligning front and rear wheels and  
   centering the steering wheel), correct rear wheel track will be  
   achieved. An out-of-line condition not caused by an accident usually  
   can be traced to a mechanical defect or sag due to stress in the  
   middle or corner of the frame. A frame that is out of line must be  
   straightened before it is possible to get correct steering alignment.  
 <P>The frame rails must be the same height from the floor on each side  
   at the spring seats, along with the essential parallel and right  
   angle relationships.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Weight Balance on The Springs</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                       
  
  <P> The springs control the up-and-down motion of the car and so, the  
   height of the car above the road. If one or more of the springs is  
   collapsed or broken, it causes an unbalanced distribution of weight.  
   This unbalance creates a lopsided appearance, puts an added strain on  
   the related parts, and changes the angularity of the front wheels.  
   This condition may also occur when the load is distributed unequally.  
   In fact, anything that changes the ratio of weight on the springs  
   will have a definite bearing on the alignment angles and on the area  
   of tire-to-road contact. This can wear tires unevenly, making it  
   necessary to replace them prematurely.  
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Shock Absorbers in Wheel Alignment</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                    
  
  <P> The shock absorbers are important in controlling the up-and-down  
   motion of a moving vehicle. Efficient shock absorber action aids  
   wheel alignment by furnishing a dampening effect that protects the  
   springs from sudden overloading or unloading action. If the shock  
   absorbers are not functioning properly, the car will bounce too much  
   and steering angles will change to damaging extents. Sometimes  
   steering angles will check out correctly on the alignment equipment,  
   yet the car will not handle well on the road.  This problem could  
   also be caused by faulty springs or shock absorbers, worn parts in  
   the steering gear or front suspension system, driving conditions, or  
   the habits of the driver.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Front Wheel Alignment</B></FONT></CENTER>   
   
 <P>  The angles involved in front wheel alignment are caster, camber,  
   toe-in, steering axis inclination, and toe-out on turns. They refer  
   to the tilt of the wheels and steering axis. These angles govern the  
   way the front wheels behave while the vehicle is in motion.  Balance  
   is a large part of the picture. The goal is a balanced relationship  
   of the steering angles, with due regard for road and load factors  
   involved in each individual case.  
  
 <P>  Some early cars used a tiller instead of a steering wheel. To turn  
   the wheels, you really had to pay attention. Turning the tiller to  
   the left turned the car to the right, and vice versa.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Camber Alignment</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                             
  
  <P>Camber is the inward or outward tilt of the wheel at the top. It is  
   built into the wheel spindle by forming the spindle with a downward  
   tilt to provide positive camber. Steering axis inclination is the  
   inward tilt of the steering knuckle. It is so interrelated with the  
   camber that they share a common side (vertical axis of the wheel).  
  
      <P>
      
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Steering Axis Inclination</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                       
 <P>  Steering axis inclination is the inward tilt of the steering  
   knuckle. It is so interrelated with the camber that they share a  
   common side (vertical axis of the wheel). With the steering axis  
   tilted inward (inclined), the end of the spindle will form an arc  
   that is lower in the extreme turn position than in the center or  
   straight ahead position. In normal operation, the weight of the car  
   prevents the spindle from moving up and down. Therefore, the car is  
   forced upward when the front wheels are turned, and the force of  
   gravity tends to straighten the wheels. In this way, the weight of  
   the car helps to provide an automatic steering effect brought about  
   by accurate adjustment of the steering angles.   
  
  <P> The combination of the camber tilt and the steering axis inclination  
   forms an important junction that is known as the "included angle."  
   The purpose of this two-angle team is to place the turning point of  
   the wheel at the center of the tire tread contact area to reduce the  
   scuff area to a minimum. The benefits of additional alignment becomes  
   apparent when some of the troubles caused by misalignment are seen;  
   these include: hard steering, wander, pull to one side, and unequal  
   or excessive tire wear.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>MacPherson Strut  
</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                          
  <P> In MacPherson Struts, the shock absorber is built into the strut. The  
   strut consists of a shock absorber unit, a coil spring, an upper  
   pivot, and a lower clamp. The upper pivot mounts to the fenderwell.  
   The rest of the unit rotates when the steering is used. The lower  
   clamp secures the spindle and the strut together into a solid unit.   
   Most shock absorber struts are hydraulic units. Some use  
   low-pressure, gas to absorb energy. These are usually nonadjustable  
   and nonrefillable.  Like the shock absorber, faulty units must be  
   replaced as an assembly.   
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheel Lugs  
</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                              
  
  <P> Wheel lugs are the large bolts that go through the wheel rim and  
   secure it to the wheel hub. They are pressed into the hub from the  
   inboard side so they cannot pull out when tightened.  The Lug nuts  
   thread onto the wheel lugs, clamping the wheel rim between the hub  
   and lug nuts.  It is extremely important that the wheel lug nuts are  
   securely tightened! If they are not -- your wheel will come off!  
   Over- tightening is also a bad idea; it can prevent you from being   
   able to change a flat tire.   
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Grease Fittings  
</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                              
  <P> Grease fittings are mounted to almost all of the moving parts of the  
   suspension. They are used to add grease to bushings, pivot points,  
   tie rods, ball joints and even universal joints on some cars (not  
   usually). When you have your car's chassis lubricated, the grease  
   fittings are where the grease is put into during the lubrication  
   process.  
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Grease Cap</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                                 
  
 <P>  A grease cap is a small sheet metal part that is mounted over the   
   wheel bearing, that contains the grease that the wheel bearing has on  
   it. It protects the wheel bearing from dust and dirt. The grease cap  
   is removed in order to unscrew the nut that holds the rotor and the  
   bearings on. These are not used on front wheel drive cars, since  
   their bearings are usually the sealed type.  
  <P>
      <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheels</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                                  
  
  <P>Wheels come in many different designs and usually fall into two  
   categories: stamped sheet metal and machine castings. Some wheels are  
   a combination of the two.  
  
   <P>Usually cast alloy wheels are higher priced, but have greater   
   strength than stamped sheet metal wheels. Stamped sheet metal wheels  
   are the most common, because they are less expensive to produce and  
   are adequate for most uses. Some cars have wire wheels which consist  
   of three basic components; inner rings, outer rings, and a series of  
   spokes which connect the two. Cast aluminum wheels are very popular,  
   magnesium wheels are also popular. Both are popular because they are  
   light-weight and strong.  
  <P>
       <CENTER> <FONT SIZE=4><B>Suspension Computer</B></FONT></CENTER>   
                            
  
  <P> The suspension computer allows the suspension system to adapt to  
   changes in road conditions (smooth or bumpy).   
  
 <P>  A suspension computer works continually to work out the best  
   compromise for the car's stability and comfort. Position sensors at  
   all four wheels determine whether the car is riding smoothly or  
   jouncing up and down on a rough road. The computer adjusts the air  
   shocks in the wheels by giving electronic instructions.  
  
 <P> The computer can give instructions directly to each of the air shocks.  
   A position sensor is attached to the suspension system at each wheel.  
   These sensors convert the up and down motion into a signal into an   
   electrical signal that is sent to the suspension computer. The  
   computer signals the compressor to pump more air into each air shock.  
   The air expands a bladder in the shock and increases its stiffness.  
   This helps the shock to resist bumps. When the road is smooth again,  
   the computer signals a valve at the top of the shock to open and let  
   air out of the bladder.

Cleaner Gasoline Has Come To Your Part of the Country</h1></center>
Reformulated gasoline (RFG) is one of our nation's most important strategies to
reduce pollution from motor vehicles. On January 1, 1995, you found cleaner, or
"reformulated," gasoline at local service stations if you live in those parts
of the country with the worst ozone air pollution problems. Also, some areas
with less serious problems have elected to use it. Others may do so in the
future.<P>

Reformulated gasoline is just conventional gasoline blended to burn more
cleanly and not evaporate as easily. The U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency
has been working cooperatively with the petroleum and auto industries to make
sure this new gasoline fully meets the needs of the American motorist. <P>

Cleaner gasoline is waiting for you at the pump.<P>

This means there will be less smog-forming ground-level ozone to damage
sensitive lung tissue and make it harder for the lungs to function. When the
noxious ozone level is high, joggers, people working or exercising outdoors, or
people with various chronic health conditions or lung diseases may suffer
symptoms such as chest pain, coughing, and stinging eyes.<P>

Air toxics from tailpipe emissions or gasoline vapors also can be harmful. Some
of the toxic compounds in gasoline (benzene, for one) and compounds created
when gasoline is burned in the engine are known or believed to cause cancer. In
fact, motor vehicles are estimated to account for roughly 50% of all cancers
associated with exposure to air toxics.<P>

<i>Using reformulated gasoline reduces the total health risk to the public by
reducing exposure to ozone and air toxics.</i><P>

<i></i>Reformulated gasoline will have no adverse affects on vehicle
performance or the durability of engine and fuel system components, not even
for high performance engines. In fact, the nation's major auto manufacturers
support - even recommend -  the use of reformulated gasoline. If you travel to
a conventional gasoline area, you can fill up without any harm to your car.<P>

Reformulated gasoline contains oxygenate additives that have been used in a
significant amount of gasoline since the 1970's. Gasolines containing
oxygenates may reduce gas mileage by 1 to 2 percent. Gas mileage is affected
mostly by the type of engine and vehicle, driving habits, weather conditions,
and vehicle maintenance. So, changing your driving habits and vehicle
maintenance pattern could balance it out.<P>

Using reformulated gasoline will not affect either the manufacturer's general
warranty or the emissions warranty. For information on warranty provisions, see
your vehicle owner's manual or consult a local auto dealer.<P>

 Recently, EPA has had discussions with various manufacturers of off-road
engines (motorcycles, boats, recreational equipment, and lawn equipment) who
have confirmed that using oxygenated fuels is acceptable, although some
manufacturers offer special instructions when operating equipment on oxygenated
fuels. While manufacturers' recommendations vary for the type of oxygenate that
should be used in various applications, a report published in November, 1994 by
Downstream Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of Bremen, Indiana, revealed that most
off-road engine manufacturers permit the use of oxygenated fuels not to exceed
10% ethenol or 15% methyl tertiary butyl ether 9MTBE) by volume.<P>

RFG will cost a few cents more per gallon than conventional gasoline, but its a
small price to pay for cleaner air and a healthy environment. So . . . now that
cleaner gas is here, use it to protect your health.

<H1></h1></center></head><body>If you live in an area that
has had some type of emission testing for the last several years, you are in a
part of the country the EPA calls a non-attainment area.  A non-attainment area
is simply a metropolitan area that has levels of carbon monoxide and/or ozone
that is greater than EPA standards.<P>

The EPA has five levels of non-attainment: Moderate, Marginal, Serious, Severe,
and Extreme.  The level of non-attainment will determine the type of emission
testing required.  The two lower areas will require a basic emission inspection
and the three worst areas will require an enhanced emission inspection, or as
the EPA refers to it, High-Tech IM240.<P>

If you take your car in for an emission inspection now it is most likely a
basic inspection, and there is a very good likelihood that in about a year you
will be required to start going through the High-Tech IM240 inspection.<P>

Should you be concerned about this enhanced test?  Not if you have followed the
carmaker's maintenance recommendations and kept all of the emissions control
devices in proper working order, changed the oil regularly and used the correct
type of gasoline.  However, if vehicle maintenance is not very high on your
list of priorities or any of the emission control devices on your car have been
removed or rendered inoperative, or you have been using leaded gasoline, your
car will fail the High-Tech IM240 test.<P>

This emissions test is very sophisticated.  Cars are driven through a 4 minute
driving cycle on a chassis dynamometer.  During which time all of the exhaust
that comes out of the tailpipe is run through a special analyzer and the amount
of air that flows through the vapor storage system is measured.  After the
driving test is done the vapor storage system is pressurized and checked for
leaks.<P>

When the enhanced test is in full swing about 100 million cars will be tested.
I have seen projections that anywhere from 30 to 70 million cars will fail the
new test.  Many cars that are barely squeaking by the basic test now will fail
the enhanced test.  And many cars that appear to breeze through the basic test
will fail because the enhanced test checks the vehicle under driving loads,
measures for pollution never before tested and thoroughly tests the vapor
storage system.  The vapor storage system has never been tested to this level
before and it is the most neglected emission system on your car.  If you go
through the High-Tech IM240 test with the gas cap loose it will fail.  Of
course tightening a loose gas cap would be a cheap repair.  The enhanced test
will also find EGR valves and catalytic converters that aren't working and now
you are talking several hundred dollars.<P>

By now I hope it's clear why I said earlier that car owners who followed the
carmakers maintenance recommendations will have an excellent chance of passing
the enhanced test.  Vehicle manufacturers must design and build a car that will
meet emission standards set forth by the government.  Manufacturers also must
demonstrate that the cars can be operated for many thousands of miles and with
proper maintenance, stay within mandated emission levels.  All the knowledge
that the manufacturers acquire regarding maintenance during emissions
certification testing is in the owners manual buried under the maps in the
glove box.<P>

Why is the EPA pushing this enhanced test on us?  The bottom line is simple.
The current emissions testing is not doing the job.  If the High-Tech IM240
test doesn't do the job the next step will be severe restrictions on stationary
polluters (power plants), restricted use of our cars and/or an emissions tax on
the gasoline we use.  Any or all of these options will cost us alot of money.
The least expensive way out of this problem is to maintain our vehicles
properly.<P>

What is the IM240 and Why Should Car Owners Learn More About This
Program?</h1></center>
If you are one of the millions of people who take their car in to be tested
every year or two to see if its emissions controls are up to snuff, then you're
already familiar with the main topic of this article--vehicle inspection and
maintenance or I/M programs. <br>I/M programs are necessary because even cars
with elaborate pollution control systems can have those systems go bad, either
as a result of poor maintenance, simple aging, or active (and illegal)
tampering. You might think that since I/M programs are already in place in many
areas that the problem is solved. Not so. The trouble is that the idle
emissions test that many states operated in the 1980's and which many still
operate today, was designed to be just good enough for making pass/fail
decisions on relatively low-tech cars. These tests are less effective when it
comes to testing vehicles made and sold after 1981, which marks the
introduction of stricter standards and more sophisticated pollution controls,
including elaborate fuel metering systems, feedback controls, and onboard
computers. Some of the shortcomings of the idle test include the fact that it
test cars at only one or two speeds, and without any simulation of real world
road conditions. For pre-1981 vehicles, this wasn't much of a problem because a
pre-1981 car clean at idle was probably clean across the board; post-1981 cars,
however, constantly readjust themselves based upon different driving modes, and
so a post-1981 car that seems clean at idle can actually be a gross polluter
whenever it accelerates or decelerates. As a result, the idle test sometimes
passes cars that should be failed, and fails cars that should pass. Another
problem is that the idle test cannot measure oxides of nitrogen (NOx) which
along with hydrocarbon emissions contribute significantly to ozone (smog)
production. <P>

The IM240 was designed to correct all these problems. It has been introduced in
several states and other states are considering its use. As a car owner, you
should be asking how this new variety of I/M program may affect you and your
family and how it can help you improve our nation's air quality. This article
will give you the facts:  Why the new program was introduced, how
cost-effective it is, and the experience in two states, Colorado and Arizona,
where the new program has been in effect since January, 1995.
<h3>
BACKGROUND</h3>
The IM240 was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help
reduce ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) pollution. Cars give off gasoline  fumes,
called hydrocarbons (HC), which mix with NOx in sunlight to form ozone. Ozone
damages lung tissues, aggravates respiratory disease, and makes people more
susceptible to respiratory infections. It is also very damaging to building
materials. CO, which also comes from cars, affect individuals with respiratory
problems and impairs visual perception, manual dexterity and learning
functions. While both the idle test and the IM240 were designed to detect high
emitters of these pollutants they measure these pollutants differently. Unlike
the idle test, the IM240 measures emissions while the vehicle is driven on a
treadmill-like device called a dynamometer, which serves to simulate real world
driving conditions. The test measures all important pollutants including HC,
CO, and NOx. It also measures fuel economy and generates diagnostic information
that helps in the repair process for vehicles that fail the test. Using the
diagnostic output of the IM240, repair technicians can more accurately
determine what is wrong with your car leading to less pollution from your
vehicle and reducing the time and money you spend on repairs.
<h3>
THE IM240 TEST</h3>
The actual IM240 test is fully automated and begins with a trained inspector
driving your vehicle onto the dynamometer. The vehicle is restrained, an
exhaust collection device is fitted onto the exhaust, and a cooling fan placed
in front of the engine. The inspector "drives" the vehicle, rather like
"driving" a car on a video racing game, and consists of applying the
accelerator and brakes according to a prescribed cycle displayed on a
computerized video screen. The cleaner the car, the shorter the test. The
maximum test-time is four minutes (which is where the 240 in IM240 comes from),
but the average test time is about two minutes. Car owners may worry that there
could be some damage to their car, but this rarely occurs. A thorough safety
inspection is made on cars prior to the test and the driving operation of the
vehicle during the test is probably no more severe than what the vehicle
experiences on its drive to the test location.
<h3>
IM240-THE COLORADO EXPERIENCE</h3>
Colorado has been a leader in inspection/maintenance since the early 1980's.
The development of the IM240 was inspired by this state's development of a
transient loaded test similar to the IM240.  Colorado designed its own I/M
program to combat the high CO pollution in the Denver-metro area and reduce
emissions in areas around the state.  In January, 1995, Colorado began the
high-tech IM240 program to test car models 1982 and older in Boulder and the
Denver-metro area while operating idle tests in the less polluted areas of
Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and Greeley.<P>

Colorado has reported that its IM240 program is working smoothly.  For the past
fifteen years, Colorado has been in violation of the health-based air quality
standards for carbon monoxide (CO).  The graph below shows that the IM240 test
is expected to reduce CO emissions from motor vehicles by 31% well as
hydrocarbons by 28% and oxides of nitrogen by 9%.  Data from 53,700 IM240 tests
indicate that this is a realistic estimate.The data also indicates that IM240
is doing a much better job than the idle test.  The average failed vehicle
emitted 81 grams of CO per mile (the typical new car standard is about 3.5
grams/mile).  After test and repair, the average vehicle emitted less than 33
grams of CO per mile, representing a reduction in CO emissions by 59%.  By
contrast, data on the idle test showed that on average, CO was reduced by only
13% (see graph above).
<h3>
MOTORISTS REACTION IN COLORADO</h3>
A survey of 200 motorists in Colorado showed that most motorists were very
aware of the air pollution problems.  Most supported the program because it
could effectively reduce pollution.  A high percentage also supported the
program because the repair shop and test facility are under separate ownership
thereby limiting the potential of selling unnecessary repairs.  Those who
objected to the program, however, felt that it was too expensive.  In fact, the
IM240 typically costs motorists less than the idle test program.  In Colorado,
the price of the new IM240 test is $25 for a test every two years compared with
$20 for the idle test which was needed every year.
<h3>
THE IM240 PROGRAM IN ARIZONA</h3>
Arizona has been cited as having one of the better inspection/maintenance
programs in the country.  A facility that had separate test sites and repair
shops was chosen as a way to limit the potential for fraudulent repairs.  Their
IM240 was implemented in January, 1995 for car models 1981 and older in the
Phoenix-metro area.  A combination of loaded and idle tests were chosen for the
less polluted Tucson area.<P>

Results in Arizona confirm that the IM240 is doing a great job in identifying
the high emitting vehicles and helping determine what is wrong with the
vehicle.  88% of cars passed and 13% failed the IM240 in the first four months
of testing 232,823 vehicles.  Of the vehicles that failed, 59% passed the test
the first time after repairs were made.
<h3>
REPAIR COSTS</h3>
Most car owners will be concerned about the cost of repairs if their vehicle is
identified as high emitting.  The average repair cost for a car in Arizona
ranged from $15 for 1994 cars to $193 for 1989 cars.  Cars that are pre-1981
cost less, on average, to fix than cars post-1981.<P>

A few tips may help car owners reduce repair costs:  it is better to fix the
car as soon as possible because high emissions are usually a sign of some other
problem with the car which, if left, may become worse and eventually cost more
to repair.  Also, at many test centers, a booklet is available which lists
registered repair shops where program staff have worked with repair technicians
to identify cost-effective ways to identify and repair the failures.<P>

What's New In Alternative Fuel Vehicles</h1></center>
The environment is a hot topic now and probably will be for years to come.
Automobiles have typically received the brunt of the criticism aimed at heavy
polluters.  But automobile manufacturers have made enormous strides in the past
few years in the design and development of more "environmentally friendly"
vehicles, commonly called alternative fuel vehicles or AFVs.<P>

Flexible-fuel vehicles, or FFVs, which use a combination of gasoline and
methanol, are in use now and provide a fairly convenient, low-cost alternative.
FFVs are powered by a conventional engine with minor modifications.<P>

Natural gas vehicles, or NGVs, also use a conventional engine and can burn
cleaner than a flexible-fuel vehicle but require more substantial changes to
the engine and vehicle fuel system for optimal performance.<P>

Electric vehicles, or EVs, run on batteries and produce zero vehicle emissions
but require the greatest degree of vehicle modification.<P>

So if they're so much better for the environment, why isn't everybody driving
an alternative fuel vehicle?  Well, it's not that easy.<P>

So far, none of the AFVs match the performance, cost and convenience of
gasoline-powered vehicles.<P>

FFVs use methanol, a fuel commonly used in high-powered race cars, which give
them even more horsepower than conventional gasoline engines.  However, except
for parts of California, methanol pumps are few and far between, which poses
problems for commuters.  FFV's cost more than conventional vehicles. . . but
less than the other alternatives.<P>

NGV's require special equipment for refueling and about 5-8 minutes to refill.
There exists the possibility to refuel at home, using a compressor on the
household natural gas outlet.<P>

Electric vehicles also pose the biggest problems in terms of cost and
convenience.  Acceleration puts the biggest power drain on an EV and fast,
repeated, standing starts can shorten the vehicle's range.  Recharging an EV's
battery can take up to 8 hours for maximum range and may have to be done at
night to avoid building more power plants.  EV's are also the most expensive of
the AFV's because they must have their high-cost batteries replaced after a
fixed number of charges.<P>

Despite the obstacles, most automobile manufacturers have an alternative fuel
vehicle program in place.  General Motors plans to introduce its electric car,
the Impact, in 1995.  Ford Motor Company plans to sell Flexible Fuel Tauruses
in California and has plans for several fleets of electric vehicles for
operation at utility companies around the country later this year and early
next year.  Nissan is currently at work on an electric vehicle that can
recharge 100 percent in 15 minutes.<P>

Even though gasoline is not problem free, it provides efficient transportation
for millions.  The engines that use it are light, powerful and dependable and
over the years have reduced their emissions to very low levels.  It will be a
significant achievement for any alternative fuel to improve on their
performance and affordability.  Reformulated gasoline is an alternative you can
be using today.  It has considerable potential for reducing smog-producing
emissions.<P>

The transition from today's gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles to tomorrow's
alternative fuel vehicles has potential to reduce our country's dependence on
foreign oil, contribute to ongoing clean air efforts and reduce the level of
harmful ozone formed in the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.<P>

In the near future, you may be faced with the decision to purchase an
alternative fuel vehicle (AFV).  I urge you to become familiar with the future
choices for alternative fuels and vehicles.  It may mean a better, cleaner
world for us and future generations.<P>

Proper Vehicle Maintenance</h1></center>
Efforts by government and industry since 1970, when the Clean Air Act was first
enacted, have greatly reduced typical vehicle emissions.  However, despite the
increased technology of emission control devices used on modern vehicles, and
the ever-more-stringent emission standards established by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), motor vehicles still account for the
majority of air pollution in the nation.<P>

Unfortunately, since 1970 the number of cars on the road and miles driven have
nearly doubled.  As a result, much of the progress we have made in decreasing
emissions output and improving air quality has been offset by this increase in
vehicles and vehicle miles traveled (VMT).  Although emission control
technology continues to improve, that alone will not solve our air quality
problems.  It is time that all citizens evaluate their contributions to air
pollution and take the necessary steps for reducing their contribution.
Besides driving less, proper vehicle maintenance is one of the most important
steps you can take in reducing harmful emissions from your vehicle and cleaning
up our air.<P>

Although vehicle manufacturers are required by law to certify that a vehicle
will meet emissions standards for its useful life, the ability of a vehicle to
do so depends largely on proper maintenance of the vehicle by the vehicle
owner; that is, having scheduled maintenance performed as recommended by the
manufacturer.  Proper maintenance will not only keep your car from being an
excessive polluter, it will increase the running life of your car and may
eliminate the need for costly repairs down the road.  In addition, failure to
properly perform scheduled maintenance may void your vehicle's emissions
warranty, decrease gas mileage and detract from its resale value.  To prevent
this from happening, when you take your vehicle in for scheduled maintenance,
or if you do it yourself, be sure that you or the mechanic follow the
manufacturer's recommendations for service as found in your owner's manual or
warranty booklet.<P>

Along with proper vehicle maintenance, another method for reducing motor
vehicle pollution is reducing the amount of time you drive your vehicle.  This
can be accomplished by consolidating trips, carpooling, and using mass transit
or alternative forms of transportation such as biking or walking.  Any method
of transportation that reduces the amount of time you spend behind the wheel
will also reduce air pollution and improve the quality of the air you breathe.
In addition, leaving your car idling for a long period of time releases
unnecessary pollutants into the atmosphere and is illegal in some cities.
Turning the car off and restarting it uses less gas than idling does, and you
are also polluting less.<P>

The sources of air pollution are not limited to highway vehicles and factories.
The EPA has determined that emissions from off-road vehicles and engines such
as lawnmowers, chainsaws, generators, construction and farm equipment, marine
vehicles and aircraft are also significant contributors to the nation's air
quality problem.  Therefore, performing regular maintenance on your lawn and
garden equipment is another effective step you can take in reducing your
contribution to air pollution.  EPA is currently drafting regulations to
control air pollution from these sources.  Depending on the technology
developed for controlling emissions from these sources, it may not be long
until you have a catalytic converter on your lawnmower.<P>

Remember you are the key to reducing motor vehicle air pollution.  Proper
vehicle and equipment maintenance will not only extend the running life of your
car or equipment, but also improve air quality, which is critical for life to
exist on Earth.<P>

Do You Really Want Clean Air?</h1></center>
<address><i>By Larry W. Yeager, Director, Technical Services BWD Automotive
Corporation</i></address><P>
Does it concern you that according to the Center for Disease Control there has
been a 40 percent increase in asthma-related illnesses in the last decade?<P>

Does it concern you that the American Lung Association says that about 23.8
million children and more than 14 million elderly are at risk from airborne
pollutants because they live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution?<P>

Do you know that vehicles account for about 50% of the air pollution problem?
<P>

Do you know that the vehicle population increases by 4 million cars per year?
<P>

Do you know that the number of miles that we drive per year doubled in the last
ten years?<P>

Why have I asked these questions?  It is to make you aware of the fact that if
you drive a car you are contributing to the air pollution problem we face.  If
you are part of the problem, shouldn't you be part of the solution?
<h3>
What is the solution?  The answer is simple.  </h3>
<ol>
<li>Proper vehicle maintenance.  Keeping your vehicle in proper  running
condition based  on the recommendations found in your owners manual. 
<li>Be willing to accept an enhanced emissions test once every two years to
confirm that your car is in compliance with federal emission
standards.</ol>Current language in the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 requires
a 28% reduction in airborne pollutants by the year 2000.  The EPA designed a
test called IM240 that if implemented in the areas with the worst air quality
the reduction requirements could be met at the lowest cost per ton of pollution
removed.<P>

IM240 is an enhanced emissions test where the vehicle is driven on a chassis
dynamometer following a drive cycle that includes various acceleration rates,
cruise speeds and deceleration rates.  During the 240 second drive cycle the
tailpipe emissions are measured in grams per mile.<P>

Acceleration Simulation Mode (ASM) testing is another type of enhanced
emissions test.  This test run on a chassis dynamometer at fixed speed and load
for a minimum of 30 seconds and tailpipe emissions are measured in percent.<P>

Both IM240 and ASM testing have been proven to be much more effective in
identifying vehicles with excessive emissions.  IM240 and ASM testing can
identify 40% more excess emissions than a combination of idle and 2500 RPM
tests currently used by many states today.<P>

Maine was the first state to implement IM240 in July of 1994.  Keep in mind
that Maine had no emission testing at all prior to July of 1994.  Complaints
about long lines, damage to vehicles and high cost to repair surfaced rapidly.
The press, of course, concentrated on only one negative issue and many people
who had never been to the test signed a petition to stop the testing.  The EPA
came in, audited the inspection process and other than a few new system start
up glitches gave the Maine inspection program a clean bill of health.  Some
experts say that Maine did a poor job of educating the public about benefits of
the emissions testing.<P>

The fallout from Maine spread like wildfire.  Other states considering IM240
began to reconsider.  The EPA tried to enforce the implementation of IM240 by
threatening to withhold road repair funds from the states who did not comply.
A group of governors complained to Washington.  This prompted a letter from
President Clinton to Carol Browner, head of the EPA.  The President asked the
EPA to backoff and reconsider what the states were proposing in lieu of IM240.
Of course, the EPA announced a program that would be much more flexible.<P>

In spite of the fact that IM240 is working very well in Colorado and Arizona
the new Republican controlled Congress has bills before it that could
completely gut the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 and leave the EPA virtually
powerless.  Because of the complaints of a few and the desire of the
Republicans to reduce the size of government.  But remember this, air pollution
does not recognize state boundaries.  Air pollution from one state can be
carried by prevailing winds to another state.  So it seems that one standard
for all will insure clean air for everybody.  When the health of generations to
come is at stake the idea of a federal agency (EPA) charged with the
responsibility of maintaining the quality of our environment is an absolute
must.<P>

If you care about your health and the health of your children and your
children's children, I suggest that you contact your Senator and Congressman
and let them know that you want clean air.  Tell them we need to keep the
current language in the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 and all states that
don't meet the national ambient air quality standard must comply with stricter
emissions testing proven to reduce pollution levels.  If you are part of the
problem you should be part of the solution.<P>

CCAR:  An Industry Program That Benefits the Motorist</h1></center>
<address><i>Mr. Sherman Titens, President</i></address><P>
<h2>
Coordinating Committee for Automotive Repair (CCAR)</h2>
Have you had to make an appointment for auto service lately? You may have
waited several days or longer, largely because of a shortage of technicians.
Many maintenance services are assigned to those technicians who have been
trained in the complexities of newer cars.<P>

The shortage of people qualified to do this kind of work has become a serious
problem for the automotive service and repair industry, according to Sherman
Titens, President of the Coordinating Committee for Automotive Repair (CCAR),
Kansas City, MO. `There are as many as 60,000 unfilled jobs in our industry,"
he says, "and this condition is likely to continue at least until the turn of
the century."
<h3>
Filling the Need</h3>
The urgent need for education and training, dissemination of information, were
the basis for creating CCAR, Titens explains. Starting just two years ago as a
partnership of industry-education-government, we're now affiliated with 34
national trade associations and professional societies. Our premise:  "How do
we provide for diagnosis and efficient repair of our vehicles in light of
future technological changes?"<P>

Beginning this year, millions of vehicles will be subject to the new EPA
program and its emissions inspection and repair requirements. It is estimated
that as many as twenty five percent of the vehicles tested will fail the
inspection. Required repairs will involve new knowledge and technology on the
part of the automotive technician. CCAR aims to help meet this challenge and to
help technicians deal with the new On Board Diagnostics (OBDII) on future
vehicles.<P>

"CCAR exists because of the need for more coordinated and united activities to
enhance the proficiency and image of automotive technicians," says Titens.
"Achieving this objective is believed to be the most cost-effective way to
improve vehicle maintenance. This will benefit the public in terms of improved
air quality, safety, fuel economy and satisfaction with repairs."<P>

In addition to being able to diagnose and utilize the data generated from the
OBDII system, the technician will need to acquire greater knowledge of
computers and electronics in order to make full use of the information provided
by the OBDII system.
<h3>
A Wide Range of Activities</h3>
To better coordinate and cross-pollinate the ideas and energies of government,
industry and training/educational organizations, CCAR has formed an
Inter-Agency Council which brings together government agencies and industry
representatives to share and exchange information. Beyond this, a State IM
Coordinators Network has been formed to keep states current on inspection and
maintenance issues and technical training.<P>

Two satellite video programs, focusing on career opportunities and professional
development of automotive education instructors, will be broadcast to hundreds
this fall.<P>

Further, the CCAR program will offer an electronic education bulletin board for
instructors' information exchange.<P>

Another aspect of the organization's programs is an industry campaign to
solicit and direct donated tools, equipment, educational materials and vehicles
for technical school programs. Over two million dollars worth of items have
been distributed to date.<P>

Finally, CCAR is exploring the establishment of a national clearinghouse for
regulatory information which affects employees of the five hundred thousand
small businesses which operate in the automotive industry.<P>

"Although it is young," says Titens, CCAR has demonstrated that the automotive
industry can come together and work to improve the professionalism of the
automotive technician.<P>

For more information, write CCAR, at 4717 Central, Kansas City, MO, 64112.<P>

A Future For Women As Automotive Professionals</h1></center>
The demand for qualified automotive technicians to service more sophisticated
vehicle technologies is increasing. Estimates suggest a current shortage of
roughly 60,000 technicians nationwide, growing by 20,000 each year. If these
estimates hold true, the industry could face a serious shortage of qualified
technicians. One effort underway to combat this potential gap is the formation
of an industry association that would organize around attracting and retaining
women in the auto service profession. Women currently working in the industry
are identifying other women throughout the nation to explore the possibilities
of forming such an association. Anyone interested in this issue should contact
Jessica Levy of Monroe Community College in Rochester, NY at 716-325-1242.<P>

Community Campaign Improves Car Care Awareness</h1></center>
Most drivers are aware that a neglected vehicle pollutes our environment,
wastes fuel and is a safety hazard. Unfortunately, many owners delay or ignore
the repairs necessary to keep their cars in satisfactory condition.<P>

One means of improving motorists' maintenance habits is through an annual
campaign known as National Car Care Month. <P>

Every October for the past 15 years, this project, coordinated by the Car Care
Council, involves widespread support from government, consumer groups, and
automotive industry associations and businesses.<P>

Local groups join forces to plan and publicize National Car Care Month,
announcing the times and places of free vehicle inspection lanes. Auto clubs,
technical and automotive service establishments conduct the testing with the
cooperation of trained technicians.<P>

Results of these checks, tabulated by the Automotive Market Research Council,
provide "grass roots" insight into the condition of a cross section of our car
population.<P>

In October of 1994, 6,569 confirmed inspections took place in 31 cities, with
more than 8 out of 10 vehicles found to have some unsatisfactory part, fluid
condition or emissions level.<P>

A closer look at the results reveals:<P>

Emissions - Among all vehicles inspected, nearly 20% failed,on average, with
one site reporting as many as 48% failed. <P>

Tires - 31% of vehicles failed due to incorrect tire pressure or worn tread.<P>

Windshield Wipers - 14% of vehicles failed due to windshield wiper condition
and/or malfunction. 18% had insufficient windshield washer solvent.<P>

Fluids - 16% of vehicles failed due to low or dirty fluids (motor oil,
transmission, power steering or brake fluid), an increase of about 20% over the
previous 5 year average.<P>

A third of cars 10 years old or older were low on motor oil.<P>

NOTE:  <b><i>94%</i></b> <b><i>of vehicles 10 years old or older needed
maintenance, the highest percentage in the history of this program.</i></b><P>

<b><i></i></b>Watch for National Car Care Month events in your community.<P>

Students/Teachers Collaborate in Car Care Event</h1></center>
High school students, accustomed to being taught, now have the opportunity to
teach while learning. It's part of a  school oriented Car Care Event that
involves vehicle check lanes, informative exhibits, car rallies and other
activities to teach their communities about good car  maintenance.<P>

Armed with a step-by-step teacher's guide and other materials provided by the
Car Care Council. Educators and students from various disciplines pool their
resources to carry out this event. The result is a collaborative teaching
project that educates students in life skills while motivating motorists to
take care of their cars.<P>

In a recent pilot program, journalism students worked on editorial and
advertising while distributive education students gathered support from local
businesses. Many of these students created and manned the consumer education
booths on Car Care Day. Meanwhile, the auto mechanics department assembled the
work teams that operated check lanes. Finally, the English Department's applied
communications class  compiled the data and wrote articles comparing their
county to other check sites in the nation.<P>

Marketing instructor Billy Ross said that, ". . . as long as the project
remains student-focused and students are allowed to do most of the work, an
amazing amount of learning will take place."<P>

Barbara Garnett, applied communications instructor was impressed by the
effectiveness of on-the-job-training. She said her students "learned so much
about their computers while preparing for Car Care Day. It's almost impossible
to teach that fast and that thoroughly using traditional teaching methods."<P>

For more information on how your school can participate, write Car Care
Council, One Grande Lake Drive, Port Clinton, OH 43452.<P>

Teen Driving</h1></center>
<address><i>By Bob Bondurant, former professional race car driver, now
president of the Bondurant School of High Performance Driving in Phoenix,
Arizona and consumer advisor for Ford Motor Company.</i><i></i></address><P>
Today's teenage drivers are responsible for about five times as many fatal
crashes per license holder as are drivers between the ages to 35-64.  We often
assume these fatal teenage accidents involve alcohol.  In fact, carelessness
and poor decision-making are most likely the cause in the majority of these
incidents.<P>

Driving an automobile requires making skilled and well-timed decisions several
times a second.  Such decisions are based on prior knowledge and driving
experience.<P>

However, public education faces more and more funding cuts, and driver's
education programs are usually one of the first to face the guillotine.  Many
state programs previously established time requirements for in-class and
on-road training.  For example, a student in Michigan had to spend 30 hours in
classroom instruction and 6 hours behind the wheel with a driving instructor.
The new trend steers toward knowledge and competency-based programs.  Most
often, as long as students show up to class, pass a written test, and
demonstrate basic driving skills behind the wheel, they can receive their
license.<P>

Students must demonstrate objectives at a level specified by each state's
department of education to earn their driver's certificate.  The purpose of
most driver's education programs is to expose students to the basic skills they
need to maneuver a vehicle.  Students are orientated to residential, country,
light and heavy city traffic, and expressway driving.  They learn basic driving
maneuvers such as starting, stopping, and backing the vehicle.  Before passing
a course, students must demonstrate turning, turn-arounds, and lane changing as
well as parallel and perpendicular parking.  Lastly, students must show an
understanding of traffic laws.<P>

But safe driving requires more than just basic skills.  Safe driving requires
experience.<P>

It is the belief of Ford Motor Company and the Bob Bondurant School of High
Performance Driving that experience should be acquired through on-road and
simulation training before a teen is licensed.  A teen should not have to learn
the hard way by rear ending a vehicle during rush hour, or by spinning into a
ditch on a snowy night.<P>

Students need to spend less time in the classroom and more time behind the
wheel - - not necessarily on the road, but in a parking lot or a test track in
accident simulation.  Practicing how to avoid a collision benefits a student in
ways text-book training cannot.<P>

Parents can play a significant role in their teenager's development into a
skilled and responsible driver by allowing them to gain experience behind the
wheel.  Many states require fresh graduates of driver's education to drive with
a permit, with a parent, for thirty days before receiving their license.  This
is the opportunity for teens to gain their most critical driving experience.
The Automotive Club of America provides parents with a checklist they can use
to monitor their teen's driving maneuvers.<P>

However, completing a driver's education course does not mean a teen is ready
to receive his/her license.  A driver's license can be obtained as early as the
age of 16 in the United States, but in many countries the legal driving age is
eighteen.  My point is, that if a parent feels their teen is not ready on
his/her sixteenth birthday to handle the responsibility of driving a vehicle, a
safer option might be to wait a month or two, or maybe even a year.<P>

Motor vehicle incidents are the number-one killer of young Americans aged 15 to
24, and Ford Motor Company is committed to changing that statistic.  With this
in mind, Ford Motor Company recently offered the Ford Motor Company Teenage
Driving School with Bob Bondurant to select high school students in Dallas.
The program was designed to help reduce fatalities by teaching teens improved
driving skills.<P>

The program consisted of two half-day sessions and engaged students in
demonstrations and activities to illustrate skid control, including front- and
rear-wheel slides.  They participated in a crash simulator to sharpen reflexes,
learned maneuvering and braking techniques and heel-and-toe downshifting.<P>

Teenage drivers need to be equipped with sight and thought processes which
allow them to make correct decisions in the ever-changing traffic environment.
Proper on-road instruction and experience can help a young driver meet the many
challenges of vehicle operation.<P>

The Ford Motor Company Teenage Driving Program provides teens the "hands-on"
experience that cannot be learned or appreciated through traditional
training.<P>

Driving is not just a physical task.  Students can demonstrate basic skills,
but still may not have proper mental attitudes and responses to driving
situations.  They must be taught respect for the vehicle they drive, as well as
the other drivers on the road.  For teens, a more thorough understanding of how
a car operates is essential in achieving optimum performance and response,
under all "types" of conditions.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ost drivers are aware that a neglected vehicle pollutes our environment, wastes fuel and is a safety hazard. Unfortunately, many owners delay or ignore the repairs necessary to keep their cars in satisfactory condition.
<P>
One means of improving motorists' maintenance habits is through an annual campaign known as National Car Care Month.
<P>
Every October for the past 15 years, this project, coordinated by the Car Care Council, involves widespread support from government, consumer groups, and automotive industry associations and businesses.
<P>
Local groups join forces to plan and publicize National Car Care Month, announcing the times and places of free vehicle inspection lanes. Auto clubs, technical and automotive service establishments conduct the testing with the cooperation of trained technicians.
<P>
Results of these checks, tabulated by the Automotive Market Research Council, provide "grass roots" insight into the condition of a cross section of our car population.
<P>
In October of 1994, 6,569 confirmed inspections took place in 31 cities, with more than 8 out of 10 vehicles found to have some unsatisfactory part, fluid condition or emissions level.
<P>
A closer look reveals:
<P>
Emissions - Among all vehicles inspected, nearly 20% failed, on average, with one site reporting as many as 48% failed.
<P>
Tires - 31% of vehicles failed due to incorrect tire pressure or worn tread.
<P>
Windshield Wipers - 14% of vehicles failed due to windshield wiper condition and/or malfunction. 18% had insufficient windshield washer solvent.
<P>
Fluids - 16% of vehicles failed due to low or dirty fluids (motor oil, transmission, power steering or brake fluid), an increase of about 20% over the previous 5 year average.
<P>
A third of cars 10 years old or older were low on motor oil.
<P>
NOTE: 94% of vehicles 10 years old or older needed maintenance, the highest percentage in history of this program.
<P>
<I><B>A typical inspection lane includes checks of lights, windshield wipers, tires, exhaust
emissions and other functions affecting the vehicle's safety and performance. 
It's a volunteer project with no charge for the service.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Air Conditioning and Heating System</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>
                   
<P>
Not only do we depend on our cars to get us where we want to go, we also depend on them to get us there without discomfort. We expect the heater to keep us warm when it's cold outside, and the air conditioning system to keep us cool when it's hot.  
<P>
We get heat from the heater core, sort of a secondary radiator, which is part of the car's cooling system. We get air conditioning from the car's elaborate air conditioning system.   
<P>
Despite its relatively small size, the cooling system has to deal with an enormous amount of heat to protect the engine from friction and the heat of combustion. The cooling system has to remove about 6,000 BTU of heat per minute. This is a lot more heat than we need to heat a large home in cold weather. It's good to know that some of this heat can be put to the useful purpose of keeping us warm.  
<P>
Air conditioning makes driving much more comfortable in hot weather. Your car's air conditioner cleans and dehumidifies (removes excess moisture), the outside air entering your car. It also has the task of keeping the air at the temperature you select. These are all big jobs. How do our cars keep our "riding environment" the way we like it?
<P>
Most people think the air conditioning system's job is to add "cold" air to the interior of the car. Actually, there is no such thing as "cold," just an absence of heat, or less heat than our bodies are comfortable with. The job of the air conditioning system is really to "remove" the heat that makes us uncomfortable, and return the air to the car's interior in a "un-heated" condition.  Air conditioning, or cooling, is really a process of removing heat from an object (like air).  
<P>
A compressor circulates a liquid refrigerant called Refrigerant-12 (we tend to call it "Freon," a trade name, the way we call copy machines "Xerox" machines). The compressor moves the Refrigerant-12 from an evaporator, through a condenser and expansion valve, right back to the evaporator. The evaporator is right in front of a fan that pulls the hot, humid air out of the car's interior. The refrigerant makes the hot air's moisture condense into drops of water, removing the heat from the air. Once the water is removed, the "cool" air is sent back into the car's interior. Aaaaaah! Much better.   
<P>
Sometimes we worry when we catch our car making a water puddle on the ground, but are relieved to discover that it's only water dripping from the air conditioning system's condenser (no color, no smell, and it dries!).  
<P>
Note: Refrigerant-12 is extremely dangerous. Many special precautions must be taken when it is present. It can freeze whatever it contacts (including your eyes), it is heavier than air and can suffocate you, and it produces a poisonous gas when it comes in contact with an open flame.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Dash Controls</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Most or all of the control panel of your car is located on the dashboard behind the steering wheel. Sometimes it extends onto the car's console, between the two front seats, and onto your steering column. Little duplicate fragments of the control panel are scattered around the interior of your vehicle, such as automatic door locks, extra light switches, etc.  
<P>
The dash controls enable you to operate your headlights, turn signals, horn, windshield wipers, heater, defroster, air conditioning, radio, etc. All of the vehicle's controls should be within the reach of the driver.  
<P>
The control panel also contains all of your gauges; gas, temperature, tachometer, etc. These enable you to monitor the operating conditions of your engine and charging system, fuel level, oil pressure and coolant temperature. Warning lights come on to alert you to dangerous coolant temperatures, or loss of oil pressure.  
<P>
In 1924 the Nash Co. introduced the electric clock as an accessory.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Relays</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A relay is an electromagnetic device in which contacts are made and subsequently broken. An example of this would be your car's horn.  
<P>
By natural law, the farther electrical current travels, the lower its voltage becomes. Your car horn has to be connected to the car battery in order to sound. The shortest distance between two points is a wire connecting your horn to your battery. The only problem with this arrangement is that connecting the two would give you a permanent horn blast when you turned the key in your ignition.  
<P>
This is an unacceptable arrangement, so a relay is included in the connection. The relay stops the horn from sounding until you activate the relay by pressing the horn. The relay then allows the horn to connect to the battery, or complete the circuit, and it sounds. As soon as you stop pressing the horn, the relay breaks the connection, or circuit, and presto-- no more horn!  
<P>
Relays, with switches, are used for most of the equipment that depends on the battery for an energy source. This includes headlights, taillights, radio, etc.  
<P>
In 1922, a Model T was the first car equipped with a radio. In 1927, the first commercially produced car radio came on the scene.  
<P>
A "relay" is any switching device operated by a low current circuit that controls opening and closing of another circuit of high current capacity. The purpose of the "cutout relay" is to prevent the battery from discharging through the generator when the engine is stopped or turning over slowly. A "field relay" connects the alternator field windings and voltage regulator windings directly to the battery.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Heater/AC Blower Motor</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The blower motor is the motor that turns the electric fan in an air conditioning or heating system.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Air Ducts</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The air ducts control the passage of hot or cold air into the interior of the car. They are operated by a control on the dash, either manually or automatically.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Controls</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Most air conditioning/heating systems have three possible air settings. One is to recirculate the air that is in the car, a second is to use only air from the outside of the car, and a third is to mix some of the outside air with the air recirculating inside the car.                              
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Low Pressure Line</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The low pressure line is a hose, or tube containing refrigerant that connects the evaporator to the air conditioning system's compressor. The compressor draws the low pressure refrigerant from the evaporator in through the low pressure line in order to compress it.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>High Pressure Line</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The high pressure line is a hose, or tube containing refrigerant that connects the air conditioning system's compressor to the condenser. The compressor forces the compressed refrigerant into the condenser through the high pressure line.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS)</B></FONT>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=3> 

<P>
Originally developed for aircraft, ABS basically works by limiting the pressure to any wheel which decelerates too rapidly. This allows maximum stopping force to be applied without brake lockup (skidding). If standard brakes are applied too hard, the wheels "lock" or skid, which prevents them from giving directional control. If directional control (steering) is lost, the vehicle skids in a straight line wherever it is going. ABS allows the driver to steer during hard braking, which allows you to control the car much better. In the old days, drivers had to know how to "pump" the brakes or sense the lockup and release foot pressure in order to prevent skidding. This meant that if only one wheel lost traction and started to skid, the driver would have to reduce braking force to prevent a skid. The advantage of ABS is that the brakes on the wheels with good traction can be used to the fullest possible amount, even if other wheels lose traction. 
<P>
In operation, the wheelspeed sensors at each wheel send electronic pulse signals to the control unit. If wheel lockup (rapid deceleration) is detected during brake application, the computer signals the valve unit to limit the hydraulic pressure to the wheel cylinder. This is usually accomplished by diverting the fluid into a small reservoir. The fluid is later pumped out of the reservoir and returned to the main fluid reservoir when the brakes are not being applied. 
<P>
The anti-lock brake system tests itself every time the vehicle is started and every time the brakes are applied. The system evaluates its own signals. If a defect is detected, the system then turns off, leaving normal braking unaffected.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Emissions Testing</B></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
Many states require emissions tests on vehicles. This means that you drive to a facility where the test people take a sample of your emissions and run it through some analysis. The results are printed,and you pass or fail depending on the percentage of toxic emissions that turn up in your car's sample.
<P>
The only way to "study" or prepare for this test is to take good care of your car, including its emission system. If you use preventative maintenance, and keep your car tuned properly, you will pass. If you tamper with your emissions system, you will not pass. You can have your car checked independently before your emissions test if you want to resolve problems before going to the emissions test station.
<P>
One other good thing to do is to save your printouts from the test from year to year. If you compare them, you will be able to monitor your car (if its score is getting worse) and catch any problems before the emissions people catch you.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Emission Control System</B></FONT></CENTER>                

<P>
The purpose of the emission control system is just that; it controls the emissions and exhaust from your vehicle. The idea is to turn the harmful gases your car manufactures into harmless ones that don't ruin the environment, or us. Some of the problem gases are:  
<P>

To help control these substances, we (along with federal regulations) have made changes in our gasoline to eliminate them.  Also, with a push from federal regulations, we have developed ways, varying from state to state, to test emissions, that have caused automotive manufacturers to develop better, safer emission systems.  
<P>
Although emissions control systems vary between manufacturers and vehicles, they all have the same goal and use many of the same methods. The addition of computers to ignition systems allows the engine to monitor and adjust itself continuously, so it just isn't true that emission controls lower the amount of mileage we get fromfuel.  
<P>
The best news is that emission controls have reduced carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions by about ninety-six percent from pre-control vehicles. That's almost a hundred percent!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Tailpipe</B></FONT></CENTER>                       

<P>
The tailpipe is a long metal tube attached to the muffler. It sticks out from under the body of your car, at the rear, in order to discharge the exhaust gases from the muffler of your engine into the air outside the car.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Muffler</B></FONT></CENTER>                       

<P>
Exhaust gases leave the engine under extremely high pressure. If these gases escaped directly from the engine the noise would be tremendous. For this reason, the exhaust manifold sends the gases to a muffler where they go through metal plates, or tubes, with a series of holes. The pressure of the gases is reduced when they pass through the muffler, so they go out of the tail pipe quietly.  
<P>
The muffler is made of metal and is located underneath the body ofthe car. It's connected between the tail pipe and the catalytic converter.  
<P>
There are two types of muffler design. One type uses several baffled chambers to reduce noise. The other type sends the gases straight through perforated pipe wrapped in metal or fiberglass.  This type of muffler is designed for the purpose of reducing back pressure and, consequently, makes slightly more noise.  
<P>
Since a muffler cannot reduce the noise of the engine by itself, some exhaust systems also have a resonator. Resonators are like little mufflers, and are usually the "straight through" type. They are added at the end of the exhaust system to take care of any noise that has made it through the muffler.  
<P>
The muffler quiets the noise of the exhaust by "muffling" the sound waves created by the opening and closing of the exhaust valves. When an exhaust valve opens, it discharges the burned gases at high pressures into the exhaust pipe, which is at low pressure. This type of action creates sound waves that travel through the flowing gas, moving much faster than the gas itself (up to 1400 m.p.h.), that the muffler must silence. It generally does this by converting the sound wave energy into heat by passing the exhaust gas and its accompanying wave pattern, through perforated chambers of varied sizes. Passing into the perforations and reflectors within the chamber forces the sound waves to dissipate their energy.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Catalytic Converter</B></FONT></CENTER>                 

<P>
When your engine burns fuel, it produces gases that are bad for the environment. These noxious gases are hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. To prevent the engine from polluting the environment with these gases, we include a catalytic converter in our emission systems.  
<P>
The catalytic converter is installed in the exhaust line, between the exhaust manifold and the muffler, and makes use of chemicals that act as a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that causes a reaction between other chemicals without being affected itself. In the case of the catalytic converter, the chemicals it contains cause a reaction in the pollutants in the exhaust. The pollutants are changed from harmful gases to harmless ones before they are let into the environment through the tail pipe.  
<P>
Basically, the harmful gases enter the catalytic converter, a kind of stainless steel container. The converter is lined with chemicals such as aluminum oxide, platinum and palladium. These chemicals cause the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to change into water vapor and carbon dioxide. Some converters have a third lining of chemicals, platinum and rhodium, that reduce nitrogen oxides (three-way, dualbed converter).  
<P>
The reason that leaded gas cannot be used in an engine with a catalytic converter is that the lead coats the chemicals in the converter. This makes them unable to do the job anymore, since the chemical lining can't come in contact with the pollutants. At first,this was a big disappointment, because lead acted as a lubricant and helped to reduce wear on some of the engine parts.  Luckily for our engines and the environment (not to mention us), car manufacturers soon got around the problem by making tougher parts and coating them with special metal.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The EGR Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>                     

<P>
The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is used to send some of the exhaust gas back into the cylinders to reduce combustion temperature. Why would we want to do this?  
<P>
Nitrous oxides (nasty pollutants) form when the combustion temperature gets above 2,500 degrees F. This happens, because at such temperatures, the nitrogen in the air mixes with the oxygen to create nitrous oxides. Did you ever have two friends that were fine by themselves but just awful when they got together? Well, our good friend, the sun, is just like that. When it's sunny, the nitrous oxides from the exhaust get together with the hydrocarbons in the air to form our not-so-good friend, smog. That's when the EGR valve comesin handy.  
<P>
By recirculating some of the exhaust gas back through the intake manifold to the cylinders, we can lower the combustion temperature. Lowering the combustion temperature lowers the amount of nitrous oxide produced. Consequently, less of it comes out the tail pipe.  
<P>
There are two types of EGR valves. One operates through the use of a vacuum, and the other operated through the use of pressure. Both types allow the exhaust gas in to lower the combustion temperature when it gets too high.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> PCV Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>                             

<P>
The process of combustion forms several gases and vapors; many of them quite corrosive. Some of these gases get past the piston rings and into the crankcase. If left in the crankcase, these substances would cause all kinds of bad things (rust, corrosion, and formation of sludge), so they have to be removed. Back in the old days, they used to be dumped out into the atmosphere through a tube. Once we realized what a problem pollution was in the sixties, the PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system was developed to take the place of the old "dump tube."  
<P>
The PCV system uses a hose connected between the engine and the intake manifold to draw these gases out of the engine's crankcase and back into the cylinders to burn with the regular fuel. The only problem to solve is how to keep these gases from going willy-nilly into the manifold and upsetting the required air-fuel ratio. The solution to this problem is the PCV valve.  
<P>
The PCV valve controls the release of crankcase gases and vapors to the intake manifold. The valve is kept closed by spring action when the engine is at rest. When the engine is running normally, the low vacuum it creates allows the valve to open and release crankcase vapors and gases into the intake manifold for burning. If the engine is idling or you are slowing down, the vacuum level rises and pulls the valve plunger into the valve opening. This partially blocks off the opening so that only a small amount of vapors and gases can be drawn into the intake manifold.  
<P>
One really comforting feature of the PCV valve is its behavior in the event of a backfire. If your car backfires in the manifold, the pressure makes the spring close the valve completely. With the valve closed, there is no chance that the flame can move into the crankcase and cause an explosion.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Air Pump</B></FONT></CENTER>                        

<P>
The air pump sends (or pumps) compressed air into the exhaust manifold and in some cases to the catalytic converter. The oxygen in the pressurized air helps to burn quite a bit of any unburned hydrocarbons (fuel) and therby converts the poisonous carbon monoxide into good old carbon dioxide.  
<P>
A belt from the engine drives the air pump. It has little vanes (thin, flat, curved fins) that draw the air into the compression chamber. Here, the air is compressed and sent off to the exhaust manifold where it speeds up the emissions burning process.  Stainless steel nozzles are used to shoot the air into the exhaust manifold, because they will not burn.  
<P>
Some engines use a pulse air injection system. This system uses pulses of exhaust gas to operate an air pump that delivers air into the exhaust system.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Exhaust Manifold and Header</B></FONT></CENTER>               

<P>
The exhaust manifold, usually constructed of cast iron, is a pipe that conducts the exhaust gases from the combustion chambers to the exhaust pipe. It has smooth curves in it for improving the flow of exhaust.  
<P>
The exhaust manifold is bolted to the cylinder head, and has entrances for the air that is injected into it. It is usually located under the intake manifold.  
<P>
A header is a different type of manifold; it is made of separate equal-length tubes.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manifold to Exhaust Pipe Gaskets</B></FONT></CENTER>               

<P>
There are several types of gaskets that connect the exhaust pipe to the manifold.  
<P>
One is a flat surface gasket. Another type uses a ball and socket with springs to maintain pressure. This type allows some flexibility without breakage of the seal or the manifold. A third type is the full ball connector type, which also allows a little flexibility.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Exhaust Pipe Hangers</B></FONT></CENTER>                       

<P>
Hangers hold the exhaust system in place. They give the system flexibility and reduce the noise level. The hanger system consists of rubber rings, tubes and clamps.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Catalysts</B></FONT></CENTER>                          

<P>
The materials within a catalytic converter vary between cars. Catalytic converters are designed to do different things, depending on the design of the converter.   
<P>
Some catalytic converters use what is called an "oxidation" catalyst; this usually consists of ceramic beads coated with platinum to reduce hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Through the catalytic action, the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are "burned" to creat ewater vapor and carbon dioxide. This type of catalytic converter needs an input of oxygen, so oxygen is usually injected into the cylinder head, or directly into the exhaust header or manifold.  
<P>
Newer catalytic converters have a two part design. The front half is a "three-way" catalyst, which burns various pollutants, and reduces hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen into water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. These converters require exact fuel air mixtures in order to maintain efficient exhaust reduction. The rear section of these converters is the normal oxidation catalyst that further reduces hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Air from the air pump is injected into the center of these converters. Here the air is allowed to mix with the exhaust before it passes into the oxidation catalyst, where it burns off its toxic chemicals and reduces emissions.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Exhaust Pipe</B></FONT></CENTER>                          

<P>
The exhaust pipe is the bent-up or convoluted pipes you will notice underneath your car. Some are shaped to go over the rear axle, allowing the rear axle to move up and down without bumping into the exhaust pipe; some are shaped to bend around under the floor of the car, connecting the catalytic converter with the muffler. Exhaust pipes are usually made out of stainless steel, since the high heat conditions involved with the muffler system will cause rust.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Reverse-flow Muffler</B></FONT></CENTER>                      

<P>
The reverse-flow muffler is oval-shaped and has multiple pipes. Four chambers and a double jacket are used to accomplish muffling of the exhaust noise. Exhaust gases are directed to the third chamber, forced forward to the first chamber, from where they travel the length of the muffler and are exhausted into the tail pipe.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Straight Through Muffler</B></FONT></CENTER>                  

<P>
The straight through muffler has a central tube, perforated with several openings which lead into an outside chamber packed with a sound absorbing (or insulating) material. As the exhaust gases expand from the perforated inner pipe into the outer chamber, they come in contact with the insulator and escape to the atmosphere under constant pressure. Because of this, the expanding chamber tends to equalize or spread the pressure peaks throughout the exhaust from each individual cylinder of the engine.  
<P>
A V-8 engine requires two exhaust manifolds and either one or two mufflers and often accompanying resonators. If one muffler is used, the exhaust pipe from one manifold meets the other one in the form of a "Y".  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Dual Exhaust System </B></FONT></CENTER>                   

<P>
The advantage of a dual exhaust system is that the engine exhausts more freely, thereby lowering the back pressure which is inherent in an exhaust system. With a dual exhaust system, a sizable increase in engine horsepower can be obtained because the "breathing" capacity of the engine is improved, leaving less exhaust gases in the engine at the end of each exhaust stroke. This, in turn, leaves more room for an extra intake of the air-fuel mixture.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Compressor</B></FONT>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=3>                            
  
<P>
The compressor used to air condition your car works in a similar way to the one in the refrigerator in your kitchen. The job of the compressor is to move liquid refrigerant around in a pipe. The compressor pumps, or forces, the liquid from the evaporator into a condenser and expansion valve, and then back to the evaporator.  
<UL TYPE=square>  
	<B> There are three common types of compressors:</B>
	<BR>
	<BR>
	<LI>Two cylinder reciprocating piston type  
	<LI>Four cylinder RADIAL type  
	<LI>Six cylinder AXIAL type 
</UL>

<P>
The engine drives the compressor with a belt. In action, the compressor takes the low pressure refrigerant from the evaporator and compresses it according to speed and air temperature. The inlet side is known as the low (pressure) side and the outlet side is known as the high (pressure) side.  
<P>
The compressor compresses the refrigerant, and raises its temperature higher than that of the surrounding air. Then, the compressor forces the refrigerant into the condenser.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Compressor Clutch</B></FONT></CENTER>                           
  
<P>
The air conditioning compressor has an electromagnetic clutch that can engage or disengage the compressor pulley. The compressor pulley always turns when the engine is running, but the compressor only runs when the pulley is engaged to the compressor driving shaft.  
<P>
When this system is activated, current runs through the electromagnetic coil. The current attracts it to the armature plate. The strong magnetic pull draws the armature plate against the side of the turning pulley. This locks the pulley and the armature plate together; the armature plate drives the compressor.  
<P>
When the system is deactivated, and current stops running through the electromagnetic coil, flat springs pull the armature plate away from the pulley.  
<P>
The magnetic coil does not turn since its magnetism is transmitted through the pulley to the armature. The armature plate and hub assembly are fastened to the compressor drive shaft. When it's not driving the compressor, the clutch pulley turns on a double row of ball bearings.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> AC Compressor Drive Ring</B></FONT></CENTER>                       

<P>
Inside the air conditioner's refrigerant compressor is a drive ring made of a friction material that is mounted to both sides of the "swash" or "wobble" plate. As the swash plate rotates, the friction material pushes the ball bearings (mounted to the pistons) back and forth.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Condenser</B></FONT></CENTER>                        

<P>
The condenser is a long tube that goes back and forth through a multitude of cooling fins, quite similar to the evaporator in structure. The condenser is mounted in front of the radiator to take advantage of the forced air provided by the fan and the motion of the car.  
<P>
As the highly pressurized refrigerant (vapor) flows into the condenser, it gives off heat and warms the condenser. This causes the condenser to be hotter than the forced air coming through the condenser. The condenser hands its heat off to the forced air and turns the refrigerant back into cool liquid in the expansion valve, where it heads back to the evaporator.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Evaporator</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The evaporator is a long tube, or coil, that goes back and forth through a multitude of cooling fins. It is quite similar to the condenser in structure.  
<P>
The refrigerant is a liquid when it enters the evaporator. A fan blows warm air over the evaporator. The warm air causes the liquid refrigerant to boil. This means that it absorbs the heat from the warm air. Once it has absorbed the heat from the warm air, the warm air isn't warm anymore. The same blower that blows the warm air (that is now "cool" air) over the evaporator, keeps on blowing it into the interior of your car, and you have -- air conditioning!  
<P>
The evaporator also removes the moisture from the air coming through its fins and turns it into water. The water just drains off.  
<P>
The temperature of the evaporator coil can go from 33 degrees F to 0 degrees F. If it goes below 32 degrees F, the moisture that's supposed to drain off the coils will freeze. This makes for a very (surprise!) inefficient system, so a thermostatic switch is used to connect and disconnect it to the compressor as necessary.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Expansion Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>                       

<P>
The expansion valve determines the correct amount of refrigerant going into the evaporator, and it lowers the pressure of the refrigerant.  
<P>
When the compressor starts, the expansion valve opens and the liquid refrigerant flows through a strainer in the high pressure liquid inlet. Once in the expansion valve, the refrigerant is correctly pressurized. As the evaporator calls for more refrigerant, the expansion valve allows the required amount of low pressure liquid refrigerant into the coils.  
<P>
The expansion valve maintains the delicate balance between the heat load and the cooling efficiency of the evaporator.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Discharge/Suction Service Valves</B></FONT></CENTER>               

<P>
Discharge and suction service valves allow the air conditioning system to be emptied and filled. These valves also provide places where the system can be checked with pressure gauges.  
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Some systems use a Schrader valve in place of the discharge and suction valves. This is a spring-loaded valve which looks rather like the valve in a tire.  
<P>  

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Compressor Relay</B></FONT></CENTER>                      
  
<P>
A capillary tube from a cycling switch lets the switch know what the temperature is in the evaporator. This switch turns the compressor on and off to keep the evaporator temperature at about 32 to 45 degrees F. The relay switch keeps moisture from freezing on the evaporator core.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Electric Air Conditioning Fan</B></FONT></CENTER>               

<P>
Sometimes an extra electric fan is placed in front of the condenser to provide an extra flow of air during warm weather, or for times when the car has to idle for a long time. You activate and deactivate the air conditioning fan when you turn it on and off at the control panel.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Compressor Belt</B></FONT></CENTER>
                              
<P>
The compressor is engine driven by a belt on the front of the crankshaft.

<FONT SIZE=3>                     
  
<P>
The internal combustion engine burns fuel within the cylinders and converts the expanding force of the combustion or "explosion" into rotary force used to propel the vehicle. There are several types of internal combustion engines: two and four cycle reciprocating piston engines, gas turbines, free piston, and rotary combustion engines. The four cycle reciprocating engine has been refined to such a degree that it has almost complete dominance in the automotive field.   
<P>
The engine is the heart of the automobile. It converts fuel into the energy that powers the automobile. To operate, it requires clean air for the fuel, water for cooling, electricity (which it generates) for igniting the fuel, and oil for lubrication. A battery and electric starter get it going.  
<P>
Charles and Frank Duryea built the first American automobile in 1892. In the winter of 1895/96 they produced 13 Duryeas, which became the first horseless carriages regularly manufactured in the United States.  
<P>
In 1900, at the first National Automobile Show in New York City,  visitors overwhelmingly chose the electric car. Most people thought  the gasoline engine would never last. One critic of the engine wrote that it was noisy, unreliable, and elephantine; that it vibrated so violently as to "loosen one's dentures." He went on to give the opinion that the gasoline motor would never be a factor in America's growing automobile industry. People were afraid that gasoline engines would explode. Motorweek magazine referred to them as "explosives." At the show, a bucket brigade was standing by every time an "explosive," was cranked. However, just three years later, at the same show, the number of cars with four-stroke internal combustion gasoline engines had risen sharply.  
<P>
Each "cylinder" of the typical car engine has a "piston" which moves back and forth within the cylinder (this is called "reciprocating"). Each piston is connected to the "crankshaft" by means of a link known as a "connecting rod".   
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Horsepower </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Horsepower is a unit of power for measuring the rate at which a  device can perform mechanical work. Its abbreviation is hp. One  horsepower was defined as the amount of power needed to lift 33,000 pounds one foot in one minute.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Oil Weights</B></FONT></CENTER>                           
  
<P>
Oil weight, or viscosity, refers to how thick or thin the oil Is. The temperature requirements set for oil by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) is 0 degrees F (low) and 210 degrees F (high).  
<P>
Oils meeting the SAE's low temperature requirements have a "W" after the viscosity rating (example: 10W), and oils that meet the high ratings have no letter (example SAE 30). An oil is rated for viscosity by heating it to a specified temperature, and then allowing it to flow out of a specifically sized hole. Its viscosity rating is determined by the length of time it takes to flow out of the hole. If it flows quickly, it gets a low rating. If it flows slowly, it gets a high rating.  
<P>
Engines need oil that is thin enough for cold starts, and thick  enough when the engine is hot. Since oil gets thinner when heated,  and thicker when cooled, most of us use what are called multi-grade,  or multi-viscosity oils. These oils meet SAE specifications for the low temperature requirements of a light oil and the high temperature requirements of a heavy oil. You will hear them referred to as multi-viscosity, all-season and all-weather oils.  
<P>
When choosing oil, always follow the manufacturer's recommendation.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Gaskets  </B></FONT></CENTER>                          
  
<P>
Gaskets and seals are needed in your engine to make the machined  joints snug, and to prevent fluids and gasses (oil, gasoline, coolant, fuel vapor, exhaust, etc.) from leaking.  
<P>
The cylinder head has to keep the water in the cooling system at the same time as it contains the combustion pressure. Gaskets made of steel, copper and asbestos are used between the cylinder head and engine block. Because the engine expands and contracts with heating and cooling, it is easy for joints to leak, so the gaskets have to be soft and "springy" enough to adapt to expansion and contraction. They also have to make up for any irregularities in the connecting parts.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Four-stroke Piston Cycle </B></FONT></CENTER>                    
  
<P>
In 1876, a German engineer named Dr. Otto produced an engine, that worked, using the four-stroke, or Otto cycle. "Four-stroke" refers to the number of piston strokes required to complete a cycle (a cycle being a sequence of constantly repeated operations). It takes two complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the cycle.  
<P>
The first stroke is the intake stroke. The piston moves down the  cylinder and creates a partial vacuum in the cylinder. A mixture of  air and fuel is forced through the inlet valve into the cylinder by  atmospheric pressure, now greater than the pressure in the cylinder. During this stroke, the exhaust valve stays closed.  
<P>
The second stroke is the compression stroke. The piston moves up in  the cylinder with both valves closed. The air and fuel mixture is  compressed and the pressure rises.  
<P>
The third stroke is the power stroke. Near the end of the compression stroke, the air and fuel mixture is ignited by an electric spark from the spark plug. The combustion that occurs causes a rise in  temperature and enough pressure to force the piston down again.  
<P>
Finally, on the fourth stroke, or exhaust stroke, the piston moves up again and forces the burned gases out of the cylinder and into the exhaust system. This cycle repeats itself the entire time the engine is running.  <BR <BR>
<P>

<BR><BR>   
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>V-Type Engines</B></FONT></CENTER>                     
   
<P>
The V-type of engine has two rows of cylinders at (usually) a ninety degree angle to each other. Its advantages are its short length, the great rigidity of the block, its heavy crankshaft, and attractive low profile (for a car with a low hood). This type of engine lends itself to very high compression ratios without block distortion under load, resistance to torsional vibration, and a shorter car length without losing passenger room.  
<P>
In 1914, Cadillac was the first company in the United States to use a V-8 engine in its cars.  
<P>
In-line engines have the cylinders arranged, one after the other, in a straight line. In a vertical position, the number of cylinders used is usually either four or six, but three cylinder cars are becoming  more common. 
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Rotary Engine </B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
<P>
The rotary, or Wankel, engine has no piston, it uses rotors instead (usually two). This engine is small, compact and has a curved, oblong inner shape (known as an "epitrochoid" curve). Its central rotor turns in one direction only, but it produces all four strokes (intake, compression, power and exhaust) effectively.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Flat (Horizontal-Opposed) Engines  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A horizontal-opposed engine is like a V-type engine that has been  flattened until both banks lie in a horizontal plane. It is ideal for installations where vertical space is limited, because it has a very low height.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Overhead Camshaft (OHC)  </B></FONT></CENTER>                  

<P>
Some engines have the camshaft mounted above, or over, the cylinder head instead of inside the block (OHC "overhead camshaft" engines). This arrangement has the advantage of eliminating the added weight of the rocker arms and push rods; this weight can sometimes make the valves "float" when you are moving at high speeds. The rocker arm setup is operated by the camshaft lobe rubbing directly on the rocker. Stem to rocker clearance is maintained with a hydraulic valve lash adjuster for "zero" clearance.  
<P>
The overhead camshaft is also something that we think of as a  relatively new development, but it's not. In 1898 the Wilkinson Motor Car Company introduced the same feature on a car.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Double Overhead Camshaft(DOHC)</B></FONT></CENTER>                  
  
<P>
The double overhead cam shaft (DOHC) is the same as the overhead  camshaft, except that there are two camshafts instead of one.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Overhead Valve (OHV)  </B></FONT></CENTER>                     
  
<P>
In an overhead valve (OHV) engine, the valves are mounted in the cylinder head, above the combustion chamber. Usually this type of engine has the camshaft mounted in the cylinder block, and the valves are opened and closed by push rods.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Multivalve Engines  </B></FONT></CENTER>                       
  
<P>
All engines have more than one valve; "multivalve" refers to the fact that this type of engine has more than one exhaust or intake valve per cylinder.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Timing </B></FONT></CENTER>                           
  
<P>
Timing refers to the delivery of the ignition spark, or the opening  and closing of the engine valves, depending on the piston's position, for the power stroke. The timing chain is driven by a sprocket on the crankshaft and also drives the camshaft sprocket.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Vacuum System (Importance of)</B></FONT></CENTER>                   
  
<P>
Engines run on a vacuum system. A vacuum exists in an area where the pressure is lower than the atmosphere outside of it. Reducing the pressure inside of something causes suction. For example, when you drink soda through a straw, the atmospheric pressure in the air  pushes down on your soda and pushes it up into your mouth. The same principal applies to your engine. When the piston travels down in the cylinder it lowers the atmospheric pressure in the cylinder and forms a vacuum. This vacuum is used to draw in the air and fuel mixture for combustion. The vacuum created in your engine not only pulls the fuel into the combustion chamber, it also serves many other functions. <P> The running engine causes the carburetor and the intake manifold to produce "vacuum power," which is harnessed for the operation of several other devices.  
<P>
Vacuum is used in the ignition-distributor vacuum-advance mechanism. At part throttle, the vacuum causes the spark to give thinner mixtures more time to burn.  
<P>
The positive crankcase ventilating system (PCV) uses the vacuum to remove vapor and exhaust gases from the crankcase.  
<P>
The vapor recovery system uses the vacuum to trap fuel from the  carburetor float bowl and fuel tank in a canister. Starting the  engine causes the vacuum port in the canister to pull fresh air into the canister to clean out the trapped fuel vapor.  
<P>
Vacuum from the intake manifold creates the heated air system that  helps to warm up your carburetor when it's cold.  
<P>
The EGR valve (exhaust-gas recirculation system) works, because of  vacuum, to reduce pollutants produced by the engine.  
<P>
Many air conditioning systems use the vacuum from the intake manifold to open and close air-conditioner doors to produce the heated air and cooled air required inside your vehicle.  
<P>
Intake manifold vacuum also is used for the braking effort in power  brakes. When you push the brake pedal down, a valve lets the vacuum  into one section of the power-brake unit. The atmospheric pressure  moves a piston or diaphragm to provide the braking action. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Rotary Engine  </B></FONT></CENTER>                   

<P>
One alternative to conventional automobile power is the rotary (or Wankel) engine. Although it is widely known that Felix Wankel built a rotary engine in 1955, it is also a fact that Elwood Haynes made one  in 1893!  
<P>
Dispensing with separate cylinders, pistons, valves and crankshaft, the rotary engine applies power directly to the transmission. Its construction allows it to provide the power of a conventional engine that is twice its size and weight and that has twice as many parts. The Wankel burns as much as 20%% more fuel than the conventional engine and is potentially a high polluter, but its small size allows the addition of emission-control parts more conveniently than does the piston engine. The basic unit of the rotary engine is a large combustion chamber in the form of a pinched oval (called an epitrochoid). Within this chamber all four functions of a piston take place simultaneously in the three pockets that are formed between the rotor and the chamber wall. Just as the addition of cylinders increases the horsepower of a piston-powered engine, so the addition of combustion chambers increases the power of a rotary engine. Larger cars may eventually use rotaries with three or four rotors.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>  Combustion Chamber </B></FONT></CENTER>                   

<P>
The combustion chamber is where the air-fuel mixture is burned. The location of the combustion chamber is the area between the top of the piston at what is known as TDC (top dead center) and the cylinder head. TDC is the piston's position when it has reached the top of the cylinder, and the center line of the connecting rod is parallel to  the cylinder walls.  
<P>
The two most commonly used types of combustion chamber are the  hemispherical and the wedge shape combustion chambers.  
<P>
The hemispherical type is so named because it resembles a hemisphere. It is compact and allows high compression with a minimum of  detonation. The valves are placed on two planes, enabling the use of  larger valves. This improves "breathing" in the combustion chamber.  This type of chamber loses a little less heat than other types.  Because the hemispherical combustion chamber is so efficient, it is  often used, even though it costs more to produce.  
<P>
The wedge type combustion chamber resembles a wedge in shape. It is  part of the cylinder head. It is also very efficient, and more easily and cheaply produced than the hemispherical type.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Intake Stroke </B></FONT></CENTER>            

<P>
The first stroke is the intake stroke. The piston moves down the  cylinder and creates a partial vacuum in the cylinder. A mixture of  air and fuel is forced through the inlet valve into the cylinder by  atmospheric pressure, now greater than the pressure in the cylinder.  During this stroke, the exhaust valve stays closed.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Compression Stroke </B></FONT></CENTER>                
  
<P>
The second stroke is the compression stroke. The piston moves up in  the cylinder with both valves closed. The air and fuel mixture is  compressed and the pressure rises.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Power Stroke  </B></FONT></CENTER>                     

<P>
The third stroke is the power stroke. Near the end of the compression stroke, the air and fuel mixture is ignited by an electric spark from the spark plug. The combustion that occurs causes a rise in  temperature and enough pressure to force the piston down again.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Exhaust Stroke  </B></FONT></CENTER>                   

<P>
On the fourth stroke, or exhaust stroke, the piston moves up again  and forces the burned gases out of the cylinder and into the exhaust  system.

<FONT SIZE=4><B> Valve Lifter (Tappet)</B></FONT>
<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
The valve lifter is the unit that makes contact with the valve stem and the camshaft. It rides on the camshaft. When the cam lobes push it upwards, it opens the valve.  
<P>
The engine oil comes into the lifter body under pressure. It passes through a little opening at the bottom of an inner piston to a cavity underneath the piston. The oil forces the piston upward until it contacts the push rod. When the cam raises the valve lifter, the pressure is placed on the inner piston which tries to push the oil back through the little opening. It can't do this, because the opening is sealed by a small check valve.  
<P>
When the cam goes upward, the lifter solidifies and lifts the valve. Then, when the cam goes down, the lifter is pushed down by the push rod. It adjusts automatically to remove clearances.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Lifter Body</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The valve lifter body houses the valve lifter mechanism. The valve lifter is the unit that makes contact with the valve stem and the camshaft. It rides on the camshaft. When the cam lobes push it upwards, it opens the valve.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Valve Cover</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The valve cover covers the valve train. The valve train consists of rocker arms, valve springs, push rods, lifters and cam (in an overhead cam engine). The valve cover can be removed to adjust the valves. Oil is pumped up through the pushrods and dispersed underneath the valve cover, which keeps the rocker arms lubricated. Holes are located in various places in the engine head so that the oil recirculates back down to the oil pan. For this reason, the valve cover must be oil-tight; it is often the source of oil leaks.  
<P>
The valve cover is often distorted on older cars, because at some point the valve cover screws were over-tightened, bending the valve cover. This happens because the valve cover is made of very thin sheet metal and cannot withstand the force of an over-tightened bolt.
<P>
One way to determine if your valve cover is bent is to remove the gasket and put the valve cover back on to the cylinder head. When the valve cover and cylinder head come into contact, the cover should sit flat. If it rocks, it is bent. Cast aluminum valve covers cannot be straightened, they need to be replaced. Sheet metal valve covers can be straightened.  
<P>
A symptom of a bent or leaking valve cover is a pinching of the valve cover gasket. This means that the gasket is sealing one area and not sealing another area. This condition produces a leak; oil could be leaking down the side of the engine. Some valve covers are hard to access, because they are covered with other engine parts.  
<P>
Chronic valve cover leakage can sometimes be fixed by using two gaskets glued together instead of using just one.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Valve Ports</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Valve ports are openings in the cylinder head. Intake ports let the fuel mixture into the cylinder head, and exhaust ports let the exhaust out.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Valves </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The valve's job is to open and close the valve ports. If the ports were always open, the fuel exploded in the combustion chamber would leave through the ports. The explosion has to be kept in the combustion chamber to push the piston down. The valves are set up to open and close at exactly the right moment. One lets the fuel mixture in and closes. After the fuel explodes and pushes the piston down, the other valve lets the exhaust out.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Valve Guides</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The valves are usually held in an upright position by the valve stem. The valve stem is the long straight side of the valve, like the stem of a flower. Holes are bored in the cylinder head for the valve stems. Worn valve guides allow oil to enter the combustion chamber and cause blue smoke in the exhaust.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Valve Springs</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The valve springs keep the valves closed tightly against their seats until the valve is opened by the cam. After the cam turns (releasing pressure), the valve springs close the valves.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Valve Seals</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The valve seal is a unit that goes over the end of the valve stem. It keeps excess oil from getting between the valve guide and the valve stem.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>  Camshaft  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The camshaft is a round shaft with "lobes" (specially formed bumps) which is driven by the timing belt or timing chain. It, directly or through "lifters" and "pushrods" opens and closes the fuel and exhaust valves. The camshaft turns at one-half of the crankshaft speed. It is supported by bearings located in the front and rear of the crankcase.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Rocker arms</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Rocker arms are used to transmit force from cam to valve. Riding on a cam on the camshaft, rocker arms direct the upward motion of the lobe of the cam into an opening motion of the valve stem.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Push Rods </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Push Rods attach the valve lifter to the rocker arm. Through their centers, oil is pumped to lubricate the valves and rocker arms.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Electrical System (An Overview)</FONT></B>
<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
When the automotive industry was in its infancy, it used electricity only to ignite the fuel inside the engine. By the late 1920's, the electric starter replaced the hand crank, electric headlights made acetylene lamps obsolete and the braying of the electric horn drowned out the squeak of the hand-squeezed air horn. Today, an automobile requires an elaborate electrical system of circuits just to produce, store, and distribute all the electricity it requires simply for everyday operation. 
<P>
The first major component in the electrical system is the battery. The battery is used to store power for starting, and for running auxiliary devices such as clocks, radios and alarms when the engine is off. The next major component is the starter motor, which is used to start the engine. The third component is a charging device powered by the engine, known as the alternator.  It powers the electrical system when the car is running, and restores the charge within the battery. With these basic components, the car maintains its supply of electricity. A device called the voltage regulator keeps the power level stabilized, and the fuse box keeps minor problems from becoming major ones. 
<P>
Many different auxiliary electrical devices are used in modern cars, such as: radios, cellular phones, rear window defrosters and electric door locks, as well as a vast array of motors powering everything from the moonroof on down.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Battery</FONT></B></CENTER>                           

<P>
The car's initial source of electricity is a battery, whose most important function is to start the engine. Once the engine is running, an alternator takes over to supply the car's electrical needs and to restore energy to the battery.   
<P>
A 12-volt storage battery consists of layers of positively and negatively charged lead plates that, together with their insulated separators, make up each of six two-volt cells. The cells are filled with an electricity-conducting liquid (electrolyte) that is usually two-thirds distilled water and one-third sulfuric acid. Spaces between the immersed plates provide the most exposure to the electrolyte. The interaction of the plates and the electrolyte produces chemical energy that becomes electricity when a circuit is formed between the negative and positive battery terminals.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Starter</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The starter converts electricity to mechanical energy in two stages.  Turning on the ignition switch releases a small amount of power from the battery to the solenoid above the starter. This creates a magnetic field that pulls the solenoid plunger forward, forcing the attached shift yoke to move the starter drive so that its pinion gear meshes with the engine's crankshaft flywheel. When the plunger completes its travels, it strikes a contact that permits a greater amount of current to flow from the battery to the starter motor. The motor then spins the drive and turns the meshed gears to provide power to the crankshaft, which prepares each cylinder for ignition.  After the engine starts, the ignition key is released to break the starting circuit. The solenoid's magnetic field collapses and the return spring pulls the plunger back, automatically shutting off the starter motor and disengaging the starter drive.  
<P>
When the starter is not in use, the drive unit is retracted so that its pinion is disengaged from the flywheel. As soon as the starter is activated, the forward movement of the solenoid plunger causes the shift yoke to move the drive in the opposite direction and engage the pinion and flywheel. The pinion is locked to its shaft by a clutch that unlocks if the engine starts up and the flywheel begins turning the pinion faster than its normal speed. By allowing the pinion to spin freely for a moment, the clutch protects the motor from damage until the drive is retracted.  
<P>  

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Alternator or Generator</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The alternating-current generator, or alternator, is the electrical system's chief source of power while the engine is running. Its shaft is driven by the same belt that spins the fan. It converts mechanical energy into alternating-current electricity, which is then channeled through diodes that alter it to direct current for the electrical system and for recharging the battery.  
<P>                          

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Lighting Circuit</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The automobile lighting circuit includes the wiring harness, all the lights, and the various switches that control their use. The complete circuit of the modern passenger car can be broken down into individual circuits, each having one or more lights and switches. In each separate circuit, the lights are connected in parallel, and the controlling switch is in series between the group of lights and the fuse box. The parking lights, are connected in parallel and controlled by a single switch. In some installations, one switch controls the connection to the fuse box, while a selector switch determines which of two circuits is energized. The headlights, with their upper and lower beams, are an example of this type of switch.  Again, in some cases, such as the courtesy lights, several switches may be connected in parallel so that any switch may be used to turn on the lights.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Main Lighting Switch</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The main lighting switch (sometimes called the headlight switch) is the heart of the lighting system. It controls the headlights, parking lights, side marker lights, taillights, license plate light, instrument panel lights, and interior lights. Individual switches are provided for special purpose lights such as directional signals, hazard warning flashers, back up lights, and courtesy lights. The main lighting switch may be of either the "push-pull" or "push-pull with rotary contact" types. A typical switch will have three positions: off, parking, and headlamps. Some switches also contain a rheostat to control the brightness of the instrument panel lights.  The rheostat is operated by rotating the control knob, separating it from the push-pull action of the main lighting switch.  
<P>
When the main lighting switch completes the circuit to the headlamps, the low beam lights the way for city driving and for use when meeting oncoming traffic on the highway. When the dimmer switch is actuated, the single filament headlamps go "on," along with the high beam of the two filament headlamps. The next actuation of the dimmer switch returns the headlighting system to low beams only on the two filament lamps. Some cars are equipped with an electronic headlight dimming device, which automatically switches the headlights from high beam to low in response to light from an approaching vehicle or light from the taillight of a vehicle being overtaken. The dimmer switch in the automatic headlamp dimming system is a special override type. It is located in the steering column as part of a combination dimmer, horn, and turn signal switch. The override action occurs when a slight pull toward the driver on the switch lever provides high beam headlights regardless of the amount of light on the sensor-amplifier.
<P>
For some years there has been discussion about the advantages of a polarized headlight system. Such a system comprises headlights which produce polarized light in a particular plane. The windscreens of all cars would be fitted with polarizing glass, which would be oriented so that glare from an approaching vehicle would be essentially eliminated, while the forward vision would still be kept at the present levels. The advantages the system appear attractive, but the practical problems of making the transition are very great, since it would not be practical to convert all existing vehicles to this type of lighting. Also, any benefits would only be marginal because glare itself is not a frequent cause of accidents. However, many cars now have refracting or colored glass to cut down on glare.  
<P>
Due to recent legislation, newer cars in Texas with the dimmer switch mounted on the steering column will have to be refurbished with standard floor-mounted dimmers. Too many Aggies are being found in the ditch with their legs caught in the steering wheel.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Directional Signal Switch</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The directional signal switch is installed just below the hub of the steering wheel. A manually controlled lever projecting from the switch permits the driver to signal the direction in which he wants to turn. Moving the switch handle down will light the "turn signal" lamps on the left front and left rear of the car, signaling a left turn. Moving the switch upward will light the turn signal lamps on the right (front and rear), signaling a right turn. With the switch in a position to signal a turn, lights are alternately turned "on" and "off" by a turn signal flasher. Incorporated in the directional signal switch is a "lane change switch mechanism." This feature provides the driver the opportunity to signal a lane change by holding the turn lever against a detent, then releasing it to cancel the signal immediately after the maneuver is completed. 
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Stoplight Switch</FONT></B></CENTER>
 
<P>
In order to signal a stop, a brake pedal operated "stoplight switch" is provided to operate the vehicle's stop lamps. In addition to lighting the conventional rear lights, the switch also operates the center high-mounted stop lamp, that became mandatory on later models. Cruise control equipped vehicles may also utilize a vacuum release valve. In this case, both the vacuum release valve and the stoplight switch are actuated by movement of the brake pedal.
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Horn</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The car horn on passenger cars provides the driver with a means of sounding an audible warning signal. The horn electrical circuit generally includes: battery, fuse or fusible link, horn relay, horn(s), steering column wiring harness, horn switch, and body sheet metal. Often, a cadmium plated screw is used to ground the horn to the body of the vehicle. Horns usually are located in the forward part of the engine compartment or in the front fender well. The horn switch is built into the steering wheel or incorporated into the multi-functional switch lever, which includes turn signal and  dimmer switch.

The ancient Greeks had a word for it. Records show that as early as 600 BC the attractive properties of amber were known. Thales of Miletus (640-546 BC), one of the "seven wise men" of ancient Greece, is credited with having observed the attraction of amber for small fibrous materials and bits of straw. Amber was used by these people, even as it is now, for ornamental purposes. Just as the precious metals had their names of gold and silver, so amber had its name: "electron." It was later shown that the same effect can be obtained by rubbing a rod of glass or hard rubber with a handkerchief. Many other nonmetallic materials are found to have this property, which is known as "static electricity."  
<P>
All electrified materials behave either as glass or rubber. Glass has a "positive" charge and hard rubber has a "negative" charge. If you electrify two strips of hard rubber by rubbing them with fur, they will repel each other. Two glass rods will behave the same way.  But, if you electrify a rod of rubber and suspend it near an electrified rod of glass, they will attract each other. One of the most important laws of electricity is "Bodies with similar charges repel each other; bodies with opposite charges attract each other." A positive charge is designated with a (+); a negative charge by the sign (-).   
<P>
Although people have controlled electricity for many years, no one can explain exactly what it is. Many different theories have been given as to the nature of electricity through the years, but the modern one is the "Electron theory." In short, the electron theory proposes that all matter consists of tiny particles called molecules. These molecules are made up of two or more smaller particles called atoms. The atoms are then divided into smaller particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles are all the same in matter, whether in gas, liquid, or solid. The different properties or characteristics of the matter take form according to the arrangement and numbers of these particles which make up the atom. The proton has a natural positive charge of electricity; the electron has a negative charge; and the neutron has no charge at all, but just adds weight to the matter.
<P>
Protons and neutrons form the central core of the atoms about which the electrons rotate. The electrons carry small negative charges of electricity, which neutralize the positive charges of the protons.  The simplest atom of all is the hydrogen atom. It consists of one positive proton and one negative electron. Other atoms, such as those forming copper, iron, or silicon, are much more complicated. Copper, for example, has 29 electrons circling about its nucleus in four different orbits. While protons are much smaller than electrons in size, they contain the bulk of the mass of every atom. One proton, for example, weighs nearly two thousand times as much as an electron. The electrons therefore are light particles or objects around a small but relatively heavy nucleus.  
<P>
It is difficult to conceive the size of the atom. Research by physicists has established that the mass on one electron is about .000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,911 of a gram. If you assume that one proton in a hydrogen atom is the size of a baseball in Kansas City, then the electron would have an orbit which would reach from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific. Along with the extremely small size of electrons and protons, they are separated by relatively vast distances.  
<P>                     

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Conductors and Insulators</FONT></B></CENTER>
 
<P>
Not all substances are good conductors of electricity. As a general rule, metals are good conductors whereas nonmetals are poor conductors. The poorest of conductors are commonly called "insulators," or "nonconductors." Aluminum, copper, gold, iron, mercury, nickel, platinum, and silver are examples of good conductors. Amber, glass, mica, paper, porcelain, rubber, silk, and sulfur are all nonconductors. The difference between a conductor and an insulator is that in a conductor, there are free electrons, whereas in an insulator, all of the electrons are tightly bound to their respective atoms. In an uncharged body, there are an equal number of positive and negative charges. In metals, a few of the electrons are free to move from atom to atom, so that when a negatively charged rod is brought to the end of the conductor, it repels nearby free electrons in the conductor, causing them to move.  They in turn repel free electrons in front of them, giving rise to a flow of electrons all along the conductor. There are a large number of substances that are neither good conductors of electricity nor good insulators. These substances are called "semi-conductors." In them, electrons are capable of being moved only with some difficulty, i.e., with considerable force.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Electricity In Motion (Electrical Current)</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
When an electric charge is at rest it is spoken of as "static electricity," but when it is in motion, it is referred to as an "electric current." In most cases, an electric current is described as a flow of electric charge along a conductor. To make an electron current flow continuously along a wire, a continuous supply of electrons must be available at one end and a continuous supply of positive charges at the other. This is like the flow of water through a pipe: to obtain a continuous flow, a continuous supply of water must be provided at one end and an opening for its escape into some receptacle at the other. The continuous supply of positive charge at the one end of a wire offers a means of escape for the electrons. If this is not provided, electrons will accumulate at the end of the wire and the repulsion back along the wire will stop the current flow.  
<P>
The rate at which the free electrons drift from atom to atom determines the amount of electrical current. In order to create a drift of electrons through a circuit, it is necessary to have an electrical pressure, or "voltage." Electric current, then, is the flow of electrons. The more electrons in motion, the stronger the current. In terms of automotive applications, the greater the concentration of electrons at a battery or generator terminal, the higher the pressure between the electrons. The greater this pressure (voltage) is, the greater the flow of electrons.  
<P>
In modern electric car designs, the drive motors are often used as the brakes also, allowing them to switch over into performing as generators, which charge the batteries with the energy generated.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Electromagnetic Principles</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The connection between electricity and magnetism was made by Oersted, a Danish scientist, in 1820. He had frequently demonstrated the nonexistence of a connection between electricity and magnetism. His usual procedure was to place a current-carrying wire at right angles to, and directly over, a compass needle to show that there was no effect of one on the other. One occasion, at the end of his lecture, he placed the wire parallel to the compass needle and saw the needle move to one side. When he reversed the current in the wire, the needle, to his amazement, deviated in the opposite direction. Thus a great discovery concerning electromagnetism was made quite by accident.  
<P>
There is no actual knowledge as to why some materials have magnetic properties and others have not. The "electron theory" generally is accepted as the best explanation of magnetism. It is also known as the "domain theory."   
<P>
According to the theory, an electron moving in a fixed circular orbit around the proton creates a magnetic field with the north pole on one side of the orbit and a south pole on the other side. It is assumed that the orbiting electron carries a negative charge of electricity, which is the same as electrical current flowing through a conductor.  Current flow, then, is from negative to positive. When a number of magnetized orbiting electrons exist in a material, they interact with each other and form "domains," or groups of atoms having the same magnetic polarity. However, these domains are scattered in random patterns throughout and the material is, in effect, demagnetized.  Under the influence of a strong external magnetic field, domains become aligned and the total material is magnetized. The strength of its magnetic field depends on the number of domains that are aligned. In magnetic substances, the domains align themselves in parallel planes and in the same direction when placed in a magnetic field. This arrangement of the electron-created magnets produces a strong magnetic effect.   
<P>
If you stroke a piece of hardened steel with a magnet, the piece of steel itself will become a magnet. (Steel railroad tracks laid in a north-to-south direction become magnetized because they lie parallel to the magnetic lines of the earth.) Much stronger magnets and magnetic fields can be produced by electrical means. Placing a piece of steel in any strong magnetic field will cause it to become magnetized.  
<P>
A magnetized field surrounds any conductor carrying an electrical current. The discovery of that fact resulted in the development of much of our electrical equipment. The "field of force" is always at right angles to the conductor. Since the magnetic force is the only force known to attract a compass needle, it is obvious that a flow of electric current produces a magnetic field similar to that produced by a permanent magnet. Not only is the field of force at right angles to the conductor, but the field also forms concentric circles about the conductor. When the current in the conductor increases, the field of force is increased. Doubling the current will double the strength of the field of force.  
<P>  

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>The Left-Hand Rule (Magnetic Effect)</FONT></B></CENTER>
 
<P>
Oersted's experiment has been interpreted to mean that "around every wire carrying an electric current there is a magnetic field." The direction of this field at every point, like that around a bar magnet, can be mapped by means of a small compass or by iron filings. If a wire is mounted vertically through a hole in a plate of glass or other suitable nonconductor, and then iron filings are sprinkled on the plate, there will be a lining-up of the filings parallel to the magnetic field. The result shows that the magnetic lines of force or "lines of induction" are concentric circles whose planes are at right angles to the current.   
<P>
The "left-hand rule" used in electromagnetism can always be relied upon to give the direction of the magnetic field due to an electron current in a wire. Derived from experiment, the rule states: "if the current-carrying wire were to be grasped in the left hand, the thumb pointing in the direction of the electron current, negative (-) to positive (+), the fingers will point in the direction of the magnetic induction."
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Magnetic Properties of A Solenoid</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
Shortly after Oersted discovered the magnetic effect of a current-carrying wire, Ampere found that a loop or coil of wire (a single loop or a coil of several turns of wire) acted as a magnet. A coil of wire of this kind is sometimes referred as a "solenoid," or as a "helix." The magnetic lines of force in a solenoid are such that one side or end of the coil acts like a "N" magnetic pole and the other side or end like a "S" magnetic pole. At all points in the region around a coil of wire carrying a current, the direction of the magnetic field, as shown by a compass, can be predicted by the left-hand rule. Inside each loop or turn of wire, the lines point in one direction, whereas outside they point oppositely. Outside the coil, the lines go the same way they do about a permanent bar magnet, whereas inside the coil they go from "S" to "N". Not only does one coil of wire act like a magnet, but two coils will demonstrate the repulsion and attraction of like and unlike poles.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Electronics (Solid State)</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
Electronics refers to any electrical component, assembly, circuit, or system that uses solid state devices. "Solid state" means that these devices have no moving parts, other than electrons. Examples of solid state devices include semiconductor diodes, transistors, and silicon controlled rectifiers. These and many more have broad application in automotive electronics.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Semiconductors and Diodes</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
Semiconductors are made from material somewhere between the ranges of conductors and nonconductors. Semiconductors, basically, are designed to do one of three things: (1) stop the flow of electrons, (2) start the flow of electrons, or (3) control the amount of electron flow. A semiconductor diode is a two-element solid state electronic device.  It contains what is termed a "P" type material connected to a piece of "N" material. The union of the "P" and "N" materials forms a PN junction with two connections. The "anode" is connected to the P material; the "cathode" is connected to the N material. A diode is, in effect, a one-way valve. It will conduct current in one direction and remain non conductive in the reverse direction. When current flows through the diode, it is said to be "forward biased." When current flow is blocked by the diode, it is "reverse biased." When a diode is reverse biased, there is an extremely small current flow; actually, the current flow is said to be "negligible." When the P and N are fused together to form a diode, it can be placed in a circuit. The P material is connected to the positive side of the battery and the N material is connected to the negative side of the battery. Connected in this manner, current will flow. If connected in the reverse manner, current will not flow.  
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Transistors and Resistors</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
A transistor is a solid state device used to switch and/or amplify the flow of electrons in a circuit. A typical automotive switching application would be a transistorized ignition system in which the transistor switches the primary system off and on. An amplifying application could be in a stereo system where a radio signal needed strengthening.  
<P>
A transistor is a three-element device made of two semiconductor materials. The three elements are called "emitter," "base," and "collector." The outer two elements (collector and emitter) are made of the same material; the other element (base) is different. Each has a conductor attached. The materials used are labeled for their properties: "P" for positive, meaning a lack of electrons. It has "holes" ready to receive electrons. "N" is for negative, which means the materials has a surplus of electrons. The movement of a free electron from atom to atom leaves a hole in the atom it left. This hole is quickly filled by another free electron. As this movement is transmitted throughout the conductor, an electric current is created from the negative to the positive. At the same time, the "hole" has been moved backward in the conductor as one free electron after another takes its place in a sort of chain reaction. "Hole flow" is from positive to negative. Current flow in a transistor, then, may be either electron movement or hole flow, depending on the type of material, and this determines the type of transistor it is as well.  
<P>
In most 12 volt systems, a resistor is connected in series with the primary circuit of the ignition coil. During the cranking period, the resistor is cut out of the circuit so that full voltage is applied to the coil. This insures a strong spark during cranking, and quicker starting is provided. The starting circuit is designed so that as long as the starter motor is in use, full battery voltage is applied to the coil. When the starter is not cranking, the resistance wire is cut into the circuit to reduce the voltage applied to the coil. If the engine starts when the ignition switch is turned on, but stops when the switch is released to the run position, it can indicate that a resistor is bad and should be replaced.   
<P>
At no time should the resistor be bypassed out of the circuit, as that would supply constant battery voltage and burn out the coil. The resistor and resistor wires should always be checked when the breaker points are burned, or when the ignition coil is bad.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="coil">Coil</A></FONT></B></CENTER>
  
<P>
The coil is a compact, electrical transformer that boosts the battery's 12 volts to as high as 20,000 volts. The incoming 12 volts of electricity pass through a primary winding of about 200 turns of copper wire that raises the power to about 250 volts. Inside the distributor, this low-voltage circuit is continuously broken by the opening and closing of the points, each interruption causing a breakdown in the coil's electromagnetic field. Each time the field collapses, a surge of electricity passes to a secondary winding made up of more than a mile of hair-like wire twisted into 25,000 turns. At this point, the current is boosted to the high voltage needed for ignition and is then relayed to the rotor.
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="ignition">Ignition Circuit</A></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The distributor is separated into three sections: the upper, middle, and lower. In the middle section, the corners of the spinning breaker cam strike the breaker arm and separate the points some 160 miles an hour. (standard ignition) High-voltage surges generated by the action of the coil travel to the rotor that whirls inside a circle of high-tension terminals in the distributor cap. At each terminal, current is transferred to wires that lead to the spark plugs. Two other devices - the vacuum advance and the centrifugal advance - precisely coordinate the functions of the points and the rotor assembly as the requirements of the engine vary.
<P>
An ignition circuit consists of two sub-circuits: the primary, which carries low voltage; and the secondary, which carries high voltage.  The primary circuit, controlled by the ignition key, releases 12 volts of electricity from the battery or alternator through the coil to a set of breaker points in the lower part of the distributor, or to the relay in electronic ignition applications. When the points or relay are closed, current flows through the chassis back to the battery, completing the circuit. When the points or relay are open, the flow stops, causing a high-voltage surge to pass from the coil through a rotor in the top of the distributor to the spark plugs. Once the car has started, the voltage regulator protects the battery from being overcharged by the alternator. The condenser absorbs part of the low-voltage current when the points are open.
<P>
 
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="cei">Computerized and Electronic Ignition</A></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
In an electronic ignition, a rotating reluctor and magnetic-pickup coil replace the traditional cam, breaker points and condenser in the distributors of cars equipped for electronic ignition. This system reduces the time between tune-ups. The high spots of the reluctor interrupt the magnetic field of the pickup coil and the permanent magnet. These interruptions, or pulses, are transmitted from the pickup to a nearby electronic control unit. There, the pulses signal a transistor to break the low-voltage sub-circuit and release high voltage from the coil to the spark plugs.
<P>
The short-lived electronic ignition system was a transition from the points and condenser system to the computerized ignition system. It came into widespread use in the mid-1970s, but there are still a few engines that use electronic ignition.
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="starting">Starting Circuit</A></FONT></B></CENTER>
  
<P>
The starter circuit is activated when the ignition switch is turned on. This opens a second switch in the solenoid, permitting a second flow of electricity from the battery to the starter motor.  
<P>
The engine cranking circuit is made up of a battery, starting motor, ignition switch, and electrical wiring. When the ignition switch is placed in the "start" position, the solenoid windings are energized and the resulting shift lever movement causes the drive pinion gear to engage the flywheel ring gear, and cranking takes place. When the engine starts, an overrunning clutch (part of the drive assembly) protects the armature from too much speed until the switch is opened. At this time, a return spring causes the pinion gear to disengage from the flywheel.
<P>
 
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="plugwires">Spark Plug Wires</A></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The spark plug wire carries 20,000 or more volts from the distributor cap to the spark plug. Spark plug wires are made of various layers of materials. The fiber core, inside the spark plug wire carries the high voltage. The older design of spark plug wires used a metallic wire to carry the high voltage. This caused electrical interference with the radio and TV reception. Some spark plug wires have a locking connection at the distributor cap. The distributor cap must first be removed and the terminals be squeezed together, and then the spark plug wire can be removed from the distributor cap.
<P>
To reduce interference with radio and TV reception, ignition systems are provided with resistance in the secondary circuit. Resistor spark plugs or special resistor type ignition cable may be used.   
<P>
To work effectively in modern ignition systems, it is important that the resistor ignition cable is capable of producing a specifically designed resistance. The cable must also have enough insulation so that it can withstand heat, cold, moisture, oil, grease, and chafing. High tension electricity passing through a cable builds up a surrounding electrical field. The electrical field frees oxygen in the surrounding air to form ozone, which will attach to the rubber insulation if it is not properly protected. Ozone causes the rubber to deteriorate and lose its insulating qualities. Electrical losses will seriously weaken the spark at the plug gap.
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="cap">Distributor Cap</A></FONT></B></CENTER>
 
<P>
As the rotor rotates inside the cap, it receives the high voltage from the ignition coil, then passes it to the nearest connection, which is a metal projection in the cap, which is connected to a spark plug.
<P>
The distributor cap should be checked to see that the sparks have not been arcing from point to point within the cap. The inside of the cap must be clean. The firing points should not be eroded, and the inside of the towers must be clean and free from corrosion.
<P>
 
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="rotor">Distributor Rotor</A></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
A distributor rotor is designed to rotate and distribute the high tension current to the towers of the distributor cap. The firing end of the rotor, from which the high tension spark jumps to each of the cap terminals, should not be worn. Any wear will result in resistance to the high tension spark. The rotor with a worn firing end will have to be replaced.
<P>
Rotors are mounted on the upper end of the distributor shaft. In this connection, the rotor must have a snug fit on the end of the shaft.  On another design, two screws are used to attach the rotor to a plate on the top of the distributor shaft. Built-in locators on the rotor, and holes in the plate, insure correct reassembly. One locator is round; the other is square.
<P>
The rotor is driven directly by the camshaft, but is "advanced" (turned) by the centrifugal advance mechanism. Advancing the spark timing allows the engine to run efficiently. A vacuum advance is also fitted on some cars for the same reason.
<P>

<P>
Primary current produces a magnetic field around the coil windings.  This does not occur instantly, because it takes time for the current and the magnetic field to reach maximum value. The time element is determined by the resistance of the coil winding or the length of time the distributor contacts are closed. The current does not reach the maximum because the contacts remain closed for such a short time, and more so at higher engine speeds. When the breaker points begin to open, the primary current will continue to flow. This condition in a winding is increased by means of the iron core. Without an ignition condenser, the induced voltage causing this flow of current would create an arc across the contact points and the magnetic energy would be consumed in this arc. As a result, the contact points would be burned and ignition would not occur. The "condenser" prevents the arc by making a place for the current to flow. As a result of condenser action, the magnetic field produced and continued by the current flow will quickly collapse. It is the rapid cutting out of magnetic field that induces high voltage in the secondary windings. So, if the condenser should go bad, the high voltage needed to jump the gap at the spark plugs will not be possible. This could cause a no-start condition or a driving problem.

The ignition distributor makes and breaks the primary ignition circuit. It also distributes high tension current to the proper spark plug at the correct time. The distributor is driven at one half crankshaft speed on four cycle engines. It is driven by the camshaft. Distributor construction varies with the manufacturers, but the standard model is made of a housing into which the distributor shaft and centrifugal weight assembly are fitted with bearings. In most cases, these bearings are bronze bushings.
<P>
In standard ignition, the contact set is attached to the movable breaker plate. A vacuum advance unit attached to the distributor housing is mounted under the breaker plate. The rotor covers the centrifugal advance mechanism, which consists of a cam actuated by two centrifugal weights. As the breaker cam rotates, each lobe passes under the rubbing block, causing the breaker points to open. Since the points are in series with the primary winding of the ignition coil, current will pass through that circuit when the points close. When the points open, the magnetic field in the coil collapses and a high tension voltage is induced in the secondary windings of the coil by the movement of the magnetic field through the secondary windings.
<P>
The design is to provide one lobe on the breaker cam for each cylinder of the engine; i.e., a six cylinder engine will have a six lobe cam in the distributor; and an eight cylinder engine will have an eight lobe cam, so every revolution of the breaker came will produce one spark for each cylinder of the engine. However, on a four cycle engine, each cylinder fires every other revolution so the distributor shaft must revolve at one half crankshaft speed. After the high tension surge is produced in the ignition coil by the opening of the breaker points, the current passes from the coil to the center terminal of the distributor cap. From there, it passes down to the rotor mounted on the distributor shaft and revolves with it. The current passes along the rotor, and jumps the tiny gap to the cap electrode under which the rotor is positioned at that instant.    This cap electrode is connected by high tension wiring to the spark plug. As the rotor continues to rotate, it distributes current to each of the cap terminals in turn.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Spark Plugs</FONT></B>
<P>
</CENTER>                       
  
<P>
A spark plug is a device, inserted into the combustion chamber of an engine, containing a side electrode and insulated center electrode spaced to provide a gap for firing an electrical spark to ignite air-fuel mixtures.  
<P>
The high-voltage burst from the coil via the distributor is received at the spark plug's terminal and conducted down a center electrode protected by a porcelain insulator. At the bottom of the plug, which projects into the cylinder, the voltage must be powerful enough to jump a gap between the center and side electrodes through a thick atmosphere of fuel mixture. When the spark bridges the gap, it ignites the fuel in the cylinder.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Spark Plug Wear</FONT></B></CENTER>
  
<P>
The spark plugs ignite the fuel mixture in the cylinders by means of a burst of high-voltage electricity carried from the distributor. The ability of the spark to ignite the fuel is badly affected if the plugs are damaged or the spark gaps are abnormal. It is therefore important to examine used spark plugs closely and to clean them periodically. The gaps of old and new plugs should also be checked before installing them. There are three basic types of spark plug fouling: "carbon" fouling, "high speed" or "lead" fouling, and "oil/carbon" fouling.   
<P>
Carbon fouling is caused from low-speed operation or a fuel mixture that is too rich. It causes missing or roughness and creates soft black soot that is easily removed. Lead fouling is caused by tetraethyl lead used in some fuels and by extended high speed operation. Lead compounds which are added to the gasoline have a bad effect on some spark plug insulators. At high temperatures, it is a good conductor and may give good results under light loads, but often fails under full loads and high combustion temperatures. In some cases, it is possible to run the engine at a speed just below the point where missing will occur; then, increase the speed (always keeping below the missing speed) to burn off the lead fouling. Lead fouling appears as a heavy, crusty formation, or as tiny globules.   
<P>
The third type of fouling is found on engines that are so badly worn that excess oil reaches the combustion chamber past the piston ring, or the valve guides.   
<P>
In all cases of fouling or wear, it is best to replace the plugs. To avoid having to replace plugs one at a time as they wear out, always replace the entire set, even though only one plug may be bad. Plugs should normally be replaced about every 12,000 miles.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Coil</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The coil is a compact, electrical transformer that boosts the battery's 12 volts to as high as 20,000 volts. The incoming 12 volts of electricity pass through a primary winding of about 200 turns of copper wire that raises the power to about 250 volts. Inside the distributor, this low-voltage circuit is continuously broken by the opening and closing of the points, each interruption causing a breakdown in the coil's electromagnetic field. Each time the field collapses, a surge of electricity passes to a secondary winding made up of more than a mile of hair-like wire twisted into 25,000 turns. At this point, the current is boosted to the high voltage needed for ignition and is then relayed to the rotor.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Ignition Circuit</FONT></B></CENTER>
 
<P>
The distributor is separated into three sections: the upper, middle, and lower. In the middle section, the corners of the spinning breaker cam strike the breaker arm and separate the points some 160 miles an hour. (standard ignition) High-voltage surges generated by the action of the coil travel to the rotor that whirls inside a circle of high-tension terminals in the distributor cap. At each terminal, current is transferred to wires that lead to the spark plugs. Two other devices - the vacuum advance and the centrifugal advance - precisely coordinate the functions of the points and the rotor assembly as the requirements of the engine vary.
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
An ignition circuit consists of two sub-circuits: the primary, which carries low voltage; and the secondary, which carries high voltage.  The primary circuit, controlled by the ignition key, releases 12 volts of electricity from the battery or alternator through the coil to a set of breaker points in the lower part of the distributor, or to the relay in electronic ignition applications. When the points or relay are closed, current flows through the chassis back to the battery, completing the circuit. When the points or relay are open, the flow stops, causing a high-voltage surge to pass from the coil through a rotor in the top of the distributor to the spark plugs. Once the car has started, the voltage regulator protects the battery from being overcharged by the alternator. The condenser absorbs part of the low-voltage current when the points are open.                  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Computerized and Electronic Ignition</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
In an electronic ignition, a rotating reluctor and magnetic-pickup coil replace the traditional cam, breaker points and condenser in the distributors of cars equipped for electronic ignition. This system reduces the time between tune-ups. The high spots of the reluctor interrupt the magnetic field of the pickup coil and the permanent magnet. These interruptions, or pulses, are transmitted from the pickup to a nearby electronic control unit. There, the pulses signal a transistor to break the low-voltage sub-circuit and release high voltage from the coil to the spark plugs.  
<P>
The short-lived electronic ignition system was a transition from the points and condenser system to the computerized ignition system. It came into widespread use in the mid-1970s, but there are still a few engines that use electronic ignition.
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Starting Circuit</FONT></B></CENTER>
  
<P>
The starter circuit is activated when the ignition switch is turned on. This opens a second switch in the solenoid, permitting a second flow of electricity from the battery to the starter motor.  
<P>
The engine cranking circuit is made up of a battery, starting motor, ignition switch, and electrical wiring. When the ignition switch is placed in the "start" position, the solenoid windings are energized and the resulting shift lever movement causes the drive pinion gear to engage the flywheel ring gear, and cranking takes place. When the engine starts, an overrunning clutch (part of the drive assembly) protects the armature from too much speed until the switch is opened. At this time, a return spring causes the pinion gear to disengage from the flywheel.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Spark Plug Wires</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The spark plug wire carries 20,000 or more volts from the distributor cap to the spark plug. Spark plug wires are made of various layers of materials. The fiber core, inside the spark plug wire carries the high voltage. The older design of spark plug wires used a metallic wire to carry the high voltage. This caused electrical interference with the radio and TV reception. Some spark plug wires have a locking connection at the distributor cap. The distributor cap must first be removed and the terminals be squeezed together, and then the spark plug wire can be removed from the distributor cap.  
<P>
To reduce interference with radio and TV reception, ignition systems are provided with resistance in the secondary circuit. Resistor spark plugs or special resistor type ignition cable may be used.   
<P>
To work effectively in modern ignition systems, it is important that the resistor ignition cable is capable of producing a specifically designed resistance. The cable must also have enough insulation so that it can withstand heat, cold, moisture, oil, grease, and chafing. High tension electricity passing through a cable builds up a surrounding electrical field. The electrical field frees oxygen in the surrounding air to form ozone, which will attach to the rubber insulation if it is not properly protected. Ozone causes the rubber to deteriorate and lose its insulating qualities. Electrical losses will seriously weaken the spark at the plug gap.
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Distributor Cap</FONT></B></CENTER>
 
<P>
As the rotor rotates inside the cap, it receives the high voltage from the ignition coil, then passes it to the nearest connection, which is a metal projection in the cap, which is connected to a spark plug.   
<P>
The distributor cap should be checked to see that the sparks have not been arcing from point to point within the cap. The inside of the cap must be clean. The firing points should not be eroded, and the inside of the towers must be clean and free from corrosion.   
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Distributor Rotor</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
A distributor rotor is designed to rotate and distribute the high tension current to the towers of the distributor cap. The firing end of the rotor, from which the high tension spark jumps to each of the cap terminals, should not be worn. Any wear will result in resistance to the high tension spark. The rotor with a worn firing end will have to be replaced.  
<P>
Rotors are mounted on the upper end of the distributor shaft. In this connection, the rotor must have a snug fit on the end of the shaft.  On another design, two screws are used to attach the rotor to a plate on the top of the distributor shaft. Built-in locators on the rotor, and holes in the plate, insure correct reassembly. One locator is round; the other is square.  
<P>
The rotor is driven directly by the camshaft, but is "advanced" (turned) by the centrifugal advance mechanism. Advancing the spark timing allows the engine to run efficiently. A vacuum advance is also fitted on some cars for the same reason.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Condenser</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
Primary current produces a magnetic field around the coil windings.  This does not occur instantly, because it takes time for the current and the magnetic field to reach maximum value. The time element is determined by the resistance of the coil winding or the length of time the distributor contacts are closed. The current does not reach the maximum because the contacts remain closed for such a short time, and more so at higher engine speeds. When the breaker points begin to open, the primary current will continue to flow. This condition in a winding is increased by means of the iron core. Without an ignition condenser, the induced voltage causing this flow of current would create an arc across the contact points and the magnetic energy would be consumed in this arc. As a result, the contact points would be burned and ignition would not occur. The "condenser" prevents the arc by making a place for the current to flow. As a result of condenser action, the magnetic field produced and continued by the current flow will quickly collapse. It is the rapid cutting out of magnetic field that induces high voltage in the secondary windings. So, if the condenser should go bad, the high voltage needed to jump the gap at the spark plugs will not be possible. This could cause a no-start condition or a driving problem.  
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Breaker Point (Standard) Ignition</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The ignition distributor makes and breaks the primary ignition circuit. It also distributes high tension current to the proper spark plug at the correct time. The distributor is driven at one half crankshaft speed on four cycle engines. It is driven by the camshaft. Distributor construction varies with the manufacturers, but the standard model is made of a housing into which the distributor shaft and centrifugal weight assembly are fitted with bearings. In most cases, these bearings are bronze bushings.

<BR>
</CENTER> 
                        
<P>
This diagram shows the flow of fuel and exhaust within a V8 engine. It shows the timing chain (driven by the crankshaft) drives the camshaft, which opens the valves. Fuel enters the cylinders via the intake manifold. The spark-caused explosions force the pistons down.  Rotation of the crank forces the pistons back up, which expels the exhaust.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Engine's Lubrication System  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
This animation shows the route taken by the oil within an engine. The oil pump draws oil from the oil pan, then forces it through the filter, into the crankshaft passage, through the connecting rods to the pistons and rings. Oil is pushed through the lifters and pushrods, and covers the rocker arms. It then flows back down into the pan to complete the cycle.   
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Piston, Rings, and Wrist Pin </B></FONT></CENTER>  
 
<P>
The piston converts the potential energy of the fuel, into the kinetic energy that turns the crankshaft. The piston is a cylindrical shaped hollow part that moves up and down inside the engine's cylinder. It has grooves around its perimeter near the top where rings are placed. The piston fits snugly in the cylinder. The piston rings are used to ensure a snug "air tight" fit.  
<P>
The piston requires four strokes (two up and two down) to do its job. The first is the intake stroke. This is a downward stroke to fill the cylinder with a fuel and air mixture. The second is an upward stroke to compress the mixture. Right before the piston reaches its maximum height in the cylinder, the spark plug fires and ignites the fuel. This action causes the piston to make its third stroke (downward). The third stroke is the power stroke; it is this stroke that powers the engine. On the fourth stroke, the burned gases are sent out through the exhaust system.  
<P>
The wrist pin connects the piston to the connecting rod. The connecting rod comes up through the bottom of the piston. The wrist pin is inserted into a hole (about half way up) that goes through the side of the piston, where it is attached to the connecting rod.  
<P>
Pistons are made of aluminum, because it is light and a good heat conductor. Pistons perform several functions. Pistons transmit the driving force of combustion to the crankshaft. This causes the crankshaft to rotate. The piston also acts as a moveable gas-tight plug that keeps the combustion in the cylinder. The piston acts as a bearing for the small end of the connecting-rod. Its toughest job isto get rid of some of the heat from combustion, and send it elsewhere.  
<P>
The piston head or "crown" is the top surface against which the explosive force is exerted. It may be flat, concave, convex or any one of a great variety of shapes to promote turbulence or help control combustion. In some, a narrow groove is cut into the piston above the top ring to serve as a "heat dam" to reduce the amount of heat reaching the top ring.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Timing Chain/belt</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The automobile engine uses a metal timing chain, or a flexible toothed timing belt to rotate the camshaft. The timing chain/belt is driven by the crankshaft. The timing chain, or timing belt is used to "time" the opening and closing of the valves. The camshaft rotates once for every two rotations of the crankshaft.
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Cylinder Head</B></FONT></CENTER>
                              
<P>
The cylinder head is the metal part of the engine that encloses and covers the cylinders. Bolted on to the top of the block, the cylinder head contains combustion chambers, water jackets and valves (in overhead-valve engines). The head gasket seals the passages within the head-block connection, and seals the cylinders as well.
<P>
Henry Ford sold his first production car, a 2-cylinder Model A, on July 23, 1903.
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Push Rods</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Push Rods attach the valve lifter to the rocker arm. Through their centers, oil is pumped to lubricate the valves and rocker arms.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Flywheel</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The flywheel is a fairly large wheel that is connected to the crankshaft. It provides the momentum to keep the crankshaft turning without the application of power. It does this by storing some of the energy generated during the power stroke. Then it uses some of this energy to drive the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons during the three idle strokes of the 4-stroke cycle. This makes for a smooth engine speed. The flywheel forms one surface of the clutch and is the base for the ring gear.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Harmonic Balancer (Vibration Damper)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The harmonic balancer, or vibration damper, is a device connected to the crankshaft to lessen the torsional vibration. When the cylinders fire, power gets transmitted through the crankshaft. The front of the crankshaft takes the brunt of this power, so it often moves before the rear of the crankshaft. This causes a twisting motion. Then, when the power is removed from the front, the halfway twisted shaft unwinds and snaps back in the opposite direction.  Although this unwinding process is quite small, it causes "torsional vibration." To prevent this vibration, a harmonic balancer is attached to the front part of the crankshaft that's causing all the trouble. The balancer is made of two pieces connected by rubber plugs, spring loaded friction discs, or both.  
<P>
When the power from the cylinder hits the front of the crankshaft, it tries to twist the heavy part of the damper, but ends up twisting the rubber or discs connecting the two parts of the damper. The front of the crank can't speed up as much with the damper attached; the force is used to twist the rubber and speed up the damper wheel. This keeps the crankshaft operation calm.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Crankshaft</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The crankshaft converts the up and down (reciprocating) motion of the pistons into a turning (rotary) motion. It provides the turning motion for the wheels. It works much like the pedals of a bicycle, converting up-down motion into rotational motion.  
<P>
The crankshaft is usually either alloy steel or cast iron. The crankshaft is connected to the pistons by the connecting-rods.  
<P>
Some parts of the shaft do not move up and down; they rotate in the stationary main bearings. These parts are known as journals.  There are usually three journals in a four cylinder engine.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Main Bearings </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The crankshaft is held in place by a series of main bearings. The largest number of main bearings a crankshaft can have is one more than the number of cylinders, but it can have one less bearing than the number of cylinders.  
<P>
Not only do the bearings support the crankshaft, but one bearing must control the forward-backward movement of the crankshaft. This bearing rubs against a ground surface of the main journal, and is called the "thrust bearing."  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Connecting Rod </B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
The connecting rod links the piston to the crankshaft. The upper end has a hole in it for the piston wrist pin and the lower end (big end) attaches to the crankshaft.  
<P>
Connecting rods are usually made of alloy steel, although some are made of aluminum.  
<P>

Connecting rod bearings are inserts that fit into the connecting rod's lower end and ride on the journals of the crankshaft.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Oil Pump </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The oil pump is used to force pressurized oil to the various parts of the engine.   
<P>
Gear and rotary pumps are the most common types of pumps. The gear pump consists of a driven spur gear and a driving gear that is attached to a shaft driven by the camshaft. The two gears are the same size and fit snugly in the pump body. Oil is carried from the inlet to the delivery side of the pump by the opposite teeth of both gears. Here it is forced into the delivery pipe. It can't flow back, because the space between the meshing gear teeth is too tight.  
<P>
The rotary pump is driven by the camshaft. The inner rotor is shaped like a cross with rounded points that fit into the star shape of the outer rotor. The inner rotor is driven by a shaft turned by the camshaft. When it turns, its rounded points "walk" around the star shaped outer rotor and force the oil out to the delivery pipe.
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Piston Motion/Bicycle </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The pistons in your engine's cylinder are similar to your legs when you ride a bicycle. Think of your legs as pistons; they go up and down on the pedals, providing power. The pedals are like the connecting rods; they are "attached" to your legs. The pedals are attached to the bicycle crank, which is like the crank shaft, because it turns the wheels.  
<P>
To reverse this, the pistons (legs) are attached to the connecting rods (pedals) which are attached to the crankshaft (bicycle crank). The power from the combustion in the cylinders powers the piston to push the connecting rods to turn the crankshaft.  
<P>
The bicycle played a large part in the process of inventing the automobile; in fact, in 1896, the first car that Henry Ford produced was even called a "Quadricycle."  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Engine Placement</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Mid-engine sports coupes have the engine mounted in front of the rear axle. Passenger space is limited to two people. Concentrating the weight in the center of the car improves handling.
<P>
The conventional sports coupe's engine is in the front of the car, driving either the front or rear wheels. This layout reduces production costs, but luggage space and rear seat room are sacrificed for the sporty styling.  
<P>
Vans have engines located in either the front or the rear. Contemporary sedans have the engine in the front driving the front or rear axle.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Cylinder </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A cylinder is a round hole through the block, bored to receive a piston. All automobile engines, whether water-cooled or air-cooled, four cycle or two cycle, have more than one cylinder. These multiple cylinders are arranged in-line, opposed, or in a V. Engines for other purposes, such as aviation, are arranged in other assorted forms.
<P>
The first four cylinder engine with a sliding transmission was in the 1907 Buick.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Oil Seals  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Oil seals are rubber and metal composite items. They are generally mounted at the end of shafts. They are used to keep fluids, such as oil, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid inside the object they are sealing. These seals flex to hold a tight fit around the shaft that comes out of the housing, and don't allow any fluid to pass. Oil seals are common points of leakage and can usually be replaced fairly inexpensively. However, the placement of some seals make them very difficult to access, which makes for a hefty labor charge!  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Engine Oil Dip Stick</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The engine oil dip stick is a long metal rod that goes into the oil sump. The purpose of the dip stick is to check how much oil is in the engine.  
<P>
The dip stick is held in a tube; the end of the tube extends into the oil sump. It has measurement markings on it. If you pull it out, you can see whether you have enough oil, or whether you need more by the level of oil on the markings.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Oil Filler Cap  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The oil filler cap is a plastic or metal cap that covers an opening into the valve cover. It allows you to add oil when the dipstick indicates that you need it. Some cars have the crankcase vented through the filler cap. Oil which is added through the filler passes down through openings in the head into the oil sump at the bottom of the engine.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Oil Filter</B></FONT></CENTER>
                                 
<P>
Oil filters are placed in the engine's oil system to strain dirt and abrasive materials out of the oil.   
<P>
The oil filter cannot remove things that dilute the oil, such as gasoline and acids. Removing the solid material does help cut down on the possibility of acids forming. Removing the "grit" reduces the wear on the engine parts.  
<P>
Modern passenger car engines use the "full flow" type of oil filters. With this type of filter, all of the oil passes through the filter before it reaches the engine bearings. If a filter becomes clogged, a bypass valve allows oil to continue to reach the bearings. The most common type of oil filter is a cartridge type. Oil filters are disposable; at prescribed intervals, this filter is removed, replaced and thrown away.  Most states now require that oil filters be drained completely before disposal, which adds to the cost of an oil change, but helps to reduce pollution.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Oil Passages</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Within the engine is a variety of pathways for oil to be sent to moving parts.  These pathways are designed to deliver the same pressure of fresh lubricating oil to all parts.  If the pathways become clogged, the affected parts will lock together. This usually destroys parts that are not lubricated, and often ruins the entire engine.  
<P>
The oil passages are cleverly drilled into the connecting parts of the engine, which allows the highly mobile ones (like the pistons) to have ample lubrication. Originating at the oil pump, they flow through all of the major components of the engine.  In the case of the pistons and rods, the passages are designed to open each time the holes in the crankshaft and rods align.
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Oil Pan </B></FONT></CENTER> 
                                 
<P>
At the bottom of the crankcase is the container containing the lifeblood of the engine.  Usually constructed of thin steel, it collects the oil as it flows down from the sides of the crankcase. The pan is shaped into a deeper section, where the oil pump is located. At the bottom of the pan is the drain plug, which is used to drain the oil. The plug is often made with a magnet in it, which collects metal fragments from the oil.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Serpentine Belts </B></FONT></CENTER>                           

<P>
A recent development is the serpentine belt, so named because they wind around all of the pulleys driven by the crankshaft pulley. This design saves space, but if it breaks, everything it drives comes to a stop.

<FONT SIZE=4><B> The Steering/Suspension System (Overview)</B></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
"Suspension," when discussing cars, refers to the use of front and rear springs to suspend a vehicle's "sprung" weight. The springs used on today's cars and trucks are constructed in a variety of types, shapes, sizes, rates, and capacities. Types include leaf springs, coil springs, air springs, and torsion bars. These are used in sets of four for each vehicle, or they may be paired off in various combinations and are attached by several different mounting techniques. The suspension system also includes shocks and/or struts, and sway bars.  
<P>
Back in the earliest days of automobile development, when most of the car's weight (including the engine) was on the rear axle, steering was a simple matter of turning a tiller that pivoted the entire front axle. When the engine was moved to the front of the car, complex steering systems had to evolve. The modern automobile has come a long way since the days when "being self-propelled" was enough to satisfy the car owner. Improvements in suspension and steering, increased strength and durability of components, and advances in tire design and construction have made large contributions to riding comfort and to safe driving.  
<P>
Cadillac allegedly produced the first American car to use a steering wheel instead of a tiller.  
<P>
Two of the most common steering mechanisms are the "rack and pinion" and the standard (or recirculating-ball) systems, that can be either manual or assisted by power. The rack and pinion was designed for sports cars and requires too much driver muscle at low speeds to be very useful in larger, heavier cars. However, power steering makes a heavy car respond easily to the steering wheel, whether at highway speeds or inching into a narrow parking place, and it is normal equipment for large automobiles.  
<P>
The suspension system has two basic functions, to keep the car's wheels in firm contact with the road and to provide a comfortable ride for the passengers. A lot of the system's work is done by the springs. Under normal conditions, the springs support the body of the car evenly by compressing and rebounding with every up-and-down movement. This up-and-down movement, however, causes bouncing and swaying after each bump and is very uncomfortable to the passenger. These undesirable effects are reduced by the shock absorbers.   
<P>              

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Steering Systems</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The manual steering system incorporates: 1. steering wheel and column, 2. a manual gearbox and pitman arm or a rack and pinion assembly, 3. linkages; steering knuckles and ball joints; and 4. the wheel spindle assemblies.   
<P>
In Pittman arm systems, the movement inside the steering box causes the Pitman shaft and arm to rotate, applying leverage to the relay rod, which passes the movement to the tie rods.   
<P>
Power steering systems add a hydraulic pump; fluid reservoir; hoses; lines; and either a power assist unit mounted on, or integral with, a power steering gear assembly.  
<P>
There are several different manual steering gears in current use. The "rack and pinion" type is the choice of most manufacturers. The "recirculating ball" type is a past favorite because the balls act as a rolling thread between the wormshaft and the ball nut. Another manual steering gear once popular in imported cars is the "worm and sector" type. Other manual gears are the "worm and tapered pin steering gear" and the "worm and roller steering gear."   
<P>
The steering wheel and column are a major source of injury to the driver, and a range of energy-absorbing and non-intrusion designs have been developed. There is great variation in these designs, some of which are now thought to be not fully effective.   
<P>
Energy-absorbing columns have to serve two functions. First, they must stop the steering wheel and column from being pushed to the rear as the front of the car is crushed in an impact. Before such designs were invented, a common feature of driver injury was for the chest to be impaled by the steering column. The energy-absorbing column must also provide the driver with a tolerable impact as he moves forward and strikes the wheel with his chest. At that point in the crash, the column should build up the load on the driver's chest to a tolerable level, and then deform under that load to give a "ride-down" for the driver.  
<P>
Several design problems are presented in providing this system. One major problem is that collapse of the column due to the frontal crush of the car should not hinder its performance for providing ride-down for the driver's chest. The system must also be so designed that under crash conditions, the wheel stays in such a position that it will strike the driver's chest and not move upwards into the region of his face, or downwards into his abdomen.   
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Steering Linkage</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The steering linkage is made of interconnected parts which move every time the steering wheel is turned. The rotating movement of the steering column activates mechanisms inside the steering box. Tie rod ends, which join the key parts, pass on the steering wheel's motion no matter what the angle of the linkage or the vibration from the road. In a pitman arm steering setup, the movement inside the steering box causes the Pitman shaft and arm to rotate, applying leverage to the relay rod, which passes the movement to the tie rods. The steering arms pick up the motion from the tie rods and cause the steering knuckles to  turn the wheels. The steering linkages need regular maintenance for safe operation, such as lubrication and inspection. Faulty steering links can cause tire wear at the least, and complete loss of control of the vehicle at worst. "Popping" noises (when turning the wheels) usually indicate worn out steering linkages.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Rack and Pinion Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A typical rack and pinion steering gear assembly consists of a pinion shaft and bearing assembly, rack gear, gear housing, two tie rod assemblies, an adjuster assembly, dust boots and boot clamps, and grommet mountings and bolts. When the steering wheel is turned, this manual movement is relayed to the steering shaft and shaft joint, and then to the pinion shaft. Since the pinion teeth mesh with the teeth on the rack gear, the rotary motion is changed to transverse movement of the rack gear. The tie rods and tie rod ends then transmit this movement to the steering knuckles and wheels.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Recirculating Ball Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
With the manual recirculating ball steering gear, turning forces are transmitted through ball bearings from a "worm gear" on the steering shaft to a sector gear on the pitman arm shaft. A ball nut assembly is filled with ball bearings, which "roll" along grooves between the worm teeth and grooves inside the ball nut. When the steering wheel is turned, the worm gear on the end of the steering shaft rotates, and movement of the recirculating balls causes the ball nut to move up and down along the worm. Movement of the ball nut is carried to the sector gear by teeth on the side of the ball nut. The sector gear then moves with the ball nut to rotate the pitman arm shaft and activate the steering linkage. The balls recirculate from one end of the ball nut to the other through ball return guides.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Worm and Sector Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The manual worm and sector steering gear assembly uses a steering shaft with a three-turn worm gear supported and straddled by ball bearing assemblies. The worm meshes with a 14-tooth sector attached to the top end of the pitman arm shaft. In operation, a turn of the steering wheel causes the worm gear to rotate the sector and the pitman arm shaft. This movement is transmitted to the pitman arm and throughout the steering train to the wheel spindles.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Worm and Tapered Peg Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The manual worm and tapered peg steering gear has a three-turn worm gear at the lower end of the steering shaft supported by ball bearing assemblies. The pitman shaft has a lever end with a tapered peg that rides in the worm grooves. When the movement of the steering wheel revolves the worm gear, it causes the tapered peg to follow the worm gear grooves. Movement of the peg moves the lever on the pitman shaft which in turn moves the pitman arm and the steering linkage.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Worm and Roller Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The manual worm and roller steering gear is used by various manufacturers. This steering gear has a three-turn worm gear at the lower end of the steering shaft. Instead of a sector or tapered peg on the pitman arm shaft, the gearbox has a roller assembly (usually with two roller teeth) that engages the worm gear. The assembly is mounted on anti-frictional bearings. When the roller teeth follow the worm, the rotary motion is transmitted to the pitman arm shaft, pitman arm and into the steering linkage.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Steering</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Over the years, power steering has become a standard equipment item on many automobiles. The demand for this system has caused power steering to be installed on over 90%% of all domestic new car production. All systems require a power steering pump attached to the engine and driven by a belt, a pressure hose assembly, and a return line. Also, a control valve is incorporated somewhere in the hydraulic circuit. "Power steering" is really "power assisted steering." All systems are constructed so that the car can be steered manually when the engine is not running or if any failure occurs in the power source.   
<P>
Most power steering pumps contain a flow control valve, which limits fluid flow to the power cylinder to about two gallons per minute, and a relief valve which limits pressure according to system demands.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Rack and Pinion</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Power rack and pinion steering assemblies are hydraulic/ mechanical unit with an integral piston and rack assembly. An internal rotary valve directs power steering fluid flow and controls pressure to reduce steering effort. The rack and pinion is used to steer the car in the event of power steering failure, or if the engine (which drives the pump) stalls.  
<P>
When the steering wheel is turned, resistance is created by the weight of the car and tire-to-road friction, causing a torsion bar in the rotary valve to deflect. This changes the position of the valve spool and sleeve, thereby directing fluid under pressure to the proper end of the power cylinder. The difference in pressure on either side of the piston (which is attached to the rack) helps move the rack to reduce turning effort. The fluid in the other end of the power cylinder is forced to the control valve and back to the pump reservoir. When the steering effort stops, the control valve is centered by the twisting force of the torsion bar, pressure is equalized on both sides of the piston, and the front wheels return to a straight ahead position.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Integral Power Steering Gears</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A representative of an integral power steering gear is used on certain General Motors rear-wheel drive cars and on American Motors four-wheel drive. This power steering gear uses a recirculating ball system in which steel balls act as rolling threads between the steering worm shaft and the rack piston. The key to its operation is a rotary valve that directs power steering fluid under pressure to either side of the rack piston. The rack piston converts hydraulic power to mechanical force. The rack piston moves up inside the gear when the worm shaft turns right. It moves down when the worm shaft turns left. During these actions, the steel balls recirculate within the rack piston, which is power assisted in movement by hydraulic pressure. (See also Manual Recirculating Ball Steering)  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Steering Hoses</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The power steering hoses are used to transmit hydraulic fluid under pressure from the pump to the power cylinder and to return. Besides this, the hoses must provide the proper amount of expansion to absorb any shock surge and offer enough restriction to the fluid flow to keep the pump cavity full of fluid at all times.  
<P>
Power steering hoses are specially designed rubber hoses with metal fittings at each end which screw together with your power steering system. They contain power steering fluid at high pressures, and allow the system to circulate the fluids between the pump and the power cylinders.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Shock Absorbers</B></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
In the past, a wide variety of direct and indirect shock absorbing devices were used to control spring action of passenger cars.  Today, direct, double-acting hydraulic shock absorbers and shock absorber struts have almost universal application.
<P>
The operating principle of direct-acting hydraulic shock absorbers is in forcing fluid through restricting openings in the valves.  This restricted flow serves to slow down and control rapid movement in the car springs as they react to road irregularities. Usually, fluid flow through the pistons is controlled by spring-loaded valves. Hydraulic shock absorber automatically adapt to the severity of the shock. If the axle moves slowly, resistance to the flow of fluid will be light. If the axle movement is rapid or violent, the resistance is stronger, since more time is required to force fluid through the openings. By these actions and reactions, the shock absorbers permit a soft ride over small bumps and provide firm control over spring action for cushioning large bumps. The double-acting units must be effective in both directions because spring rebound can be almost as violent as the original action that compressed the shock absorber.  
<P>
In the 1930s, there was a school for chauffeurs of the Rolls Royce. Since the car had a reputation to maintain for its smooth and quiet ride, the students had to pass a special test. They were required to drive a Phantom II model with a glass of water on the radiator without spilling a drop!  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Coil Springs</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Compression type coil springs may be mounted between the lower control arm and spring housing or seat in the frame. Other front suspension systems have the coil springs mounted above the upper control arms, compressed between a pivoting spring seat bolted to the control arm and a spring tower formed in the front end sheet metal. When coil springs are used in both front and rear suspension, three or four control arms are placed between the rear axle housing and the frame to carry driving and brake torque. The lower control arms pivot in the frame members and sometimes support the rear coil springs to provide for up-and-down movement of the axle and wheel assembly.   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Leaf Springs</B></FONT></CENTER> 
   
<P>
Front leaf springs are used with solid axle beams in most truck applications. Corvettes use single-leaf, filament-wound, glass/epoxy front and rear springs mounted transversely; i.e., they are crosswise to the vehicle's centerline. Rear leaf springs are used on trucks and some passenger cars. Single leaf or multi-leaf springs are usually mounted longitudinally over the front axle beam or under the rear axle housing. The spring center bolt fastens the leaves together, and its head locates the spring in the front axle beam or saddle on the rear axle housing. U-bolts clamp the spring firmly in place and keep it from shifting.  Eyebolts, brackets, and shackles attach it to the frame at each end. Leaf springs also serve as control arms, locating the rear end in position and transferring force to the chassis.  
<P>                           

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Torsion Bars</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P> 
   Torsion bar suspension uses the flexibility of a steel bar or tube, twisting lengthwise to provide spring action. Instead of the flexing action of a leaf spring, or the compressing-and-extending action of a coil spring, the torsion bar twists to exert resistance against up-and-down movement. Two rods of spring steel are used in this type of suspension. One end of the bar is fixed solidly to a part of the frame behind the wheel; the other is attached to the lower control arm. As the arm rises and falls with wheel movement, the bar twists and absorbs more of the road shocks before they can reach the body of the car. The bar untwists when the pressure is released, just like a spring rebounding after being compressed.  
<P>
Adjusting the torsion bars controls the height of the front end of the vehicle. The adjusting bolts are located at the torsion bar anchors in the front crossmember. The inner ends of the lower control arms are bolted to the crossmember and pivot through a bushing.   
<P>                       

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Shock Absorber Struts</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
A strut is a structural piece designed to resist pressure in the direction of its length. On typical "MacPherson Strut" use, the shock absorber is built into the strut. Most shock absorber struts are hydraulic units. Some MacPherson systems used on Ford vehicles are equipped with low-pressure, gas-filled shock struts. They are nonadjustable and nonrefillable. Like the hydraulic shock struts, faulty units must be replaced as an assembly. Another similar front suspension system is called the "hydraulic shock strut." This strut serves as a shock absorber and replaces the upper control arm. The coil spring, however, is located between the lower control arm and the body structure instead of being mounted directly on the strut.

A tire is a tubular corded carcass covered with rubber or synthetic rubber, which is mounted on a wheel and inflated to provide traction for moving a vehicle and for assisting the brakes in stopping it. Today`s tires, when properly inflated, will absorb bumps on a road's surface and give a safe, comfortable ride, while providing a reassuring grip on the road at all speeds.  
<P>
There are two basic types of tire: the tubeless tire for passenger cars and light-duty trucks; and those requiring inner tubes for medium and heavy-duty trucks.   
<P>
In 1830, Charles Goodyear experimented with turning raw rubber into a more solid and useful product. He bought a load of raw rubber from a shoe factory on credit and couldn't pay. He wound up in debtor's prison and started his experiments. He finished his sentence, and kept on experimenting.
<P>
In 1839, Goodyear invited some friends over to a fund-raiser for his experiments. He showed them a ball of rubber that he had hardened on the surface to prove to them that his experiments were worthy of their money. At this point he accidentally threw the rubber ball into the hot wood stove. While he was scraping the ball off with a knife, he realized that the rubber had hardened into just the right texture. This was the start of "vulcanization" and the rubber tire industry.  
<P>
Tires have changed a great deal since the 1950s. New rubber components have been introduced into tire compounds which improve the skid resistance. Recently new types have been developed to cope with the dangers of sudden deflation. One of the most interesting of these is a tire mounted on a relatively narrow wheel, so that the tire can be run totally deflated without damage to the tire side walls. In addition, the tire contains a special liquid which, when the tire is run under the deflated condition, vaporizes and generates a pressure so that the tire will partially reinflate.  
<P>                     

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Tire Types and Markings</B></FONT></CENTER>
    
<P>
Size, shape, materials, and construction are all factors that will govern tires' longevity as well as the ride they furnish. The first and most important rule in choosing tires is to follow the directions and recommendations in the owner's manual. Check out the information embossed on the sidewall as well. This information can help the owner choose a set of tires that will suit both the car and the driver's personal needs. The markings on a tire will give the weight (load), size designation, serial number, tire type, carcass cords, DOT, and profile size. Other markings on the tire will probably be the brand name and the name of the tire.  
<P>
The "size designation" is a combination of one letter and four numbers and is a three-part code.   
<P>
The letter denotes the sidewall-to-sidewall width of the tire; the two numbers grouped with the letter refer to the height-to-width ratio; and the numbers following the dash indicate in inches the diameter of the wheel rim the tire will fit. To replace the tire, the own will find the sizes that will fit the car specified in the owner's manual.  
<P>
As to "tire type," government regulations require that every passenger tire be stamped either "tubeless" or "tube-type," but more than 90%% of the passenger cars are tubeless. "Belted" would indicate that a tire has extra strength in its construction. In addition, if the tire were a radial, it would be designated as such - a necessary precaution because radials should not be mixed with other tire types except when the radials are used as the pair on the rear axle.  
<P>                           

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Bias Ply Tires</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
There are three general methods of arranging or laying down the tire plies. They may be laid down "on the bias," "on the bias and belted," or "radially."  
<P>
The standard, and least expensive, tire is a bias ply. In this type of ply, the cord strips are arranged diagonally (i.e., at a bias) to the center line of the tread and alternate plies are reversed to cross at a 30 or 40 degree angle. The result is a uniformly firm body, which will wear satisfactorily at moderate speeds, with sidewalls that can stand curb bruises. In fast driving or hard turning, however, the tread elements squirm together and spring apart, producing heat that weakens the tires.  
<P>
A veterinarian named John Dunlop in Belfast, Ireland gets credit for  inventing the pneumatic tire. In 1888 he tried making better tires  for his son's bicycle by using linen-covered sheet rubber. Although  he was granted a patent for bicycle and tricycle tires, he sold his  idea in 1889. The man he sold it to was named Harvey du Cros, Jr.,  who started the Dunlop Rubber Company. Dunlop himself was never part of the company.
<P>                         

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Tire Rotation</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The tire-rotation procedures charted below are not as difficult as they seem. At any given time, only one chart will pertain to any car. First find the number and type of tires you will be rotating.  Then read down the column at the left. The top entry on the left is for regular rotation without snow tires. The second and third rows are for snow tire rotation. Remember, if radial tires are used in the front, then the snow tires should be radial also. When storing tires, it is a good idea to record its position on the inner face of each one, using chalk or tape. This will help when remounting the tire.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Tire Valves</B></FONT></CENTER>                       

<P>
The tire valve is really an air check that opens under air pressure and closes when pressure is removed. The inner valve or "valve core," acts as a check valve for the air. Positive sealing is provided by the "valve cap," which contains a soft rubber washer or gasket. It is this gasket, pressed against the end of the "valve stem," that seals the air in the tire. The careless practice of operating tires without the valve cap should not be followed, because, without the valve cap in place, there is usually a slow leak of air from the tire, causing the tire to run in an underinflated condition. If air should leak out around the base of the valve, it will be necessary to install a new tire valve assembly. This is easily accomplished with a special lever-type tool.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Sprung and Unsprung Weight</B></FONT></CENTER>                    
<P>
"Sprung" weight is a term used to describe the parts of an automobile that are supported by the front and rear springs. They suspend the vehicle's frame, body, engine, and the power train above the wheels. These are quite heavy assemblies.  
<P>
The "unsprung" weight includes wheels and tires, brake assemblies, the rear axle assembly, and other structural members not supported by the springs.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Sway Bar</B></FONT></CENTER>                              
<P>
Some cars require stabilizers to steady the chassis against front end roll and sway on turns. Stabilizers are designed to control this centrifugal tendency that forces a rising action on the side toward the inside of the turn. When the car turns and begins to lean over, the sway bar uses the upward force on the outer wheel to lift on the inner wheel, thus keeping the car more level.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Control Arms</B></FONT></CENTER>                          
<P>
A control arm is a bar with a pivot at each end, used to attach  suspension members to the chassis.  
<P>
When coil springs are used in both front and rear suspension, three or four control arms are placed between the rear axle housing and the frame to carry driving and brake torque. The lower control arms pivot on the frame members and sometimes support the rear coil springs to provide for up-and-down movement of the axle and wheel assembly.  
<P>
A-arms are control arms with two inboard pivots, giving strength. Some front end designs use control arms instead of A-arms, usually to save weight and add adjustability.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Fuel System (Overview)</B></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
The purpose of the fuel system is to provide a mixture of fuel and air to the engine of the car. The air-fuel mixture must be in proportion to the speed and load placed on the engine. Major parts of the system include: fuel tank and cap, emission controls, fuel line, fuel pump, fuel filter, carburetor, and intake manifold as well as the fuel gauge, which indicates the amount of fuel in the tank.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Engine Fuel</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Engine fuel is mainly made up of hydrogen and carbon, mixed so that it will burn with oxygen present, and will free its heat energy into mechanical energy. Liquid fuels are ideal for internal combustion engines, because they can be economically produced, have a high heat value per pound, an ideal rate of burning, and can be easily handled and stored. The most common engine fuels are gasoline, kerosene and Diesel fuel oil.  
<P>
Gasoline has many advantages and is used to a greater extent than any other fuel in internal combustion engines having spark ignition. It has a better burning rate than other fuels, and, because it vaporizes easily, it gives quick starting in cold weather, smooth acceleration and maximum power.   
<P>
Diesel fuel oil ranks next to gasoline in quantity used. It can be produced as cheaply as gasoline, but its use is limited to Diesel type engines. The use of kerosene as a fuel is usually limited to farm tractors, marine and stationary engines, all which operate at a fairly constant speed. Its traits are such that it cannot be properly mixed with air and controlled in variable speed engines.   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Octane Rating</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A gasoline's ability to resist detonation is called its "octane" or anti-knock rating. Gasoline from asphaltic base crude oil produces less knock than one from paraffinic base crude. Cracked gas has less tendency to knock than straight run gas. All marketed gasolines are a blend of straight run and cracked gasolines, so unless their blending is controlled, the anti-knock qualities will vary.  
<P>
A mixture of iso-octane, which has a very high anti-knock rating, and heptane, which makes a pronounced knock, is used as a reference fuel to establish an anti-knock standard. The anti-knock value or octane number is represented by the percentage of volume of iso-octane that must be mixed with normal heptane in order to duplicate the knocking of the gasoline which is being tested. These ratings range from 50 in third grade gasolines to 110 in aviational fuels. The rating of 100 means a fuel having an anti-knock value equal to that of iso-octane.  If the octane rating of a gasoline is naturally low, the fuel will detonate as it burns and power will be applied to the pistons in hammer-like blows. The ideal power is that which pushes steadily on the pistons, rather than hammer against them. The octane rating of a gasoline can be raised by treating it with a chemical which is not a fuel. The best chemical known is tetra-ethyl lead compound, which is added to the gasoline.  
<P>
Tetra-ethyl lead is a liquid which mixes thoroughly with gasoline and vaporizes completely. Ethylene dibromide prevents the tetra-ethyl lead from forming lead oxide deposits on spark plugs and on valve seats and stems. Red dye is added to identify an ethyl treated gasoline and to warn against its being used as anything but an engine fuel. In 1975, it became illegal to use a leaded gasoline except in cars built prior to this time. With the addition of the catalytic converter, it is undesirable to burn leaded fuel, because leaded fuel will clog the converter and increase the back-pressure of the exhaust.   
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Tank</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
All modern fuel systems are fed through a pump, so the fuel tank is usually at the rear of the chassis under the trunk compartment. Some vehicles have a rear engine with the tank in the forward compartment. The fuel tank stores the excess fuel until it is needed for operation of the vehicle. The fuel tank has an inlet pipe and an outlet pipe. The outlet pipe has a fitting for fuel line connection and may be located in the top or in the side of the tank. The lower end is about one-half inch above the bottom of the tank so that collected sediment will not be flushed out into the carburetor. The bottom of the tank contains a drain plug so that tank may be drained and cleaned.  
<P>
The gas tank of the early cars was placed higher than the engine. The idea was that the gas would flow down to the engine. This arrangement caused a problem when the car went uphill -- the gas flowed away from the engine.
<P>
Solution: drive up the hill backwards!  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Filter</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Clean fuel is important, because of the many small jets and passages in the carburetor and openings in a fuel injector. To ensure this cleanliness, fuel filters are installed in the fuel line. Fuel filters can be located at any point between the fuel tank and the carburetor. One may be in the tank itself, in the fuel pump or in the carburetor. The most common placement is between the fuel tank and a mechanical fuel pump. In this case, the fuel enters a glass bowl and passes up through the filter screen and out through an outlet. Any water or solid material which is trapped by the filter will fall to the bottom of the glass bowl where it can be easily seen and removed. Dirt particles usually come from scales of rust in the tank cars, storage tanks or drums. Water comes from condensed moisture in the fuel tanks.   
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Pump</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
The fuel pump has three functions: to deliver enough fuel to supply the requirements of an engine under all operating conditions, to maintain enough pressure in the line between the carburetor and the pump to keep the fuel from boiling, and to prevent vapor lock. Excessive pressure can hold the carburetor float needle off its seat, causing high gasoline level in the float chamber. This will result in high gasoline consumption. The pump generally delivers a minimum of ten gallons of gasoline per hour at top engine speeds, under an operating pressure of from about 2 1/2 to 7 pounds. Highest pressure occurs at idling speed and the lowest at top speed. Although fuel pumps all work to produce the same effect, there are various types that may operate somewhat differently.   
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Mechanical Fuel Pump</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
The mechanical fuel pump differs in that it has a vacuum booster section. The vacuum section is operated by the fuel pump arm; otherwise, it has nothing to do with the fuel system. During the suction (or first) stroke, the rotation of the eccentric on the camshaft puts the pump operating arm into motion, pulling the lever and diaphragm down against the pressure of the diaphragm spring and producing suction (vacuum) in the pump chamber. The suction will hold the outlet valve closed and pull the inlet valve open, causing fuel to flow through the filter screen and down through the inlet valve of the pump chamber.   
<P>
During the return stroke, the diaphragm is forced up by the diaphragm spring, the inlet valve closes and the outlet valve opens to allow fuel to flow through the outlet to the carburetor. The operating lever is hinged to the pump arm, so that it can move down but cannot be raised by the pump arm. The pump arm spring forces the arm to follow the cam without moving the lever. The lever can only be moved upward by the diaphragm spring. This process causes fuel to be delivered to the carburetor only when the fuel pressure in the outlet is less than the pressure maintained by the diaphragm spring. This happens when the passage of fuel from the pump into the carburetor float chamber is open and the float needle is not seated.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Electric Fuel Pump</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Electric fuel pumps have been used for many years on trucks, buses and heavy equipment, and they have also been used as replacements for mechanically operated fuel pumps on automobiles, but only recently have they become part of a car's original equipment. The replacement types usually use a diaphragm arrangement like the mechanical pumps, except that it is actuated by an electrical solenoid.   
<P>
The electrically driven turbine type of pump, first used on the Buick Riviera, was a great departure from the usual fuel pump design. It uses a small turbine wheel driven by a constant speed electric motor. The entire unit is located in the fuel tank and submerged in the fuel itself. This pump operates continuously when the engine is running. It keeps up a constant pressure which is capable of supplying the maximum fuel demands of the engine. When less fuel is required, the pump does not deliver at full potential, because the turbine is not a positive displacement type like the mechanical pump.  Consequently, the turbine will run without pumping fuel and so, needs no means of varying fuel delivery rate like its mechanical counterpart. Since the fuel can flow past the spinning turbine blades, there is no need for pump inlet and outlet valves nor is there any need to vary its speed.  
<P>
A relay for the electric fuel pump is used to complete the circuit to the fuel pump. This cuts off current to the fuel pump in the event of an accident.   
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Vacuum Pump</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Several fuel pumps have a vacuum booster section that operates the windshield wipers at an almost constant speed. The fuel section then functions in the same way as ordinary fuel pumps. One difference is that the rotation of the camshaft eccentric in the vacuum pump also operates the vacuum booster section by actuating the pump arm, which pushes a link and the bellows diaphragm assembly upward, expelling air in the upper chamber through its exhaust valve out into the intake manifold. On the return stroke of the pump arm, the diaphragm spring moves the bellows diaphragm down, producing a suction in the vacuum chamber. The suction opens the intake valve of the vacuum section and draws air through the inlet pipe from the windshield wipers.   
<P>
When the wipers are not operating, the intake manifold suction (vacuum) holds the diaphragm up against the diaphragm spring pressure so that the diaphragm does not function with every stroke of the pump arm. When the vacuum is greater than the suction produced by the pump, the air flows from the windshield wiper through the inlet valve and vacuum chamber of the pump and out the exhaust valve outlet to the manifold, leaving the vacuum section inoperative. With high suction in the intake manifold, the operation of the wiper will be the same as if the pump were not installed. When the suction is low, as when the engine is accelerated or operating at high speed, the suction of the pump is greater than that in the manifold and the vacuum section operates the wipers at a constant speed. Some pumps have the vacuum section located in the bottom of the pump instead of in the top, but the operation is basically the same.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Air Cleaners</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Air cleaners are made to separate dust and other particles in the incoming air before it enters the carburetor. Thousands of cubic feet of air are drawn from within the car hood and passed through the engine cylinders, so it is important that the air is clean.  
<P>
When driving on dirt or other dusty roads, dust particles are drawn through the radiator and find their way into the engine if it is not filtered and cleaned. Dust and other foreign materials in the engine will cause excessive wear and operating problems.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Gauges</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Cars are equipped with fuel gauges which are operated along with the vehicle's electrical system. There are two types: the thermostatic type and the balancing coil type. The thermostatic type is made of a standing unit, located in the fuel tank, and the gauge itself (registering unit), which is located on the instrument panel. The fuel gauge used in some cars and trucks is of the electrically operated balanced coil type. These have a dash unit and a tank unit.  The dash unit has two coils, spaced about 90 degrees apart, with an armature and integral pointer at the intersections of the coil axis.  The dial has a scale in fractions between "Empty" and "Full". The tank unit has a housing, which encloses a rheostat, and a sliding brush which contacts the rheostat. The brush is actuated by the float arm. The movement of the float arm is controlled by the height of the fuel in the supply tank. The height of the fuel (called variations in resistance) changes the value of the dash unit coil so that the pointer indicates the amount of fuel available. A calibrated friction brake is included in the tank unit to prevent the wave motions of the fuel from fluctuating the pointer on the dash unit. Current from the battery passes through the limiting coil to the common connection between the two coils, which is the lower terminal on the dash unit.  The current is then offered two paths, one through the operating coil of the dash unit and the other over the wire to the tank unit. When the tank is low or empty, the sliding brush cuts out all resistance in the tank unit. Most of the current will pass through the tank unit circuit because of the low resistance and only a small portion through the operating coil to the dash unit. As a result, this coil is not magnetized enough to move the dash unit pointer, which is then held at the "Empty" position by the limiting coil.   
<P>
If the tank is partly full or full, the float rises on the surface of the fuel and moves the sliding brush over the rheostat, putting resistance in the tank unit circuit. More current will then pass through the operating coil to give a magnetic pull on the pointer, which overcomes some of the pull of the limiting coil. When the tank is full, the tank unit circuit contains the maximum resistance to the flow of the current. The operating coil will then receive its maximum current and exert pull of the pointer to give a "Full" reading. As the tank empties, the operating coil loses some of its magnetic pull and the limiting coil will still have about the same pull so that the pointer is pulled toward the lower reading. Variations in battery voltage will not cause an error in the gauge reading because its operation only depends on the difference in magnetic effect between the two coils.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Lines</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Fuel lines, which connect all the units of the fuel system, are usually made of rolled steel or, sometimes, of drawn copper. Steel tubing, when used for fuel lines, is generally rust proofed by being copper or zinc plated.   
<P>
Fuel lines are placed as far away from exhaust pipes, mufflers, and manifolds as possible, so that excessive heat will not cause vapor lock. They are attached to the frame, the engine, and other units in such a way that the effect of vibration is minimal, and so that they are free of contact with sharp edges which might cause wear. In areas where there is a lot of movement, as between the car`s frame and rubber-mounted engine, short lengths of gasoline resistant flexible tubing are used.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Intake Manifolds</B></FONT>
</CENTER>                     

<P>
An intake manifold is a system of passages which conduct the fuel mixture from the carburetor to the intake valves of the engine.  Manifold design has much to do with the efficient operation of an engine. For smooth and even operation, the fuel charge taken into each cylinder should be of the same strength and quality.   
<P>
Distribution of the fuel should, therefore, be as even as possible.  This depends greatly upon the design of the intake manifold. Dry fuel vapor is an ideal form of fuel charge, but present-day fuel prevents this unless the mixture is subjected to high temperature. If the fuel charge is heated too highly, the power of the engine is reduced because the heat expands the fuel charge. Therefore, it is better to have some of the fuel deposited on the walls of the cylinders and manifold vents. Manifolds in modern engines are designed so that the amount of fuel condensing on the intake manifold walls is reduced to a minimum.  
<P>
In a V-8 engine, the intake manifold is mounted between the cylinder heads. The L-head engine's manifold is bolted to the side of the block, and the I-head manifold is bolted to the cylinder head.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Ram Induction Manifolds</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The ram induction manifold system consists of twin air cleaners, twin four-barrel carburetors and two manifolds containing eight long tubes of equal length (four for each manifold).  
<P>
This system was designed by the Chrysler Company to increase power output by in the middle speed range (1800-3600 rpm). Each manifold supplies one bank of cylinders and is carefully calculated to harness the natural supercharging effect of a ram induction system. By taking advantage of the pulsations in the air intake column caused by the valves opening and closing, sonic impulses help pack more mixture into the combustion chambers.   
<P>
In the Chrysler system, the air-fuel mixture from each carburetor flows into a chamber directly below the carburetor, then passes through the long individual intake branches to the opposite cylinder bank. The right-hand carburetor supplies the air-fuel mixtures for the left-hand cylinder bank, and the left-hand carburetor supplies the right cylinder bank. The passages between the manifolds are interconnected with a pressure equalizer tube to maintain balance of the engine pulsations.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manifold Heat Control</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Most engines have automatically operated heat controls which use the exhaust gases of the engine to heat the incoming fuel-air charge during starting and warm-up. This improves vaporization and mixture distribution. When the engine is cold, all of the exhaust gas is deflected to and around the intake manifold "hot spot". As the engine warms up, the thermostatic spring is heated and loses tension. This allows the counterweight to change the position of the heat control valve gradually so that, at higher driving speeds with a thoroughly warmed engine, the exhaust gases are passed directly to the exhaust pipe and muffler.   
<P>
In the ram induction system, there is a heat control chamber in each manifold to operate the automatic choke and to heat the fuel mixture after warm-up. A heat control valve in each exhaust manifold will by-pass the exhaust gas through an elbow to the intake manifold heat control chamber. Heat outlet pipes then carry the gas down to the "Y" connector under the heat control valve.   
<P>
Heat control is regulated by a coiled thermostatic spring mounted on the exhaust manifold. A counterweight is mounted on the other end of the heat control valve shaft and this counterweight, in conjunction with the thermostatic spring, operates to close and open the heat control valve.   
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Carburetor</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
The purpose of the carburetor is to supply and meter the mixture of fuel vapor and air in relation to the load and speed of the engine.  Because of engine temperature, speed, and load, perfect carburetion is very hard to obtain.   
<P>
The carburetor supplies a small amount of a very rich fuel mixture when the engine is cold and running at idle. With the throttle plate closed and air from the air cleaner limited by the closed choke plate, engine suction is amplified at the idle-circuit nozzle. This vacuum draws a thick spray of gasoline through the nozzle from the full float bowl, whose fuel line is closed by the float-supported needle valve. More fuel is provided when the gas pedal is depressed for acceleration. The pedal linkage opens the throttle plate and the choke plate to send air rushing through the barrel. The linkage also depresses the accelerator pump, providing added gasoline through the accelerator-circuit nozzle. As air passes through the narrow center of the barrel, called the "venturi", it produces suction that draws spray from the cruising-circuit nozzle. The float-bowl level drops and causes the float to tip and the needle valve to open the fuel line.  
<P>
To cause a liquid to flow, there must be a high pressure area (which in this case is atmospheric pressure) and a low pressure area. Low pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. The average person refers to a low pressure area as a vacuum. Since the atmospheric pressure is already present, a low pressure area can be created by air or liquid flowing through a venturi. The downward motion of the piston also creates a low pressure area, so air and gasoline are drawn through the carburetor and into the engine by suction created as the piston moves down, creating a partial vacuum in the cylinder. Differences between low pressure within the cylinder and atmospheric pressure outside of the carburetor causes air and fuel to flow into the cylinder from the carburetor.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Supercharger</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
A supercharger is a compressor. Hence, a supercharged engine has a higher overall compression than a nonsupercharrged engine having the same combustion chamber volume and piston displacement and will burn more fuel. Unfortunately, the increase in power is not proportional to the increase in fuel consumption. There are two general models of    superchargers, the Rootes type and the centrifugal type. The Rootes "blower" has two rotors, while the centrifugal uses an impeller rotating at high speed inside a housing.  
<P>
Superchargers can be placed between the throttle body of the carburetor or fuel injection system and the manifold; or at the air inlet before the throttle body. Racing cars usually have it located between the throttle body and the manifold. This design has the advantage that the fuel can be supplied through the throttle body without modification to any part of the system. If the supercharger is placed in front of the throttle body, fuel must be supplied under sufficient pressure to overcome the added air pressure created by the supercharger. The advantage of a supercharger over a turbocharger is that there is no lag time of boost; the moment the accelerator pedal is depressed, the boost is increased.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Turbocharger</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A turbocharger, or supercharger, can boost engine power up to 40%%. The idea is to force the delivery of more air-fuel mixture to the cylinders and get more power from the engine. A turbocharger is a supercharger that operates on exhaust gas from the engine.  
<P>
Although turbochargers and superchargers perform the same function, the turbocharger is driven by exhaust gases, while the supercharger is driven by belts and gears. The turbocharger has a turbine and a compressor, and requires less power to be driven than a supercharger. The pressure of the hot exhaust gases cause the turbine to spin. Since the turbine is mounted on the same shaft as the compressor, the compressor is forced to spin at the same time, drawing 50%% more air into the cylinders than is drawn in without the turbocharger. This creates more power when the air-fuel mixture explodes.  
<P>
A turbocharged engine's compression ratio must be lowered by using a lower compression piston, since an excessive amount of pressure will wear on the piston, connecting rods, and crankshaft, and destroy the engine. All of these parts then, as well as the transmission, must be strengthened on a turbocharged engine or it will be torn apart by the increased horsepower.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Breathers</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The breather is the positive crankcase ventilation system directing atmospheric pressure to the crankcase. The atmospheric pressure then pushes the blowby gases to a low pressure area. The air that is directed into the crankcase must first be filtered; if it is not, the dust and sand particles will destroy the engine parts.  When there is too much blowby, it is routed back through the crankcase breather element. It then enters the carburetor or throttle body with the incoming fresh air to be burned in the cylinders. In addition, the breather helps to keep the regular air filter cleaner for a longer period of time, since blowby contains oil vapor from the crankcase.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Float Circuit</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Fuel in the carburetor must be maintained at a certain level under all operating conditions; this is the function of the float circuit.  The needed fuel level is maintained by the float. When its attached lever forces the needle valve closed, the flow of fuel from the pump is stopped. As soon as fuel is discharged from the float bowl, the float drops. The needle valve opens and fuel flows into the bowl again. In this way, the fuel is level to the opening of the main discharge nozzle. The float level must be set with a high degree of accuracy. If the level is too low, not enough fuel will be supplied to the system and the engine will stall on turns; if the level is too high, too much fuel will flow from the nozzle.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Metering Rod</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A metering rod varies the size of the carburetor jet opening. Fuel from the float bowl is metered through the jet and the metering rod within it. The fuel is forced from the jet to the nozzle extending into the venturi. As the throttle valve is opened, its linkage raises the metering rod from the jet. The rod has several steps, or tapers, on the lower end. As it is raised in the jet, it makes the opening of the jet greater in size. This allows more fuel to flow through the jet to the discharge nozzle. The metering must keep pace with the slightest change in the throttle valve position so that the correct air-fuel mixture is obtained in spite of engine speed.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Choke Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Chokes perform the fuel mixture adjustments necessary to start a cold engine. When the fuel-air mixture is too cold, the engine won't start properly, or will stall out periodically. The choke when engaged (closed) the choke causes the fuel air mixture to be increased, or "enriched". The choke is a special valve placed at the mouth of the carburetor so that it partially blocks off the entering air. When the choke plate closes, the vacuum below it increases, drawing more fuel from the fuel bowl. The rich fuel mixture burns even at lower temperatures, allowing the engine to warm up.  
<P>
The manual choke is a knob on the dash, usually the push-pull type, which extends from the choke on the carburetor to the instrument panel. The driver closes the choke when starting the engine. The main thing to know about a manual choke is to push it back in when the engine has reached normal operating temperature. The trouble with the manual choke is that the driver often forgets to open it fully. This results in a rich fuel mixture which causes carbon to form in the combustion chambers and on the spark plugs. To correct this problem, the automatic choke was developed.  
<P>
The automatic choke relies on engine heat. The choke valve is run by a thermostat which is controlled by exhaust heat. When the engine is cold, the valve will be closed for starting. As the engine warms, the exhaust heat will gradually open the choke valve. An automatic choke depends on a thermostatic coil spring unwinding as heat is supplied.  As the engine warms up, manifold heat is transmitted to the choke housing. The heat causes the bimetal spring to relax, opening the valve.  
<P>
An electric heating coil in the automatic choke shortens the length of time that the choke valve is closed. As the spring unwinds, it causes the choke valve in the carburetor air horn to open. This lets more air pass into the carburetor. The coil is mounted in a well in the exhaust crossover passage of the intake manifold. Movement of the bimetal spring is relayed to the choke valve shaft by means of linkage and levers.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Injection</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The carburetor, despite all it advances: air bleeds, correction jets, acceleration pumps, emulsion tubes, choke mechanisms, etc., is still a compromise. The limitations of carburetor design is helping to push the industry toward fuel injection.   
<P>
Direct fuel injection means that the fuel is sprayed directly into the combustion chamber. The fuel injected nozzle is located in the combustion chamber.  
<P>
Throttle Body injection systems locate the injector(s) within the air intake cavity, or "throttle body". Multi-point systems use one injector per cylinder, and usually locate the injectors at the mouth of the intake port.  
<P>
The fuel injector is an electromechanical device that sprays and atomizes the fuel. The fuel injector is nothing more than a solenoid through which gasoline is metered. When electric current is applied to the injector coil, a magnetic field is created, which causes the armature to move upward. This action pulls a spring-loaded ball or "pintle valve" off its seat. Then, fuel under pressure can flow out of the injector nozzle. The shape of the pintle valve causes the fuel to be sprayed in a cone-shaped pattern. When the injector is de-energized, the spring pushes the ball onto its seat, stopping the flow of fuel.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Mechanical Fuel Injection</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Mechanical fuel injection is the oldest of the fuel injection systems. It uses a throttle linkage and a governor. It is now used mainly on diesel engines. Hydraulic fuel injection is used by some of the imports. Hydraulic pressure is applied to a fuel distributor as a switching device to route fuel to a specific injector. The fuel from the tank is carried under pressure to the fuel injector(s) by an electric fuel pump, which is located in or near the fuel tank. All excess is returned to the fuel tank.   
<P>
                             
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Electronic Fuel Injection</B></FONT></CENTER>
                          
<P>
The principle of electronic fuel injection is very simple. Injectors are opened not by the pressure of the fuel in the delivery lines, but by solenoids operated by an electronic control unit. Since the fuel has no resistance to overcome, other than insignificant friction losses, the pump pressure can be set at very low values, consistent with the limits of obtaining full atomization with the type of injectors used. The amount of fuel to be injected is determined by the control unit on the basis of information fed into it about the engine's operating conditions. This information will include manifold pressure, accelerator enrichment, cold-start requirements, idling conditions, outside temperature and barometric pressure. The systems work with constant pressure and with "variable timed" or "continuous flow" injection. Compared with mechanical injection systems, the electronic fuel injection has an impressive set of advantages. It has fewer moving parts, no need for ultra-precise machining standards, quieter operation, less power loss, a low electrical requirement, no need for special pump drives, no critical fuel filtration requirements, no surges or pulsations in the fuel line and finally, the clincher for many car makers, lower cost.   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Throttle Valve</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
All gasoline engines have a throttle valve to control the volume of intake air. The amount of fuel and air that goes into the combustion chamber regulates the engine speed and, therefore, engine power. The throttle valve is linked to the accelerator (gas pedal). The throttle valve is a butterfly valve that usually consists of a disc mounted on a spindle. The disc is roughly circular, and it has the same diameter as the main air passage in the throat or "venturi". In a carburetor, the throttle valve is usually located at the bottom of the carburetor, between the jet nozzle and the intake manifold. The throttle spindle is connected to the accelerator in such a manner that when the pedal is depressed, the valve opens. When the pedal is released, the valve closes. Fuel injected engines use throttle valves to regulate engine power, even though the fuel is also regulated through the injectors.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Idle Circuit</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The fuel delivery in a carburetor tends to lag behind the motion of the throttle. The basic carburetor operates when the throttle valve is fully open or partially open, but not when it's closed. No driver wants the engine to stop every time the foot leaves the accelerator; such a car would be tiring and stressful to drive, even in the best of road conditions, let alone in a traffic situation. To keep the engine running smoothly and evenly when no power is needed, the idle circuit was added inside the carburetor. The idle jet admits fuel on the engine side of the throttle valve. Additional air is mixed with this fuel through an air bleed. The result is an entirely separate carburetor circuit which operates only when the throttle valve is closed.   
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Venturi</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
"Barrel" is a popular term for the carburetor throat. There is one venturi in each throat. A two-barrel carburetor has a primary venturi for part-load running and a secondary venturi for full-throttle; a four-barrel carburetor has two primary and two secondary venturis.  The venturi tube is important in carburetion. A "venturi" is a tube with a restricted section. When liquid or air passes through the venturi tube, the speed of flow is increased at the restriction, and air pressure is decreased, creating an "increase in vacuum" (a reduction in ambient pressure). This causes fuel to be drawn into the barrel. The venturi action is used to keep the correct air-fuel ratio throughout the range of speeds and loads of the engine.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Cetane Rating (Ether)</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
The delay between the time the fuel is injected into the cylinder and ignition is expressed as a cetane number. Usually, this is between 30 and 60. Fuels that ignite rapidly have high cetane ratings, while slow-to-ignite fuels have lower cetane ratings. A fuel with a better ignition quality would help combustion more than a lower cetane fuel during starting and idling conditions when compression temperatures are cooler. Ether, with a very high cetane rating of 85-96, is often used for starting diesel engines in cold weather. The lower the temperature of the surrounding air, the greater the need for fuel that will ignite rapidly. When the cetane number is too low, it may cause difficult starting, engine knock, and puffs of white exhaust smoke, especially during engine warm-up and light load operation. If these conditions continue, harmful engine deposits will accumulate in the combustion chamber.   
<P>
Pressurized cans of starter fluid are available in emergencies, but are not desirable, because they tend to dry out the cylinders, and are dangerous if used improperly. There are also liquid forms of starter fluid available which can be added to the gasoline.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Fuel Additives</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Tetraethyl lead was used in some gasolines to reduce or prevent knocking. However, in 1975, it became illegal to use leaded gasoline except in cars built prior to this time. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) is used in unleaded fuel to increase the octane. Gasoline exposed to heat and air oxidizes and leaves a gummy film. Detergents are now added to gasoline to prevent this. The detergents keep the carburetor passages and fuel injectors free from deposits, which could cause hard starting and problems in driving. Deposits also restrict the flow of fuel and cause a rough idle, hesitation of acceleration, surging, stalling, and lack of power.  
<P>
Alcohol is frequently used as an additive to commercial gasoline, because it will absorb any condensed moisture which may collect in the fuel system. Water will not pass through the filters in the fuel line, so, when any water collects, it will prevent the free passage of fuel. It also tends to attack and corrode the zinc die castings of which many carburetors and fuel pumps are made. This corrosion will not only destroy parts, but also clog the system and prevent the flow of fuel. By using alcohol in gasoline, any water present will be absorbed and pass through the fuel filter and carburetor jets into the combustion chamber. Alcohol additives are often purchased and added separately into the gas tank to prevent gas-line freeze and vapor lock.  
<P>
                                
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Alcohol as a Fuel</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The increasing cost of gasoline, and the new laws requiring alternative fuels have turned the attention of car and truck designers to substitutes. Chief among alternative fuels is alcohol. Considerable research has been done, and is still carried out, for alcohol in spark ignition engines. Alcohol fuels were used extensively in Germany during WWII, and alcohol blends are used in many vehicles at the present time.   
<P>
Methanol and ethanol are the forms of alcohol receiving the most attention. Both are made from non-petroleum products. Methanol can be produced from coal, and ethanol can be made from farm products such as sugar cane, corn, and potatoes. Both alcohols have a higher octane number than gasoline. High heat of vaporization, however, indicates that the use of alcohol could give harder starting problems than gasoline, which means a need for a larger fuel tank and larger jet sizes in the carburetor. It requires less air for combustion, though, which compensates for the high calorific values. In proportion, this could result in practically the same air-fuel ratio for all three.  
<P>
Experimental tests have shown that alcohol-fueled spark ignition engines can produce as much or slightly higher power than gasoline. Alcohol fuels have a higher self-ignition temperature than gasoline, which rates them better from a safety standpoint, but this same quality bars them from use in a diesel engine which depends on the heat of compression to ignite the fuel. At the present time, only ethanol can be blended in small concentrations (10%%) with gasoline. Because of the high octane rating, alcohols can be used in relatively high compression ratios, and experiments indicate that emissions from engines fueled by alcohol would require the use of exhaust gas recirculation controls.

<B><FONT SIZE=4> The Brake System </FONT></B>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>  

<P>
The braking system is the most important system in your car. If your brakes fail, the result can be disastrous. Brakes are actually energy conversion devices, which convert the kinetic energy (momentum) of your vehicle into thermal energy (heat). When you step on the brakes, you command a stopping force ten times as powerful as the force that puts the car in motion. The braking system can exert thousands of pounds of pressure on each of the four brakes. In modern systems, the master cylinder is power-assisted by the engine. All newer cars have dual systems, with two wheels' brakes operated by each subsystem. That way, if one subsystem fails, the other can provide reasonably adequate braking power. Safety systems like this make modern brakes more complex, but also much safer than earlier braking systems. 
<P>
The brake system is composed of the following basic components: The "master cylinder" which is located under the hood, and is directly connected to the brake pedal, converts your foot's mechanical pressure into hydraulic pressure. Steel "brake lines" and flexible "brake hoses" connect the master cylinder to the "slave cylinders" located at each wheel. Brake fluid, specially designed to work in extreme conditions, fills the system. "Shoes" and "pads" are pushed by the slave cylinders to contact the "drums" and "rotors" thus causing drag, which (hopefully) slows the car. 
<P> 
In recent years, brakes have changed greatly in design. Disc brakes, used for years for front wheel applications, are fast replacing drum brakes on the rear wheels of modern cars. This is generally due to their simpler design, lighter weight and better braking performance. The greatest advantage of disc brakes is that they provide significantly better resistance to "brake fade" compared to drum type braking systems. Brake fade is a temporary condition caused by high temperatures generated by repeated hard braking. It occurs when the pads or shoes "glaze" due to the great pressure and heat of hard use. Once they cool, the condition subsides. Disc brakes allow greater air ventilation (cooling) compared to drum brakes. Drum brakes are not internally ventilated because if they were, water could accumulate in them. Disc brakes can rapidly fling off any water that they are exposed to, and so they can be well ventilated. 
<P>
"Boosters" are present in "power brake" systems, and use the engine's energy to add pressure to the master cylinder. "Anti-lock" (ABS) systems, originally developed for aircraft braking systems, use computer controlled valves to limit the pressure delivered to each slave cylinder. If a wheel locks up, steering input cannot affect the car's direction. With ABS, no matter how hard the pedal is pressed, each wheel is prevented from locking up. This prevents skidding (and allows the driver to steer while panic-braking). 
<P> 
As impressive as these advances are, the basic process of converting a vehicle's momentum into (wasted) heat energy has not changed since the days of the horse and buggy. To stop a horse drawn carriage, the driver would pull on a lever which would rub on the wheel. But today, with the advent of regenerating brakes on electric vehicles, new ways of recapturing this lost energy are being developed. In these types of electric cars, when you step on the brakes, the motor switches into "generator mode", and stores the car's momentum as chemical energy in the battery, to be used again when the light turns green! 
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Disc Brakes </FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
Disc brakes use a clamping action to produce friction between the "rotor" and the "pads" mounted in the "caliper" attached to the suspension members.  Inside the calipers, pistons press against the pads due to pressure generated in the master cylinder. The pads then rub against the rotor, slowing the vehicle. Disc brakes work using much the same basic principle as the brakes on a bicycle; as the caliper pinches the wheel with pads on both sides, it slows the bicycle. Disc brakes offer higher performance braking, simpler design, lighter weight, and better resistance to water interference than drum brakes.
<P>
Disc brakes, like many automotive innovations, were originally developed for auto racing, but are now standard equipment on virtually every car made. On most cars, the front brakes are of the disc type, and the rear brakes are of the "drum" type. Drum brakes use two semi-circular shoes to press outward against the inner surfaces of a steel drum. Older cars often had drum brakes on all four wheels, and many new cars now have 4-wheel disc brakes. 
<P>
Because disc brakes can fling off water more easily than drum brakes, they work much better in wet conditions. This is not to say that water does not affect them, it definitely does. If you splash through a puddle and then try to apply the brakes, your brakes may not work at all for a few seconds! Disc brakes also allow better airflow cooling, which also increases their effectiveness. Some high performance disc brakes have drilled or slotted holes through the face of the rotor, which helps to prevent the pads from "glazing" (becoming hardened due to heat). Disc brakes were introduced as standard equipment on most cars in the early seventies. 
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Brake Drums </FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The brake drum is a heavy flat-topped cylinder, which is sandwiched between the wheel rim and the wheel hub. The inside surface of the drum is acted upon by the linings of the brake shoes. When the brakes are applied, the brake shoes are forced into contact with the inside surface of the brake drums to slow the rotation of the wheels. 
<P>
The drums are usually covered with fins on their outer surfaces to increase cooling. They are not cooled internally, because water could enter through the air vent cooling holes and braking would then be greatly impaired. 
<P>
Drum brakes are found on the rear wheels of most older cars, but they are increasingly being fazed out in favor of rear disc brakes. Drum brakes were standard equipment on all four wheels of most cars until the early 70's. 
<P>

The caliper works like a C-clamp to pinch the pads onto the rotor. It straddles the rotor and contains the hydraulic "slave cylinder" or "wheel cylinder" piston(s). One caliper is mounted to the suspension members on each wheel. The caliper is usually mounted onto the spindle, allowing it to deliver the torsional force of the wheel to the chassis via the control arms. Brake hoses connect the caliper to the brake lines leading to the master cylinder. A "bleeder valve" is located on each caliper to allow air bubbles to be purged from the system.
<P>
"Floating caliper" disc brakes, the most common variety, allow the caliper to move from side to side slightly when the brakes are applied. This is because only one pad moves (in relation to the caliper). Some calipers contain two or four seperate pistons. These calipers are fixed in place; i.e., there is no lateral movement like the floating caliper, the pistons take up the slack on each side of the rotor. These are called "dual cylinder" or "dual piston" calipers, and are standard equipment on many performance cars. 
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Wheel (Slave) Cylinder</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
Wheel cylinders, also called the "slave" cylinders, are cylinders in which movable piston(s) convert hydraulic brake fluid pressure into mechanical force. Hydraulic pressure against the piston(s) within the wheel cylinder forces the brake shoes or pads against the machined surfaces of the drum or rotor. There is one cylinder (or more in some systems) for each wheel. Drum brake wheel cylinders are usually made up of a cylindrical casting, an internal compression spring, two pistons, two rubber cups or seals, and two rubber boots to prevent entry of dirt and water. This type of wheel cylinder is fitted with push rods that extend from the outer side of each piston through a rubber boot, where they bear against the brake shoes. In disc brakes, the wheel cylinder is built into the caliper. All wheel cylinders have bleeder screws (or bleeder valves) to allow the system to be purged of air bubbles. 
<P>
As the brake pedal is depressed, it moves pistons within the master cylinder, pressurizing the brake fluid in the brake lines and slave cylinders at each wheel. The fluid pressure causes the wheel cylinders' pistons to move, which forces the shoes or pads against the brake drums or rotors. Drum brakes use return springs to pull the pistons back away from the drum when the pressure is released. On disc brakes, the calipers' piston seals are designed to retract the piston slightly, thus allowing the pads to clear the rotor and thereby reduce rolling friction. 
<P> 

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Parking (Emergency) Brakes</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>
The parking brake (sometimes called the emergency brake) is a cable-activated system used to hold the brakes continuously in the applied position. The parking brake activates the brakes on the rear wheels. Instead of hydraulic pressure, a cable (mechanical) linkage is used to engage the brake shoes or discs. When the parking-brake pedal is pressed (or, in many cars, a hand lever is pulled), a steel cable draws the brake shoes or pads firmly against the drums or rotors. The release lever or button slackens the cables and disengages the brake shoes. The parking brake is self adjusting on most systems. An automatic adjuster compensates for lining (brake shoe) wear. On many cars, the parking brake is used to re-adjust the brake shoes as they wear in, or when the shoes are replaced. In these systems, the adjustment is made by repeatedly applying the parking brake while backing up. 
<P>
The parking brake can be useful while driving up hills: If you're driving a manual transmission car, and you pull up to a stop on an incline, you might notice that you don't have enough feet to operate the clutch, brake, and gas at the same time. In other words, you will likely roll backwards slightly while getting started again. If a someone pulls up right behind you, this can be a problem. Your parking brake is useful in this situation: Apply the parking brake after you stop. When you want to go, release the clutch while pressing the gas, and release the parking brake. This keeps you from having to quickly switch your left foot from the brake to the clutch, or your right foot from the brake to the gas pedal. A little practice, and you'll be able to do it smoothly. Also, remember if you pull up behind someone who is stopped on a hill, give them extra room to roll back a little. Especially if it's a truck. 
<P>
Some cars have no parking brake release! They automatically release the parking brake when the car is placed in drive or reverse.  
<P>
Remember, it's a good idea to test the parking brake periodically and keep it in good condition. It may save your life if the main braking system fails!

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Master Cylinder </B></FONT>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=3>  

<P>
The master cylinder displaces hydraulic pressure to the rest of the brake system. It holds THE most important fluid in your car, the brake fluid. It actually controls two seperate subsystems which are jointly activated by the brake pedal. This is done so that in case a major leak occurs in one system, the other will still function. The two systems may be supplied by seperate fluid reservoirs, or they may be supplied by a common reservoir. Some brake subsystems are divided front/rear and some are diagonally separated. When you press the brake pedal, a push rod connected to the pedal moves the "primary piston" forward inside the master cylinder. The primary piston activates one of the two subsystems. The hydraulic pressure created, and the force of the primary piston spring, moves the secondary piston forward. When the forward movement of the pistons causes their primary cups to cover the bypass holes, hydraulic pressure builds up and is transmitted to the wheel cylinders. When the brake pedal retracts, the pistons allow fluid from the reservoir(s) to refill the chamber if needed.  
<P>
Electronic sensors within the master cylinder are used to monitor the level of the fluid in the reservoirs, and to alert the driver if a pressure imbalance develops between the two systems. If the brake light comes on, the fluid level in the reservoir(s) should be checked. If the level is low, more fluid should be added, and the leak should be found and repaired as soon as possible. BE SURE TO USE THE RIGHT BRAKE FLUID FOR YOUR VEHICLE. Use of improper brake fluid can "contaminate the system". If this occurs, ALL of the seals in the brake system will need replacement, and that is usually a VERY expensive operation.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Warning System </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The brake warning system has been required standard equipment since 1970, and is connected to the master cylinder. It monitors differences in pressure in the brake lines of the two hydraulic sub-systems, and alerts the driver with a light if an imbalance occurs. When you turn the key to the Ignition position, the brake warning light on the dash comes on during a "self-test". You should not drive a car if the warning light does not come on during the startup self test.
<P>
The brake system is divided into two sub-systems to increase safety. A pressure differential switch, connected to the warning light, is positioned between the two. If a major leak occurs, and therefore pressure in one of the lines is sharply reduced, pressure from the other side forces a piston to move, activating the pressure differential switch and turns on the dashboard warning light.
<P>
There are two types of pressure differential switches; mechanical or hydraulic. Mechanical switches are activated by excessive brake travel. Hydraulic switches are activated by a difference in pressure between the front and rear system. When pressure in one of the lines is sharply reduced, pressure from the other side forces a piston to move. A plunger pin then drops into a groove in the piston, activating a switch that turns on a dashboard warning light.
<P>
The brake warning light is also connected to the brake fluid level sensors in the master cylinder reservoir(s). If the brake warning light comes on, the fluid level should be checked. If the level is low, more fluid should be added, and the leak should be found and repaired as soon as possible. BE SURE TO USE THE RIGHT FLUID. NEVER IGNORE THE BRAKE WARNING LAMP, AND ALWAYS NOTE WETHER IT WORKS DURING THE STARTING SELF-TEST. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Power Brakes </B></FONT></CENTER>  

<P>
Power brakes (also called "power assisted" brakes) are designed to use the power of the engine and/or battery to enhance braking power. The four most common types of power brakes are: vacuum suspended; air suspended; hydraulic booster, and electro-hydraulic booster. Most cars use vacuum suspended units (vacuum boosters), which employ a vacuum-powered booster device to provide added thrust to the foot pressure applied.
<P>
In a vacuum booster type system, pressure on the brake pedal pushes forward a pushrod connected to the pistons within the master cylinder. At the same time, the pushrod opens the vacuum-control valve so that it closes the vacuum port and seals off the forward half of the booster unit. The engine vacuum line then creates a low-pressure vacuum chamber. Atmospheric pressure in the control chamber then pushes against the diaphragm. The pressure on the diaphragm forces it forward, supplying pressure on the master cylinder pistons.
<P>
Hydraulic booster systems usually tap into the power steering pump's pressure, and use this power to augment pressure to the master cylinder. Electro-hydraulic booster systems use an electric motor to pressurize a hydraulic system which augments pressure to the master cylinder. This allows the vehicle to have power assisted brakes even if the engine quits.
<P>
You may wish to compare the difference between power and non-assisted braking in a safe area; while driving slowly, turn the ignition key off (don't turn it into the locked position, because the steering wheel will lock, which is highly unsafe.) As the car coasts along, press the brakes hard. The force of your foot is now the only thing stopping the car. The safe driver is always ready to apply the total force needed to stop their vehicle, even if the engine quits (thereby removing the power assist).
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Filler Cap (Brake Fluid Reservoir Cover)</B></FONT></CENTER>  

<P>
The cap on the brake fluid reservoir has a hole for air, or is vented, to allow the fluid to expand and contract without creating a vacuum or causing pressure. A rubber diaphragm goes up and down with the fluid level's pressure, and keeps out any dust or moisture. If the cap's seal becomes distorted, it usually indicates a brake fluid contamination problem.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Vacuum From The Engine </B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
Engine intake manifold vacuum is used for augmenting the foot's braking power in vacuum assisted power brakes. This vacuum is created by the pistons as they draw downward, sucking air into the cylinders. When you push the brake pedal down, the vacuum control valve lets the engine draw a vacuum in the front section of the booster unit. The atmospheric pressure on the other side of the diaphragm provides significant additional braking force.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Fluid </B></FONT></CENTER>
   
<P>
Brake fluid is a special liquid for use in hydraulic brake systems, which must meet highly exact performance specifications. It is designed to be impervious to wide temperature changes and to not suffer any significant changes in important physical characteristics such as compressibility over the operating temperature range. The fluid is designed to not boil, even when exposed to the extreme temperatures of the brakes.
<P>
Different types of brake fluid are used in different systems, and should NEVER be mixed. Most cars use "DOT 3" or "DOT 4" brake fluid. Some newer cars use silicone brake fluids. These should NEVER be mixed together, because the seals in each car are designed to work with only their specific fluid types. For example, the mixing of "Silicone" brake fluid and conventional glycol based DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluids should be avoided, as the two fluid types are not miscible (they will not mix together). DOT 3 brake fluids and DOT 4 brake fluids can be mixed.
<P>
One of the WORST things that can happen to your car is if the brake fluid becomes contaminated, because the seals are designed to work with only pure brake fluid. "System contamination" means that all of the piston seals and hoses are deteriorating, and therefore must be replaced, a MAJOR expense. So, be VERY careful what you put in the master cylinder reservoir! 
<P>
It should be noted that brake fluid is highly corrosive to paint, and care should be used not to get it on your car's finish.
<P>
The brake fluid in your car should be changed every (See Owners Manual) to prevent corrosion of the braking system components.

<FONT SIZE=4><B> Drive Train (An Overview)  </B></FONT>
<BR>
</CENTER>                
  
<P>
The drive train serves two functions: it transmits power from the engine to the drive wheels, and it varies the amount of torque. "Power" is the rate or speed at which work is performed.  "Torque" is turning or twisting force. Multiple ratio gearboxes are necessary because the engine delivers its maximum power at certain speeds, or RPM (Rotations Per Minute). In order to use the same engine RPM's at different road speeds, it is necessary to change the "Gear Ratio" between the engine and the drive wheels. Just like a bicycle, the car has to switch gears in order to move at a wide range of speeds. Unlike your bicycle, the car's drivetrain also has to allow you to back up. (Well, you could push it backwards if you ate your Wheaties)  
<P>
There are actually two sets of gears in the drive train; the transmission and the differential. The transmission allows the gear ratio to be adjusted, and the differential lets the drive wheels turn at different speeds.    
<P>
Manual transmissions usually have four or five speeds, and often have "overdrive", which means that the output shaft can turn faster than the input shaft for fuel economy on the highway. Some use an electric clutch and a switch that controls whether the overdrive is engaged or not. An interesting development on a few cars is the "clutchless" manual transmission, which uses a stick shift and an automatic electric clutch. Speed and position sensors, mini computers, and throttle controls keep the engine from over-revving when the driver shifts gears. As with many automotive "inventions", this is an old idea which may now reach feasibility due to the computer revolution.
<P>
Automatic transmissions commonly use three forward gears to blend speed and torque. In the case of a three-speed transmission, first gear delivers maximum torque and minimum speed for starting. Second gear offers medium torque and speed for acceleration and hill climbing. Third gear allows maximum speed with minimum torque for highway travel. A reverse gear permits backward movement.  
<P>
A transmission is a speed and power changing device installed at some point between the engine and driving wheels of a vehicle. It provides a means for changing the ratio between engine RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) and driving wheel RPM to best meet each particular driving situation.   
<P>
Some types of drive train layouts use a "Transaxle", which is simply a combination of the transmission and the differential. These are usually found on front wheel drive cars, but are also used on mid- and rear-engine cars. Some exotic cars have their engine in the front, and a transaxle in the rear of the car for better weight balance.  
<P>
Torque is derived from power. The amount of torque obtainable from a source of power is proportional to the distance from the center of rotation at which it is applied. It is logical, then, that if we have a shaft (in this case, the crankshaft) rotating at any given speed, we can put gears of different sizes on the shaft and obtain different results. If we put a large gear on the shaft, we will get more speed and less power at the rim than with a small gear. If we place another shaft parallel to our driving shaft and install gears on it in line with those on the driving shaft, we can obtain almost any desired combination of speed or power within the limits of the engine's ability. That is exactly what an automobile transmission does by means of gears and other devices.  
<P>
There are two types of transmissions; manual and automatic. If you have a manual transmission, you have to shift the gears yourself, usually with a stick located on your console and the clutch pedal. If you have an automatic transmission, the mechanism changes without any help from you. This is accomplished through a system that works by oil pressure. Each shift of the gears is controlled by a shift valve; the gears shift change depending on speed, the road, and load conditions.  
<P>
Another basic component of all drive trains is some form of a clutch. it allows the engine to continue rotating while the gears and wheels are stationary. Automatic transmission cars use a "torque converter" in lieu of a clutch.   
<P>
From the back of the engine to where the rubber meets the road, the drivetrain encompasses one of the most complicated systems of your  car. Some people say looking at a transmission "makes their brain hurt".   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Manual Transmission</B></FONT></CENTER>                      
  
<P>
The manual transmission provides a means of varying the relationship between the speed of the engine and the speed of the wheels. Varying these gear ratios allows the right amount of engine power at many different speeds.   
<P>
Manual transmissions require use of a clutch to apply and remove engine torque to the transmission input shaft. The clutch allows this to happen gradually that so that the car can be started from a complete stop.  
<P>
Modern manual transmissions do not disengage any of the forward drive gears, they are simply connected to their shafts through the use of "synchronizers". Reverse is achieved through reverse idler gears, which are engaged to move the car backwards.   
<P>
Some manual transmissions have an "overdrive." An overdrive is a  mechanical unit bolted to the rear of the transmission. It is usually known as fifth gear. When you use it, it will reduce the engine speed by about one-third, while maintaining the same road speed.  
<P>
Chrysler came out with the first overdrive transmission in 1934.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Transmission Gears</B></FONT></CENTER>                       
  
<P>
Most cars have from three to five forward gears, and one reverse gear. The transmission changes the ratio of the engine speed and the wheels by connecting gears in various combinations. If a gear with 10 teeth is driving a gear with 20 teeth, the drive would be said to have a 2:1 ratio. 
<P>
First gear connects the engine power to the drive wheels via a pair of reduction gear sets, which gives increased power and reduced wheelspeed when the car is beginning to move. This means the engine is turning much faster than the output shaft, typically around a 4:1 ratio. Intermediate speeds are delivered by changing the gear ratio closer to 1:1. Final drive is usually accomplished by directly linking the input and output shafts, giving a 1:1 gear ratio. Using a moveable set of different sized gears, it's possible to get several degrees of torque output. The differential pinion, driven by the drive shaft, turns the ring gear, which acts like a single speed transmission. This further reduces RPM's and increases torque by a set ratio.  
<P>
Gears work exactly like levers. A small gear driving a larger one gives an increase in torque, and a decrease in speed, and vise-versa.  
<P>
Transmission gears are heat-treated, high quality steel. They have smooth, hard teeth, cut on precision machinery while red hot. There are many types of gear teeth, but most transmissions use spur and helical gears. Most of the gears are the helical type, because they last longer and are more quiet than spur gears. There has to be enough room (a few thousandths of an inch) between the gear teeth for lubrication, expansion, and any irregularities in size.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Transmission Oil  </B></FONT></CENTER>                        
  
<P>
The transmission needs lubrication to keep all of the gears and shafts running smoothly. This is accomplished by partially filling the transmission housing with thick transmission gear oil.  When the gear gears spin, they fling the fluid around and lubricate all of the parts. Oil seals at the front and rear stop the fluid from leaking out of the housing.  
<P>
Fluid levels should be checked when you change your oil, or if you notice difficulties or differences in shifting. This can indicate that the level of fluid might be low.
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Gear Shift Mechanism  </B></FONT></CENTER>                     
  
<P>
What causes the transmission to shift? It's shifted by shifter forks, also known as sliding yokes. These resemble the oarlocks you find in a row boat. and they ride in a groove in the clutch sleeve and sliding gear. Shifter forks are connected to a cam and shaft assembly. The cam assembly is kept in the selected gear by spring loaded steel balls that jump through notches (in the cam assembly) and hold the shifter forks in that gear. The shafts (of the cam and shaft assembly) go through the housing and are fastened to shift  levers.  
<P>
The shifter forks move the synchronizers which engage the gears to the shafts they ride on.  
<P>
The shift levers are connected to a control on the steering column or a shift stick located on the floor. Both of these are powered by -- you!   
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Speedometer Cable </B></FONT></CENTER>                        
  
<P>
The speedometer cable is connected to the gearbox output shaft, the transmission shaft, or differential. The rotation of these shafts is used to measure the speed and record mileage. This information is sent back through the cable where it is recorded on the speedometer.  
<P>
The speedometer and odometer are driven by a cable housed in a  flexible casing. This cable is connected to a gear in the transmission. Speedometer cables break as the result of age, lack of lubrication, or because the cable casing has sharp bends. It also breaks from too much friction in the speedometer head.   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Clutch  </B></FONT></CENTER>                         

<P>
The clutch allows you to connect and disconnect the engine and the transmission, both starting up and during shifts. Friction plates route the rotation of the engine crankshaft to the gears, and then to the wheels. It takes the rotation up slowly, so that you aren't off to a screeching start. In a manual transmission, you disengage the clutch when you press the pedal down. The pedal works the thrust pad, and it presses levers in the middle of the clutch cover. Doing all this lifts the pressure plate away from the clutch plate. The flywheel (which is turned by the crankshaft from the transmission shaft) gets disconnected.  
<P>
When you lift the clutch pedal, springs force the pressure plate and clutch plate against the flywheel. The clutch plate friction linings allow it to slide before becoming engaged. The sliding causes a smooth start instead of a jolt.  
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>  The Clutch Plate  </B></FONT></CENTER>                     
  
<P>
The clutch plate is a thin, steel, disc. Its center is connected to the transmission input shaft by a grooved piece of metal, or hub. The disc is covered with material that is similar to the break linings.  This material allows the clutch to slip smoothly and quietly.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Flywheel  </B></FONT></CENTER>                          
 
<P>
The flywheel is a fairly large wheel that is connected to the crankshaft. It provides the momentum to keep the crankshaft turning between piston firings.  
<P>
The flywheel is the base for the entire clutch attachment. The side of the flywheel that the clutch is attached to is smooth, so that it provides a surface for friction. The clutch assembly is mounted to the flywheel, sandwiching the clutch plate in between.  A bearing, called the "pilot bearing" is installed in a hole in the center of the flywheel. This lubricated bearing, either a ball bearing or a bronze bushing, is used to support one end of the clutch shaft, which is also the transmission input shaft. Around the flywheel is the ring gear, which the starter motor turns when the key is turned.  
<P>
 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> The Clutch Pedal, Cables and Levers 
</B></FONT></CENTER>                  
  
<P>
One way to activate the throw-out fork of the clutch is by using a system of levers and cables. These levers and cables are connected between the clutch pedal and the throw-out fork. When you press the clutch pedal with your foot, the pressure is transmitted to the fork through the cable and lever arrangement.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Hydraulic Clutch</B></FONT></CENTER>                          

<P>
Another method used to activate the clutch throw-out fork is the hydraulic clutch. This method is often used when the mechanical design of the car makes it difficult to use levers and cables. It is also used to multiply force, reducing driver fatigue.  
<P>
With a hydraulic clutch, when you press the clutch pedal, it moves a small cylinder called the "master" cylinder. Pressure is created in the master cylinder which is, in turn, transmitted to the "slave" cylinder. The slave cylinder is attached to the throw-out fork by a small adjustable rod, so when pressure is exerted on the slave cylinder, it operates the fork. Both master and slave cylinders are designed in such an uncomplicated way that they are easy to attach with hydraulic tubing.

<P>
Many cars use a front drive axle. Most front-wheel drive axles are constructed the same way as rear-wheel drive axles, with one exception. A front-wheel axle assembly must provide a way to turn the wheels as well as drive them.   
<P>
The clutch or torque converter sends the power on to the transmission input shaft. Next, the power is sent on to the differential by gears or chains (belts). It goes through the differential gears through the axle and CV Joints and finally to the front wheels.  
<P>
Front wheel drive was not new in the eighties when it became popular. Front wheel drive was introduced by the Pennington Car Company in  1900. Before that, steamers and electric cars had used it for years.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>2-Wheel Drive </B></FONT></CENTER>      

<P>
The engine, clutch and gearbox are usually mounted on the frame at the front of the vehicle. The rotating motion produced by the crankshaft at the front of the vehicle is transmitted either to the two wheels at the rear (rear wheel drive), or the two wheels at the front (front wheel drive). Some cars are manufactured with rear mounted engines that drive the rear wheels, and front mounted engines that drive the front wheels.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>4 Wheel Drive</B></FONT></CENTER>    

<P>
4-wheel drive vehicles use live front and rear drive axles. When the front drive axle receives power from the transfer case, along with the rear drive axle, the vehicle can function well on off-road terrain (sand, rocks, mud, snow, etc.). A 4-wheel drive vehicle has one drive axle that is automatically in use. The operator of the vehicle has to activate and deactivate the second live drive axle.  
<P>

<P>
All-wheel drive vehicles use live front and rear drive axles. When the front drive axle receives power from the transfer case, along with the rear drive axle, the vehicle can function well on off-road terrain (sand, rocks, mud, snow, etc.). A 4-wheel drive vehicle has one drive axle that is automatically in use. The operator of the vehicle has to activate and deactivate the second live drive axle. An all-wheel drive vehicle has both axles live at all times without manually activating or deactivating axles.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Automatic Transmissions  </B></FONT></CENTER>                    

<P>
An automatic transmission is much easier to drive than a manual transmission, because you don't have to use a clutch pedal or gearshift lever. An automatic transmission does the work all by itself. The first automatic transmission appeared in 1939.  
<P>
Automatic transmissions automatically change to higher and lower gears with changes in the car's speed and the load on the engine. These transmissions are also aware of how far down you have pushed the gas pedal, and shift accordingly.  
<P>
The system is operated by transmission fluid pressure; shift valves control the gear changes. A "governor" controls the shifting of the gears. It's linked to the output shaft and throttle valve and controls the transmission fluid supply, at different pressures, to the shift valve. Here's how it works: the output shaft turns the governor. The faster the car goes, the faster the governor turns. Oil is sent from the pump to the shift valves by centrifugal force from the governor. The shift valves move out, and send the transmission fluid to the gear shifting mechanisms in the transmission. When you slow down, the valves move in, and send the transmission fluid in the opposite direction. This action changes the gears.  
<P>
By routing the pressure to the clutches and brake bands, the different gears are selected.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Torque Converter   </B></FONT></CENTER>                                                   
<P>
The torque converter is a type of fluid coupling between the engine and the gearbox to even out speed changes. The torque converter also multiplies engine torque.  
<P>
The torque converter is used as a clutch to send the power (torque) from the engine to the transmission input shaft. It has three parts; an impeller connected to the engine's crankshaft, a turbine to turn the turbine shaft which is connected to the gears, and a stator between the two. The torque converter is filled with transmission fluid that is moved by the impeller blades. The stator's vanes catch the oil thrown off from the impeller, and use it to move the turbine's blades. When the impeller spins above a certain speed, the turbine spins, driven by the impeller.  
<P>
In some designs, the torque converter locks the impeller and the turbine together when at highway speeds, which increases efficiency.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Brake Bands  </B></FONT></CENTER>                          
<P>
A brake band is made of steel, and has a friction lining. One end of the band is attached a servo actuating rod.   
<P>
A servo actuating rod is a hydraulic piston (a cylinder with a piston inside it) that is open at one end to allow oil to flow in.  The piston is normally in the released position because it's kept that way by a spring. However, when pressurized oil is sent to the cylinder, the oil forces the piston forward. This causes the brake band to tighten, and this locks the brake.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Transmission Fluid </B></FONT></CENTER>                        

<P>
Transmission fluid is a special kind of oil used only for  transmissions. It circulates through and lubricates the gears. Check your car's owner's manual for the type to use.  No other type of oil should ever be used in your transmission.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Automatic Gear shifting  </B></FONT></CENTER>                     
  
<P>
Almost all automatic transmissions use a pair of gear groups called epicyclic, or planetary gears. Each group consists of; an outside "ring" gear, a shared "sun" gear in the center, and a set of "planet gears", which mesh in between the sun and the ring gear. Planet gears are so named because each one turns on its own axis as they orbit the sun gear, like planets do. Each group of planet gears is held in a "planet gear carrier". By clamping the ring gears, the sun gear, and the carriers together in various combinations, and by locking some of them in stationary positions, it is possible to achieve three forward gear ratios, and reverse as well.
<P>
To increase torque: When the ring gear is stopped, and the power is applied to the sun gear, the planet gears are forced to go around the sun gear. This makes the pinion gears revolve more slowly around the inside gears, and drive from the carrier will have lower speed and increased torque.  
<P>
To reverse the torque's direction: If the planet gear carrier is stopped, and torque is applied to the sun gear, the planet gears are forced to turn by the sun gear. This makes the ring gear revolve, but more slowly than the ring gear, which increases the torque, and in the opposite direction as the sun gear, giving reverse.  
<P>
If two members of the gear set are locked together, planetary action is stopped and the gear set turns as one unit. When this happens, there are no increases or decreases in torque transmission.
<P>
In order to have more than 2 forward speeds, two sets of epicyclic gears are needed. By changing the number of teeth (size) of one set of planetary gears, 4 forward speeds can be produced.   
<P>
The clutches within the transmission are used to connect the input torque, and the brake bands are used to lock the sun gear or the rear planet carrier.  One way bearings serve to allow power flow in certain directions only, working as clutches. All of the clutches and brake bands are powered by hydraulic pressure, and regulated by the logic circuit which is connected to the governor and/or directly to a computer-controlled valve assembly. The transmission senses gas pedal position and drive selector position, and engages the proper clutches and bands for you to "Get out of Dodge".  
<P>
The details of automatic transmission functions are vast, and different designs are introduced by the many automakers with great regularity. Some common principles shared by virtually all automatics are: fluid clutches, brake bands, one way bearings (one way clutches), and epicyclic gears. This crazy diagram is a simplified version of but one design among many, and if you think it's hard to understand, don't feel bad. It is!  
<P>
In this type of transmission, to give first gear, the forward drive clutch (C) locks the turbine shaft to the front ring gear. At the same time, the second planet carrier brake band (D) locks the rear planet carrier in place.  The power from the turbine shaft flows through the front ring gear, which turns the front carrier, which turns the sun gear. This reduces the RPM's and increases torque one time. The second reduction/multiplication happens when the sun gear turns the rear planet gears, each of which rotate within their stationary carrier.  This causes the second ring gear to turn. The second ring gear transfers its torque to the output shaft through the second one-way clutch.  (Does your brain hurt yet?)  
<P>
Second gear is accomplished by engaging the sun gear brake band (B) and the forward-drive clutch (C). This gives one reduction in RPM.  
<P>
Third gear (Drive) is engaged by locking the reverse-high clutch (A) and the forward-drive clutch (C). This gives a 1:1 (direct) ratio between the input and output shafts.  
<P>
When reverse is selected, the reverse-high clutch (A) and the second carrier brake band (D) are locked. This reverses the torque direction, and reduces the ratio (twice) for use in backing up the car.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Differential</B></FONT>
<BR>
</CENTER>                       
  
<P>
The differential is the thing that works both drive axles at the same time, but lets them rotate at different speeds so that the car can make turns. When a car makes a turn, the outer wheel has to turn faster than the inner wheel, due to the difference in the length of the paths they take. The differential is located between the two wheels, and is attached to each wheel by a half-shaft rotated through a bevel gear. Four-wheel drive cars have a separate differential for each pair of wheels.  
<P>
A grooved, or splined, axle side gear is positioned on the splined end of each axle. The side gears are driven by "spider" gears, which are little gears mounted on a shaft attached to the differential case. As it is supported by the differential case, the side gear can turn inside the case.  
<P>
The differential case can be turned, revolving around the axle gears. The differential pinion (a pinion is a small gear that either drives a larger gear or is driven by one) shaft turns the ring gear, which is fastened to the differential case. The propeller shaft (drive shaft) connects the transmission output shaft to the differential pinion shaft. The turning differential case is mounted on two large bearing holders. These bearings are called carrier bearings.  
<P>
The propeller shaft rotates the ring gear pinion, and the pinion turns the ring gear. The ring gear then turns the differential case and pinion shaft, but the axle side gears will not turn. By passing the differential pinion shaft through two differential pinion gears that mesh with the side gears, the case will turn and the axle side gears will turn with it. During turns, the side gears turn at rates dictated by the radius of the turns, and the spider gears then turn to allow the outer wheel to turn faster than the inner one.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Differential Fluids</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
For lubrication fluid, a very heavy oil, must be used in rear axle housings. Special hypoid oils are used in the differential case. Even another type of fluid, or oil must be used in a positraction type differential.  
<P>
The oil is circulated by the ring gear, and flung all over all the parts. Special troughs, or gullies are used to bring the oil back to certain spots, like the ring and pinion area and the piston bearings. The fluid is kept in with gaskets and oil seals. The bottom of the housing has a drain plug, and another filler plug is located part way up the housing. The housing must never be filled above this plug.  
<P>
The housing fluid lubricates some of the outer bearings, but others have lubrication fittings for the injection of wheel bearing grease. A hand gun, not a pressure grease gun must be used to grease these bearings (sparingly). A pressure grease gun could inject grease into the brakes-- greasy brakes are inefficient at best!  
<P>
Finally, some bearings are filled with grease at the factory and are sealed. These never require attention unless they are defective.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Positraction Differentials</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
A positraction differential is a special traction differential. Its purpose is to improve the way your differential performs under adverse conditions. When one wheel starts to slip, these differentials transfer the torque to the wheel that is not slipping. The car can then continue to go forward. There are several different kinds of positraction differentials, but all of them are based on a friction device to provide resistance to normal differential operation.  
<P>
A positraction differential provides better traction, which is handy when roads are slippery. It also lends itself to fast acceleration.  
<P>
One type uses four differential pinions instead of two, with two pinion shafts. It also uses a series of four clutch discs. The differential pinions run into resistance when they try to turn the axle side gears. The resistance gets transferred to the pinion shafts driving the pinions. The shafts are forced to slide up little ramps. This action moves both shafts outward. The pinions cause the clutches to lock.  
<P>
Other types use cone clutches, or disc clutches under pressure from coil springs. By restricting the differential action, torque is delivered to the slipping wheel.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Drive Shaft</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The drive shaft, or propeller shaft, connects the transmission output shaft to the differential pinion shaft. Since all roads are not perfectly smooth, and the transmission is fixed, the drive shaft has to be flexible to absorb the shock of bumps in the road.  Universal, or "U-joints" allow the drive shaft to flex (and stop it from breaking) when the drive angle changes.  
<P>
Drive shafts are usually hollow in order to weigh less, but of a large diameter so that they are strong. High quality steel, and sometimes aluminum are used in the manufacture of the drive shaft. The shaft must be quite straight and balanced to avoid vibrating. Since it usually turns at engine speeds, a lot of damage can be caused if the shaft is unbalanced, or bent. Damage can also be caused if the U-joints are worn out.  
<P>
There are two types of drive shafts, the Hotchkiss drive and the Torque Tube Drive. The Hotchkiss drive is made up of a drive shaft connected to the transmission output shaft and the differential pinion gear shaft. U-joints are used in the front and rear. The Hotchkiss drive transfers the torque of the output shaft to the differential. No wheel drive thrust is sent to the drive shaft. Sometimes this drive comes in two pieces to reduce vibration and make it easier to install (in this case, three U-joints are needed).The two-piece types need ball bearings in a dustproof housing as center support for the shafts. Rubber is added into this arrangement for noise and vibration reduction.  
<P>
The torque tube drive shaft is used if the drive shaft has to carry the wheel drive thrust. It is a hollow steel tube that extends from the transmission to the rear axle housing. One end is fastened to the axle housing by bolts. The transmission end is fastened with a torque ball. The drive shaft fits into the torque tube. A U-joint is located in the torque ball, and the axle housing end is splined to the pinion gear shaft. Drive thrust is sent through the torque tube to the torque ball, to transmission, to engine and finally, to the frame through the engine mounts. That is, the car is pushed forward by the torque tube pressing on the engine.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Universal Joint (U-joint)</B></FONT></CENTER>
  
<P>
The Universal joint (U-joint) is used to connect the drive shaft to the transmission output shaft and the differential pinion gear shaft. This joint must be flexible enough to allow changes in the driving angle (road incline) and the drive shaft. This way, the torque is constantly transmitted when the rear axle is moving up and down. Smaller U-joints are used to route the turning motion of the steering wheel through the steering column to the steering box.  
<P>
There are two types of U-joints, the cross and roller type and the ball and trunnion type. The cross and roller type is used the most; it allows the drive shaft to bend. The ball and trunnion type less frequently used; it allows the drive shaft to bend and also permits backward and forward motion of the drive shaft.  
<P>
 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Constant Velocity Joints (CV Joints)</B></FONT></CENTER>
                    
<P>
Front wheel drive cars need u-joints which not only allow up and down motion, but steering motion as well. the angle at which they turn requires a different design than the standard U-joint.  
<P>
Constant velocity, or CV joints are universal joints that are able to transfer torque at large angles efficiently. These joints transfer power very smoothly. They are comprised of four basic parts: 1. The outer section, which has grooves machined on its inner surface, 2. the bearings, which are usually in a "cage", 3. the inner ball, which has grooves on its outer surface for the bearings to ride in, and 4. a rubber boot to protect the unit from dirt and moisture.   
<P>
A common cause of CV joint failure is cracks in the CV boot. As dirt enters the CV joint, its parts grind themselves until a clicking noise is heard when turning, or until they fail completely. The boots should be replaced as soon as cracking is visible in their rubber folds.  
<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Cooling System</FONT></B>
<BR>
</CENTER>   
<FONT SIZE=3>  
<P>
The purpose of the engine's cooling system is to remove excess heat from the engine, to keep the engine operating at its most efficient temperature, and to get the engine up to the correct temperature as soon as possible after starting. Ideally, the cooling system keeps the engine running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are.  
<P>
As fuel is burned in the engine, about one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted into power. Another third goes out the exhaust pipe unused, and the remaining third becomes heat energy.  
<P>
A cooling system of some kind is necessary in any internal combustion engine. If no cooling system were provided, parts would melt from the heat of the burning fuel, and the pistons would expand so much they could not move in the cylinders (called "seize").   
<P>
The cooling system of a water-cooled engine consists of: the engine's water jacket, a thermostat, a water pump, a radiator and radiator cap, a cooling fan (electric or belt-driven), hoses, the heater core, and usually an expansion (overflow) tank.   
<P>
Fuel burning engines produce enormous amounts of heat; temperatures can reach up to 4,000 degrees F when the air-fuel mixture burns. However, normal operating temperature is about 2,000 degrees F. The cooling system removes about one-third of the heat produced in the combustion chamber.  
<P>
The exhaust system takes away much of the heat, but parts of the engine, such as the cylinder walls, pistons, and cylinder head, absorb large amounts of the heat. If a part of the engine gets too hot, the oil film fails to protect it. This lack of lubrication can ruin the engine.  
<P>
On the other hand, if an engine runs at too low a temperature, it is inefficient, the oil gets dirty (adding wear and subtracting horsepower), deposits form, and fuel mileage is poor-- not to mention exhaust emissions! For these reasons, the cooling system is designed to stay out of the action until the engine is warmed up.  
<P>
There are two types of cooling systems; liquid cooling and air cooling. Most auto engines are cooled by the liquid type; air cooling is used more frequently for airplanes, motorcycles and lawnmowers.  
<P>
Liquid cooled engines have passages for the liquid, or coolant, through the cylinder block and head. The coolant has to have indirect contact with such engine parts as the combustion chamber, the cylinder walls, and the valve seats and guides. Running through the passages in the engine heats the coolant (it absorbs the heat from the engine parts), and going through the radiator cools it.  After getting "cool" again in the radiator, the coolant comes back through the engine. This business continues as long as the engine is running, with the coolant absorbing and removing the engine's heat, and the radiator cooling the coolant.  
<P>
A cooling system pressure tester is used to check the pressure in the cooling system, which allows the mechanic to determine if the system has any slow leaks. The leak can then be found and fixed before it causes a major problem. 
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>The Heater Core  </FONT></B></CENTER>                

<P>
The heater core is a smaller version of the radiator that is used to keep your toes warm when it's cold outside.
<P>
The heater core is mounted under the dash board. Some of the hot coolant is routed through this little radiator, by more hoses. A small electric fan is also mounted there especially for the purpose of directing the heat inside the car. To turn this fan on, you use a switch called "fan" or "blower," located on your control panel.  The principle is exactly the same as the one used in the radiator for your engine, except that the heat is released inside the car instead of outside. Most engines use the heater core to warm the air coming from the air conditioner if the dash setting is not on "cold". More efficient designs don't do this because it makes the engine work harder than it has to. They cycle the compressor on and off to lessen the cooling output.  
<P>
If your car is running hot, turning the heater on will help to reduce the heat in the engine. Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter.

<FONT SIZE=4><B> The Thermostat</B></FONT>

</CENTER>

<P>
Just like your body needs to warm up when you begin to exercise, your car's engine needs to warm up when it starts its exercise.  
<P>
The thermostat provides control for your engine's warm-up period.  
<P>
The thermostat is located between the engine and the radiator. This little temperature-sensitive spring valve stays closed during engine warm-up. When the thermostat is closed, it prevents coolant from leaving the engine and circulating through the radiator until the correct running temperature is reached. The correct running temperature for most engines is between 180 degrees F and 200 degrees F. When the right temperature is reached, the spring valve opens, allowing coolant to circulate through the radiator to be cooled-- almost like our bodies begin to perspire after we've warmed-up.  
<P>
The temperature at which the thermostat is designed to open is called its rating, and may be stamped on the body. The 180 Degrees F thermostat begins to open at (you guessed it!) 180 Degrees F and is fully opened at 200 degrees F. Different engines use different temperature thermostats.  
<P>
Some high range thermostats maintain engine operating temperatures above 200 degrees F. This causes the engine to burn up more pollutants and aids in emissions control. However the range for your thermostat depends on the type of your engine, load requirements, weather, and other variables.  
<P>
Most thermostats are the "pellet" type; the name comes from the wax pellet that expands as the engine coolant warms. The pellet's expansion forces the valve open. Thermostats occasionally get "stuck shut" which cuts off the cooling capacity of the radiator, at least partially. This often occurs after an engine has overheated for some other reason, such as when the water pump fails, or if a large coolant leak develops. For this reason, car makers usually place the thermostat in an accessible position.
<P>
Depending on the air temperature, the engine should take from five to fifteen minutes to warm up. If your engine takes a long time to warm up, or if it always runs hot, you might need to test the thermostat. A malfunctioning thermostat can cause excessive engine wear and waste fuel. A good time to have your thermostat checked is just before summer or winter.  
<P>                          

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator Hoses</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Hoses are used to connect the engine and the water pump to the radiator. Radiator hoses are made of flexible rubber; size varies depending upon the type of engine. Smaller hoses run to the heater core, these are known as (you guessed it) heater hoses.  
<P>
Three types of hoses are; the common hose, the molded or shaped hose, and the accordion type hose. All of these hoses may have spiral wire in their construction. Spiral wire can be molded or inserted into the hoses, in the required shape, when the hose is constructed.  
<P>
The common hose is straight and cannot take much bending before collapsing. It is made of rubber with fabric reinforcement.  
<P>
Molded or shaped hoses are the same as the common hose with one exception. They will not collapse when bent, because all of the bends that they need are already molded into them.  
<P>
Accordion type hoses not only put up with all kinds of severe bending, but they also absorb some of the vibration between the engine and the radiator.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Water (Coolant) Jackets</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
When our bodies feel cold, we put on a jacket. Our car engines wear permanent jackets for the opposite reason-- to keep cool!   
<P>
The water jacket is a collection of passages within the block and head. These passages let the coolant circulate around the "hot spots" (valve seats and guides, cylinder walls, combustion chamber, etc.) in order to cool them off.
<P>
The engine block is actually manufactured in one piece with the water jackets cast into the block and cylinder head. At normal operating temperature, the water pump forces the coolant through the head gasket openings and on into the water jackets in the cylinder head. It flows around in there, cooling everything off by absorbing the heat. After doing its thing, the coolant flows through the upper hose to the radiator where it releases the heat.  Then, the water pump sends it back down into the engine's water jackets to continue the cooling process.  
<P>
On the sides of the engine are "freeze" or "expansion" plugs, which are sheet metal plugs pressed into a series of holes in the block. These are designed to hold the pressure of the cooling system, but to pop out if the coolant in the block ever freezes.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Heater Core</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P> 
The heater core is a smaller version of the radiator that is used to keep your toes warm when it's cold outside.  
<P>
The heater core is mounted under the dash board. Some of the hot coolant is routed through this little radiator, by more hoses. A small electric fan is also mounted there especially for the purpose of directing the heat inside the car. To turn this fan on, you use a switch called "fan" or "blower," located on your control panel.  The principle is exactly the same as the one used in the radiator for your engine, except that the heat is released inside the car instead of outside. Most engines use the heater core to warm the air coming from the air conditioner if the dash setting is not on "cold". More efficient designs don't do this because it makes the engine work harder than it has to. They cycle the compressor on and off to lessen the cooling output.  
<P>
If your car is running hot, turning the heater on will help to reduce the heat in the engine. Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Fan Clutch  </B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P> 
The fan clutch is a small fluid coupling with a thermostatic device that controls a variable-speed fan. The fan clutch ensures that the fan will rotate at just the right speed to keep the engine from overheating, and reduces drive to the fan when it is no longer needed.  
<P>
The fan clutch has a fluid coupling partly filled with silicone oil designed for just that purpose. If the temperature of the air passing through the radiator rises, the heat alerts a bimetal coil spring to "uncoil" or expand. When it expands, it allows just a little more oil to enter the fluid coupling, so the fluid coupling starts to rotate the fan. If the air coming through the radiator is cool, the opposite happens; the coil spring contracts, the oil leaves the fluid coupling and the fan slows. Slowing the fan when it is not needed reduces fuel consumption, makes less noise and saves engine power.  
<P>
Sometimes a flat bimetal strip spring is used instead of a coil spring; it bows out and in when the temperature rises and drops, letting oil in and out of the fluid coupling.   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Freeze Plugs (Expansion Plugs)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P> 
Freeze plugs (also called "blind" or "expansion core" plugs) are small steel plugs used to seal the holes in the engine block and head made in casting. They expand and flatten as they are driven into place, and make a tight seal. These are designed to hold the pressure of the cooling system, but to pop out if the coolant in the block ever freezes.  
<P>
If you have a leak in your cooling system, freeze plugs are one of the areas to have checked.  
<P>   

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Temperature Sending Units </B></FONT></CENTER>  

<P> 
Since it is critical for you to keep an eye on the temperature of the coolant in your cooling system at all times, your car will have either a gauge or a warning light located on the instrument panel or dashboard (see temperature gauge). The question is, how does the  information about your coolant get to the gauge? It gets there, or is sent by the temperature sending unit.  
<P>
The temperature sending unit is a device that is placed so that it can determine the temperature of the engine coolant. Simply put, its resistance to electricity changes with increases and decreases in the temperature of the coolant. The electric resistance changes control the movement of the indicator needle on the temperature gauge. If you have an indicator light, or lights, these changes will cause the bulb to be connected to the battery if the temperature of your coolant gets too high. If this happens, the light goes on.  
<P>
There are two types of sending units. One type uses a Bourdon tube instrument, a capillary tube filled with a special gas, and a capsule, or bulb. The other type uses an electric sender receiver.  
<P>
The Bourdon tube type works by having one end of the tube attached to the gauge fitting, and the free end fastened to the needle indicator. A Bourdon tube is a round, hollow metal tube. Putting pressure on the hollow end causes it to try to straighten, so that the other end moves the needle on the gauge. Because it is placed in an engine water jacket, the pressure from the coolant temperature causes it to move, which, in turn forces the other end to move the gauge needle. When the coolant cools, the lack of pressure allows the needle to swing back to cold on the gauge.  
<P>
The electric sender receiver type has a bimetal thermostat in the dashboard. This thermostat is linked to the gauge needle, so that when the engine gets warmer and passes more current, the thermostat, getting hotter itself, bends. When the thermostat bends, it moves the gauge needle, which indicates that the coolant temperature is rising. As it cools off, the thermostat "unbends" again, and the needle drops back to the cold indicator.

</CENTER>                           

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
The radiator is a device designed to dissipate the heat which the coolant has absorbed from the engine. It is constructed to hold a large amount of water in tubes or passages which provide a large area in contact with the atmosphere. It usually consists of a radiator core, with its water-carrying tubes and large cooling area, which are connected to a receiving tank (end cap) at the top and to a dispensing tank at the bottom. Side flow radiators have their "endcaps" on the sides, which allows a lower hood line.  
<P>
In operation, water is pumped from the engine to the top (receiving) tank, where it spreads over the tops of the tubes. As the water passes down through the tubes, it loses its heat to the airstream which passes around the outside of the tubes. To help spread the heated water over the top of all the tubes, a baffle plate is often placed in the upper tank, directly under the inlet hose from the engine.   
<P>
Sooner or later, almost everyone has to deal with an overheating car. Since water is readily available, it is not beyond the ability of most people to add some to their radiator if it's low. <B>BUT PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN OR SERIOUS BURNS CAN RESULT. Here are a few pointers for dealing with an overheated radiator: </B> 
<UL>
	<LI>Turn off the A/C. If the car is not seriously overheating, this will reduce the engine's temperature. The AC evaporator is located in front of the radiator, and it adds heat to the air going to your engine. The hotter the incoming air is, the less efficient the radiator will be.  
	<LI>Turn on your heater (set on highest temperature setting, with blower on highest setting). This will be uncomfortable for you, but it will cool the engine by transferring the heat to the air. Roll down the windows, and remember how 'hot' you'll get if your engine needs replacement!  
	<LI>If you're stuck in traffic, pull over and stop. Unless you're moving, very little cool air reaches the radiator. Open the hood and let the engine cool off. This takes time, so be patient. Use the time to go get a jug of water or antifreeze.  
	<LI>Check the overflow tank coolant level. If it's empty, the radiator is probably low on coolant.  
	<LI>Check the pressure of the system by wrapping a cloth around the upper radiator hose and squeezing it. If it's still under pressure (hot) it will not squeeze easily. Wait until it does.  
	<LI>Place a large cloth over the radiator cap, and CAREFULLY release the pressure.<B>DANGER: SERIOUS BURNS CAN RESULT FROM THE HOT COOLANT. IF IN DOUBT, WAIT UNTIL THE ENGINE COOLS COMPLETELY.  </B> 
	<LI>If the coolant is low, start the engine, and slowly add the water or coolant necessary to fill it up. <B>THE ENGINE MUST BE RUNNING. ADDING COOLANT TO A WARM ENGINE CAN CRACK THE BLOCK.</B>  By running the engine, the coolant keeps moving and reduces the chances of this type of damage occurring.  
</UL> 
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Water Pump</FONT></B></CENTER>                                                  

<P>
Water pumps come in many designs, but most include a rotating impeller, which forces the coolant through the engine block.  In most rear wheel drive cars, the fan is installed on the end of the water pump shaft. Many water pumps have a spring-loaded seal to avoid leakage of water around the pump shaft. Modern pumps are fitted with pre-packed ball bearings, which are sealed at each end to eliminate the need for lubrication.   
<P>
Impeller type water pumps must turn rapidly to be efficient, and worn or loose drive belts can permit slippage which is not easily detected.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Expansion (Overflow) Tank</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Several cooling systems make use of a clear plastic container, which is connected to the overflow tube from the radiator. This container provides extra storage space for the coolant when it expands and is called the expansion, or overflow tank. It is also known as the coolant reservoir, or overflow canister.  
<P>
As the engine heats up, the coolant inside it expands. Without the expansion tank, the coolant would flow out of the overflow tube and be lost from the cooling system onto the street. Instead, the coolant flows into the expansion tank.  
<P>
Since a vacuum is created in the cooling system when the engine cools, the vacuum causes some of the coolant in the expansion tube to be sucked back into the system. Because a cooling system with an expansion tank is virtually a closed system, the coolant can flow between the system and the expansion tank as it expands and contracts. This way, no coolant is lost if the system is functioning properly.  
<P>
Another function of the expansion tank is to remove air bubbles from the cooling system. Coolant without air-bubbles is much more efficient than coolant with air bubbles, because it absorbs heat much faster.  
<P>
The advantage of the expansion tank is that while the level of coolant contained in it rises and falls, the radiator is always full.  
<P>
Older cars can easily be fitted with expansion tanks, simply by mounting the tank near the radiator, connecting it to the overflow tube, and replacing the radiator cap.
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>  Radiator Cap (Pressure Cap)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The radiator cap acts as more than just a "lid" for your radiator; it keeps your engine cool by sealing and pressurizing the coolant inside it.  
<P>
What makes the radiator cap special is that it is designed to hold the coolant in your radiator under a predetermined amount of pressure. If the coolant was not kept under pressure, it would start to boil, and soon you would have boiled all of your coolant away.  
<P>
However, the radiator (or pressure) cap prevents this from happening by exerting enough pressure to keep the coolant from boiling. Normally, water (coolant) boils at 212 degrees F, but if the pressure is increased, the boiling temperature is also increased. Since the boiling point goes up when the pressure goes up, the coolant can be safely heated to a temperature above 212 degrees F without boiling.   
<P>
What makes this important is that the higher the temperature of the coolant is, the greater the temperature gap between it and the air temperature is. This is the principle that causes the cooling system to work; the hotter the coolant is, the faster the heat in it moves to the radiator and the air passing by. So, a cooling system under pressure takes heat away from the engine faster, which makes it more efficient.  
<P>
If your cooling system is under too much pressure, it can "blow its top!" To prevent this, the radiator cap has a pressure relief valve. The valve has a preset rating that allows it to take just up to a certain amount of pressure. When you turn the cap on the filler neck of the radiator, you seal the upper and lower sealing surfaces of the filler neck. The pressure relief valve spring is compressed against the lower seal when you lock the cap.  
<P>
The radiator filler neck has an overflow tube right between the two sealing surfaces. If the pressure in the cooling system exceeds the preset rating of your cap, its pressure relief valve allows the lower seal to be lifted from its seat. Then the excess pressure (coolant,air) can squish through the overflow tube to the ground or the coolant reservoir.  
<P>
Once enough pressure has been released (the caps preset rating), the pressure relief valve is again closed by the spring.  
<P>
The pressure cap can be tested with a cooling system pressure tester, using an adapter, to make certain that it is living up to its pressure rating. It should be replaced if it fails the test.  
<P>
Note: Most radiator pressure caps are not meant to be removed. Coolant should always be added through the expansion (overflow) tank. NEVER REMOVE THE RADIATOR CAP FROM A HOT ENGINE. REMOVING THE PRESSURE CAN CAUSE STEAM TO SHOOT OUT AND SERIOUSLY BURN YOU.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Cooling Fans</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The reason the coolant goes into the radiator is to allow air to pass through it and cool the coolant. When you are driving fast enough, the air rushes through the grille of the car and passes through the radiator core. If you aren't driving fast enough to push air through the radiator, then the fan will pull the air through.  
<P>
The fan improves cooling when you are driving at slow speeds, or if the engine is idling. It is usually mounted on the water pump shaft, and is turned by the same belt that drives the water pump and the alternator, although it can be mounted as an independent unit. Most independently mounted fans are electric.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Belt Powered Fans</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The fan's activity is not always necessary, and it takes power from the engine to spin. For this reason a thermostatic control, or fan clutch, is often used to reduce drive torque when it isn't needed (variable-speed fan). A different type of fan uses centrifugal force to move its flexible plastic blades, by flattening them when the engine rpm is high (flexible-blade fan). The less angle the blade shave, the less power they use. The idea of these units is to save horsepower and reduce the noise the fan makes.  
<P>
A fan can have from four to six blades to suck the air through the radiator. Often the radiator has a shroud for the fan to keep it from recirculating the same hot air that has collected behind the radiator. Many fans have irregularly spaced blades to reduce resonant noise. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Electric Fans   </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Front-wheel drive engines mounted transversely usually use electric fans to cool the engine. The radiator is located in the usual place, but an electric motor drives the fan. A thermostatic switch is used to turn the fan on and off at predetermined temperature settings, which it senses. The exception to this is air conditioning. If you turn on the air conditioner, you bypass the thermostatic switch, and the fan runs continuously. If you turn off the air conditioner, the thermostatic switch is re-activated, and goes back to turning the fan on and off, according to its instructions. Many cars have one electric fan for normal cooling and a separate one just for when the air conditioner is on.  
<P>
There are some really nice features about the electric fan. The nicest feature is that you don't have to keep an eye on the treacherous old fan belt -- there isn't one, so you don't have to worry about its health and fitness. It's also quieter, and less of a power drain on the engine. They also help your engine by continuing to cool it after it's turned off.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>V-Belt (Fan Belt)  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The fan (drive) belt wedges neatly into the different pulley grooves. The belt uses the tension and friction to turn the auxiliary devices.  
<P>
The fan belt is usually V-shaped, so it is also called a V-belt.  The fan belt friction comes from the sides of the belt and the sides of the pulley grooves to transmit power from one pulley to the other through the belt. Since the sides of the belt are used for transmission of power, the sides have very large surface areas.  The reason that the belt does not slip is because of the wedging action of the belt as it curves into the pulley grooves.  
<P>
Because your belts are so essential to so many parts of your engine, it is a very good idea to periodically check their condition. Check for cracking, splitting, or fraying, especially before summer.  Also, check the tightness of the belt and have it adjusted according to your owner's manual specifications.  Belts have a tendency to loosen with use. On the other hand, you don't want the belt to be too tight, or it will put too much pressure on the accessory bearings and cause them to die an early death. If a belt is over three years old, have it replaced even if it looks good.

<head><title>Definition of Technology Transfer</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<CENTER><h2><img align=middle src="/flc/flcmed.gif">  Definition of Technology Transfer</h2></center>
</head>
<hr>
<body>
Many definitions of technology transfer have been developed to
suit the needs of the individual organizations or activities. <p>
The FLC, operating as a consortium of its members, maintains a
definition which will accommodate all of its member departments
and agencies, and their laboratories and centers.  Within the
FLC, technology transfer is defined as:<p>

       <h4>    The process by which existing knowledge, facilities or
           capabilities developed under federal R&D funding are
           utilized to fulfill public and private needs.</h4>


Although this process can be very simple or quite complex, it
basically involves a technical resource (e.g., federal
laboratory), a user (e.g., small business), and some interface
connecting the two.<p>

Even within the FLC, the approach used by the individual
laboratory varies.  Technology transfer remains part "science"
and part "art," requiring an FLC representative to select an
operating mode which works for him/her, the laboratory, and the
clientele.<p>

"Technology transfer" includes a range of formal and informal
cooperations between federal laboratories and the public and
private sectors.  The purpose of the transfer is to strengthen
the nation's economy by accelerating the application of federal
laboratory technology and resources to private and public needs
and opportunities.  Product improvement, service efficiencies,
improved manufacturing processes, joint development to address
government and private sector needs, and the development of major
new products for the international marketplace are the results of
successful technology transfer efforts.<p>

<h3>FLC's Hayes Named Librarian of the Year</h3>

Kate Hayes, coordinator of the Technology Transfer Center (TTIC)
of the National Agricultural Laboratory (NAL), has been selected
as the first &quot;Librarian/Information Specialist of the Year&quot;
by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS).
<p>
A native of Weatherly, PA, Hayes was recognized for her innovative
leadership of TTIC, including instituting new approaches to customer
services, reducing the time needed to respond to customer requests,
and &quot;elevating the role of library and information services
in the science and technology community.&quot; TTIC seeks to facilitate
the transfer of government agricultural research results to the
private agricultural community.
<p>
&quot;Since Kate established TTIC in 1990, her leadership has
been a key to the center's success,&quot; said NAL Director Pamela
Andre.  &quot;She has worked tirelessly to establish the center's
information functions and develop partnerships with the research
and business communities.  She has greatly expanded the role that
libraries and information play in science, engineering and the
process of technology transfer.&quot;
<p>
Hayes has a bachelor's degree in home economic education from
College Misericordia in Dallas, PA, and a master's degree in agriculture
and extension education from the University of Maryland, College
Park.  She has been with the National Agricultural Library since
1986, serving variously as coordinator of the Family Information
Center and the Fiber and Textile Information Center.  She also
was instrumental in launching the NAL's Rural Information Center,
the Youth Development Information Center and the Water Quality
Information Center.  She has headed TTIC since 1990.  Kate is
Chair of the FLC Information System Committee and a member of
the Executive Board.

<h3>Navy MTTC Opens Doors</h3>

The Manufacturing Technology Transfer Center (MTTC) at the Naval
Ordnance Station in Louisville is open for business.  A Navy MANTECH
Center of Excellence, the MTTC addresses the technical problems
of a rapidly changing armed forces/industrial complex.  As the
defense industrial base and other large corporations downsize,
there is a growing dependence upon small businesses to meet a
variety of defense industrial demands.  In addressing this issue,
the center links companies with other MANTECH centers and government
research and development laboratories, facilitating the transfer
of useful technologies between the private and public sectors.
 Additionally, the MTTC's Vendor Product Showcase provides client
companies with new opportunities by exposure to innovative software
and equipment.
<p>
Technology transfer improves the competitiveness and profitability
of many businesses.  To take advantage of existing research and
development efforts, the MTTC team identifies new technologies
developed by the DoD and other public and private organizations
to help businesses achieve their goals.  The MTTC also aids business
with product sales by advising the military of new applicable
commercial products these companies have developed.  In just a
few short months of operation, the MTTC has already identified
and is working to transfer several technologies.

<h3>Calendar</h3>

<b>Technology Partnering: Can You Count on the Government?</b>
<p>
Technology collaborations between the government and the private
sector have been multiplying in recent years, each side recognizing
that it cannot afford to support alone the cutting-edge research
necessary for a healthy economy.
<p>
As lucrative as those partnerships may be, however, they often
are strained by disagreements over the appropriate roles for the
government and the availability of public funding.
<p>
The presidential and congressional election may well have determined
the course of government-private industry partnerships in technology
in coming years, including the Advanced Technology Program, the
Dual-Use Applications Program, cooperative R&amp;D agreements,
and other collaborative efforts at federal agencies and laboratories.
<p>
On March 3-4, 1997, in Washington, DC, the McGraw-Hill Companies'
<i>Federal Technology Report</i> will convene a team of decision-makers
from the Clinton administration, Congress, federal laboratories
and industry to present their expectations for technology partnering
in 1997.
<p>
The conference - <b>Technology Partnering: Can You Count On The
Government?</b> - will follow up on changes in the Clinton administration
and in Congress that will influence policies governing collaborations
between the government and the private sector and will decide
how much federal funding will be available for them.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<CENTER><h2><img align=middle src="/flc/flcmed.gif">   About The Federal Laboratory Consortium</h2></center>
</head>
<hr>
<body>
The Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer
(FLC) was organized in 1974 and formally chartered by the
Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 to promote and to
strengthen technology transfer nationwide. Today, more than 600
major federal laboratories and centers and their parent
departments and agencies are FLC members. <p>

The Consortium creates an environment that adds value to and
supports the technology transfer efforts of its members and
potential partners. The FLC develops and tests transfer methods,
addresses barriers to the process, provides training, highlights
grass-roots transfer efforts, and emphasizes national initiatives
where technology transfer has a role. For the public and private
sector, the FLC brings laboratories together with potential users
of government-developed technologies. This is in part
accomplished by the FLC Laboratory Locator Network and regional
and national meetings.<p> 

In consonance with the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986
and related federal policy, the mission of the FLC is:<p>

To promote and facilitate the rapid movement of federal
laboratory research results and technologies into the
mainstream of the U.S. economy.<p>

The approach of the FLC is to use a coordinated program that
meets the technology transfer support needs of FLC member
laboratories, agencies, and their potential partners in the
transfer process. <p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

In consonance with the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986
and related federal policy, the mission of the FLC is:<p>

   <ul>
<li>To promote and facilitate the rapid movement of federal
     laboratory research results and technologies into the
     mainstream of the U.S. economy.
</ul>
 <ul>
<li>   The approach of the FLC is to use a coordinated program that
     meets the technology transfer support needs of FLC member
     laboratories, agencies, and their potential partners in the
     transfer process. 
</ul>

<h2>The purposes of the FLC are to:</h2>

   <ul>
<li>   promote and facilitate the full range of technical
          cooperation between the federal laboratories and
          America's large and small businesses, academia, state
          and local governments, and federal agencies;
</ul>
    <ul>
<li>    provide direct services to member laboratories and 
          agencies in support of their technology transfer
          efforts;
</ul>
       <ul>
<li>enhance efforts that couple federal laboratories with  
          American industry and small businesses to strengthen
          the nation's economic competitiveness;
</ul>
       <ul>
<li>stimulate acceptance by the U.S. private and public 
          sectors of the federal laboratory system and technology
          transfer as valuable assets;
</ul>
<ul>
<li>         collaborate with local, state, regional and national
       organizations that promote technical cooperation;
</ul>
<ul>
<li>promote further development and adoption of effective
          methods for federal laboratory domestic technology
          transfer;
</ul>

        <ul>
<li>improve the effectiveness of individual and
          organizational  efforts in technology transfer through
          training, recognition, awards and evaluation of the FLC
          program;
</ul>
<ul>
<li> participate in and sponsor the development of novel
          models for federal laboratory cooperation with state,
          local, or private nonprofit technology transfer
          organizations; and
</ul>
<ul>
<li>serve as an interagency forum to develop and strengthen
          nationwide technology transfer in support of national
          policy.
</ul>

<h2>The FLC Statement of Goals and Objectives stipulates that:</h2><p>

"It is the policy of the FLC to identify and mobilize the
necessary resources to provide the environment, the organization,
and the necessary technology transfer mechanisms required to
facilitate the fullest possible utilization of federally
sponsored research and development results by both public and
private sector potential users."<p>

To accomplish its goals and objectives, the FLC operates as an
association of federal research and development (R&D)
laboratories, centers and departments and agencies that work
together to maximize the transfer of technology.<p>

More than 600 of the largest federal government research
laboratories and centers representing 16 federal departments and
agencies are presently members of the FLC.  <b>They are:</b> 
<ol>
<li><b>  Department of Agriculture
<li>     Department of the Air Force
<li>     Department of the Army
<li>     Central Intelligence Agency
<li>     Department of Commerce
<li>     Department of Energy
<li>     Environmental Protection Agency
<li>     Department of Health and Human Services
<li>     Department of the Interior
<li>     Department of Justice
<li>     National Aeronautics and Space Administration
<li>     National Science Foundation
<li>     Department of the Navy
<li>     Tennessee Valley Authority
<li>     Department of Transportation
<li>     Department of Veterans Affairs</b>
</ol>

Direct linkage with the massive federal research and development
resources of these 16 departments and agencies is a major
strength of the FLC.<p>

For industry and other public and private sector technology
seekers, the FLC serves as a point of entry to federal laboratory
expertise and technology.  Through its representatives, the FLC
has the ability to put a potential partner in contact with a
federal laboratory with expertise and capability in a specific
area of interest.<p>

Primary among users of federal technology is the federal
government.  One of the driving forces of FLC activities is to 
ensure that federal agencies are aware of applications of new
technologies developed within their own or other laboratories.<p>

Various networks have been established to facilitate the transfer
of technology to state and local governments.  The goal of these
networks is to assist and expedite the use of federal science and
technology in addressing state and local government needs.  The

<img src=m_glass.gif align=left border=0 ><h2>The FLC Laboratory Locator Network</h2>
</center>
<P>
<HR>For industry and other technology seekers, the FLC Locator Network
serves as a point of entry to federal laboratory expertise and technology.
In meeting this need, the network also handles requests from other organizations
working with the private sector. These organizations include NASA's Regional
Technology Transfer Centers, the National Technology Transfer Center and
state funded economic development centers.</P>

<P> Through its network of representatives, the FLC puts a potential partner
in contact with a federal laboratory with expertise and capability in a
specific area of interest. Once the FLC identifies the contact, the arrangements
for the technical exchange are between the user and the laboratory.</P>

<P> The network does best when the user makes the request as specific as
possible and identifies considerations such as technical need, constraints,
and intended use.</P>

<P> A central FLC Locator helps the network in matching user technical
requests for expertise and facilities with appropriate federal laboratory
capabilities.</P>

<H3>Specifically, the FLC Locator supports the network by:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Identifying laboratory technical resources that can respond to specific
requests;</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Providing referrals to other federal resources;</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Using an FLC Technical Specialist System to complement information
sources and network expertise;</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Publishing directories that focus on special needs such as automotive
materials or defense conversion partnerships.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The unique network structure of the FLC, the person-to-person technical
linkages, and the central FLC Locator are vital factors in linking user
needs to a federal laboratory person with a special expertise or capability.</LI>
</UL>

<title>Mechanisms</title>
<BODY BACKGROUND="backblue.gif">
<h2><center>  <img align=top src="/flc/flctiny.gif">   Mechanisms For Accessing Federal Resources
</center></h2></head><hr>
<body>
<b>D</b>o you know there are mechanisms available to access the knowledge
and expertise of people working in federal research and development
(R&D) laboratories and centers who may be working on the very
issues that are confronting you?<p>

<b>D</b>o you know you can gain access to federal facilities, equipment
and intellectual property?<p>

<b>T</b>his year, about $25 billion of federally funded R&D is taking
place at over 700 federal research and development laboratories and
centers.  Over 100,000 scientists and engineers work at these sites
that address virtually every area of science and technology.<p>

<b>T</b>hese federal laboratories are looking to industry to transfer
federal technologies and expertise to commercial applications that
will improve the U.S. economy.  There are many ways now possible to
make the transfer process work including cooperative agreements. 
You can use these mechanisms to gain access to the expertise and
technologies of the federal laboratory system.<p>


<h3>SHARING INFORMATION</h3>

<b>F</b>ederal laboratories share initial information with you through
workshops, briefings, and visits.  Often, the sharing is a
precursor to longer-term interactions between a company and a
federal R&D center.  Disseminating information has always been a
responsibility of federal laboratories; now there is an emphasis on
technology use as potential business opportunities for U.S.
companies.<p>

For special situations, the parties sharing information use
non-disclosure agreements prior to receiving or giving out
proprietary information.<p>

Much information is available about federal laboratory R&D through
publications at scientific and technical meetings and in technical
presentations.  This information along with other resources such as
licensable technologies, software and research-in-progress are
accessible through commercial and government databases and
specialized technical information centers.<p>

<h3>EXCHANGING PERSONNEL</h3>

<b>L</b>egislation and policy changes have made personnel exchanges
easier.  Industrial staff are assigned to government laboratories;
in some cases, reverse assignments also take place.  The employer
pays its own staff salary costs; the host organization provides
services and supplies.  Both organizations benefit by learning from
each other.  Personnel exchanges are excellent first steps toward
long-term alliances between federal R&D facilities and U.S.
industry.<p>

<h3>FINDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE</h3>


<b>U</b>nique government expertise is available to provide technical
assistance to industry.  Small businesses especially benefit from
technical assistance and suggestions from laboratory staff. 
Depending on the circumstances, there may be no charge for
technical assistance.  Another way to discuss technical problems is
by visiting federal laboratories.  Technical assistance may open
the door to a later technology transfer. <p>


<h3>USING UNIQUE FEDERAL LABORATORY FACILITIES & CAPABILITIES</h3>

<b>S</b>pecialized facilities provide unique capabilities not otherwise
available in the private sector.  Industry  access to such
facilities is often on a cost-reimbursable basis, and the
information acquired generally belongs to the company.  Under
circumstances when the information is also of interest to the
government or scientific community at large, industry may be able
to negotiate different terms under cooperative research and
development or other agreements.  Some facilities are dedicated to
providing equipment, expertise, information and other types of
assistance to outside organizations.<p>

Some federal laboratories have provisions for undertaking sponsored
research where industry reimburses the laboratory for work done at
the facility.  In such instances, the work carried out must require
unique capabilities not available in the private sector.<p>

<h3>LICENSING PATENTS AND TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW
</h3>
<b>L</b>icensing patents and patent applications and transferring
technical know-how have made technology transfer more productive
and helped staff at federal laboratories to recognize and support
their inventions.  In fact, exclusive licensing need not inhibit
the broad application of the technology.  In many cases, it can be
applied in different industrial sectors and markets, offering an
opportunity for non-competitors to collaborate and obtain exclusive
use of a federal technology for their specific markets.<p>

<h3>ACQUIRING SOFTWARE
</h3>

<b>A</b>lthough federal and non-federal employees at a federal laboratory
may protect software-related inventions by patent, U.S. law
generally prohibits federal employees from copyrighting software. 
However, there are instances when companies have entered into
Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRDAs) with
federal software developers and have made such significant
contributions or changes to the software, that the company has been
able to copyright the product resulting from the CRDA effort.

<h3>PERFORMING COOPERATIVE R&D
</h3>

<b>T</b>here are many ways the public and private sectors perform
cooperative R&D with the federal laboratories.  These include
memoranda of understanding and other cooperative arrangements. 
Special authorities have been granted to the Army Corps of
Engineers and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<p>

<h3>USING COOPERATIVE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS (CRDAS)</h3>


<b>I</b>n 1986 and 1989, legislation was enacted as part of the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act to enable federal
laboratories to enter into cooperative research and development
agreements (CRDAs, also known as CRADAs) with private businesses
and other entities.  Since then, more than 1000 CRDAs have been
signed based on this authority.  CRDAs provide the means to
leverage R&D efforts and to create teams for solving technological
and industrial problems.  Through CRDAs, companies or groups of
companies can work with one or more federal laboratories to pool
resources and share risks in developing technologies.  The CRDA is
a useful R&D relationship when the transfer of technology and
subsequent transfer of rights are expected to be important to the
collaborating party.<p>

CRDAs are potentially very flexible.  There are many benefits.  The
law sets the following conditions for a CRDA:<p>

<ol>
<li>Collaboration involves the expenditure of federal funds and the
use of federal personnel, services, facilities, equipment,
intellectual property or other resources.  However, no federal
funds may flow to the CRDA partner.<p>

<li>Non-federal contributions include funds, personnel, services,
facilities, equipment, intellectual property or other resources.<p>

<li>Special consideration is given to small businesses and
consortia involving small businesses.<p>

<li>Preference is given to businesses that are located in the
United States and undertake to manufacture substantially in the
United States products that embody inventions developed under the
CRDA or are produced using inventions developed under the CRDA.<p>

<li>The United States Government always retains a nonexclusive or
nontransferable, irrevocable, and paid-up license to practice any
inventions developed under a CRDA for governmental purposes.<p>

<li>The federal laboratory may in advance grant or agree to grant
to a collaborating party exclusive patent licenses or assignments
for all laboratory employee inventions made under the CRDA.<p>

<li>Federal laboratories may protect from public access
commercially valuable information produced under CRDAs by both
federal and non-federal participants for up to five years as
negotiated for each CRDA; trade secrets or commercially valuable
information that is privileged or confidential information which is
obtained in the conduct of research or as a result of activities
under a CRDA from a non-federal participant will not be disclosed.<p>
</ol>
As more experience is gained with CRDAs and Space Act Agreements,
federal departments and agencies are developing general policy
guidelines.  For instance, IR&D funds may be used as a CRDA
contribution in the case of DOD and NASA contractors, providing the
costs would have been allowable as IR&D had there been no CRDA.


<h3>WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH NASA</h3>


<b>T</b>he National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has
separate, broad authority to encourage private sector use of NASA
space research and technology, as well as a long history of working
with industry.  NASA's mandates include both the 1958 Space Act and
the President's National Space Policy issued in 1989.  As is the
case with CRDAs, Space Act Agreements can be used to provide mutual
leverage of government and industry resources in the cooperative
pursuit of R&D efforts.  As such, IR&D funds may be used in
performing these agreements, providing the costs would have been
allowable as IR&D had there been no agreement.  Under its
authority, NASA enters into a variety of nonreimbursable or
reimbursable agreements involving the use or exchange of
facilities, equipment, information, expertise, intellectual
property rights, or other resources.  While all such agreements are
tailored to fit the circumstances, as a general rule NASA acquires
no rights to inventions made by the private participant under the
Space Act agreement, and will afford the participant first option
to obtain an exclusive, royalty-bearing commercial license to
inventions made by NASA employees.  The agreement also may be
coordinated with a similar license for existing patents NASA may
have in its portfolio.  Any commercially valuable information
obtained from or produced by a participant will be disclosed and
used only for the purposes of the agreement, and any such
information generated by NASA will be protected from public access
to the extent permitted by law.<p>

<h3>FORMING CONSORTIA
</h3>

<b>F</b>ederal laboratories and U.S. industry work together within
consortia.  Some special centers draw collectively upon the
expertise of laboratories, universities and industry to focus on
broad technologies that can be pursued cooperatively until specific
market opportunities arise.  Becoming more common are horizontal
consortia, known as "pre-competitive  R&D consortia" where
industrial competitors may pool their resources in research and
development which is pre-competitive.  Industrial participants may
protect themselves from possible treble damages imposed under
anti-trust laws by filing with the Department of Justice under The
National Cooperative Research Act of 1984.  Vertical consortia are
becoming more common with a company and its vendor collaborating
with a federal laboratory in order to incorporate new technology in
the vendor's product.<p>

<h3>USING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS</h3>


<b>G</b>overnment contractors and contractors to government-owned,
contractor operated laboratories already have the commercial rights
to patented inventions made under their contracts.  This is a large
resource for potential commercial development.<p>

A book describing the winners in <B>RIB-IT</B>, a national program
designed to identify marketable technologies, is now available.
The 313-page book, <i><B>RIB-IT Views</B>: 38 Technology Assessments
and Partnership Opportunities From the RIB-IT Program</i>, provides
model case studies with the standards for assessing the commercial
potential of technologies.
<P>
RIB-IT, or Reinvention Initiative Between Industry and Technology,
is a program with the following goals:
<UL>
<LI>to establish an innovative collaboration in which both the
FLC Regions and the Regional Technology Transfer Centers (RTTCs) 
would have prominent roles and to strengthen the network for post-TAP-IN efforts;
<LI>to help the network build bridges to meet both regional and
national needs;
<LI>to identify innovative marketable laboratory defense technologies
that would otherwise not receive deserved exposure for commercial
exploitation; and
<LI>to find commercial applications and markets for the thoroughly
evaluated and selected defense technologies.
</UL>

<P>
RIB-IT has been widely acclaimed and nationally recognized and
has easily met and exceeded its first year goals. The second phase
of RIB-IT is under development.

<title>FLC Laboratory of the Month</title>
<BODY BACKGROUND="/flc/backblu.jpg">
<h2><CENTER>FLC Laboratory of the Month<br><font size=+1>December, 1996</font><br>
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</CENTER> </h2>
</head>
<center><IMG SRC="/flc/rainbow.gif"></center><p>
<body>
<P>
The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is one of nine U.S.
Department of Energy multiprogram national laboratories.  Battelle
operates the Laboratory, which is located in Richland, Washington.
 A satellite research facility, the Marine Sciences Laboratory,
is located at Sequim, Washington.
<P>
The Laboratory's core mission is to deliver environmental science
and technology in the service of the nation and humanity. Through
basic research, we create fundamental knowledge of natural, engineered,
and social systems that is the basis for both effective environmental
technology and sound public policy. Our broad, integrated capabilities
help us find solutions to the most complex environmental challenges
facing the DOE and the nation. We solve legacy environmental problems
by delivering technologies that remedy existing environmental
hazards; we address today's environmental needs with technologies
that prevent pollution and minimize waste; and we are laying the
technical foundation for tomorrow's inherently clean energy and
industrial processes. We also apply our capabilities to meet selected
needs in national security, energy, and human health; to strengthen
the U.S. economy; and to support the education of future scientists
and engineers.  
<P>
The Laboratory has a proven track record of successful partnerships
with industry, educational institutions, government organizations
and businesses of all sizes.  Our many unique facilities and other
resources enable us to participate in a broad network of research
and development activities.  For example, within our new William
R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, scientists
from around the world can join forces in solving complex environmental
problems.
<P>
Our resources are backed up by the entire Battelle Memorial Institute,
the world's largest and oldest contract research organization.
Battelle has operated Pacific Northwest since the Laboratory was
established in 1965.  Under a special contractual agreement, Battelle
and government-owned facilities and equipment are combined in
a Consolidated Laboratory where Battelle conducts work for DOE
as well as other government agencies and industry.

<a name="Encounters"></a><b><h3>Close Encounters of the Endangered Kind</h3></b>
He's out there, swimming around the Gulf of Mexico, eating fish, and probably wondering about the annoying little contraption glued to his shell. This lone Kemps Ridley sea turtle probably was unaware that he was being followed by a group of students from Pearl River County, Mississippi. 
<p>
Local school children tracked the endangered sea turtle through a pilot project sponsored by the NASA Teacher Resource Center at John C. Stennis Space Center. &quot;Close Encounters of the Endangered Kind&quot; used information provided by the National Marine Fisheries Service at Stennis, as well as by individual groups that participated in endangered wildlife studies, to provide an educational tracking program for area students.
<p>
Students at Picayune's West Side Elementary School and Carriere's Pearl River Central High School tracked the endangered Kemps Ridley sea turtle, which was one of three turtles released off the coast of Louisiana in August 1994. Though two of the turtles could not be tracked, one turtle sent back almost 70 transmissions over a six-month period. In January 1996, the sea turtle was located off the coast of Key West, Florida.
<p>
The data provided was processed through a geographic information system database computer program called GeoMap. GeoMap allows users to display and manipulate line graph maps of the United States (the mainland and Hawaii), as well as indicate interstates, roads, rivers, and other attributes.
<p>
By tracking the locations of the endangered species, students develop problem-solving and communications skills while actively participating in a hands-on science lesson. The lessons incorporated geography, math, language arts, and science into the curriculum while allowing students to participate in a real-world research situation.
<p>
&quot;I think this project would be a great addition to any science or computer class. And it could also be used with a variety of age levels,&quot; said Laurie Rhodes, a physical science and physics teacher at Pearl River Central High School. &quot;It shows students how science and technology go hand-in-hand.&quot; By using GeoMap, students can determine why the turtle has traveled to a certain area. Is it going there to feed? Is it a mating area? Is it simply leaving another area to get away from pollution?
<p>
Evelyn Edwards, fifth-grade teacher at West Side Elementary School, began using the program this past school year. She said that before her students began a day's work on the program, they enjoyed predicting where the turtle would be next, then got excited to see how close they had guessed. She also said the program is a valuable tool for making students aware of the need to take care of the environment. It also builds their interests in mapping, the oceans, and the seasons. &quot;It builds awareness of the environment and the need to keep it safe for all life,&quot; Edwards said.
<p>
By participating in &quot;Close Encounters&quot; students not only use computers to enhance their learning, but also apply their knowledge of science (the turtle habitats and habits), math (measuring and calculating distances), geography (mapping the transmissions), and communications (interpreting and discussing the data).
<p>
Because the tracking mechanisms don't usually last more than 6 months, this turtle has probably disappeared into the cool waters of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the students had planned to pick up another set of sea turtles and maybe a group of baby eagles for their next project. (From <I>The Picayune (Miss.) Item</I>, Feb. 4, 1996.)

<a name="CSS"></a><b><h3>Coastal Systems Station: School Enrichment Program</h3></b>
An active employee volunteer program at the Navy's CSS provides valuable educational support to schools in and around Panama City, Florida, to heighten knowledge of math and science in several areas:
<ul>
<li>regional science and engineering fairs<br>
--provide the CSS gymnasium and support rooms for 3 days
<li>employment for students to bolster professional awareness <br>
--hire qualified students who are pursuing a technical career path for summer jobs
<li>school visitation<br>
--participate in career days, science fairs, and classroom lectures
</ul>
Samples of synopses for the &quot;Teach-A-Unit&quot; classroom lectures for school visitation are shown in the box below. Synopses for many more lectures are available. <I>For more information, contact Lori Zipes</I> <I>at 904-234-4925/DSN 436-4925</I>.
<h3>Sample Teach-A-Unit Synopses</h3>
<b>Elementary School: </b><i><b>How Things Fly</b></i><br>
<i>Lecturer discusses the principles of flight. Aircraft wing design, lift and drag, and turbulent and laminar flow is demonstrated with a simple room fan acting as a wind tunnel, and pliable metal shapes are tested as potential &quot;wings.&quot; A room with a window is required.</i> 
<P>
<b>Elementary/Middle/High School: </b><i><b>Fighting Fire with Math</b></i><br>
<i>Lecture discusses the math involved in fighting fires: cubic footage of rooms, how much water is needed to produce a sufficient amount of steam (gallons of water to steam), friction losses in the hose. The lecture is geared toward the importance of math in everyday life and the importance of education in general.</i> 
<P>
In addition to the lectures is the &quot;Dr. Science Road Show,&quot; which is geared toward elementary school audiences. Wacky Dr. Science and his colleague, Mr. Gallagher, introduce students to basic scientific principles and technology with hands-on props and demonstrations, which often involve school faculty. Interested students can join the Federation of Junior Scientists with a promise to work hard and maintain excellent grades in math and science. <I>For more information, contact Frank Downs at 904-235-5479/DSN

<P>
PACT was the syndicate for the 1995 &quot;Young America&quot; America's Cup entry. The program is packaged so that it can be reproduced each year. PACT is offered to all eighth graders. First an 11-week school education program was provided via &quot;Newspapers in Education,&quot; which presents the technology required to compete for the Cup. Students can design, construct, and compete their own model vessels. <I>For more information, contact Gary Deeds at 904-234-4919/DSN 436-4919 </I>

Minority students will learn about moving research out of the laboratories and into the business world, thanks to the one-year Entrepreneurial Technology Apprenticeship Program (ETAP) at NTTC. ETAP recruited students from historically black colleges and universities and from other minority institutions; in the fall, these students will be placed in training positions at federal laboratories, universities, manufacturing technology centers, and minority-owned companies.
<P>
ETAP's goal is to stimulate qualified minority students to pursue technology management careers via academic experience, hands-on training, a structured exposure to real-world work experiences, and mentoring.
<P>
The first phase of the program, an eight-week orientation at the NTTC's new product development laboratories and the Center for Educational Technologies at the campus of Wheeling Jesuit College, is nearly done. During this time, the students master an ETAP on-line learning system. Then they are sent to sponsors in the field. Students receive a $1,600 monthly stipend during the apprenticeship.
<P>
After they complete their apprenticeship, students receive (1) academic credit from Wheeling Jesuit that transfers to their home institutions and (2) seasoned insight into a world that is difficult to grasp.

<a name="Deux"></a><h3><b>Naval Research Laboratory Summer Scholars, Part Deux</b></h3>
In the last issue of <I>eduLINK</I>, the Summer Scholar Program at NRL, Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, was highlighted. In addition to the scholars from last two years, four new students arrived at NRL-Stennis this year: Shondria Williams and Kendra Hendix, both from Mississippi Valley State University; Arthur Gates, Alcorn State University; and Kendra Bell, Jackson State University.
<P>
In this issue, <A HREF="#Internship">Nicholas Gardner</A>, a third-year NRL Summer Scholar, describes work he has done with his mentor, Dr. George Smith.
<p>
<a name="Internship"></a><b><h3>1995 Summer Internship</h3></b>
<b>Nicholas Gardner<br>
University of Mississippi </b>
<p>
For the past two summers (1994) and (1995), I have been afforded the opportunity to work in research at the Naval Research Laboratory on the grounds of the Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, MS. They were very eventful experiences which I anticipate will be very useful in the future. Research with the Government is a different type of employment. The atmosphere is very relaxed and personal, yet each one is expected to do his/her respective job. There were many projects that I came into contact with, but my project of primary concern was Study of Mismatch Induced Range and Depth Shift Errors in Conventional Matched-Field Processing. I worked with a world-recognized scientist (physicist), Dr. George B. Smith. He works in Ocean Acoustics at the lab but he specializes in Quantum Physics so we had some pretty &quot;out there&quot; (if you will allow) conversations and sessions. This project was an actual funded project that Dr. Smith was working on so it was not just busy work. The things I generated will actually be used to try to explain certain phenomena related to the project. The project was funded by NSF (National Science Foundation), ONR (Office of Naval Research), and in part by MAMP [<i>Ed. Note</i>: Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation]..<p>
The project is one concerning the Department of Defense, more specifically, antisubmarine warfare. My job consisted mainly of running data simulations and taking the generated data and making Matched-Field &quot;runs&quot; on my computer. This output was plotted and used to find information which we were interested in for the project. Another important aspect of the experience was being very good at taking and following instructions, in order to interpret plots. Critical and creative thinking is also important in making decisions, predictions, and assumptions.<p>
This is an experience that everyone should try to experience. The lab also takes in four Freshmen from across the state each year as part of the AMP and NSF. I would encourage all Freshman science, engineering, and mathematics majors to contact Ms. Vinson to obtain information to apply for the summer of 1996. Applications are usually taken at the beginning of the spring semester. Good luck with your endeavors and thanks for reading!<p>

<a name="Sun"></a><b><h3>Sun Seekers</h3></b>
<i>&quot;From paper to pavement, the construction of the model solar cars allows students to employ principles of math and science in an enjoyable atmosphere.  Each student walks away from this experience with a better understanding of the world of science and technology.&quot;</i><br>
-- Bill Sternberg
<p>
It was not a sunny day, but they were there just the same, watching for any ray that might pierce the cloudy sky and find its way to earth. It was hard to be patient because they were counting on the remarkable energy of the sun.
<p>
Early last May over 200 Iowa middle school students learned what it's like to race on rays as they waited for a fickle sun to power their model solar cars at the Junior Solar Sprint Competition in Ames, IA. Although the capricious star seldom appeared, it did supply enough energy to keep the cars rolling down the racetrack.
<p>
Held annually since 1990, the Junior Solar Sprint is a national program managed by the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. Ames Laboratory coordinates the Iowa program, which encourages students to use their math, science, and engineering skills to design, construct, and race model solar cars. Cosponsored by the Lab, the Iowa State University College of Education, and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the event involves students and their parents and teachers in a team effort that creates an enthusiasm for science.
<p>
&quot;The Junior Solar Sprint Competition is an opportunity for teams of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students to direct their scientific know-how, creative thinking, experimentation and teamwork toward solving real-world problems,&quot; said Chris Ohana, then acting coordinator for the Lab's Office of Educational Programs and a competition coordinator. &quot;The Lab provides team members with a standard solar cell and a motor, but the rest of the car is their brainchild. Unlimited ingenuity and inventiveness can be used in car construction.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Participating in the Junior Solar Sprint Competition gives students the opportunity to use their knowledge of science and math to produce their own creations,&quot; added Bill Sternberg, former student assistant in the Lab's Office of Educational Programs and also a competition coordinator. &quot;Given limited materials, students are challenged to develop an original finished product.&quot;
<p>
Originality was on overload at the Lab's Junior Solar Sprint Competition. Sleek lines, unique wheel configurations, unusual construction materials and brilliant hues were testimony to the cleverness the students displayed in planning and building their model solar cars. And the rewards came not just from participating in the competition but also from preparing for it.
<p>
&quot;The students learned a lot about cause and effect and how things go together while they were designing and building their model car,&quot; says Dave Miller, mentor for a team of sixth-grade boys from the Northwood Elementary School in Ames. &quot;They learned about solar cells in a very short time and got a lot out of the experience.&quot;
<p>
Team member Emily Nau emphasized the importance of team effort and exchanging ideas during the development of their model solar car. She said, &quot;We've been using cooperative learning in school. It's a neat way to approach science. When we were building our model car, we had a lot of meetings and talked about a lot of things that dealt with math and science.&quot; She recognized that the competition motivates students to tap their own technical abilities and shows how careers in science, math, and engineering can be both exciting and highly rewarding.
<p>
Michael Miller, a member of the Northwood boys team and son of mentor Dave, adds, &quot;In school we've been learning about pollution, and solar cars are a good way to stop pollution. Hopefully, their prices will go down,&quot; he says with a grin, possibly looking ahead to his future mode of transportation.

<a name="ORTA"></a><b><h3>ORTA Brings Dual-Use Concept to Georgia Science Fair</h3></b>
The Warner-Robins Air Logistics Center's Office of Research and Technology Application is repeatedly asked by the local community to provide judging teams of select scientists and engineers to judge science projects at various science fairs. This past February, however, Andy Adsit went one step further and introduced the concept of dual-use technology to the young Houston County regional science fair participants!
<p>
All of the science projects were judged based on general science fair criteria to identify the overall science fair winners, which would then advance to the state science fair in Athens, Georgia. About 20 of the 180 science projects were then identified as having dual-use potential for applications in both the private sector and the Air Force. These dual-use science projects were then judged based on carefully selected Air Force evaluation criteria by a team of seven judges assembled and led by Adsit.
<p>
Two junior division (6th-9th grades) Air Force award recipients were selected for the exceptional dual-use potential of their studies of potential improvements in aircraft propeller designs. One student compared different propeller designs via the amount each propeller would lift a sheet of Plexiglas from the bottom of a test rig. The second student tested propeller designs, which varied by the number of propellers in the design by measuring the amount of wind &quot;current&quot; each propeller design produced.
<p>

<a name="Adopt"></a><h3><b>Adopt-A-Ship:  Oceanography Sails in the Classroom</b></h3>
The Naval Oceanographic Office takes education in oceanography from sea to shore.  The pilot program, Adopt-A-Ship, introduces young people to oceanographic survey practices, life at sea, and foreign ports.  Students correspond with the &quot;adopted&quot; ship's crew and scientists.  The program's inter-disciplinary curriculum program allows students to gain real-world knowledge about the US Navy, the sea and seafaring nautical skills, oceanography, meteorology, marine biology, geology, communications, and distant lands and people.
<p>
The Senior NAVOCEANO representative aboard acts as the initial contact for the classroom; the ship's manager oversees a book from the students containing their photos and biographies, and the students receive the same information from the crew.
<p>
Currently, the Earle B. Wood Middle School in Maryland, Elmbrook Middle School in Wisconsin, and West Lauderdale High School in Mississippi have adopted NAVOCEANO ships.  The USNS <i>Silas Bent</i> serves as the oceanographic classroom for the Earle B. Wood Middle School.  The USNS <i>Kane</i> is adopted by the Elmbrook Middle School.  At home, the USNS <i>Pathfinder</i> makes the connection with the West Lauderdale High School, as the oceanographic ship was built at Moss Point, Mississippi.
<p>
To kick off the program at Earle B. Wood Middle School, Commander Darrell Smith visited the classroom of Ms. Lance Dempsey in November 1995.  A geography teacher, Ms. Dempsey acts as the school's coordinator for the program.  Her class received a chart with points marked at San Diego, California, and Sasebo, Japan -- the ship's points of departure and arrival.  In a basic session, the students learned how to plot points on the class map.  Daily position reports were sent to the school so the class could plot the <i>Bent's</i> course.
<p>
Commander Smith also discussed how oceanographic data are gathered from the NAVOCEANO platforms and how collecting this information relates to the US Navy.  After Smith described what a typical survey operation involves, the students began a question-and-answer session.  They were intrigued with life at sea and the stories they were told about it.
<p>
Taking time to teach not only about oceanography, but also meteorology, Smith arranged for a weather balloon to be launched from the school.  AG1 Jackson and AGAN Law from the Naval Ice Center were on hand to release the balloon and to describe the atmosphere based on the data received.
<p>
The program ensures that students have the opportunity to receive a broad-based scientific education and to interact with Navy oceanographers and aerographers mates, who serve as excellent role models.  Seeing real-world applications of oceanography and meteorology can ignite a fire under a student's willingness to learn.  The Adopt-A-Ship program is an outreach effort that makes the greatest investment -- one that is in the education of our nation's youth.

<a name="Phillips"></a><b><h3>Air Force Phillips Sponsors Weather Training for New Mexico Teachers </h3></b>
Teachers from 15 New Mexico schools met in September 1995 for hands-on training on &quot;Neighborhood Weather Net,&quot; a program sponsored by Air Force Phillips Laboratory and by Albuquerque's KOB-TV, Channel 4. Under this program, participating schools will use weather stations and computers linked to KOB-TV.
<p>
The program will give students experience using computers and data and the opportunity to learn more about their environment.
<p>
Students will record and send weather information to the television station where it will be consolidated and aired, giving TV viewers a real-time picture of area weather.
<p>
David Founds of Phillips' Plans Directorate oversees the program for the laboratory. &quot;This gives us an opportunity to get students more involved in the sciences. It's a natural outgrowth of our work in geophysics, the study of the Earth-- Sun relationship that causes weather patterns,&quot; he said.
<p>
Students will use a weather station in their classrooms to provide real-time weather information to KOB-TV. The weather station consists of a sensor station that gathers information on current and daily high and low temperatures, humidity, barometric pressure, light intensity, windspeed and direction, and precipitation. The information is logged and automatically downloaded to a computer with a modem and phone linked directly to KOB-TV. The data can be stored for up to 4 months and can be generated in different formats, including maps, graphs, and charts.
<p>
Teacher training was provided by employees from Automated Weather Source of Gaithersburg, Maryland, who have established similar automated weather stations.

<a name="Tennessee"></a><b><h3>DoE and <a href="#ORNL">ORNL</a> Link Tennessee Students to World of Information</h3></b>
Tennessee students can travel the world on their fingertips while never leaving the room by using Internet programs funded by the Department of Energy and managed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Through both the Oak Ridge Educational Network (OREN) and the Adventures in Supercomputing programs (AiS), DoE and ORNL have helped open computer windows in 59 Tennessee schools to a world of learning on the Internet. These programs help students search the world in a few seconds to answer their questions.
<p>
Access to the vast information on the Internet is sometimes not available to rural students, who don't have access to extensive research libraries like those at the University of Tennessee. Since one school, Wartburg Central, has had access to the Internet, the students' interest in computers has increased, and the computer class has tripled in size, according to David Staten, the math and computer teacher.
<p>
The AiS program is aimed at cultivating the interests of minority, female, and economically disadvantaged high school students in mathematics, science, and computing. The program simulates scientific experiments, which are safer and less costly than doing experiments in a laboratory. More than 3000 AiS students use high-performance computers, graphic workstations, and networks to conduct experiments that can be too complex or dangerous to study in a laboratory. For example, students can easily perform simulated crash tests to understand crash dynamics without the costs of using real cars. Supercomputing can also help predict the spread of fire or the path of a tornado.
<p>
In 1993-1994, Tennessee had the narrowest gap between male and female AiS users, according to the Center of Children and Technology. Female participation in AiS increased about 7 percent, and minority participation increased about 12 percent during 1994.
<p>
OREN is a wide-area network that connects elementary, middle, and senior high schools in Oak Ridge and more than a dozen counties, mainly in east and middle Tennessee to Internet tools that help students understand and explore physics, chemistry, art, and many other subjects without having to wait to learn them in high school. &quot;The scientific world increasingly relies on Internet computer tools to do research, solve mathematical problems, and simulate and model science experiments,&quot; said ORNL Director Dr. Alvin W. Trivelpiece. &quot;By linking schools to the Internet, ORNL can help students get excited learning new ways to analyze scientific data or write computer programs. The Internet will revolutionize the way students work and think by helping them tap into resources from around the world.&quot; 
<p>
Through OREN, DoE and ORNL has helped to train more than 1000 teachers in computer technology. The program has also provided free advanced computer training for over 300 teachers and students at the Saturday Academy for Computing and Mathematics, in which ORNL volunteers teach computing and mathematical tools to solve problems, such as deciphering DNA and the human genome.

<a name="Opportunity"></a><b><h3>How Do You Define Opportunity?</h3></b>
Answer: With the Summer Minority/Women Research Internship of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory! Established in 1993, this internship specifically focused on promising research opportunities for minority and women undergraduate students.
<p>
This summer will be the program's fourth year, and interns will be given exciting opportunities to conduct magnet-related research in a wide range of areas--biology, biomedical, chemistry engineering, geochemistry, material science, and physics. Students who are interested in management and administrative careers within scientific and technological areas are encouraged to apply. The internships are available at all three consortium sites: Florida State University in Tallahassee, the University of Florida in Gainesville, and Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
<p>
Interns are matched with a senior researcher at the NHMFL and will participate in the research efforts for two months. They are then encouraged to present the results of their research at regional or national programs. Every effort is made to pair interns with ongoing research projects that are of interest to them.

<a name="Scholars"></a><b><h3>Young Scholars Program</h3></b>
Forty-four high school students from six states were selected to participate in the 1995 National Science Foundation's Young Scholars Program on coastal erosion and preservation at McNeese State University, Lake Charles, Louisiana. Students were chosen on the basis of grades, an essay, their awards and accomplishments in high school, and letters of recommendation from science and math teachers. They were divided into two sessions for the program.
<p>
Each group of Young Scholars spent three weeks studying coastal engineering and shoreline preservation. During the second week, they spent 3 days at the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station's Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC). Here, they attended lectures and demonstrations of laboratory and numerical models by CERC engineers and scientists. They also collected wave data in a laboratory flume and performed data analysis on computers.
<p>
As part of the program, each student designed a model of a device to prevent coastal erosion and tested the model in a wave flume. Holly Beach and Constance Beach, Louisiana, served as an outdoor laboratory. Students observed attempts at coastal preservation and measured the rate of erosion by surveying the beach line.

<a name="Grants"></a><b><h3>Challenge Grants</h3></b>
How can communities across the country use the information superhighway and powerful new technologies to improve education and enhance economic competitiveness? Modern computers and telecommunication services can bring a vast array of information to our teachers, students, and parents. 
<p>
But hardware alone is not enough. We need to learn to use this technology to improve learning in our classrooms, homes, and workplaces. We need teacher training and support services, software that involves students in engaging activities to meet high academic standards, and strong partnerships to link our schools with new learning opportunities.
<p>
To help educators meet the challenge, the US Department of education is sponsoring &quot;Challenge Grants for Technology in Education.&quot;
<p>
Each application must be submitted by a Local Education Agency (LEA) on behalf of a strong consortium of partners with appropriate resources to address the needs identified in the community. Partners in the consortium are expected to make substantial commitments for equipment costs, technical support, and any other coasts that may be associated with acquiring network linkages or telecommunication services. The grants are 5-year awards.
<p>
Last year it was expected that 23 grants would be made from $400,000 to $1.9 million a year, with the average being $1 million.
<p>
Awards are made in June, so this should give interested schools ample time to form the required consortia to apply for the grants. Applications may be obtained from:

in fact.  The FLC and Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) commercial 
representatives selected the 12 technologies demonstrating the greatest 
commercial promise, and 26 other inventions of equal commerical potential.
<P>
<I>The RIB-IT Views </I>provides:
<UL>
<LI>38 RIB-IT Views, model case studies with the standards for
assessing the commercial potential of your technologies.  Representing
all subject areas and levels of maturity from Federal laboratories
in all six regions in the U.S., each RIB-IT View contains:<br>

<dl>
<dd> -- technology description
<dd> -- competing technologies
<dd> -- market potential
<dd> -- commercial potential
<dd> -- recommendations for continued evaluation and possible commercialization
</dl><p>

<LI>Partnership opportunities for <I><B>HOT </B></I>technologies.
 Each of the 38 technologies received the &quot;go-ahead&quot;
from commercial representatives; that is, each is ripe for commercial
development.  These inventions are described succinctly in the
Table of Contents and indexed by subject for easier selection
or identification.
</UL>

<P>
<I>The RIB-IT Views </I>also contains a review of the RIB-IT program,
the selection process, and the important lessons learned in this
campaign, for example, the reasons one technology may be selected
for commercial review over another, <I>which may surprise you</I>.
 
<P>
The format for the standard RIB-IT View evaluation is also included
to assist you in assessing <I>effectively</I> your own laboratory's
technologies.

<h2><a name="services">SERVICES</a></h2>
 
<b>TAP-IN</b> helps companies:<p>
<ul>
<li>identify new markets for existing products <p>
<li> identify new markets for new products developed using current capabilities<p>
<li>evaluate technologies that will enhance/improve products<p>
 <li>evaluate customer needs<p>
<li>find federal lab technologies that can be spun off into commercial projects<p>
<li>acquire federal lab technologies<p>
<li>acquire capital<p>
</ul>
<p>
Services are grouped into four categories:<p>
<a href="#product planning">Product planning and development </a><br>
<a href="#technology problem">Technology problem-solving</a><br>
<a href="#market studies">Market studies</a><br>
<a href="#technology commercialization">Technology commercialization</a><hr><p>
 
<h2><a name="productp">PRODUCT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT</a></h2>
 
<b>TAP-IN </b>partners work with defense suppliers to:<p>
<ul>
<li>     identify market opportunities
<li>     evaluate a new product's potential to succeed in the commercial marketplace
<li>     conduct feasibility studies to predict how well a company can expect to produce/market a new product
<li>     assist in the design of new products
<li>     find and acquire technologies from private or federal sources
<li>     develop dual-use technologies
<li>     assess alternative applications for existing technologies.<p>
</ul>
 
For example, the RTTCs are working with the industrial designers  to help clients identify
profitable new products that can be developed using existing technologies and manufacturing
capabilities.<p>
 
In the Midwest, an RTTC is working with a defense contractor to answer some questions
needed to complete a DOD project.  The RTTC brought the company together with EPA and
Argonne researchers.  Results:   EPA provided answers to technological questions; Argonne
identified new project opportunities for the company. <p>
<hr>
 
<h2><a name="technology problem"> TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM-SOLVING</a></h2>
 
<b>TAP-IN</b> partners work with manufacturers to:
 <ul>
<li>     clearly define a manufacturer's technology needs
<li>     match needs with technologies or capabilities in the public and private sector
<li>     find local technology sources
<li>     establish partnerships with federal laboratory scientists and engineers
<li>     establish partnerships with commercial organizations.<p>
</ul>
 
For example, through the FLC and the National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC), TAP-
IN is helping companies rapidly access effective federal technologies.<p>
 
Aero Instruments, a manufacturer of pressure probes for measuring air speed and altitude on
military and general aviation aircraft, needs to develop and demonstrate the capabilities of
new, more accurate probes due to changes in the FAA rules.  The NASA Lewis Research
Center had computational fluid dynamics code that could help Aero Instruments meet the new
regulations and therefore compete in the commercial sector.   Results:  NASA Lewis
scientists currently are providing Aero Instruments with a Pentium-PC version of the code
and is training Aero staff to use the code in future analysis and design efforts.<hr><p>
 
<h2><a name="market studies">MARKET STUDIES</a></h2>
 
<b>TAP-IN</b> market studies produce the following products:<p>
     <ul>
<li>     market needs assessment
<li>     market surveys
<li>     market analyses
<li>     market forecasts.<p>
</ul>
 
 
<b>TAP-IN</b> links firms to business service organization that have the experience and expertise
needed to identify and analyze market opportunities.<p>
 
For example, Airborne Industries, a small woman-owned defense supplier, needed to identify
new markets and marketing channels to sustain its revenues.  By using the TAP-IN network,
Airborne has successfully diversified. <hr><p>
 
<h2><a name="technology commercialization">TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION </a></h2>
 
TAP-IN partners work with companies to commercialize technologies by:<p>
 
    <ul>
<li> developing business plans
<li>      helping companies acquire newly developed technologies through:
   <ul>
<li>          licensing
<li>          cooperative R&D agreements
<li>          informal collaboration
<li>          formal consultation
<li>          contract research</ul>
<li>     finding venture capital
<li>     providing networking opportunities for joint ventures.<p>
</ul>
For example, a defense contractor was interested in developing new commercial product
ideas for the medical or telemedicine market.  Today the company negotiating a NASA
Space Act Agreement to develop telemedicine applications.<p>
<hr><p>
 
<a name="target markets"><h2>TARGET MARKETS:</h2></a><p>
 
TAP-IN primarily serves:<p>
<ul>
<li>     Small defense suppliers
<ul>
<li>          Fewer than 500 employees
<li>          Selling directly to DoD, DOE or NASA
<li>          Subcontractors to major defense prime contractors
<li>          In need of market diversification services <p></ul>
<li>     Manufacturing/product development companies
<ul><li>          Any size<br>
<li>          Defense or non-defense<br>
 <li>         Eligible/able to commercialize defense technologies</ul><p>
</ul><p>

<a name="technology sources"><h2>TECHNOLOGY SOURCES:</h2></a>
 
Federal Laboratories<br>
Federal Contractors<br>
Affiliates<br>
Private sector institutions and companies<p>
 
Federal laboratories are the principal source or technologies, technological expertise, and
research facilities. TAP-IN draws from defense laboratories across the nation.<p>
 
Federal R&D contractors expend almost 2/3 of the federal R&D budget; some of these R&D projects
yield technologies with commercial applications.  Many TAP-IN participants are
defense contractors or have defense contractors as clients. <p>
 
Affiliate organizations specialize in technology problem-solving, technology transfer, and
industrial development.  TAP-IN has strong ties to affiliates in every state.  Some affiliates
are state technology centers/programs, others are universities.<p>
 
Private sector companies and institutions are another source of technology.  For example,
Battelle Memorial Institute, the largest not-for-profit industrial R&D organization in the
world, is a source of TAP-IN technologies.<p><hr>
 
<a name="costs"><h2>COSTS</h2></a><p>
 
Many TAP-IN services are provided at no cost; others carry reasonable fees structured to
make services easily accessible to small manufacturing companies.<hr><p>

<P>
<b>TO:</b>  FLC Membership/FLC Webmasters Group<p>

 <b>FROM:</b>  Jonathan Root, FLC Executive Board Member-At-Large<P>
 
<b>SUBJECT:</b>  FLC Webmasters Group<P>
 Over the next month we will be working to start-up the FLC
Webmasters Group as agreed upon at the Agency Liaison Meeting
meeting in February.  Tina Mckinley's subsequent e-mail message
inviting participation generated significant interest in the
group.  In recognition of the wide-spread development of websites
across the federal technology transfer community, and the
increasing potential of the Internet/World Wide Web to support
technology transfer objectives and operations, the group will
provide a professional forum for sharing experience/expertise,
staying current with the lastest developments, and developing
cooperative activities.  
<P>
The group is open to all current and emerging Website operators
who support the transfer and commercialization of federal
technology.
<P>
 The group's kick-off is three-fold:
<P>
 1.   A kick-off meeting will be held at the FLC's National
Technology Transfer Meeting in Seattle on May 8th.  This
introductory meeting will include Website presentations and the
formulation of objectives for the group.
<P>
2.  The FLC Management Support Office (Rick Shindell) is

<h2><center>Northeast FLC Explores New Marketing Initiative</center></h2>

<b>Brookhaven</b> - In an effort to develop new cost effective ways of promoting and
marketing federal laboratory technologies, the Northeast FLC will be participating in
INPEX XII, the World's Largest International Invention/New Product Exposition. 
INPEX XII will be held May 16 - 19, 1996 at the Greater Pittsburgh ExpoMart in
Monroeville, PA.  It attracts hundreds of companies searching for solutions to
problems as well as new products and technologies.  The caliber of the companies
represented as well as the past attendees show that this gathering provides an
attractive forum to market federal technology.<p>

CTC of New Jersey has received a grant from the N.E. FLC to solicit technologies
from the regional laboratories and showcase them at INPEX XII.  The names of
interested companies will be referred to the laboratory's technology transfer
representative for follow on discussions.  <p>

<h3>BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY<br>
PROBES MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE</h3>

Brookhaven National Laboratory located on Long Island in Upton, New York has
determined the geographical origins of approximately 1,500 French medieval limestone
sculptures currently in the collections of American museums.<p>

In 1990, using a technique called neutron activation analysis, Brookhaven researchers
Garman Harbottle and Lore Holmes began providing limestone data to art historians on
the Brookhaven Limestone Database.  The geographical origins of much of the
Romanesque and Gothic sculpture made during the 10th and 15th centuries in France
are mostly unknown due to damage and displacement during the French revolution and
religious wars.<p>

Brookhaven and its American and French partners analyzed limestone samples from
about 50 quarries in the Ile-de-France, Normandy, Burgundy, and southwestern France,
and compared quarry samples with the sculptures.   Samples of sculpture were irradiated
with neutrons from Brookhaven s two research nuclear reactors and chemical elements
were measured with gamma ray counters.  Researchers were able to determine the
stone s  fingerprint  since each element has a characteristic spectrum of gamma rays.  
Many sculptures remain unidentified and Brookhaven would like to both continue and
broaden this research.<p>

For additional information, please contact Garman  Harbottle,   516-344-4387 or Lore
Holmes, 516-344-4386.<p>

For additional information on other research programs at Brookhaven, contact FLC
Representative Dorry Tooker at 516-344-2078 or via email at <a href="mailto:dorryt@bnl.gov">Dorryt@bnl.gov</a><p>

<h3>ROME LABORATORY WINS EXCELLENCE AWARD - AGAIN</h3>

<b>U.S. Air Force Rome Laboratory</b> located in Rome, New York has been selected for the
fourth time to receive the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award.  During the 1993-
1994 time period Rome Laboratory s 1,100 scientists, engineers, and support personnel
was cited for displaying  extraordinary initiative and skill  in the operational
advancement of the Air Force command, control, communications, computers, and
intelligence (C4I) capabilities.<p>

 In transferring  technologies to the commercial marketplace, other services, and non-
Department of Defense agencies, the laboratory fosters higher levels of government-
industry-academia cooperation.  By providing a variety of computer software systems and
artificial intelligence technologies to the operational Air Force units, Rome was able to
increase capabilities in areas such as flight and transportation scheduling, intelligence
analysis and battle management.<p>

Other technologies that were also cited included infrared camera technology that has the
potential to increase safety for both military and civilian pilots operating in adverse
weather conditions; advances in computer memory and data storage technologies that
will benefit both military and civilian computer systems; and the transfer of automatic
target recognition technology for a variety of civilian applications ranging from medical
diagnostics to law enforcement.   For additional information on Rome Laboratory,
contact Fran Crumb at 315-330-3053.<p>


<h3>NORTHEAST REGION DIRECTORY: </h3>

The update to the 1992 Northeast Region Directory is now complete.
Copies of the directory may be obtained by contacting Julie Chambliss
of the FLC Northeast Region Technical Support Office at 609-667-6770.<P>

<h3>FLC NORTHEAST REGION VIDEO: </h3>

TRP funds in the amount of $25,000 contributed to the production
of the FLC Northeast Technology Transfer Video. This Technology
Transfer Video geared toward laboratory bench-level scientists
and engineers was produced in order to both educate the scientists
and engineers in the area of technology transfer and to instill
in them the desire to become involved in the process of technology
transfer during the creation of new technologies.<P>

It is hoped that the video also will stress the responsibility
of bench-level scientists and engineers as well as that of the
laboratories to become involved in technology transfer in order
to improve the U.S. economy. Copies of the video are available
by contacting Julie Chambliss of the FLC Northeast Technical Support
Office at: <br>

<b>FLC Mid-Continent Regional Meeting</b><p>

The Regional meeting with the MCTTC in Jackson, WY, was attended
by 90 persons.  The theme of the meeting was &quot;Technology
Roundup.&quot;  The featured speaker was Mr. James Turner, the
lead staff member on the House Democratic staff for technology
and competitiveness matters.  He presented a summary of the technology
transfer program from a legislative point of view.<p>



<b>Consumer Assistive Technology Network</b><p>
 
The Mid-Continent Region has established an informal partnership with
the Consumer Assistive Technology Network (CATN) to provide technologies
for use by disabled persons.  The region hopes to formalize a program
during FY97.  Thus far, they have identified 30+ technologies that may
be helpful.  For example, the Center for Excellence for Self-Organizing
Intelligent Systems at Utah State University has modified a wheelchair
to incorporate a stereoscopic television camera which transmits, by
wireless telemetry, real-time images of the wheelchair's environment
back to a remote monitor.  This device derived from control technology
developed from NASA planetary exploration.  The Pattern Recognition and
Artificial Intelligence Spelling Experiment (PRAISE) is computer
software technology under development at Armstrong Laboratory.  The
technology is  designed to improve the writing and reading skills of
people with dyslexia.<p>


<b>** Last Month **</b><p>

Technology Targeting is the latest project between the Mid-Continent
Technology Transfer Center and the FLC Mid-Continent Region is .  The
laboratories in the region have been supportive of this project, which
is now 60% complete.  The vision is to build pipelines between targeted
companies and federal laboratories in the region.  Short, concise,
personalized lists of technologies will be sent to various companies
with an option to request more detailed information.<p>

The Region plans to publish another version of Tap In To Success, which
has been distributed to most Mid-Continent Region laboratory
representatives.  Representatives indicate this publication has proven
helpful for reinforcing their role at the laboratories, and they will
definitely make an effort to submit success stories for the next
publication.  The new publication was used with excellent results at a
recent SBIR Conference in Dallas, TX.  When companies have a clear
example of technology transfer opportunities with real results, they are
eager to take advantage of the programs available through the FLC.<p>

<a name="Pilot"></a><H3>Fermilab Receives Grant for Science Education Pilot Project</H3>

Officials at the Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.fnal.gov">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</a> announced December 11 that the nonprofit organization
Friends of Fermilab has received a $143,000 grant from the Illinois
State Board of Education. Under the terms of a cooperative agreement
with Friends of Fermilab, the Laboratory 's Education Office will
conduct a four-year pilot program to improve high school science
education in Illinois. During the program, based at Fermilab,
teams of teachers from nine Illinois high schools will work together
to develop &quot;coherent, inquiry based high-school science curricula
and implement a three-year sequence of science courses in their
respective schools,&quot; according to Marjorie Bardeen, manager
of Fermilab's Lederman Science Education Center.
<P>
For more information, see <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/public_affairs/press_releases/EducationGrant121196.html">http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/public_affairs/press_releases/EducationGrant121196.html</A>

<a name="Antihydrogen"></a><H3>Fermilab Finds Antihydrogen Atoms</H3>

Experimenters at Fermilab recently announced that they had detected
atoms of antihydrogen produced in a gas-jet target in the Fermilab
Antiproton Accumulator. By early January, the collaboration had
detected about 15 antihydrogen atoms, the simplest atoms of antimatter.
Fundamental precepts of the scientific theory known as relativistic
quantum field theory require that atoms of antihydrogen exhibit
the same atomic &quot;spectrum&quot; of energy levels as atoms
of hydrogen-levels detected by spectroscopy. Tests of this fundamental
precept are possible but would require tens of thousands of atoms
of antimatter. The Fermilab experiment, as well as a similar experiment
conducted at CERN, are the initial steps toward producing sufficient
quantities of antihydrogen to permit such tests.
<P>
Helping create antihydrogen is just one of many benefits of Fermilab's
antiproton accumulator - an apparatus that aids scientists in
their quest to learn more about antimatter and its interaction
and relationship with matter in the universe.

<a name="Ford"></a><H3>Training Project Links Ford and Michigan Tech</H3>

An $8.4 million project spearheaded by Michigan Technical University
Professor Ed Lumsdaine (ME-EM) has brought MTU faculty and students
to the forefront of a major training and education program at
Ford Motor Company. Based on Lumsdaine's proposal to the Michigan
Jobs Commission, Michigan Tech is administering the state's share
of the funding, $3.2 million, with Ford providing $5.2 million.
<P>
Four members of the mechanical engineering faculty are in Dearborn
retraining engineers and designers from Ford and its suppliers
on the new Integrated Design and Engineering Analysis Software.
I-DEAS brings together the separate components of computer-aided
design, computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering,
and product information management into a single software package.
Thus, the training program has been named C3P. The C3P program
is an important component of the company's Ford 2000 leadership
strategy, to better position it in the global marketplace.
<P>
For more information on the C3P program, contact Sue Gregg at

<a name="Pollution"></a><H3>Assessment of Air Force Pollution Prevention Technology Needs
Published on Web</H3>

The Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) Technical
Planning Integrated Product Team (TPIPT) annually canvases the
Air Force to gather and prioritize environment related needs.
The Pollution Prevention Research and Development Program Office,
located in Wright Laboratory's Materials Directorate, recently
reviewed all the higher ranking Pollution Prevention related needs
and published a two volume assessment to serve as feedback to
the needs submitter. All needs submitters were sent the section
of the document dealing with their particular problem and the
entire document has been sent to environment related organizations
throughout the Air Force.

<a name="Liaison"></a><H3>New Liaison Program Increases Access to SURVIAC</H3>

A new innovative liaison program to expand the SURVIAC user base
was recently implemented. This week long training program was
made available to Government volunteers at locations remote from
the SURVIAC office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Initial
recruits were representatives from the Naval Surface Warfare Center
in China Lake, California and Dahlgren, Virginia.
<P>
This first liaison training program began with the SURVIAC Survivability
Workshop (10 - 14 June 1996) and continued through the following
week. Three of these days were spent investigating SURVIAC databases
and libraries, performing searches, reviewing products, models,
and technical area task procedures, becoming familiar with key
survivability lethality agencies and the day-to-day operations
of the SURVIAC office. A very informative briefing on how the
IACs and DTIC interrelate was presented by the DTIC IAC Program
Office. The last day was spent discussing the needs of each liaison
and how a more effective relationship with their organization
might be established through this program.
<P>
At the conclusion of this program, an evaluation was solicited
from each attendee. The overall comment was on the actual realization
of the vast amount of available information, that previous to
this program, the attendees did not know existed. Another unanimous
comment was that the liaison program should be continued. 
<P>
This training program will again be offered in the upcoming months.
If you would be interested in becoming your organization's SURVIAC
liaison, please contact Donna Egner at (937) 255-4840, DSN 785-4840

<a name="Global"></a><H3>UNISPHERE Offers Help Finding Global Partners</H3>

Whether it's across the country or around the globe, finding successful,
qualified business partners can be difficult for small and medium-sized
technology companies. Increasingly, the companies must recognize
their markets are global, as are their competitors. Time, resources,
and skills, however, are limited for them to enter foreign markets,
find joint venture partners, or license out technologies for deployment
overseas.
<P>
Small firms often need various types of technical, business, legal,
and financial assistance to form and implement an effective relationship
with a firm halfway around the world. To address these needs,
the UNISPHERE Institute has brought together an international
network of diverse professional partner organizations who have
technology-based firms as clients.
<P>
For further information about UNISPHERE, contact Dave Salay, GLITeC,

<a name="Experiments"></a><H3>NASA Lewis Experiments Will Land on Mars July 4, 1997</H3>

While Clevelanders enjoy July 4th festivities later this year,
three <a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov">NASA Lewis Research Center</a> designed and built experiments
will celebrate American independence in historic fashion. The
experiments, which will land on the Red Planet as part of the
Mars Pathfinder mission, were launched from Kennedy Space Center
atop a Delta rocket on Dec. 2. The experiments will investigate
the Martian environment and its effect on robotic surface exploration
systems-paving the way for future missions to confirm or disprove
that life once existed on Mars.

<h3>Argonne National Laboratory Seeks Partner for Radon-Mitigation Device</h3>

<b>Markets foreseen in residential, mining, and industrial settings</b>
<P>
 Researchers at Argonne National Laboratories have developed a
unique radon mitigation device that removes up to 98% of the toxic
gas from air.  The device stems from a recent discovery at the
lab of a new fluid-based process for high-efficiency removal of
radon from air.  Three patents are pending.  The lab is seeking
an industrial collaborator for cooperative research and development,
in which the partner will focus on commercialization, optimization,
and mass production.  
<P>
 Argonne has agreed to develop the device for use at two U.S.
government facilities.  If successfully developed, it is expected
to have market applications in a variety of residential, government,
mining, commercial, and industrial settings.  
<P>
 Argonne's contribution to the research project will be approximately
$200,000 of the lab's efforts in the first year. It is expected
that the industrial partner will contribute a similar amount of
cash and/or effort to the project.  No government funds are available
for the industrial partner's share of the R&amp;D.  
<P>
 Interested comapnies may request more information by writing
to Radon Partnership, ITD-900, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700
S. Cass Ave., Argonne, IL  60439, or by fax at 708-252-5230.  Email to <a href="mailto:radonmit@anl.gov">radonmit@anl.gov</a><p>

<h3> USAARL Invention Is Patented</h3>

Four US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL) researchers,
John H. Hapgood, Parley P. Johnson, John S. Martin, and Clarence
E. Rash, envision their newly patented design mitigating one of
the ever present dangers of aviation -- the inability of pilots
to see utility wires.
<P>
Military and civilian aircraft, fixed-wing as well as rotary-wing,
are in danger of striking the extremely hard to see power and
telephone lines. Night flying renders these wires virtually invisible
even to pilots wearing night vision devices.
<P>
The USAARL-designed invention is a solar-powered, light-emitting
diode (LED) power line avoidance marker, usually referred to as
a wire marker.  It is active, with a flashing light, while all
past and present wire markers are passive devices.
<P>
All four coinventors were US Government employees at the USAARL
when the LED wire marker was designed.  Hapgood designed the original
circuit for the LED wire marker.   Before the working model could
be constructed, Hapgood retired and Johnson, an electronics technician
at USAARL, assumed the task of enhancing the circuit design. 
Martin was an electro-optical technician at the USAARL prior to
his retirement from the Army.  Rash has been employed at the USAARL
since 1979 as a research physicist.
<P>
The idea for an LED wire marker occurred while Martin and Rash
were testing currently used wire avoidance marker configurations
for conspicuity.
<P>
The USAARL is working with the Gulf Coast Alliance for Technology
(GCATT) to commercialize this technology.  For more information,
contact Ms. Diana L. Hemphill at USAARL at (334-255-6907).

<B>Florida company using ORNL technology for revolutionary wheelchair</B>
<P>
Oak Ridge, Tenn., Dec. 6, 1996 -- Some of the barriers faced every
day by people in powered wheelchairs may soon be removed because
of an invention licensed to a new company in Florida by the Department
of Energy's (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
<P>
Cybertrax Innovative Technologies of Tampa plans to introduce
its revolutionary,  omnidirectional wheelchair in the spring.
These highly maneuverable, battery-powered vehicles, made possible
by developments at ORNL, allow for total freedom of motion, meaning
an operator can maneuver with 360-degree free wheeling capability.
Cybertrax plans to call the wheelchair the TransRovr (TRANSportable
Roving Omnidirectional Vehicle Replacement).
<P>
&quot;I like to explain it by telling people this wheelchair is
perfect for parallel parking,&quot; said co-inventor Stephen Killough
of ORNL's Robotics and Process Systems Division. &quot;Because
it is so highly maneuverable, it can also go into tight corners.&quot;
<P>
Killough and colleague Francois Pin developed the mathematics
and engineering necessary for the TransRovr's revolutionary maneuvering
characteristics. Their patented invention consists of new algorithms
and innovative engineering that evolved from their work on a DOE
project that focused on developing mobile robots to work in hazardous
environments. The invention won an R&amp;D 100 Award in 1993 as
one of the year's most significant technological innovations.
<P>
&quot;This is a prime example of how we can use knowledge gained
in a specific area for a particular purpose for other worthwhile
endeavors,&quot; Killough said.
<P>
Cybertrax will integrate several unique technologies into its
power wheelchairs; however, ORNL's invention is the heart of the
TransRovr. Other significant advances include improved seating
technology for enhanced ergonomics, rapid battery recharging and
internal recharging offering increased convenience and dramatically
reduced down time.
<P>
The TransRovr's lightweight, three-piece modular construction
makes the wheelchair easy to pick up and transport in a car's
trunk or back seat. The seat portion of the unit, expected to
be provided by Superior Unlimited Corp. of Bristol, sits atop
a platform propelled by three spherical casters. A spin-on-itself
turning capability eliminates the wide turning radius typical
of conventional power wheelchairs. &quot;These revolutionary maneuvering
characteristics maximize operating efficiency by eliminating wasted
moves, time and power consumption,&quot; said Terry Lewis, president
and chief executive officer of Cybertrax. &quot;For the first
time, people, not products, determine the shortest, smartest and
most practical route between two points.&quot;  Lewis, who expects
Cybertrax to employ 20 to 30 people, plans to introduce the TransRovr
to the market by May, pending approval from the Food and Drug
Administration. Its cost should be competitive with conventional
electric wheelchairs, he said.
<P>
Funding for the research that led to this invention was provided
by DOE's Basic Energy Sciences.
<P>
ORNL, one of DOE's multiprogram research facilities, is managed
by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp.

<font size=+2><img align=left hspace=35 vspace=10 src="nlhead2.gif"><b>ORNL Licenses Design of Revolutionary Omnidirectional Wheelchair</b></font><hr>
<center><font size=-1><a href="9701newa.htm">Back to Contents</a> | <a href="9701newc.htm">View Next Article</a></font></center>
<p>
Some of the barriers faced every day by people in powered wheelchairs
may soon be removed because of a technology licensed to a new
company in Florida by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
<p>
Cybertrax Innovative Technologies of Tampa plans to introduce
to the market a revolutionary omnidirectional wheelchair, a highly
maneuverable battery-powered vehicle made possible by developments
at ORNL. It allows for total freedom of motion, meaning an operator
can maneuver with 360-degree free-wheeling capability. Cybertrax
plans to call the wheelchair the TransRovr (TRANSportable Roving
Omnidirectional Vehicle Replacement).
<p>
&quot;I like to explain it by telling people this wheelchair is
perfect for parallel parking,&quot; said co-inventor Stephen Killough
of ORNL's Robotics and Process Systems Division. &quot;Because
it is so highly maneuverable, it can also go into tight corners.&quot;
<p>
Killough and colleague Francois Pin developed the mathematics
and engineering necessary for the TransRovr's maneuvering characteristics.
Their patented technology consists of new algorithms and innovative
engineering that evolved from their work on a DoE project to develop
mobile robots to work in hazardous environments. The technology
won an R&amp;D 100 Award in 1993 as one of the year's most significant
technological innovations.
<p>
ORNL's invention is the heart of the TransRovr, but Cybertrax
will integrate several unique technologies into its powered wheelchairs.
Other significant advances include improved seating technology
for enhanced ergonomics and rapid battery recharging and internal
recharging, offering increased convenience and dramatically reduced
down time.
<p>
The TransRovr's lightweight three-piece modular construction makes
the wheelchair easy to pick up and transport in a car's trunk
or back seat. The seat portion of the unit, expected to be provided
by Superior Unlimited Corp. of Bristol, TN, sits atop a platform
propelled by three spherical casters. A spin-on-itself turning
capability eliminates the wide turning radius typical of conventional
power wheelchairs.
<p>
&quot;These revolutionary maneuvering characteristics maximize
operating efficiency by eliminating wasted moves and time and
power consumption,&quot; said Terry Lewis, president and chief
executive officer of Cybertrax. &quot;For the first time, people,
not products, determine the shortest, smartest, and most practical
route between two points.&quot;
<p>
Lewis, who expects Cybertrax to employ 20 to 30 people, plans
to introduce the TransRovr to the market by May, pending approval
from the Food and Drug Administration. Its cost should be competitive
with conventional electric wheelchairs, he said.

<p>
The Entrepreneurial Advisory Services group of Coopers and Lybrand,
the international professional services firm, released its latest
&quot;Trendsetter Barometer&quot; report last month, endorsing
the role of innovative products and services in spurring revenue
growth and that of external alliances in developing those products
and services.
<p>
For the report, Coopers and Lybrand interviewed CEOs of 428 companies
identified in the media as the fastest-growing US businesses over
the past five years. The surveyed companies ranged in size from
approximately $1 million to $50 million in revenue or sales. Officers
of 36 percent reported launching new products or services they
called &quot;breakthroughs&quot; in the past two years.
<p>
A majority (53 percent) of these products and services are based
on entirely new technology, the report shows. The new items, which
comprise 28 percent of the firms' offerings now, are already generating
29 percent of their revenues, and over the next 12 months the
executives expected continued sales growth to 37 percent of revenues.
These &quot;trendsetter&quot; companies allocate 7.48 percent
of revenues to new product development, 70 percent more than their
less successful peers (4.41 percent).
<p>
While most breakthrough products and services in the two-year
period were developed entirely internally (62 percent), one third
were created with some external assistance. Only 5 percent were
developed entirely externally. External assistance broke down
as follows: strategic alliances (53 percent); participation with
direct customers (34 percent); marketing, selling, or distribution
partnerships (29 percent); joint ventures owned in-part by others
(24 percent); and R&amp;D agreements with other businesses, universities,
or federal laboratories (18 percent).
<p>
&quot;Developers of breakthrough new products and services tend
to keep some control of their product development process, rarely
turning it over completely to external sources,&quot; said <a href="mailto:mckinlet@orau.gov">Tina McKinley</a>,
until recently chair of the FLC. &quot;The survey data shows that
the five-year growth record of all firms that used both internal
and external resources was 22 percent higher than those that relied
strictly on internal capabilities -- and that revenue growth of
firms relying exclusively on external resources was significantly
lower. This confirms the value of partnerships for leveraging
of both internal and external capabilities.&quot;

<font size=+1>Technology Transfer Workshop Held in DC</font><br>

FLC Washington, DC Representative<hr>

<p>
During the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, the Washington,
DC office sponsored a Technology Transfer workshop with the support
of several agencies and the National Technology Transfer Center
(NTTC). Through a collaborative effort, the FLC was able to leverage
the resources of the NTTC Entrepreneurial Technology Apprenticeship
Program (ETAP) and the federal agencies that supported the workshop.
The goal of ETAP is to stimulate the interest of minority students
and historically black colleges and universities in the broad
area of technology management. A total of 16 students participated
in the workshop, representing such academic institutions as Cheyney
University, Howard University, University of the District of Columbia,
University of Arkansas--Pine Bluff, Central State University,
and West Virginia University.
<p>
The primary objective of the workshop was to expose the students
to a Washington perspective on the varied missions and policies
of a diverse range of federal agencies, and how they implement
their technology transfer programs and activities.
<p>
The students, through their evaluations, declared the workshop
an overwhelming success. The program was a positive experience
for the presenters as well, offering them an opportunity to interact
with young talent that will soon be entering the technology community.
<p>
The workshop would not have been the success it was without the
assistance and support we received from the federal departments,
agencies, Congressional staff, and private-sector entities that
willingly lent a hand. Many thanks to the US Departments of Agriculture,
Commerce (including National Institute for Standards and Technology),
National Institutes of Health, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
US Geological Survey, James Turner of the staff of Congressman
George Brown (D-CA), James Dailey of the staff of Congresswoman
Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Maurice Foxworth, and Cynthia Dinkins.
<p>
This was an exciting and valuable opportunity for the FLC to work
with today's youth, in an effort to increase their ability to
meet the technological challenges of tomorrow.

Four US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL) researchers
-- John Hapgood, Parley Johnson, John Martin, and Clarence Rash
-- envision their newly-patented design as mitigating one of the
ever-present dangers of aviation: the inability of pilots to see
utility wires. Increased map-of-the-earth flights by military
aircraft place aviators dangerously close to these wires, and
night flying renders them virtually invisible, even to pilots
wearing night-vision devices.
<p>
Wire markers, painted international orange, have been placed on
wires in high-traffic areas as an additional warning to aircraft;
however, due to changing weather and light conditions, these markers
sometimes do not get noticed. Making these markers more visible
is the goal of the Fort Rucker (AL) researchers.
<p>
Since wire markers were introduced more than a decade ago, their
design has been modified several times. Initially, simple international
orange spheres were hung on cross wires. They contained no moving
parts or wiring and required virtually no maintenance after being
installed.
<p>
A proposed alternative marking-system design was submitted to
the US Army in 1991. this was a molded international orange polyhedron
with circular patterns of 3M Scotchlite reflective sheets applied
to its individual faces. Using the principle of retro-reflection,
this 3M sheeting significantly increased the daytime conspicuousness
of the marker.
<p>
Efforts to improve the concept of the polyhedral marker have culminated
in a new USAARL-designed invention that enhances both night and
day conspicuousness. The original polyhedral design has been modified
to operate in two distinct modes: a passive daytime mode and a
luminous nighttime/inclement weather mode, using light-emitting
diodes (LEDs). These two modes are intended to facilitate both
naked-eye and electro-optical image intensification detection.
<p>
A visibility enhancement module used in the daytime mode consists
of surface-mounted circular retro-reflectors. In the nighttime
mode, it consists of light-emitting diodes located at the center
of the retro-reflectors. The logic control activates the LEDs
when the light-level detector indicates that the ambient illumination
has fallen below some selected threshold and the power-supply
voltage monitor indicates that the battery voltage is adequate.
The power supply consists of one or more solar cells which recharge
a nickel-cadmium battery pack located inside the marker.
<p>
The USAARL is working with the Gulf Coast Alliance for Technology
Transfer (GCATT) to commercialize this technology. GCATT is a
partnership of nine federal laboratories, four state universities,
and a consortium of community colleges in northwest Florida and
southern Alabama that have united to enhance the industrial and
economic development of the region through the transfer of technology.

<font size=+1>Fruitful Research Yields More Nutritious Sweets</font>

<p>
Satisfying both your sweet tooth and your nutritional goals could
soon be easier than ever. That's because USDA Agricultural Research
Service scientists from the Western Regional Research Center have
developed a way to add more fruit to confections, baked goods,
and frozen treats.
<p>
&quot;Many candies and baking ingredients already include some
fruit, but they often contain mostly sugar. By creating products
with fruit as the main ingredient, consumers can get a more nutritious
end-product,&quot; says ARS food research technologist Tara McHugh.
<p>
Fruit growers could also benefit from an expanded market for fruits
like peaches, pears, and apricots, she says. And the fresh fruit
could be pureed during the growing season and then processed year-round.
<p>
McHugh and colleagues combine full puree with unique gelling agents
and then form the mixture into shapes using molds or twin-screw
extruders. So far, they've included up to 30 percent fruit in
the molded pieces, with moisture, starch, and sugar making up
the other ingredients. With the extrusion process, the product
can be made entirely of fruit puree.
<p>
One potential limiting factor to molding the puree mixture is
its viscosity. &quot;If the viscosity of the fruit mixture is
too high, it won't flow smoothly into the mold. The resulting
pieces would be irregularly shaped and less appealing to consumers,&quot;
says McHugh.
<p>
The extrusion process overcomes this limitation, because the mixture
is blended and shaped within the extruder and doesn't require
pouring. It's also faster, taking only minutes to produce the
final product. Molded pieces may take about one day to set.
<p>
Researchers are ready to move the technology from the lab to commercial
applications. The confectionery, or candy, industry would likely
be the first and largest user.

<font size=+1>Keeping Dried Biological Samples Sterile</font>
<hr>

<p>
Many compounds, such as drugs, growth factors, etc., must be kept
sterile and must be aliquotted (divided into equal portions) for
storage. Usually, these aliquots are best stored lyophilized (freeze-dried).
Yet researchers have never had a way to keep aliquots sterile
through the lyophilization process. Consequently, each aliquot
has had to be filter-sterilized when reconstituted for use. This
process has the disadvantages of consuming excessive filters,
syringes, sterile receptacles, and time, and results in serious
loss of precious sample due to absorption by the filters (especially
with small aliquots less than 1 ml). Alternatively, researchers
have had to forgo lyophilization and store their solutions in
the less stable form.
<p>
A recently-developed technology by the National Institutes of
Health has provided a solution to this problem: sterile-lyophilization
tubes having a 0.22-micron filter built into the cap. This unique
feature allows a sterile solution to remain sterile throughout
lyophilization, even after the vacuum is released and air reenters
the tube. Thus, a starting solution is simply filter-sterilized
while in a relatively large volume, using a single filter and
therefore suffering minimal loss and consuming little time. It
is then aliquotted into sterile-lyophilization tubes and lyophilized.
The tubes can then be transferred directly to the freezer, if
desired. The compound is reconstituted when needed, and may then
be used immediately without further filtration.
<p>
Researchers worldwide who utilize sterile, labile compounds will
have an interest in this product, including governmental, university,
institutional, and drug-company laboratories. Most notably in
need are investigators involved in drug-testing, which is normally
done either in cell cultures, laboratory animals, or humans, and
which requires sterility of many aliquots of many drugs.

<p>
A patented National Renewable Energy Laboratory technology that
transforms sewage sludge and landfill waste into biogas and compost
is now available for licensing.
<p>
NREL's high-solids digester has an innovative horizontal design
that allows it to produce more biogas from much drier waste material
than conventional vertical digesters. Researchers found that a
horizontal design improves mixing ability, so that a solids concentration
of about 35% can yield as much as 10 times more biogas than a
vertical reactor.
<p>
The high-solids digester speeds up waste conversion and improves
yields by increasing the amount of contact between cellulase enzymes
and the cellulose portion of the waste material. Conversion rates
improved even further when researchers used mixed waste streams
containing fat, oil, or grease. Laboratory trials indicate that
methane yields increase by about 10% when fat or grease is added
to cellulosic materials such as paper, a practical advantage when
dealing with landfill waste.
<p>
Municipal landfill operators and industrial waste managers will
find that the economics of NREL's digester compare favorably with
incineration, waste-to-energy combustion, composting, and other
waste-treatment technologies. Geographically exclusive licenses
are available to qualified partners.

<p>
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting research
on developing an expert system for crash-data collection. Enhanced
accident data-collection techniques that employ an expert-systems
approach are being developed to demonstrate how the quality and
utility of police-reported accident data can be improved by using
the knowledge of experts (accident reconstructionists, safety
analysts, etc.) to guide users through selected parts of the on-scene
data collection process.
<p>
American Management Systems (AMS) has entered into an agreement
with FHWA to link the expert-system modules being developed into
AMS's existing accident data-collection software. Called &quot;Officer
Information Manager&quot; (OIM), the software is currently being
used in several state and local police jurisdictions to capture
data at the accident scene.
<p>
In another FHWA effort, advanced collection technologies (pen-based
computers, global positioning systems, and geographical information
systems) used in Iowa, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin have
been evaluated from a benefit/cost perspective. At these test
locations, police officers are using AMS' OIM software on pen-based
computers to capture accident data.
<p>
A combined FHWA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) effort, the ALERT (Advanced Law Enforcement Response Technology)
project incorporates both hand-held and in-vehicle computers to
store and transmit crash data more quickly to state records, databases,
or officers' base stations.

<p>
A new process developed by Ohio State University and federal EPA
researchers that uses tiny phosphate rocks to neutralize lead
in soil, sand, sediments, sludges, and solid and hazardous wastes
has been licensed to a Texas firm.
<p>
In the new process, phosphate joins with lead and renders it insoluble
within 24 to 48 hours after application. Treating an acre of soil
with phosphate rocks costs hundreds of dollars, versus thousands
or tens of thousands with other technologies. The licensee, Proactive
Environmental Research Laboratory of Houston, will use the process
in the recycling of glass from computer and television monitors.
<p>
Robin Rasor, associate director of Ohio State's Office of Technology
Transfer, called the licensing agreement a win-win relationship
with the university's research partner on the project, the Office
of Research and Development's National Risk Management Research
Laboratory of the Environmental Protection Agency in Cincinnati.
<p>
&quot;This partnership provides an innovative and cost-effective
technology to help find solutions to environmental problems specific
to the electronic industry,&quot; said Larry Fradkin, EPA's technology
transfer coordinator.
<p>
Ohio State will share any royalties received from this nonexclusive
license with the EPA. As other companies obtain licenses for the
technology, Ohio State stands to make as much as $500,000. The
university has patented and licensed more than 100 technologies
in the last eight years, resulting in a total royalty income of
over $12 million.

<p>
A five-year renewable agreement permitting cooperative research
between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Canadian National
Research Council's Institute for Research in Construction (IRC)
marks the first time the Corps has entered into such an arrangement
with a Canadian government agency.
<p>
Collaborative research will develop a new pool of construction
technologies for the US and Canadian construction industries,
initially in the areas of corrosion mitigation and inspection
of techniques, nondestructive testing for pavements and roadways,
and the building envelope.
<p>
Over the long term, research will encompass broader technology
issues in the fields of building construction, infrastructure
and materials, water resources and coastal engineering, and environmental
issues in construction.
<p>
&quot;Now that we have an agreement in place, our researchers
are looking forward to sharing technical information with their
Canadian counterparts,&quot; said the Corps' Assistant Director
of Research and Development (Civil Works), Dr. Bill Roper. &quot;One
of the primary purposes of the agreement is to identify opportunities
for leveraging research across the spectrum of infrastructure
problems.
<p>
&quot;We intend to explore the possibilities not only of sharing
research results with such a premier research organization as
the IRC, but of relying on each other to provide coverage in mutually-exclusive
areas, and thereby achieving a technical synergism that wouldn't
be possible otherwise.
<p>
&quot;This agreement is highly significant,&quot; said IRC Director
General George Seaden, &quot;because the Corps has the world's
largest construction research organization, and its pool of knowledge
-- particularly North American construction knowledge -- greatly
enhances our own research capability. IRC is internationally renowned
for its research and development work, but we have limited resources
and we cannot afford to reinvent the wheel. We operate in a common
technology pool with the US and we deal with similar problems,
such as those related to cold climates. Through this agreement,
we end up having privileged access to information of direct benefit
to Canadians.&quot;

<font size=+1>Bright Idea: New Fixtures for the Sulfur Lamp</font>
<hr>
<center><font size=-1><a href="9701newa.htm">Back to Contents</a> | <a href="9701newk.htm">View Previous Article</a> | <a href="9701newm.htm">View Next Article</a></font></center>
<p>
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory scientists have developed
the first lighting fixtures to capitalize on the extraordinary
brightness and remarkable energy efficiency of the award-winning
sulfur lamp. Prototypes of these new fixtures were installed in
the lobby of the headquarters of the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District (SMUD) and unveiled to the public in November.
<p>
&quot;This system will make it practical for sulfur lamps to be
integrated into common interior spaces, which should accelerate
their market potential,&quot; says Michael Siminovitch of the
Energy and Environment Division, one of the principal investigators
behind the concept and design of the new fixtures.
<p>
The research was carried out under a partnership between the laboratory
and Cooper Lighting, a major US manufacturer. Although the new
fixtures were designed around the physical dimensions and photometric
properties of a specific commercial sulfur lamp, the technology
can be applied to other high-brightness energy-efficient electrode-less
lamps now under development.
<p>
Indoor lighting accounts for about 25 percent of the electrical
energy consumed in the United States each year. It has been estimated
that this consumption, which costs about $30 billion, could be
cut in half if existing lighting systems were to be replaced with
advanced energy-efficient alternatives.
<p>
Two years ago, a new type of lighting technology called a sulfur
lamp was unveiled and widely touted as the lamp for the 21st century.
Consisting of a golf-ball-sized glass globe filled with argon
gas and a tiny amount of non-toxic sulfur, this microwave-powered
lamp was four times more energy-efficient and 75 times brighter
than a conventional 100-watt incandescent bulb. It also outperformed
the best fluorescent lamps.
<p>
The sulfur lamp was invented by Fusion Lighting Inc., a small
company in Rockville, MD, which is now field-testing a 1000-watt
version, called the Solar 1000. A major impediment to the widespread
adoption of the sulfur lamp has been the lack of high-efficiency
fixture systems for delivering its light to the interiors of commercial
spaces. What has been needed, Siminovitch says, is an indirect
low-glare system that could take advantage not only of the high
energy efficiency and brightness of sulfur lamps, but also of
their high CRI (Color Rendering Index), which puts them on a par
with sunlight for quality of illumination.
<p>
Siminovitch and two colleagues in E&amp;E's Lighting Research
Group, Carl Gould and Erik Page, have developed a fixture that
can be fitted with different reflectors to provide a variety of
light-distribution patterns. The fixture can also be mounted in
various ways -- on a free-standing kiosk, or on a wall of ceiling
-- to provide a high degree of flexibility and suitability across
a broad range of interior-lighting applications, from shopping
malls to interior complexes and offices.
<p>
Two of the new fixtures, outfitted with the Solar 1000 sulfur
lamp, were switched on during an official &quot;lighting ceremony&quot;
in the spacious lobby of SMUD headquarters on Nov. 14. The fixtures
are about eight feet tall and resemble flashlights standing on
end with their beams directed skyward. About 20 seconds after
the lamps were activated in the ceremony, their spinning sulfur
light bulbs reached full speed and filled the lobby with easy-on-the-eyes
illumination.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.pnl.gov:2080">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>
(PNNL) is one of nine US Department of Energy multi-program national
laboratories. Battelle operates the Laboratory, which is located
in Richland, WA. A satellite research facility, the Marine Sciences
Laboratory, is located at Sequim in that state.
<p>
The Laboratory's core mission is to deliver environmental science
and technology in the service of the nation and humanity. Through
basic research, the staff creates fundamental knowledge of natural,
engineered, and social systems that is the basis for both effective
environmental technology and sound public policy. The Laboratory
solves legacy environmental problems by delivering technologies
that remedy existing environmental hazards; they address today's
environmental needs with technologies that prevent pollution and
minimize waste, as well as lay the technical foundation for tomorrow's
inherently clean energy and industrial processes. The Laboratory
also applies its capabilities to meet selected needs in national
security, energy, and human health; to strengthen the US economy,
and to support the education of future scientists and engineers.
<p>
PNNL has a proven track record of successful partnerships with
industry, educational institutions, government organizations,
and businesses of all sizes. For example, within their new William
R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, scientists
from around the world can join forces in solving complex environmental
problems.
<p>
The Laboratory resources are backed up by the entire Battelle
Memorial Institute, the world's largest and oldest contract research
organization. Battelle has operated Pacific Northwest since its
establishment in 1965.

<p>
Technology collaborations between the government and the private
sector have been multiplying in recent years, as each side recognizes
it cannot afford to support alone the cutting-edge research necessary
for a healthy economy. As lucrative as those partnerships may
be, however, they often are strained by disagreements over the
appropriate roles for the government and the availability of public
funding.
<p>
The Presidential and Congressional election may well have determined
the course of government-private industry partnerships in technology
in coming years, including the Advanced Technology Program, the
Dual-Use Applications Program, cooperative R&amp;D agreements,
and other collaborative efforts at federal agencies and laboratories.
<p>
On March 3-4, 1997, in Washington, DC, the McGraw-Hill Companies'
<i>Federal Technology Report</i> will convene a team of decision-makers
from the Clinton administration, Congress, federal laboratories,
and industry to present their expectations for technology partnering
in 1997.
<p>
The conference -- &quot;Technology Partnering: Can You Count on
the Government?&quot; -- will trace changes in the Clinton administration
and Congress that will influence policies.

<p>
NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was recently recognized for
outstanding achievement in technology transfer by the Arkansas
Chapter of the Technology Transfer Society.
<p>
The Society presented the 1996 Federal Laboratory to Private Industry
Award to Marshall for its outstanding technology outreach program
and its work with Arkansas businesses. Marshall is considered
the blue-collar center for NASA, specializing in design development,
testing, and manufacturing.
<p>
In June of 1993, the Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker, and
the Director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Hunstville,
AL, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) calling for the
transfer of technology from NASA to the private sector in Arkansas.
Since that time, Dinah Higgins and Sara Deason of Marshall's outreach
program, along with Jim Benham of Arkansas Science and Technology
Authority and Brett Cornwell of Mid-Continent Technology Transfer
Center, have made hundreds of industry visits and numerous presentations
to local officials and industry representatives. Many Arkansas
companies have benefitted from Marshall's assistance. <hr>

<p>
What an incredible time we are living in for new ventures and
exciting new products and services. Truly we are seeing a &quot;peace
dividend,&quot; with an encouraging financial environment for
entrepreneurs and large companies alike to seek new business horizons
domestically and internationally. Sometimes I feel like a kid
in a candy shop, surveying the new companies that are being formed
and promoted. It's hard to decide what to invest in -- or even
what to follow -- because there are so many exciting new ventures.
<p>
Just look at the names of some of the initial public offering
of stock that occurred in 1996: Xionics Document Technologies,
Industri-Matematik International, Open Vision Technologies, Planning
Sciences International, Prism Solutions, Splash Technology Holdings,
XLConnect Solutions, Cable Sat Systems, Sound Source Interactive,
On-line System Services, Research Engineers, AlphaNet Solutions,
Spatial Technology, Silicon Gaming, Factset Research Systems,
Microleague Multimedia, Digex, 12 Technologies, OneWave, Storm
Technology, CyberCash, Gensym Corporation, Infonautics, Quadramed,
Raster Graphics, Visigenic Software, VocalTec, Wiztec Solutions,
Legacy Software, Trusted Information Systems, Digital Data Networks,
4Front Software International, NICE-Systems, Axent Technologies,
Affinity Technology Group, Raptor Systems, OzEmail Limited, SCB
Computer Technology, Documentum, Forte Software, Xylan, Analogy,
Imagematrix, Microvision, Cylink, Reality Interactive, SmartServ
On-line, Bell Technology, Aspect Development, BroadVision, Excite,
PowerCerv, Vanstar, Xybernaut, CompuRAD, ULTRADATA, Spanlink,
Cotelligent, Optika Imaging Systems, OrCAD, Cerlon Technologies.
<p>
Just those companies listed above raised more than $125 million
in equity capital -- and this is just the tip of the iceberg of
emerging enterprises that have obtained new funds for development
and marketing. And you've just got to be excited about these new
names for our technology business vocabulary -- that is, unless
you're brain-dead or want to bury your head in the sand.
<p>
The other morning it was announced here in the Washington, DC
area where I live that a new venture fund was being formed with
$25 million to invest in early-stage technology companies. However,
this new fund joins at least a dozen others in this region that
have raised far more than $200 million in private funds to finance
entrepreneurial corporations expanding into broadening markets
with technological developments. Yes, and I have personally invested
in a number of early-stage technology companies.
<p>
Sure, some of these guys will fail. And I agree that there are
many entrepreneurs that might even deserve funding more than those
that have been fortunate to receive it. But it's really happening.
If your organization is sitting on exciting technologies that
should be moved to the marketplace, then get cracking to help
find the capital, marketing, and management talent to get them
off the ground.  It's not the government financing deals these
days; it's the economy and the investment community.
<p>
These new technologies coming into our lives are changing the
ways we do business, how our children will learn and communicate,
product marketing, medical services and information, and just
about any other facet of our living standards.  Don't just sit
on the sidelines waiting for the worlds to beat a path to your
door; study the markets and lean where the action is -- then be
a positive catalyst for action and organization.
<p>
You bet there's a peace dividend, and we're all better off because
of it.

<center><h2>UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE NEWS</h2>
<h3>Bureau of Export Administration</h3>
For Immediate Release: June 20, 1995</center><br></head>
<hr>
<body><b>Commerce Department Announces Expansion of "Needs Assessment" Survey to Assist
U.S. Defense Subcontractors</b><p>

<b>Washington</b> - The Commerce Department today announced expansion of a program
designed to help small and medium-sized businesses affected by downturns in
the defense and aerospace markets diversify and become more globally
competitive.  The Competitive Enhancement and Defense Diversification Needs
Assessment Survey will assist the businesses in identifying what government
programs and resources are available to them.<p>

"The survey is a comprehensive, cost-effective approach to help small and
medium-sized manufacturers stay competitive in a dynamically changing world
marketplace and create jobs in their own communities.  By keeping these
companies strong, we help to maintain a vibrant defense industrial base to
meet U.S. security needs in the future," said William Reinsch, Under Secretary
for Export Administration.<p>

Following the success of the initial survey mailing last fall, an additional
14,000 businesses nationwide will be included.  The program, run by Commerce's
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), identifies federal, regional. state and
local government programs and resources appropriate to the needs of
participating companies.  Services and assistance are available in the areas
of manufacturing technology, exporting, product/service development, research
and development, financing, training and marketing skills.<p>

BXA has assembled a team of more than 50 experts from various U.S. government
agencies to provided detailed information on a wide range of existing
programs.  When a company fills out the voluntary Needs Assessment Survey, BXA
provides a coordinated response so that all of the appropriate agencies can
follow up directly with the company.<p>

The interagency response team includes representatives from the Department of
Commerce, Defense, Energy, and Labor, as well as the Small Business
Administration, the Export-Import Bank, the <b>Federal Laboratory
Consortium, NASA Regional Technology Transfer Center</b>, and the
Environmental Protection Agency.  The Small Manufacturers' Institute and many
state organizations are also included.<p>

The second round of mailings will include the subcontractors of McDonnell
Douglas Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Texas
Instrument's Defense System and Electronics Group, members of participating
defense-related associations and organizations including the Joint Venture
Silicon Valley Defense/Space Consortium and the Florida Space Coast
Development Commission, and defense subcontractors in Virginia and Texas. 
Additional organizations and prime contractors will be added during the year.<p>

Firms interested in learning more about this free survey program should
contact Brad Botwin, Director of Strategic Analysis Division at the U.S.
Department of Commerce: 202-482-4060 or fax 202-482-5650.<p>

&quot;Successful Partnering'' was the topic of the Federal Laboratory
Consortium's (FLC) Far West Regional Meeting held in August at
the University of California's Riverside (UCR) campus. The two
day meeting showcased the successful partnering efforts of the
three-pronged collaborative: federally funded researchers, private
sector industry, and universities.
<p>
<a href="mailto:mckinlet@orau.gov">Ms. Tina McKinley</a>, FLC
Chairperson, recognized the efforts of Congressman George Brown,
Jr., on behalf of technology transfer and presented him with the
FLC Science and Technology Award. The congressman has long been
a strong proponent of federal research and has led the way in
support of US firms capitalizing on this valuable national resource.
He was a leader in passing legislation that enabled the FLC to
get its official charter with the authority to enter into cooperative
research and development agreements (CRADA) with outside partners.
Most recently, he supported the amendment to the Stevenson-Wydler
Act passed in March of this year - as well as leading bi-partisan
support for last year's National Technology Transfer and Advancement
Act. In accepting his award, Congressman Brown cautioned those
in attendance that the US must not become complacent in its supremacy
in the world of R&amp;D. Foreign competition has recognized the
value of R&amp;D and is looking to increase spending in the recruitment
of the finest researchers at a time when the US is the only country
considering cutting back funding for R&amp;D and the possible
disarming of laboratories.
<p>
In his keynote speech, UC Riverside's Chancellor Raymond Orbach
focused on the post cold war environment of research and how the
future intellectual exchange between institutions of higher education,
government and the private sector, between Federal and State agencies,
and individuals and corporations will be vastly different from
the last fifty years. Citing the shrinking funding platform, he
emphasized that university research cannot survive if it remains
dependent on the same structure, format, and patronage which it
enjoyed in the past. The Chancellor illustrated his point with
three innovative approaches to partnering that UCR is involved
in: (1) College of Engineering-Center for Environmental Research
and Technology (CE-CERT), (2) The Institute for Desert Agriculture,
and (3) Conservation Biology Group.
<p>
Jon Paugh, Director, Technology Competitiveness Staff at the US
Department of Commerce, presented an overview of <i>Effective Partnering:
A Report to Congress on Federal Technology Partnerships.</i>
<p>
Lawrence Udell, Exec. Director, Center for New Venture Alliance,
California State University, Hayward; and Daniel Larson, Past
President, Inland Empire Economic Council (IEEC) paneled a discussion
&quot;Valuing and Funding New Technology Opportunities.&quot;
<p>
Three case studies were presented by (1) Leo Reddy, President,
The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM); Joseph
Harris, Manger of External Programs, Sandia National Lab.; and
Woodrow Clark, Manger Strategic Planning, Energy Directorate,
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; (2) Gordon Bourns, President
&amp; Chairman of the Board of Bourns International and Dr. Joe
Norbeck, Director of the College of Engineering-Center for Environmental
Research &amp; Technology (CE-CERT); and (3) Dr. Martin Rachmeler,
Director of Technology Transfer Office University of California
San Diego.
<p>
The second day began with the Far West Regional business meeting.
A legislative update was given by the FLC's Washington, DC Liaison,
<a href="mailto:tyrone.taylor@zyn.com">Tyrone Taylor</a>, on PL
l04-113, the Technology Transfer Act of 1995. He stressed that
while the Morella-sponsored bill passed without a sunset clause,
even with bi-partisan support related to technology, the reality
of the situation is that both President Clinton's and Capital
Hill's budgets reflect cuts in funding. Survival will be dependent
on the perception of value to industry and value as seen by the
large percentage of freshmen Republicans. His suggestion was to
find substantial new relations in industry and to build on old
partnerships. &quot;Be creative as possible and keep building
trust in the FLC.&quot;
<p>
A how-to training &quot;Building Collaborative Partnerships&quot;
was presented by Marketing Dynamics Corporation.

Since the last newsletter, many opportunities have presented themselves
to the region. The most exciting opportunity was our regional
meeting in August, &quot;Successful Partnering,&quot; highlighting
successful partnerships with supportive training on how to establish
these relationships. For those of you who were able to participate,
you shared in the experience of forming value-added partnerships
to achieve common goals. For those of you who weren't able to
be there, you will be receiving a synopsis of the key points of
the speakers and some general information. You'll find more information
on the meeting inside the newsletter.
<p>
A key success of the meeting was the cooperation we received from
other organizations that allowed us to stretch our dollars further.
The University of California at Riverside provided the Region
with free facilities, AV equipment, suggestions for speakers,
use of their reduced price on-campus catering service and assistance
from their staff to help make the meeting a success. The contacts
made and the caliber of the presenters benefited the Region by
offering new ideas and ways of doing business in these times of
change and shrinking budgets. The examples used, showed how successful
collaborations can be formed among the labs, the private and public
sectors. These successes can be short-term, long-term, or whatever
is required to get the job done.
<p>
I have been actively looking for ways to leverage the power and
resources we have across the region to take advantage of opportunities
that may be cost prohibitive for each of us to do separately,
but doable if we pool our resources. One example was the regional
ad placed in the next Technology Transfer Business magazine. Several
labs took advantage of the reduced price to highlight their labs
and plug into the regional ad that will benefit all of us If you
have ideas for other ways to pool resources, please let me know.
<p>
For those of you who don't know, Cookie West, the Deputy Coordinator,
retired last month. We all wish Cookie the best, but will miss
her knowledge and support. Maybe we can enlist her for advice,
however!
<p>
As we go into the new fiscal year, we'll be initiating special
projects that will be available to assist all of you. Information
will be sent out to request your input. We will be updating a
generic brochure and one page sheets on all labs. This information
will be placed on the regional home page for easy access by you
and your customer. Your ideas are welcomed and encouraged to make
the Region supportive of your lab. Let me know your thoughts.<br>

&quot;This is indeed a great day&quot; proclaimed 
<a href="mailto:op913d1@tecnet1.jcte.jcs.mil">Dr. Mike Sullivan</a>,
director and ORTA at <b>Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division
(NAWCWPNS) - Point Mugu</b>. That early day in May 1996, Rear Adm.
Dana B. McKinney, commander, NAWCWPNS signed not one CRADA, but
seven with business organizations within Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties. Specifically, those partnerships were with the <b>Ventura
County Business Incubator (VCBI), Santa Barbara County Board of
Supervisors (SBC), Sonic Development Laboratories (SDL), KDG Vortec,
Southwest Aerospace, Toyon Research Corporation, and SRS Technologies</b>.
<p>
The Ventura County Business Incubator's CRADA with Point Mugu
is to foster technology transfer from NAWCWPNS to companies in
Ventura County who make requests through its technology access
service. In a similar but separate CRADA with SBC, there is a
parallel recognition that NAWCWPN's leading-edge technical skills
can assist the growing number of technologically based companies
that are being attracted to both counties. Identified by both
VCBI and SBC, were the primary areas of Aerospace Engineering,
Software, Communication Command and Control Systems, Control and
Data-Link Systems, Electronic Warfare Systems, Electro-Optic and
Radio Frequency Multispectral, Devices and Signatures, Embedded
Computer Hardware and Software, Information Processing and Instrumental
Analysis, Microwave Devices and Materials, Optical Devices and
Materials, Radio Frequency/lnfrared Signature Collection, Recovery
Systems, Sensor Systems, Simulation and Modeling, Target Recognition,
Classification, and Identification, Test Instrumentation Systems,
Data Base Management, and Software Support.
<p>
Two more entities, Sonic Development Laboratories and KDG Vortec,
have each signed separate CRADAs but will collaborate in a joint
effort with NAWCWPNS for potential commercial and government applications
in medical emergency and therapy devices. Showing immediate promise
is an apparatus, based on ring vortex technologies, that can more
effectively deliver a medicated aerosol deeper into the lungs
than spray mist nebulizers currently being used. Possible uses
would be: asthma self care, emphysema treatment, emergency treatment
(smoke and chemical inhalation victims), anesthesia administration,
and medicine administration via lung (rather than by injection).
Other potential applications involving human breathing enhancement
include: decreased breathing work load for deep sea divers and
astronauts on EVA, as well as increasing breathing efficiency for
people wearing masks and respirators.
<p>
In the works for SDL is an apparatus that utilizes the fluid dynamic
characteristics of the ring vortex to project fire fighting gases,
such as Halon and carbon dioxide, into inaccessible or space confined
areas like attics and crawl spaces of buildings, as well as void
spaces in aircraft and ships. SDL is also developing a device
for use by law enforcement in the apprehension of &quot;hot pursuit&quot;
vehicles. SDL and NAWCWPNS will jointly develop, demonstrate,
and evaluate several gas dynamic aspects of ring vortex flow phenomena
with SDL, providing a knowledgeable expert and inventor of several
ring vortex related concepts already filed with the Navy.
<p>
The CRADA signed with Southwest Aerospace (SWA) states that NAWCWPNS
will loan a Tactical Air Launched Decoy (TALD) for the purpose
of SWA exploring the development and installation of a new IR
plume generator kit for the TALD. The TALD, launch aircraft, chase
aircraft, and any Navy-owned equipment will be operated by NAWCWPNS
personnel.
<p>
Toyon Research Corporation (TRC) is collaborating with NAWCWPNS
to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate exploiting Radar Cross Section
(RCS) measurements to detect and identify lethal weapons that
are hidden or carried on a human body. Potential exists for commercial
law enforcement application, such as airport security, crowd control/security,
court security systems, law enforcement officer protection, and
threat screening.
<p>
Another collaboration with TRC is for an electronically-steerable
antenna that has the potential for communication systems on automobiles,
boats, and aircraft, such as radios and cell phones.
<p>
A prototype Text, Photo, Video Electronic Technical Library of
the Future (consisting of material already approved for public
release) is the objective of a CRADA with NAWCWPNS and SRS Technologies.
SRS will provide personnel with skills, knowledge, and experience
in data research, input, conversion/transfer and data recording
to gather, assemble, integrate, digitize, record, and input the
scientific and technical data. Also provided or developed by SRS
will be the software to create a prototype relational database.
NAWCWPNS will provide personnel (when available) knowledgeable
in the location of and sources of selected technical and scientific
information. NAWCWPNS will also provide facilities (when available)
at approved sites. The joint effort has a potential commercial
application as an input data source to a national and international
on-line information network as an Electronic Technical Library
of the Future.

<p>
Scientists with the Department of Energy's Ernest Orlando Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have won two of this
year's seven <i>Discover Magazine</i> Awards for Technological Innovation.
The winners were Ashok Gadgil of Berkeley Lab's Energy and Environment
Division, in the environment category for the &quot;UV Waterworks&quot;
device, an ultraviolet-based water purification system; and Xiao-Dong
Xiang and Peter Schultz, of the Materials Sciences Division, in
the computer hardware and electronics category; for &quot;Combinatorial
synthesis,&quot; a high-speed technique for making and testing
new advanced materials.
<p>
This is the seventh year that <i>Discover Magazine</i> has presented
its awards, which are intended to &quot;celebrate the outstanding
innovations of our time, and specifically, the scientists, engineers,
and inventors who too often are the unsung heroes of our technological
age.&quot;
<p>
<i><b>Safe Drinking Water for the World.</b></i>
<p>
Worldwide each year, the waterborne viruses and bacteria in unsanitary
drinking water cause cholera, typhoid, dysentery and other deadly
diseases that kill an estimated four million children under the
age of five and make adults sick enough to loose billions of hours of work productivity and income. Ashok
Gadgil knows personally how devastating dysentery can be on a
developing nation's population. Growing up in India, he lost several
cousins to the disease and saw how it can stunt the growth of
those who survive it.
<p>
Three years ago, as a particularly virulent strain of cholera
was sweeping his native country, it occurred to him that he might
be able to make a water purifier based on ultraviolet light that
would be inexpensive enough for even the poorest 
villages. With cost as a main consideration, Gadgil designed the
UV Waterworks using off-the-shelf gear, such as sheet metal, UV
lamps that are replaced every two years, and stainless steel piping.
Because it is designed to rely on gravity for water flow and only
needs electricity for the UV light, that can be produced by a
car battery or a 40 watt solar cell, the device does not require
a pressurized water delivery system nor electrical outlets. The
water flows into a tray where it is exposed to twelve seconds
of UV light before it flows out at the rate of a typical American
bathtub spigot. The ultraviolet light triggers the formation of
peptide bonds between certain amino acids in the pathogen's DNA
molecules, which robs pathogens of the ability to reproduce and
renders them harmless. While highly effective on E.coli bacteria,
and ten other pathogens including typhoid and cholera, the device
does not work with very muddy water, which is opaque to UV light,
and Giardia spores that can not be penetrated by UV light. Negotiations
for licensing the technology to <b>EEG Inc. of Chicago</b> are in their
final stages for worldwide use, except in India, where a company
in Bombay is investing $700,000 in a new plant that will manufacture
a solar-powered version capable of supplying 1,000 villagers with
clean water. The UV Waterworks costs $250 to make and is expected
to go on sale next year. Cost of purification for 1,000 gallons
of water? About eight cents.
<p>
<i><b>Highspeed Creation of New Materials</b></i>
<p>
Xiao-Dong Xiang and Peter Schultz have modernized the age old
trial and error method of testing different molecular combinations
to create new materials. The new method allows researchers to
increase the number of chemical compounds that can be created
and tested, as potential new materials, from the current rate
of about one a day to as many as 10,000 a day.
<p>
Schultz, who is also a professor of chemistry at the University
of California at Berkeley, got the idea for combinatorial synthesis
from the human immune system. The immune system maintains a &quot;Library&quot;
of roughly one trillion differently-shaped antibodies, each made
up of different combinations of protein chains. When faced with
an invading virus, the immune system selects the antibodies from
this combinatorial library that bind to the virus and creates
multiple copies to fight the infection. Schultz used the technique
to invent &quot;catalytic&quot; antibodies - antibodies that,
because of their shape, promote certain chemical reaction - for
which he received the 1995 Wolf Prize in Chemistry.
<p>
Though biotechnology researchers have used a combinatorial approach
to screen for potentially useful drugs, this is the first time
the strategy has been applied to materials research. Working at
Berkeley Lab's Molecular Design Institute, Xiang and Schultz have
already used their combinatorial synthesis technique to discover
26 new magnetoresistive materials. Symyx Technology, a California
start-up corporation, has licensed the combinatorial synthesis
technology from the Berkeley Lab for commercial development.
<p>
&quot;These honors are a tribute to the innovation and creativity
of our scientists and to the breadth and excellence of the work
that goes on here,&quot; said Berkeley Lab Director Charles Shank.
&quot;They are further examples of how national laboratories like
Berkeley Lab turn fundamental science into practical solutions.&quot;

<title>Far West Bulletin - CRADA between NRaD RDT&E and LuminOre, Inc.</title>

Division (NRaD) and LuminOre, Inc.</b></center>

<p>
All that glitters may not be gold, but if <b>NRaD</b>, the US Navy's
high tech research facility in San Diego, finds that a unique
furniture coating made by <b>LuminOre, Inc.</b> (also of San Diego) can
coat and protect the hulls of its fleet of ships from marine micro-organism
&quot;Fouling&quot;, the coating technology's owner and developer
Mr. Tom Valente will have struck it rich.
<p>
Sound incredible? Even more incredible is that LuminOre, a composite
metal containing up to 95 percent copper, can be conductive of
electricity for some applications and non-conductive for others.
It is also being studied for use in computers where ceramics have
been utilized for electrical insulation and heat diffusion. Other
uses may be in electronic mounting boards, burn in boards, heat
sinks, fiber optics, and encapsulation. SRI International, formerly
Stanford Research Institute, wants to test encapsulation capabilities
for radiation management, waste disposal, and radiation shielding.
Another lab is researching LuminOre's use as a mercury-free dental
filling.
<p>
All of the uses listed above are a far cry from LuminOre's original
aesthetic application; a coating for mirror frames, furniture,
and art objects. Tom Valente, the inventor, was a custom furniture
manufacturer in Boston 13 years ago who wanted a low-cost metallic
furniture finish. He wanted something that would look like gilt,
but be less expensive and labor intensive than the traditional
methods of hot casting, forging, covering with sheet metal, or
using bronzing powders in a lacquer coating. His patented invention
is manufactured in a &quot;cold&quot; process. Objects are either
cold cast or cold sprayed using standard HVLP spray equipment
and standard tools. In comparison, this process is a much less
expensive and easier to master technique for adding beauty and
perceived value to wood, reinforced plaster, molded urethane foam,
plastics, PVC, paper, fabric, as well as non-precious solid cast
metals.
<p>
The Far West RTTC's involvement, through its affiliate South West
Technology Transfer (SWTTC), was to assist LuminOre in entering
into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)
with the US Navy. Having the benefit of a close working relationship
with NRaD and understanding of the partnering process, the SWTTC
was able to expedite execution of the CRADA pact to develop both
Navy-specific and commercial applications for the unique coating
material.

If not for irrigation water, most of what is now the Southwest's
crop growing area would be bone-dry desert. Instead, areas like
the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation Drainage District (MSIDD) in
central Arizona have become agricultural cornucopias producing
fruits, vegetables, grains, animal feed, and cotton with water
diverted from the Colorado River. Understanding the grower's water
needs, and how the district's canal system can best fulfill them,
is an ongoing project for the US Water Conservation Laboratory,
Phoenix, Arizona.
<p>
In 1991, <a href="mailto:adedrick@uswcl.ars.gov">Allen R. Dedrick</a>,
 the lab's director, proposed a collaborative
agricultural management improvement program (MIP) to farmers and
various state and federal farm service agency representatives
in the area served by the MSIDD. Dedrick's goal was to improve
agricultural sustainability and natural resource management by
improving performance of irrigated agricultural systems in the
district. The MIP called for &quot;a level field where all the
players could come together to identify opportunities for improvement,
do the planning, and then make the changes in a coordinated way.&quot;
The first part of the three-part MIP process was to analyze the
current performance of existing irrigated systems to get a common,
shared understanding of the situation. Next came defining opportunities
and making plans for necessary change. Last was implementing plans
for a coordinated effort to improve irrigation and overall resource
management within the district.
<p>
One of the outcomes of the MIP was a report recognizing that much
of the district had effectively become a cotton monoculture. The
report stated that with the absence of crop rotation, cotton yields
throughout the district had fallen. The water district's Board
of Directors took steps to become more flexible in meeting farmer's
needs. It reduced the winter water rate with the intent of improving
the feasibility of planting the winter crops, like wheat and other
small grains, in order to remedy this increasing problem of decreasing
yield. As a result, increasing numbers of farmers rotated crops
by planting winter wheat. The lowered water rates made this feasible
for the growers.

<p>
The MIPs original three year study ended in 1994, but continues
on in the form of collaborative efforts between the Lab, the water
districts, state and federal farm service agencies, and farmers.
The MIP succeeded in providing a foundation of understanding and
communication needed for people to work together. It also paved
the way for partnerships involving tech transfer in the area of
agricultural irrigation.
<p>
In an effort to make the irrigation of reclaimed farmland more
efficient and with water conservation in mind, the <b>US Water
Conservation Laboratory, Phoenix, Arizona and Automata, Inc. of
Grass Valley, California</b>, recently signed a CRADA to develop hardware
and software for economical and easy automation of irrigation
canals. Currently, many large canals are operated manually from
a control center. Very few large canals are operated with automatic
controls such as microprocessor or computer controls, even though
most of the technology is currently available. Also, most smaller
secondary canals are operated manually, even though many water
delivery regulation problems occur at this level. In general,
canal operators are not comfortable with automatic controls because
canal operations are complex and the previously available canal
automation logic has often been too simplistic to handle the variety
of operational needs. Further, available gate control hardware
often is not &quot;Intelligent&quot; enough to implement sophisticated
control logic, and is generally too expensive for smaller canals.
ARS researchers are developing improved automation logic that
can more fully satisfy operational needs. Automata, Inc. is developing
low-cost control hardware that can use this logic.

<b>CTA Incorporated</b>, a minority-owned Fortune 500 defense-company,
was in the same boat with other defense contract firms seeking
stability through diversification. CTA knew they must develop
commercially viable products and services that used core capabilities
they already possessed to stay afloat in a shrinking defense contract
business. Help came in the form of the <b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory's
(JPL) Technology Affiliates Program</b> through the <b>Far West Regional
Technology Transfer Center (RTTC)</b> in Los Angeles.
<p>
CTA, based in Rockville, Maryland designs and manufactures satellites,
software and hardware for ground and space-based systems. The
company founder, Tom Velez, was named Entrepreneur of the Year
by the Montgomery County High Technology Council and a competition
sponsored by <i>Inc. Magazine</i>, Ernst &amp; Young, Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and the <i>Washington Business Journal</i> in 1993. That same year,
CTA finalized a contract to design and build a satellite system
for the Republic of Indonesia. INDOSTAR will be the world's first
lightsat (lightweight satellite) for direct broadcast to a single
country and will provide television receive-only and digital television
receive-only services for Indonesia. CTA's core technologies added
new and existing capabilities to compete in the newly targeted
export arena - at a fairly low price. JPL was able to provide
CTA with recommendations regarding design and implementation for
INDOSTAR and identify potential risk areas and guidance in avoiding
those risks.
<p>
The Far West RTTC's involvement with the JPL Technology Affiliate's
Program allows businesses with small jobs to utilize a program
that had previously only been available to resource-rich firms.
Companies can submit a statement-of-work to the Far West RTTC
for assistance in any of the broad capability areas from JPL and
receive an estimate for a specific job. A quick turn-around allows
the lab to respond at the speed of business, not at the speed
of government.
<p>
INDOSTAR creates new jobs in the Space Systems Division and their
export capabilities improve America's trade deficit by almost
$50 million. As a member of NASA's commercialization team, the
Far West RTTC is glad to give a hand.

Has your computer network been victimized by criminal hackers,
crackers, or techno-weenies looking for entertainment at your
expense? If your answer is yes, you're in good company. In the
last two years, GE, IBM, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center
are just a few of the companies who have had major security breaches.
If your answer is no...are you sure? Unfortunately, only a few
of us have bothered to implement security procedures to protect
our networks from malicious mischief, criminal hackers, or dishonest
employees. Most companies wait until they are forced into implementing
measures after considerable damage has been done. And, for those
that have security measures in place, coupled with diligent maintenance,
it's terribly hard to remain confident that you have competently
implemented strategies for your network when IBM, of all companies,
has had a major security breach.
<p>
According to the a 1995 report from the Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University, 2,241 Internet security
breaches were reported in 1994. These attacks continued to increase
in 1995 while CERT funding decreased from the Defense Department's
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Even the Department
of Defense (DoD) ran a penetration test on its own system in 1994
and found 7,860 holes, of which only 390 were detected by alert
network security administrators. Of those 390 detections, a scant
19 were reported. So, we live in an age where security incidents
are on the rise with professional criminal hackers operating in
relative obscurity because law enforcement agencies are ill-equipped
to catch or prosecute them. Add to this, the inability to make
the Internet secure.
<p>
However, while your system won't be impregnable, there are solutions
that will make your system less vulnerable and more unattractive
to causal hackers and inexperienced criminals.
<p>
The National Computer Security Center (NCSC), operating under
the direction of the National Security Agency (NSA), has set up
guidelines to assist companies in developing Internet and firewall
policies, but, with the proliferation of companies entering the
computer security market, there is justifiable chaos in deciding
which solution(s) to apply. Earlier this year, the National Computer
Security Association (NCSA) announced that they are currently
developing a program to establish what a firewall should offer.
<p>
Enter <b>Gemini Computers, Inc.</b>, a California-based company with 14
years experience in secured computer communications research and
development. The company has developed and implemented secure
networks for a variety of US Government customers, including
the Pentagon, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), Small
Business Administration (SBA), and DoD. As a result of their work
with high level US Government security systems, Gemini Computers
Inc. has perfected their Trusted Security Firewall and its integrated
Encryption System to the degree that it has met the requirements
for an A-1 rating by the National Computer Security Center (NCSC).
Presently, it is the only commercially-available security system
that holds the A-1 rating; a rating that was earned only after
10 years of rigorous testing. The DoD evaluates government security
products through the NCSC, which performs operating systems compliance testing for vendors and
assigns ratings from A-1 through D. This provides government users
the ability to match up their security needs with products available
from government vendors.
<p>
Gemini Computers Inc. has also provided secure computer service
on an international level; the United Kingdom's Corporate Headquarters
Office of Technology (CHOTS) installed a Gemini security system
that is currently maintained by Gemini. One of their current projects,
sponsored by the BMDO and the Small Business Administration (SBA),
is the Trusted Secure Electronic Bank Loan Pilot System. The goal
is to secure electronic loan processing for the largest SBA Service
Center in the country, which processes over two billion dollars
in loans annually. New, innovative technology, developed by Gemini
and well-known in the top secret enclaves of the BMDO community,
will be the foundation of this security system. Gemini is ready
to expand the use of this government-funded technology and has
hopes of breaking into the commercial computer security industry
with their innovative brand of solutions. While they are leaders
in the government security arena, they are relatively unknown
beyond military and intelligence consumers. The Far West Regional
Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) in Los Angeles, California seeks
to change that situation.
<p>
Gemini Computers Inc. was one of two projects selected by the
Far West RTTC for inclusion in Rib-It, a national program designed
to speed federally-based or federally funded technology into the
commercial marketplace. This joint Federal Laboratory Consortium
(FLC) and NASA RTTC program reviewed over 400 technologies and
selected 12 projects: 2 projects for each of the 6 nation-wide
RTTCs, as candidates for Leap Reports. Leap Reports will assess
the company's technology, its commercial viability and plan a
strategy for commercialization. While the Gemini report is still
in its infancy stages, one recommendation for commercialization
of its security system has already emerged. A commercial partner
would be the ideal situation to transition Gemini into the commercial
marketplace. This partner would potentially have an existing market
share in the industry and/or name recognition that would recommend
itself to potential buyers. A marketing campaign is being developed
by the Far West RTTC to ferret out such a partner.

<p>
The entrepreneurial leave program at PNNL (as first reported in
the FLC Newslink) is alive and well with ten new local businesses
launched since the program's mid 1995 inception. As explained
by Program Director, <a href="mailto:m_clement@pnl.gov">Marv Clement</a> 
of PNNL's Economic Development Office, &quot;We want to create 
new companies and jobs in the community and region. We want to 
increase the number of our Lab technologies commercialized, and we 
want to reduce the time required to commercialize technologies that 
serve small or niche markets.&quot; Like other DoE facilities at the 
Hanford Site near Richland, PNNL has had large scale lay-offs recently 
and is committed to helping diversify the local economy by supporting 
employees who want to start their own businesses. In a nutshell, the 
program allows lab staff to:
<ul>
<li>leave their positions for up to three years, or work part-time,
and still receive medical, dental and other Battelle benefits
<li>obtain access to PNNL or Battelle technologies for the purpose
of commercialization
<li>enter into agreements to use laboratory equipment to further
develop a technology.
</ul>

The following newly created companies range in technology from
medical products to agricultural services:
<ul>
<li>Credit Card Solutions, Inc.
<li>KLM Analytical
<li>Alligator Corporation
<li>ExNet Systems, Inc.
<li>Integrated Environmental Technologies
<li>BetaScient, Inc.
<li>XL Scitech, Inc.
<li>Valley Vine Machinery Company
<li>SARE
<li>Composite Solution, Inc.
</ul>

<i><b>Case in Point: Valley Vine Machinery Company</b></i>
<p>
A logistics manager for Battelle-PNNL is utilizing the entrepreneurial
leave program to develop a way to enjoy the fruits of his labor;
with a lot less labor. Roger Dellinger bought an overgrown Concord
table grape vineyard in Prosser, WA. Initially, he wanted to devise
a better way to cut back excess vine growth so laborers could
reach the grape buds that have to be pruned by hand. What Dellinger
developed was a mechanical pruner that could prune an acre of
grape vines in less than two hours, instead of the 10 to 12 hours
it takes several trained laborers. The effectiveness of machine
pruning is being researched in a ten year study at Washington
State University. There is evidence that indicates that mechanical
pruning can match hand pruning for maximized yields - and it's
a lot faster.
<p>
Grape pruning is the practice of shaping and reducing the number
of buds on a grape plant in order to improve the size and quality
of the crop. For effective pruning, a specific number of buds
must remain to maintain vigor in the individual plant, manage
quality of the grapes, and as the crop matures, optimize the size
of the harvest. The existing mechanical pruners were very expensive
and not always capable of cutting the vines with the selectivity
needed to produce maximum yield per acre. The Vinemaster's major
asset is its flexibility and adjustable selectivity.
<p>
Dellinger's company, Valley Vine Machines is demonstrating the
Vinemaster to local Concord grape growers and taking orders for
pruning service. Wine grape growers are interested in this new
technology and a mechanical pruner for wine grapes is planned.
With plans for local manufacturing, new jobs will be created in
the firm and its partner companies.

A CRADA has been signed between <b>Four Cycle Technology, of Odessa,
WA</b>, and <b>Keyport Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC)</b>. The CRADA
will help develop a supercharged crankcase for the four cycle
engine that 4-Cycle holds a patent on. The basic principle is
based on the compression achieved by each piston downstroke used
to feed a supercharged fuel/air mixture into the combustion chambers
of gasoline and diesel engines, including stepped-piston configurations,
thus realizing greater engine efficiencies. Applications include
government and commercial marine, light industrial, light aircraft,
and unmanned vehicle engines.
<p>
As partners, 4-Cycle will provide the technology, the engines
for conversion, and perform market assessments and NUWC Division
Keyport will test the results and make modifications as jointly
agreed by the partners utilizing CAD/CAM flexible manufacturing
technologies developed by NUWC Division Keyport. Both partners
are looking for higher efficiencies and lower operating costs
in small engines after conversion.

In a quest to develop a new treatment for the nearly one million
people in the US afflicted with Parkinson's disease, <b>Somatix Therapy,
Inc.</b> of Alameda, CA has formed a partnership with <b>Berkeley Lab's
Center for Functional Imaging</b>. The project unites scientists at
Berkeley Lab who have been studying the disease using functional
imaging techniques, with researchers at Somatix, who are developing
new methods for genetic modification of cells to enable the secretion
of neuro-transmitters like dopamine.
<p>
Somatix will use genetic engineering to create fibroblast skin
cells that produce the neurochemical dopamine, which is depleted
in patients with Parkinson's. The altered cells will be implanted
in brains of animals with the disease, and Berkeley Lab scientists
will use scanning techniques such as positron emission tomography
(PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to
study to what extent dopamine levels are restored by the fibroblasts.

<b>The Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC)</b>
has just received approval of its first CRADA, signed in August
with <b>Fairfield Language Technologies, Inc. (FLT)</b>, developers of
The Rosetta Stone&#153;, a multimedia CD-ROM language learning
product which currently exists in seven languages. Through joint
efforts blending DLIFLC's linguistic expertise with FLT's capabilities
in programming and development, the CRADA will result in a Vietnamese
version of The Rosetta Stone. In a classic win-win scenario, FLT
and its customers will have access to a new language learning
product sooner than otherwise, and DLIFLC and other government
entities will enjoy the usual benefits that accrue to the government
under CRADAs. In addition to generating these CRADA-specific benefits,
this agreement demonstrates that the benefits of technology transfer
are not limited to the industrial sciences, but extend also to
the world of humanities and education.
<p>
Located on the Monterey Peninsula 100 miles south of San Francisco,
the Institute has been teaching foreign languages to soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines for over 50 years, continuously developing
cutting-edge expertise in the fields of foreign language education
and testing. Over 2000 resident students are learning 24 languages
in 6-hour-a-day classes for up to 63 weeks.
<p>
A relative newcomer to the world of technology transfer, DLIFLC
was authorized by the Department of the Army in October 1993 to
function as a government-operated laboratory for purposes of technology
transfer. The fundamental objective of DLIFLC's participation
in the Federal Laboratory Program is to identify DLIFLC-developed
technology and expertise which may be of interest to private sector
partners and enter into CRADAs with such partners to mutual advantage.
DLIFLC's ORTA is ready and able to talk with interested parties
about CRADA possibilities that can lead to new product opportunities
in the field of foreign language learning and assessment, whether
for the consumer market, the educational sector, or the corporate
world.

<P>
From: Brenda Karasik<br>
Naval Command, Control Ocean Surveillance Center
<P>
Since becoming the Far West Regional Coordinator on January 1,
1996, there have been many developments in the region.  As with
any change in people, new support contracts, new ways of doing
things and new focuses have to be determined.
<P>
In direct support of your comments in my initial email to the
laboratories, I've focused on getting the information out to you.
 Efforts include: establishing a Far West Regional Roundtable
(I encourage you to use that capability), putting the FW home
page on-line and producing the quarterly newsletter.  Again, access
to information was a key request from the majority of you.
<P>
You were also concerned about the shrinking travel dollars available
to support FLC activities.  We canceled the meeting tentatively
scheduled for February in the hope of encouraging as much participation
as possible at the FLC national spring conference being held in
our region.  We will have a FW Region business meeting on Monday,
May 6, 1996, in the afternoon.  I encourage you to attend.  We
will be reviewing the current budget, new initiatives, what your
needs are, ways of leveraging off each others' capabilities and
how our goals for the region will support the national FLC strategic
plan, etc.  Please come to the meeting with your great ideas and
be prepared to participate.
<P>
I would like to have your comments about the format and content
of the newsletter.  What do you want or don't want to see in the
newsletter?  Remember, this is designed to help you!  Please contact
me at (619) 553-2101; fax: (619) 553-6924; email: <a href="mailto:brenda@nosc.mil">brenda@nosc.mil.</a>
<P>
I am enthusiastic about being Coordinator and working with each
of you.  This coming year will be very challenging, but hopefully,
rewarding.<p>

FAR WEST CITIES RECEIVE PTI WINNING SOLUTIONS AWARDS
<P>
Twenty-eight city/county initiatives that tap the power of technology
to improve service to citizens, cut operating costs, and enhance
public revenues won Public Technology Inc. (PTI) recognition in
the 1995 Technology Achievement Awards competition.  The annual
awards program, also known as SOLUTIONS, is one facet of a broader
PTI effort to encourage and honor innovation in local government.
<P>
&quot;SOLUTIONS is a consistent way that local governments have
been benchmarking their excellence, contributing best-of-class
efforts that can act as beacons not only for the membership, but
for local governments at large,&quot; Costis Toregas, PTI President
and member of the FLC State and Local Government Committee, said.
 &quot;Their investment to document, capture, and share through
the PTI program their innovative practices is the strength of
the PTI membership.&quot;
<P>
The Community and Economic Development winner was Phoenix, Arizona.
 Phoenix brought water-saving plumbing retrofits to inner-city
homes through a unique neighborhood-based conservation program.
 Thirty-six plumbing students upgraded over 130 homes in the first
year alone, repairing leaks; replacing inefficient showerheads,
toilets, and water heaters; and rebuilding shower and faucet controls.
 These enhancements will reduce water usage by 65 percent.
<P>
Phoenix was also the Leisure Services and Libraries winner.  Phoenix
expanded citizen access to information with electronic links to
periodical, business, and health databases at all 12 public-library
branches, as well as remote dial-in access to these information
repositories.
<P>
The Public Works and General Services winner was San Diego, California.
 San Diego took control of its extensive residential refuse-collection
network - encompassing hundreds of routes and over 15,000 stops
each year - with a powerful geographic information system (GIS).
 Using a workstation networked to the GIS, staff can restructure
routes or crews, adjust routes to respond to fluctuations in refuse
tonnage, and produce instant route maps.
<P>
The Transportation winner was Portland, Oregon.  Portland enhanced
safety for schoolbound children by designing pager-controlled
flashing beacons for the city's school crossings.  The new technology
ties beacons system-wide to a single pager phone number, but assigns
each a unique six-digit message code for independent operation,
allowing staff to customize beacon operating schedules from their
desktops.<p>

WISE AWARDS TO FAR WEST ARS WOMEN
<P>
Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) is a professional society
of federally employed women.  The organization makes three annual
awards: one for contributions in science, one in engineering,
and one for lifetime achievement.  These awards honor women not
only for their own accomplishments, but also for the career support
they give other women.
<P>
Antoinette A. Betschart (1994) - Director, ARS Western Regional
Research Center in Albany, California, is internationally known
for improving the nutritional quality of cereal grains and legumes.
 Betschart established the nutritional quality of amaranth and
led a scientific team that developed the rapid production of transgenic
wheat, to speed improvements in wheat quality, nutritional value,
and pest resistance.
<P>
Phyllis E. Johnson (co-winner, 1993) - Acting Director, ARS Pacific
West Area (Albany, California) invented a noninvasive technique
to measure whole-body copper metabolism, showed that requirements
for this element differ for men and women, and was the first to
show that a specific nutrient - manganese - affects menstrual
symptoms and volume.
<P>
Elizabeth L. Klepper (1991) - Columbia Plateau Conservation Research
(Pendleton, Oregon) was one of the first to measure the time lag
between changes in field environment and changes in the energy
status of water within intact field-grown plants.  Klepper's work
led to research that quantified resistance to waterflow within
the plant and its root system.

TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE FAR WEST REGIONAL FACILITIES
<P>
NEW RICE SURVIVES EXTENDED FLOODING
<P>
Too much of a good thing is sometimes not so good.
<P>
Take rice.  It needs water to grow in, but too much can kill it.
 Especially hard hit by flooding are some lesser developed areas
of the world, where millions of people rely on rice as their major
source of food.
<P>
Over the centuries, many Asian countries have developed intricate
water delivery systems and rice paddies.  But heavy rains can
inundate fields before plants are fully grown and drown this labor-intensive
crop.
<P>
Now Agriculture Research Service (ARS) scientist David Mackill
has succeeded in breeding short rice plants that have both of
these valuable traits - high yields and tolerance to complete
submergence for up to two weeks.  This is margin enough for most
floodprone areas.
<P>
After many years of research in the ARS Crops Pathology and Genetics
Research Unit at Davis, California, MacKill has shown that the
flood-resistance trait is mostly controlled by a single gene.
<P>
Though the new rices are not yet commercially available to growers,
initial testing indicates that they will yield upwards to five
tons per acre.  This is about 20 to 50 percent more than traditional
tall varieties and about the same as other high-yielding short
types.
<P>
Another benefit to the trait might be in controlling many of the
most competitive, yield-robbing weeds.  With rices that have more
tolerance to flooding, growers could raise the water level in
fields until the weeds die.  And MacKill is now searching for
other useful genes that give rice seedlings vigor and resistance
to stem rot disease.
<P>
For more information, contact David MacKill, (916) 752-5966, fax
(916) 752-4361.

HYBRID HYDROGEN-ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILES: HIGH MILEAGE, LOW POLLUTION
<P>
A concept for a highly efficient hybrid hydrogen-electric automobile,
that gets the equivalent of 95 miles per gallon, travels 300 miles
without refueling, and produces significantly less pollution than
a gasoline-powered vehicle, is evolving at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.
<P>
Advancing this vehicle into commercial production will not only
help reduce polluting emissions, it will create manufacturing
jobs, increase U.S. economic competitiveness, and improve energy
security through the use of domestic hydrogen sources.
<P>
The envisioned automobile is a hybrid design that combines an
electric generator with a piston engine.  The design being developed
at LLNL uses hydrogen to run the engine.  The hydrogen fuel, safely
stored in the form of a metal hydride, supplies chemical energy
that the generator converts into electricity.  Special flywheels
store sufficient electrical energy to accelerate the vehicle at
a brisk 0 to 60 mph in 8 to 10 seconds.
<P>
The technology used in the hybrid hydrogen-electric vehicle is
well understood and can be available in the near future.  The
production cost of the engine/generator combination is estimated
to be about $75 per kilowatt ($100 per horsepower) of available
output power - somewhat higher than for conventional vehicle engines,
but several times less than the projected cost of fuel cells.
<P>

SEAL BEACH LABORATORY UNIQUENESS PRODUCES NUMEROUS PARTNERSHIPS
<P>
Increasing numbers of partnering opportunities have been enjoyed
by the Test Systems &amp; Sciences Laboratory (TSSL) Division
of the Technical Support Department at the Naval Weapons Station,
Seal Beach, California.
<P>
Lab Director, Stan Nakama, reports that his Business Development
Task Force, composed of colleagues David Ball, John Green (FLC
Lab Rep), and independent consultant Chris Menadier, has accumulated
an impressive array of new opportunities.
<P>
In place since Summer 1995, the group has obtained so-called Beta
Site test status on two emerging technologies: the Chemical Analysis
Automation (CAA) program from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),
and the QUIKLITE BIOASSAY water purification measurement system
developed at the Navy Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation
Division (NRaD).
<P>
As the result of reciprocal visits between TSSL and other Department
of Defense (DoD) facilities, the Lab's broad test, evaluation,
and calibration capabilities are being more broadly exposed.
Prospects with sister locations are very promising.
<P>
On a localized basis, the TSSL is responding to opportunities
to engage in technology partnerships with commercial firms - one
with revolutionary work in optical surface evaluation, and the
other with a low-cost, but highly efficient filter for removing
water and impurities from diesel fuel.  This latter program has
been still further networked to incorporate a single-plate fuel
water level sensor.  A third Cooperative Research and Development
Agreement (CRADA) opportunity is being explored with a local Huntington
Beach, California, R&amp;D firm active in advanced sensors and
carbon-air fuel cells.
<P>
The TSSL consultant, Mr. Menadier, has uncovered an unusual contract
award database which permits reviewing over 450,000 previously
awarded government contracts.  Analysis of these contracts through
specific word-search retrieval has produced short-term negotiating
opportunities with a variety of DoD and other government agencies,
including USMC, Army, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land
Management and others.  This database, compiled by Visionary Concepts
of Irving, Texas, has saved hundreds of hours of background research
through old Commerce Business Dailys and other publications.
It is expected to produce projects on virtually an immediate level.
<P>
Mr. Nakama, TSSL Director, attributes the short-term success of
the business development effort to the energetic and creative
approaches being taken by his own staff and other representatives
at the Naval Weapons Station, Seal Beach who comprise the Business
Development Task Force.
<P>

NEW EDIBLE COATINGS FOR FRUIT PRODUCTS
<P>
The Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California, has
entered into a CRADA with Alpha Food Ingredients of Evanston,
Illinois, to evaluate new edible coatings for fruit products made
from pureed fruit.  Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists
are developing a process that combines pureed apricots, pears
and peaches with various gelling agents, such as starch, to form
tasty fruit pieces.  The coating will help the fruit pieces stay
moist and last longer.  The goal is to increase consumers' fruit
consumption by using restructured fruit pieces as ingredients
in ice cream, baked goods or other products, or as alternatives
to candy.  By pureeing perishable fruit at harvest time, fruit
pieces can be produced throughout the year.  Alpha Foods licensed
technology from Argonne National laboratory to apply the novel
high-molecular-weight polylactic acid coating to foods.  ARS scientists
are determining the barrier properties of these novel coatings
and investigating the effects of the coatings on the color, texture
and shelf-life of the fruit products.

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING SERVICE SPEEDS CLEANUP
<P>
A new Tri-Cities environmental services business - known as Northwest
Environmental Services, Testing and Training (NESTT) - is part
of an alliance between the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
and a private-sector company - a partnership that's already paying
off in benefits to the local economy.
<P>
The new environmental services business, NESTT, was the result
of a CRADA between Beckman Instruments, Inc. (Palo Alto, California),
Washington State University, and the Laboratory.  The new business
uses the capabilities of the Unsaturated Flow Apparatus (UFA)
in environmental characterization and remediation.
<P>
The UFA was originally developed to measure the hydraulic conductivity
in unsaturated soils and whole rock cores for waste remediation
efforts.  Movement of water through these materials could have
serious consequences for the integrity of waste packages over
long storage periods.  Using the UFA method, predictions regarding
water movement can be based on reliable experimental data.
<P>
The hydrologic modeling made possible by the UFA is also applicable
to the migration of contamination into drinking water supplies.
 Sparse data exist at present to model the transport of water,
hydrocarbons, or contaminants in unsaturated zones.  Water from
these zones recharges the aquifers and water tables from which
most of the southwestern United States obtains its drinking water.
<P>
The UFA technology was developed jointly by engineers at Beckman
Instruments and scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
and Washington State University to model and predict the transport
of water, hydrocarbons, or contaminants through unsaturated soils,
sediments, and rock formations on the Hanford Site.  Under a CRADA
with Beckman Instruments, the Laboratory and its partner tailored
the UFA for commercial use in environmental remediation, agricultural,
and other applications.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION
<P>
SAN DIEGO AREA OFFICE HAS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CUSTOMERS FOR YOU!
<P>
Encouraged by Congressional mandates, a growing number of companies
are tapping into the storehouse of technology available from the
federal laboratories, and reaping its many rewards -- reduced
R&amp;D costs, improved manufacturing processes, advanced materials
and components, use of unique government facilities and equipment,
and new commercial products and services.
<P>
Last year, under a grant from the NASA Far West Regional Technology
Transfer Center, the City of San Diego initiated an effort to
assist regional firms in gaining access to this technology.  Initially
established as a City Economic Development Services program, the
Southwest Technology Transfer Center (SWTTC) was later restructured
as a non-profit corporation and relocated to the World Trade Center.
 The SWTTC works closely with the San Diego Regional Technology
Alliance and others, in support of economic development and defense
conversion activities in the area.
<P>
On August 3, 1995, a formal Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was
signed between the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance
Center (NCCOSC) and the City of San Diego, which established an
alliance for expeditious transfer of technology between NCCOSC
and U.S. private- sector firms in the greater San Diego area.
 The SWTTC has been designated as the City's action agent for
the project.  On November 7, 1995, a similar collaborative MOA
was signed between SWTTC and Sandia National Laboratories, and
other agreements are in process.
<P>
The greater San Diego area offers a rich and diverse environment
of high-tech industry firms.  The primary business clusters include:
Health Care Products and Services, Business/Financial Services,
Tourism and Entertainment, Defense Manufacturing, Electronics
Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Software, and Recreational
Goods.
<P>
If you would like local assistance in locating potential &quot;customers&quot;
for your laboratory's technologies in the San Diego area, contact
Mike Templeton at the Southwest Technology Transfer Center, World
Trade Center-San Diego, 1250 Sixth Avenue, Suite 110, San Diego,
CA 92101.  Contact numbers are (619) 685-1488; Fax: 685-1484;

FORUM UPDATES RESEARCHERS ON WHAT'S NEW IN TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
<P>
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Technology Transfer Department Head,
and FLC Representative, Cheryl Fragiadakis recently presented
an overview of current technology transfer issues at a forum held
at LBL.  Among the topics covered at the meeting were trends in
federal funding for technology transfer, policy and personnel
changes in DOE, government funding vs. industry partnerships,
technology transfer programs under siege, and the proposed Morella
Bill, which is aimed at improving access to national laboratories.
<P>
According to an AAAS analysis of the House-proposed balanced budget
plan, Fragiadakis said, U.S. funding for science could drop one-third
by the year 2002.  Projections indicate a downward spiral for
most agencies.  Funding for technology transfer in DOE has taken
big hits.
<P>
At the same time, national laboratories continue to receive mixed
messages from Congress.  &quot;Set-aside&quot; funding programs
are under fire.  DOD's Technology Reinvestment Program and DOC's
Advanced Technology Program are threatened with extinction.  Yet
both houses of Congress recently passed similar versions of the
Technology Transfer Improvement Act of '95 (Morella Bill, which
was recently signed by President Clinton).
<P>
The Technology Transfer Department goal is to increase alternative
funding.  To strengthen its marketing to industry and meet the
challenges of reduced funding, Technology Transfer Department
now works in teams with LBL researchers in the negotiation of
non-disclosure, materials transfer, and licensing agreements;
co-sponsorship of workshops; project management for work with
private industry; and development and implementation of industry
marketing programs.
<P>
For more information about technology transfer at LBL, contact
Steve Hunter at (510) 486-6467; fax: (510) 486-6457; email: slhunter@lbl.gov.

FAR WEST REGIONAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTER (RTTC)
<P>
Federal research is booming everywhere: in nearly all areas, products
and processes.  Much of the resulting technology and knowledge,
the fruits of labor of pre-existing research, is available to
American business for licensing.  Technology transfer--the adaptation
of an innovation originated in one institution for use in another--
might be the best way for a business to continue development,
keep its competitive advantage, or go better places altogether.
 Companies which have never used the services provided by centers
such as the RTTC here in Los Angeles have questions about the
services provided and possible benefits to be acquired through
technology transfer.  If a corporation has potential ideas for
expansion, technology transfer may be the way to go.  But how
do you know?  It sounds good, NASA and federal technology... But
in a nutshell--what can the RTTC do for you?
<P>
It's a monolithic task to attempt description of what services
RTTCs offer to a company, since we work with clients to develop
a custom-built vehicle of service.  The point of RTTCs is essentially
to provide sophisticated information brokering -- services akin
to legal representation for the world of technical development,
in the words of one of our own Information Specialists.  Much
the way legal counsel will research and direct a case for trial,
or the way a brokerage firm helps you find good investments, the
RTTC will research and direct your technical case for development,
using expertise and an inside knowledge of the system.  RTTCs
bring together those businesses and laboratories whose technical
focuses lend common ground each to the other.  Technology Transfer
Centers exist as full-service organizations with the express purpose
of matching clients to the government technology which will best
complement their own.  This can be achieved by request of a client
in search of technology or by a laboratory in search of  licensees
or co-developers.
<P>
<U>What Can You Do First?</U>
<P>
The primary rule of thumb to observe is always the same, no matter
the extent or nature of your technology transfer need:  KNOW THYSELF.
 What's the nature of your company's request?  Do you need to
know what available technology exists in relation to your gizmo?
 Do you want to develop the technology further on your own?  Are
you interested in co-development with a federal laboratory?  Or
perhaps you're a laboratory with a hot new patent and want to
get the word out or find some licensees.  RTTC specialists can
assist you only when you are clear on what your needs are and
can articulate them as clearly and fully as possible.  Be prepared
to give the rundown on what you do have and where you've been
-- essentially, what you've tried and what's come of it, so the
specialist can determine, with your assistance, how you can benefit
from the services RTTCs provide.
<P>
<U>Now That You're a Client</U>
<P>
When coming through our doors, a potential client needs a well-written
business proposal and, ideally, should possess a working prototype
of the proposed technology.  A complete and concise business proposal
will illustrate to us what your technical ambition is, the scope
and function (so far) of your company, and give our specialists
the opportunity to identify the nature and level of possible application
of RTTC services to your needs.  Once it's determined how RTTC
assistance would be beneficial to you, you'll be referred to a
Project Manager.
<P>
Project Managers evaluate your needs and determine an appropriate
course for successful development.  An in-depth analysis, which
could include an on-site visit, is standard.  The more details
available to us in determination of your needs, the more you help
us to help you.
<P>
Information services within RTTC are most useful as a stepping-stone
in the research process which will lead your company to appropriate
matches to one or more resources, such as a federal research laboratory,
NASA laboratories, other centers in the RTTC network or other
private industry sources, or universities.  Specialists can assess
the marketability of your product that uses federal technology,
the current status of the market where products similar to yours
are presently available, and product `hurdles' you'd be likely
to encounter and would need to overcome in order to secure a market
share.  We provide the client with an understanding of the position
a new product ought to take in the market and to assist with identifying
marketing alternatives which will work to the benefit and success
of your business.
<P>
<U>When All's Said And Done</U>
<P>
Technology Transfer Centers exist to perform a service: namely,
the connection of government and private sectors in technology.
 The NASA RTTCs are funded to create such lucrative intersections.
 We are your filling station on the information highway.  Our
information and technology brokering is unique for two reasons:
 we have a vast set of connections and resources available to
companies; and because our services are subsidized, we are able
to spend more time and effort with clients and tailor our services
for each project.
<P>
Opening the doors to technology is our mission at the Far West
Regional Technology Transfer Center.  Tracking your progress keeps
us in touch with the success and accomplishments of clients we've
connected with labs to work on their projects or who have taken
technology to further develop on their own.  Every step up for
you is a plus for us.  Your success is our success.
<P>
We'll see you in May at the FLC meeting in Seattle!

NEWS FROM AROUND THE REGION
<P>
HANDOUT NEEDED FOR NEGOTIATIONS
<P>
The American Federation of Technology Transfer Executives (AFTTE)
winter meeting in San Jose included an excellent critique by both
parties to an ongoing CRADA negotiation.  Confusion and wasted
time could be saved, however, if a negotiable vs. non-negotiable
summary handout were available that could be discussed early in
the negotiations.  The handout should briefly cite the legal basis
for the non-negotiables.  The president of AFTTE agreed to have
a &quot;straw man&quot; drafted and provided to us for the inevitable
tuning each lab would want to do.
<P>
This could be a big help.  If anyone has something similar already
drafted, please send one electronically, ideally as an attachment
to email, so it could be fine-tunied without retyping.  Please
provide the information to Tom Karasek at NUWC Division Keyport,
(360) 396-5557; Fax: (360) 396-4845; email: tkarasek@kpt.nuwc.navy.mil.

Bay Area Recipients of the National Medal of Technology
<P>
The National Medal of Technology is the highest award the President
of the United States of America bestows for technological achievement.
 Enacted by Congress in 1980 and first awarded in 1985, the Medal
is awarded annually to individuals, teams or companies for accomplishments
in the innovation, development, and commercialization of technology
as evidenced by the establishment of new significantly improved
products, processes, or services.
<P>
California, a progressive state in many respects, has produced
more winners of the Medal than any other state in the nation.
 Fully one-sixth of all recipients of the Medal are residents
of the Bay Area, home of Silicon Valley and the firms which are
continuing to shape today's &quot;Digital Age.&quot;  Drawing
on such academic powerhouses as Stanford University, the University
of California at Berkeley and the University of California at
San Francisco, as well as world-class scientific facilities of
the Department of Energy and NASA such as Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and NASA Ames
Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 14 individuals
have made substantial contributions to the nation's competitiveness
and dramatically improved our quality of life.

CALSTART'S PROJECTS ARE FERTILE BREEDING GROUND FOR NEW COMPANIES
<P>
CALSTART, California's leading advanced transportation technologies
consortium, is a non-profit organization of more than 180 public
and private entities located in Burbank, California.  Formed in
1992 to stimulate growth in advanced transportation, the consortium
has developed a business incubator program, called Project Hatchery.
<P>
Business incubators play a critical role in helping start-up companies
dig in at the ground floor of new industries by providing much-needed
services and facilities.  CALSTART's Project Hatchery offers a
wealth of resources: affordable workspace; CALSTART's machine
shop, test laboratory and fabrication facility; a professional
network; fund-raising resources; and access to CALSTART's World
Wide Web site and state-of-the-art computer simulation design
services.  Twenty-two companies have taken up residence at Project
Hatchery in Burbank.
<P>
Project Hatchery North is also now a reality.  Alameda Naval Air
Station, a nexus of naval aviation since World War II, now has
a new mission: fighting air pollution and creating jobs for advanced
transportation.  The Naval Air Station's Hangar 20 has been recommissioned
from military to civilian use as a development and manufacturing
site for electric and other clean vehicle technologies.
<P>
Any company involved in advanced transportation can apply for
the assistance available through the CALSTART's incubator projects.
 Laboratories with transportation technologies should also contact
CALSTART.
<P>
For more information, contact Glenn Perry, CALSTART's chief operating
officer, at (818) 565-5600; Fax: (818) 565-5610; email: calstart@ix.netcom.com.

<title>TAP IN Success Story #17</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Helps Small, Minority-Owned Business Win
9.1 Million Dollar Contract</center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>A small, defense dependent, minority-owned Montana business
       was bidding for a large Department of Defense contract.<p>

<li>MCTTC identified additional suppliers of fuel in the Western
       United States.<p>

<li>As a result of receiving this information, the company
    determined which    areas it should bid on and was awarded a 9.1
    million dollar contract.
</ul><p>

The client company is a small, minority-owned business located
in Montana.  The defense dependent company (60%), which is classified
as an SBA 8(a), presently employs two (2) full-time and several
part-time employees.  The company supplies fuel and aviation services.
 
<P>
In January, a company representative contacted a representative
of the Montana Tradeport Authority (MTA), a TAP-IN affiliate.
 The company was a previous client that participated in procurement
technical assistance programs conducted by the MTA.  
<P>
The company was planning to bid on a large contract for the Department
of Defense.  The company requested assistance in identifying additional
suppliers of fuel, including small refineries, in the Western
United States.   
<P>
The MTA representative contacted the <b>Mid-Continent Technology
Transfer Center (MCTTC)</b> and was referred to the Texas A&amp;M
office.  The A&amp;M office conducted a search that identified
suppliers of the Defense Fuel Supply Center, along with other
small suppliers of fuel.  This information was compiled and submitted
to the company.  
<P>
The company analyzed the results of the search and bid on the
areas in which they could get suppliers.  On April 19, 1995, the
company was awarded a 9.1 million dollar contract.  This two-year
contract is in the process of completion.  Future plans for the
company include other government contract bids and solicitations.
MTA in continuing to help the company identify and enter additional
markets.
<P>
This success story was directly related to the assistance that
was provided by the Montana Tradeport Authority and the TAP-IN
Program.  Without this assistance, the outside resources required
by the company might not have been identified.

<title>TAP IN Success Story #18</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>Tap-In Helps Wyoming Company </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>A small Wyoming company is working to develop, test, and
commercialize new polymide technology.<P>

<li>The company was awarded an SBIR grant and is currently
working with Langley Research Institute through a licensing
agreement.<P>

<li>Several major companies and governmental agencies have
expressed a desire to commercialize the technology.<P>
</ul>

This small (three employees) Wyoming company is attempting to
develop, test, and commercialize a new polyamide technology. 
The polyamide technology is a plasma spray used in the application
of high performance polymers.
<P>
Through contacts with the Business Assistance Center at the University
of Wyoming, an<b> MCTTC</b> affiliate, a licensing agreement is in process
with <b>Langley Research Center</b>.  An SBIR grant was also awarded
to the company, North Dakota State University, and the Langley
Research Institute.  The Langley Research Institute will furnish
six groups of polymers that can be licensed under the company.
The Business Assistance Center also submitted a problem statement
to the Kennedy Lab to test the technology.
<P>
As a result of the SBIR, several major companies and governmental
agencies have expressed a desire to commercialize the technology.
 Technology searches and market assessments are two ongoing TAP-IN
services being provided to the company.  Without the services
of the MCTTC, potential resources for the company would not have
been discovered, and the project would be non-existent. <p>

<title>TAP IN Success Story #19</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Helps With New Software Product Release </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>
<ul>
<li> A Boston-based company and Honeywell are involved in a
joint venture to    develop a new computer programming software
package.<P>

<li>MCTTC aided in the commercialization of the technology
by providing a    director of Honeywell with insight into the
commercialization process and    agreement facilitation.
<P>
<li>The release of the software package is expected to result
in the establishment of three to ten jobs in the Clear Lake
Area.<P>
</ul>
A joint venture between Honeywell and a Boston-based company,
recently resulted in the development of a new software package
entitled, ACSL-CODE.  Pending release, ACSL-CODE  is a package
designed to automatically generate C or Ada computer programming
software, bypassing the need for engineers to write this tool.
<P>
Prior to this announcement, the <b>Mid-Continent Technology Transfer
Center (MCTTC)</b> introduced Director Robert McAfoos, of the Honeywell
Space System Houston Engineering Center, to the MCTTC commercialization
process.  The MCTTC helped McAfoos understand the commercialization
process, and also provided valuable insight on agreement facilitation.
<P>
McAfoos cites the involvement of the Clear Lake Area Economic
Development Foundation (CLAEDF) and the participation of the MCTTC
as keys for the success of this venture.  &quot;I credit CLAEDF
for fostering the environment that makes these things possible,
and for providing the necessary contacts,&quot; McAfoos said,
&quot;I also thank UHCL Technology Transfer Center for providing
his strategic insight.&quot;
<P>
Without the aid of TAP-IN and the MCTTC, Honeywell and the company
would not have been provided with the valuable information and
services necessary for success.    &quot;Everyone's commercialization
effort has allowed this product to come to fruition,&quot; McAfoos
continued, &quot;This is another example of the technology transfer
that is being accomplished frequently in the Clear Lake Community.&quot;
 Release of ACSL-CODE is expected to result in the establishment
of three to ten jobs in the Clear Lake Area.<p>

<title>TAP IN Success Story #20</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Helps Company Improve Environmentally Friendly Waste
Conversion Process </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>
<ul>
<li>A TAP-IN company signed a CRADA with the Westinghouse
Savannah    River Company to generate the data required to design
an environmental    plant which will convert garbage into a reusable
liquid fuel.
<P>
<li>The goal of the CRADA over its two year term will be to
generate enough    data to design and engineer a commercial unit
for operation.
<P>
<li>Because of their relationship with Westinghouse Savannah
River Company,   the company is well positioned to enter the commercial
market.
<P>
</ul>
A company working with the <b>Southeast Regional Technology Transfer
Center (STAC)</b> has developed a patented waste conversion process.
The process has caught the attention of both the public and private
sectors. In August 1995, they signed a CRADA with Westinghouse
Savannah River Company to generate the data required for designing
their environmental plant.  The plant will convert garbage (or
other organic material) into a clean liquid fuel.  The fuel is
reusable in conventional equipment such as industrial boilers.
 This environmentally friendly process is inexpensive when compared
to traditional waste disposal methods (other than landfills).
<P>
About a year ago, the president of the company was introduced
to the technology transfer manager at WSRC, by one of STAC's RTTC/TAP-IN
affiliates.  In addition to the introduction, STAC's affiliate
assisted in the CRADA development and negotiations.  Prior to
the CRADA, the company had piloted the technology and it had been
proven on a continuous basis.  The goal of the CRADA over its
two year term will be to generate enough data to design and engineer
a commercial unit for operation.  The research and development
activities include optimization, kinetics, and defining the construction
materials.  Additionally, they will identify the plant location
and sources of funding for the construction of the facility.
<P>
The company's technology has exceptionally high barriers to entry
due to the nature of waste disposal industry and the high capital
costs of building such facilities.  By partnering with WSRC, the
company is better positioned to successfully break into this difficult
market.  Although the CRADA has not impacted their current position,
it will provide the necessary springboard for the future.  One
of the benefits of the CRADA includes the technical capability
available through WSRC needed to help answer some vital research
questions.  This will in turn lessen the risk in building the
plant, increasing the likelihood for a successful first operation.
 The visibility of partnering with a large, well regarded company
will give them credibility and name recognition for relationship
building with funding prospects.<p>

<title>TAP IN Success Story #21</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Company Works to Create Therapy Robot</center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>
<ul>
<li>A Florida company is working with Lockheed Martin to create
a robot that   will be  used by both military and commercial therapy
practices.
<P>
<li>The company has received multiple grants and is already
testing  prototypes.
<P>
<li>Sales are expected to reach 10 million dollars in the
United States alone    and Lockheed Martin projects the creation
of 60 new jobs at Lockheed    Martin and 10 additional jobs in
sales and management at the company.<P>
</ul>
The skilled hands of the muscular therapist may soon belong to
a robot.  A muscular therapist in Pinellas Park, is developing
a robot arm that applies pressure just as a therapist would. 
But the robot never gets tired.  The Robotic Therapist Assistance
will allow therapists, many of whom are limited to 20-hour work
weeks by the rigors of their jobs, to be more productive.  And
once miniaturized, the device will allow patients to treat themselves
at home.
<P>
While working as an engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy's
Pinellas Plant in Largo, the owner of the company was stricken
with an equilibrium disorder that incapacitated him for 10 months.
 After several failed diagnoses, he found relief from a muscular
therapist, who loosened a hardened neck muscle that was pulling
at his ear.  He eventually recovered and took night classes in
massage therapy and anatomy and decided to change careers.  After
working for a number of years in massage therapy, he developed
a hernia at work by trying to apply pressure to a patient.  That's
when he got the idea to create a robot to take some of the pressure
out of his job.
<P>
To accomplish this, he contacted the Southeast Regional Technology
Transfer Center (STAC) which screens applicants who apply for
technical assistance from the Martin Marietta Specialty Components,
Inc., the operator of the Department of Energy's plant in Largo,
Florida.  Until recently, the sprawling plant has produced nuclear
triggering devices, but has now been transitioned to commercial
use.  Several technology assistance programs are in effect which
allow local businesses to take advantage of its highly specialized
technologies.
<P>
STAC also helped the company obtain several Technology Transfer
Initiative grants and funding from the TAP-IN program. Engineering
prototypes for the devices have already been fabricated and are
under test. The design includes a patient table, a force sensor,
a patient position detection system, a patient/therapist display
system, and an attachment for various end-effectors.
<P>
The robot will be used by military and commercial therapy practices,
according to a doctor at the University of South Florida (USF).
The doctor, who is teaming with the company for a Technology Development
Center grant states, &quot;I expect that this particular device
will become common place in the physical therapy environment.
I expect that this robot will be commonly used with other adjunctive
modalities such as electrical stem, Ultrasound, and moist heat.&quot;
<P>
A business plan created independently by USF College of Business
projects annual sales of 10 million dollars in the United States
alone. Lockheed Martin Specialty Components projects the creation
of 60 new jobs at Lockheed Martin and 10 additional jobs in sales
and management at the company. As for the owner of the company,
he is glad the robot has saved his business and has prevented
him from suffering another hernia injury.<p>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>CRADA Signed for the Development of &quot;Phantom Organs&quot;</center></h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>
<ul>
<li> A Florida company has received a $200,000 grant and signed
two CRADAs with Department of Energy laboratories for the
development and   production of radioactive &quot;phantoms organs&quot;.
<P>
<li>A company which was 100% defense dependent is now only
10%     dependent.
<P>
<li>A former weapons facilities is now producing medically
useful devices for    nuclear medicine and oncology.  <P>
</ul>
A Florida company working with TAP-IN recently received a $200,000
grant and signed two CRADAs with Department of Energy laboratories
for the development and production of radioactive &quot;phantoms
organs&quot;. Phantoms organs are used for diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes in the practice of nuclear medicine.  Nuclear medicine
is practiced at more than 5,000 hospitals in the U.S.  <b>The Southern
Technology Transfer Center (STAC)</b>, NASA's Southeast Regional Technology
Transfer Center, provided much of the needed expert assistance
to make these CRADAs a reality.
<P>
The phantoms will be used to calibrate the cameras used on the
patients.  Currently, calibration is done with short-lived, radioactive
solutions that must be mixed by a technician.  Problems with this
include frequent exposure of technicians to radioactive materials,
the possibility of dangerous spills during mixing, and air bubbles,
which give false readings.
<P>
The company development creates &quot;phantom&quot; organs (such
as brains, livers, etc.) that are filled with radioactive gel.
One of the advantages of these gel-filled phantom organs are that
they are able to provide precise calibration due to elimination
of air bubbles. They are safer than their predecessors in that
if spilled, the gel lands in a lump and is more easily and safely
cleaned up and technicians have much less exposure to radioactive
material. The phantom organs also last 1.5-2 years rather than
the few hours under the current technology.  The phantoms will
be manufactured for domestic use and for export.<p>

<title>TAP IN Success Story #23</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>Wisconsin Company Finds Answer Through TAP-IN </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>A Wisconsin manufacturer is working with a DOE contractor
to solve a drilling problem.
<P>
<li>The two companies negotiated an agreement and have already
begun the testing phase of a project.
<P>
<li>The Wisconsin manufacturer expects the project to yield
results that could put the company in a substantially improved
competitive position.
<P>
</ul>
Due to contacts made through the Technology Access for Product
Innovation (TAP-IN) program, a mid-sized Wisconsin manufacturer
is now working with a Department of Energy (DOE) contractor to
help meet some of the company's technical needs. NASA's <b>Midwest
Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC)</b> is helping the companies
work together to solve a drilling problem for the manufacturer.
<P>
The manufacturer produces machines that convert bulk paper materials
into consumer products (such as diapermakers and toilet tissue
paper rollers). The company has had difficulty perfecting the
boring of its steel tubes used in a turning/winding process. Thus
far, the company has been forced to either buy bar stock and drill
through the middle or buy redrilled tubing and refine the tube
to specified tolerances. The company approached the Midwest RTTC
for assistance identifying alternatives in materials, suppliers,
or manufacturing methods.
<P>
The RTTC pooled its resources of federal laboratories and industry
clients. A Cleveland grinding client suggested that another Ohio
company that supplies the DOE with nuclear fuels rods might have
appropriate expertise. After putting the two companies in contact
with each other, they quickly determined that the DOE supplier
did have manufacturing capabilities which could assist the Wisconsin
manufacturer.
<P>
&quot;After many years of frustrating work within our organization
attempting to resolve a difficult manufacturing issue,...the RTTC
personnel I have had the opportunity to work with were very helpful
in getting our company in touch with someone in the field we were
researching. The RTTC referred us to a DOE supplier specializing
in deep hole boring technology. The DOE supplier has proven to
be our best bet to date on resolving our manufacturing problems,&quot;
commented David Wagner, manufacturing engineer at the Wisconsin
company.
<P>
The companies negotiated an agreement and as of early October
they have entered the testing phase of the project. &quot;We feel
confident that this project will yield results that could put
our company in a substantially improved competitive position,&quot;
Wagner said.
<P>
Continuing, Wagner added that &quot;without the help of the RTTC,
we may never have found the DOE supplier. The Midwest RTTC continues
to research additional alternative polymer and ceramic material
options for us to explore on this same project. We look forward
to continuing to work with the RTTC in the future. This is has
been a good example of the kind of cooperative government service
that industry needs more of.&quot;<p>

<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Pilot Project Improves Kiosks </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>The Midwest RTTC, a small defense contractor, and an industrial
design firm have teamed to design, prototype, and engineer an
interactive multimedia kiosk for printing consumer coupons on
demand. 
<P>
<li>The project has the potential to reduce the millions of
coupons that are thrown away each week.
<P>
<li>The Defense Commissary Agency also would like to use the
coupon dispensing computer kiosks at military base commissaries.<P>
</ul>

NASA's <b>Midwest Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC)</b> is working
with a small defense contractor and an industrial design firm--both
in Ohio--to design, prototype, and engineer an interactive multimedia
kiosk for printing consumer coupons on demand. The project is
part of the Technology Access for Product Innovation's (TAP-IN)
industrial design pilot project with partner Industrial Designers
Society of America (IDSA).
<P>
The company manufactures communication, electronic, and electro-mechanical
devices. The small Akron, Ohio company has been supplying the
Department of Defense under the name Airborne Industries since
1983.  With the decline in defense contracts, however, the company
decided it wanted to use its defense-developed capabilities to
pursue opportunities in the interactive point-of-sale kiosk market.
<P>
The company began integrating its interactive communication expertise
with state-of-the-art kiosk display technology and developed a
new electronic coupon dispensing machine. The company has produced
ten prototype interactive point-of-sale kiosks that will print
customized coupons for a major food chain. The units are being
field tested in the chain's stores (began in September). When
the TAP-IN pilot project began, the Midwest RTTC contacted the
company and asked if the company would like to participate in
the pilot and have an IDSA industrial designer help with the kiosk
effort. 
<P>
The answer was yes. The RTTC involved Cleveland design firm with
experience in consumer product design. Once the field tests are
completed, Design Interface will evaluate the company's kiosk
design and redesign the kiosks based on observations and results
of the field tests. The company and the design firm have agreed
on a scope of work for the project. The company has experience
necessary for manufacturing kiosk devices, but the design firm's
consumer product design experience will help make the project
a success.
<P>
The Defense Commissary Agency has now expressed interest in the
company's idea and would like to use coupon dispensing computer
kiosks at military base commissaries. The project also allows
the company to gain new capabilities in interactive computer terminals,
touch-screen displays, data communication, and human factors design
that will help supply the next generation of electronic devices.
<P>
The coupon industry continues to grow at a constant rate but redemption
rates remain low, varying between two-five percent in the last
ten years. With the help of the TAP-IN pilot project, the company
has the potential to cut down on the millions of coupons that
are added to land-fills each week. The company hopes to establish
itself as a key supplier of low cost, interactive kiosks and projects
that it will be able to build over 1400 units in the first year
of production. <p>

<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>The Midwest RTTC, its Indiana affiliate, and NASA have
teamed with Indiana industry and two high schools to help high
school students build and operate rovers and robots.
<P>
<li>An Indiana high school hopes to create a new advanced
computer programming curriculum that will incorporate hands-on
activities like robotics and other real-world expertise gained
from the project.
<P>
<li>The project unites NASA and industrial robotics expertise
to the benefit of education in Indiana and Ohio.<P>
</ul>
NASA's <b>Midwest Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC)</b>, its
Indiana affiliate, and NASA's Lewis Research Center and Jet Propulsion
Laboratory have teamed with an Indiana high school to help the
high school students build and operate rovers and robots. Though
the project is part of an afterschool program called Innovative
Research &amp; Design, the high school hopes to take the robotics,
electronics, and programming knowledge it acquires through the
project and apply it toward a class next year. 
<P>
The Midwest RTTC and its affiliate Indiana Business Modernization
&amp; Technology Corp. have joined forces with NASA, the Indiana
Microelectronics Center, CYBO Robots and Wayne High School in
Ft. Wayne, Indiana, to help the students develop rovers and robotic
arms. The teleoperation project involves the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's
rover expertise from work with the Mars Pathfinder. The Pathfinder
was developed to explore Mars on a 1997 mission, but both NASA
and the Department of Defense are also conducting research on
rovers and teleoperation for tactical and medical applications.
<P>
The Indiana Microelectronics Center offered the use of its video
conferencing facilities to connect the students and NASA researchers.
In March of 1996, the students will visit the Center and participate
in the video conference with NASA and the other partners. The
students will also receive a tour and training on programming
ASICs or microcontrollers. CYBO Robots, a robotics company in
Indianapolis, has also offered its expertise on building robots
for industrial applications and programming in the robotics field.
A tour of the plant is being scheduled. The video conference may
also involve Cleveland East Tech High School in Cleveland, Ohio.
NASA is currently taking steps to link the two schools electronically
to allow the students to learn from a similar project completed
previously with the Ohio school. 
<P>
This teleoperation project offers a unique opportunity to unite
NASA and industry expertise with education in Indiana and Ohio.
Depending on the success of the March video conference, the high
schools could further relationships with its NASA and industry
partners. The NASA Lewis Research Center is currently helping
the Indiana high school identify several projects from which the
school could create an advanced computer course involving robotics.
  
<P>
The teleoperation effort is part of the Technology Access for
Product Innovation (TAP-IN) program. TAP-IN is a program of the
NASA RTTCs that seeks to help the private sector access and use
defense-related technology.<p>

will work together to select future pairings of combustion systems
and coatings for testing.
<P>
This partnering came about when MTAC met with the company and
asked for problem statements. The company indicated that assistance
was needed in testing the performance of a hightemperature coating
in a particular application. It was beyond their capability to
perform this test in their own facilities. MTAC arranged for representatives
of PETC and the company to meet and discuss requirements which
resulted in the signing of an agreement and initial testing.

<title>TAP IN Success Story #27</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Company Works with Argonne National Lab to Improve
Sensors  </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>An MTAC client company is working with Argonne to design
a software program that can identify specific gases.
<P>
<li>Improvements, including a reduction in size and inclusion
of artificial    intelligence, have already been made.
<P>
<li>The sensors reduce environmental emissions from vehicles
and industrial plants in compliance with DOE's mission.<P>
</ul>
An <b>MTAC</b> client company sought assistance from the Ben Franklin
Technology Center of SW PA to obtain SBIR funding. MTAC discovered
<b>Argonne National Laboratory</b> was looking for a company to further
develop the software for its multigas ceramic metallic (cermet)
microsensor.  MTAC informed the company and introductions were
made between the company and  Argonne. The company turned out
to be a perfect fit for the project. They began designing a smaller,
more powerful software program with artificial intelligence enhancements
that allow the neural networks to be &quot;trained&quot; to recognize
certain gases. Their improved version was announced in Argonne's
newsletter, Tech Transfer Highlights (Vol. 6, No. 4).
<P>
Sensors available today run on a microprocessor. The company and
Argonne's improved version can run the sensor from a chip. The
reduction in size is expected to be very welcome in a market which
lacks an intelligent sensor that is also inexpensive and compact.
Currently, prototypes are being further developed and  refined.
The ultimate goal is to create a sensor that can fit on a circuit
board.
<P>
The sensors fit in with the DOE's mission to reduce environmental
emissions from vehicles and industrial plants. But more than that,
the creation of the sensor software is a model example of mutually
beneficial governmentindustry teamwork.

<title>TAP IN Success Story #28</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center> TAP-IN Helps Company Utilize NASA Ames Space Technology to
Improve Medical Monitoring Systems</center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>A Pennsylvania company is working to license a NASA technology
    originally developed by Ames Research Center to monitor astronauts.
<P>
<li>The company is interested in manufacturing the system
to monitor in-home   heart patients.
<P>
<li>The technology looks promising for potential commercialization
for use in    a variety of medical areas.<P>
</ul>

MTAC received a call from a company with a need for 80 wireless
remote physiological monitoring systems.  Nothing commercially
available met the company's requirements.  Assuming that such
a system must already exist for monitoring astronauts in space,
an MTAC representative searched the NASA labs.
<P>
NASA Ames Research Center originally developed the Ames Autogenic
Feedback Training System (AAFTS) to facilitate astronaut adaptation
to space. Ames had applied for a patent and was looking for companies
to produce the AAFTS.  MTAC located a company that is interested
in licensing the technology and manufacturing the system.  The
Pennsylvania company produces heart monitors for in-home use that
continually monitor the patient and &quot;call in&quot; the results
to a hospital. The company is interested in the AAFTS because
of its adaptability and has already filed a license application.
<P>
The system consists of two parts -- the wireless, non-invasive
hardware and the training program that teaches people how to control
their own physiological responses to a variety of environmental
stresses.  The system's small size offers greater comfort and
mobility for the wearer and the four to six hour training program
to permanently reduce or eliminate motion and airsickness has
been effective in 85% of the test subjects.
<P>
The program can also be used in the treatment of hypertension,
dysautonomia, autonomic neuropathy and nausea from chemotherapy.
 In addition, the training is useful for alleviating low blood
pressure in patients with diabetes, spinal cord lesions or generalized
somatic paralysis.  Training can also be used to modify central
nervous system activity in the treatment of neuropathological
disorders such as epilepsy, Attention Deficit Disorder and mild
head trauma.  Another advantage of the system is that training
in the recognition and control of physiological changes provides
an alternative to pharmacological treatment of a variety of disorders.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center> TAPIN Helps Site Remediation Company Introduce New Equipment</center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>
<ul>
<li>The Far West RTTC is working with a Washington State company
to leverage NASA technology to improve their site remediation
equipment.
<P>
<li>TAPIN assistance from the RTTC and Langley Research Center
will allow the company's equipment to operate for longer periods without
maintenance.
<P>
<li>The company has entered into a agreement with Langley
Research Center which is expected to lead to the licensing of the technology.<P>
</ul>
Through the <b>Far West RTTC</b>, TAPIN has assisted a bioremediation
services and equipment company in accessing a technology critical
to the improvement of their innovative site remediation equipment.
 An agreement has been made with <b>NASA Langley Research Center</b>
to test a new polyimid coating on the turborator blades to improve
their life in use.
<P>
The company came to the Far West RTTC looking for a material and/or
manufacturing process which would increase the life of the fan
knife blades used in their Turborator machines.  Currently the
company finds that a fan knife blade must be changed after approximately
2,000 cubic yards. The Turborator can turn 3500 cubic yards of
soil in 8 hours time.  This means the equipment has to be shut
down for 2 hours during the day to replace the blades; a process
which is very costly.
<P>
Heretofore, the industry approach to bioremediation has been to
deposit contaminated soil into permanent landfills or to attempt
to incinerate the toxic contents of the soil.   The company has
revolutionized the industry by using a 3 step process which turns
contaminated soil, with high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons,
into uncontaminated soil which is capable of sustaining plant
life.
<P>
There is currently no other bioremediation process in the marketplace
as effective as this company's.  The machinery is very expensive
and therefore it is not feasible to have 2 machines on site. 
Thus, lengthening the life of the fan blades is of utmost importance.
 It is a major step in increasing the company's ability to solve
ecological problems.
<P>
The Turborators blades need to be capable of turning at 520 RPM
with a 34&quot; diameter between points in sand, gravel and other
types of soil and they need to be able to withstand shock attacks.
 The blades need to be hard enough to resist wear but not so hard
that they will shatter if they strike a piece of rock or steel.
 Current wear patterns show less wear in the area where the cutting
(welding) took place which indicates that the heat in the cutting
is creating a harder area next to the cut.
<P>
An agreement has been made with NASA Langley Research Center to
test a new polyimid coating on the turborator blades to improve
their life in use. The coating allows for diamond and other hard
substances to be imbedded into the coated surface to improve blade
life.  This effort will result in the licensing of the selected
coating technology to the company for its use.

<title>TAP IN Success Story #30</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<head><h2><center>TAPIN Helps Company Commercialize Spectral Imaging Equipment </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>The NASA Far West RTTC has been working with a California
company    to identify commercial partners to assist them in the
development  and    manufacture of real time spectral imaging
instrumentation for commercial    application.
<P>
<li>The company has entered into a JPL Affiliate Agreement
to access the labs    expertise in this field.
<P>
<li>The company has secured a Phase II SBIR grant and is working
to further    develop its industrial nondestructive inspection
technology.<P>
</ul>
The NASA <b>Far West RTTC</b> has been working with Surface Optics Corporation
(SOC), which approached the Far West RTTC  with a request for
assistance in initiating a technical partnership with NASA's <b>Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</b>; the goal of the partnership was development
and manufacture of realtime spectral imaging instrumentation for
commercial applications.
<P>
The Far West RTTC,  familiar with JPL's expertise and history
in the field of spectral imaging systems, helped SOC team with
JPL by signing a JPL Affiliate agreement.  SOC developed the basis
for their spectral imaging system, known as the Multiband, Identification
and Discrimination Imaging Spectroradiometer (MIDIS), under a
Department of Defense Phase I SBIR contract.  NASA technology
and expertise, made possible by the Affiliate agreement, facilitated
further refinement of the technology and helped procure a Phase
II grant.
<P>
The MIDIS system allows realtime collection and processing of
spectral images, ultimately over the spectral range of 0.4 um
to over 12 um. Highspeed processing of the highspeed spectral
imagery allows materialsbased discrimination throughout a viewed
scene.  Such capability has application in any field where noncontact,
realtime, passive determination of material composition or state
is important.  On web production lines, for example, it is often
necessary to ensure that materials are being applied in the proper
proportions, or that the applied materials are producing the desired
effect on the web, e.g., wallpaper or membrane production.  Other
processes require that surfaces be free of contaminants before
further treatment; to ensure quality and minimize wasted materials;
such processes could benefit from inspection of the entire surface,
 not just a small sample area, to ensure freedom from contamination.
 In an experimental demonstration of the MIDIS technology, SOC
and JPL showed that the spatial distribution of otherwise undetectable
mold release on carbon composites could be detected by the spectral
imaging technique.  Detection of even small patches of contamination
on an otherwise clean surface ensures that time and effort are
not wasted in applying a subsequent coating to that surface before
additional cleaning.
<P>
Beyond the industrial nondestructive inspection capabilities of
the instrument, MIDIS also has applications in medical imaging.
 Because various tissues are both chemically and physically distinct,
their spectral characteristics are also distinct.  Spectral imaging
then allows identification of tissue type and health.  Skin lesions,
for example, can potentially be identified without the need for
biopsy.  In traumatic injuries, dead or dying tissues can be identified
and removed without removing any of the surrounding healthy tissue.
<P>
From an environmental and earth resource monitoring perspective,
this technology allows monitoring of effluents from industries,
vehicles, and homes.  In controlling the emissions of factories,
such technology allows remote, passive identification of the types
and amounts of chemicals being released into the atmosphere or
waterways.  With use of MIDIS technology, collection of samples
from the potential offender would not be necessary, giving monitoring
agencies greater power in ensuring compliance with environmental
regulations.  Emissions from vehicles can also be monitored in
realtime, allowing identification of the worst polluters.  Another
unique application or emission monitoring is the identification
of potential drug processing labs.  The volatile chemicals used
in illicit drug manufacture emanate from structures where such
processing occurs. Identifying these emissions using spectral
imaging would allow law enforcement a means to find potential
drug processing operations.  Health and composition of forests
or commercial crops can also be monitored over large areas, allowing
preventive care, forecasting and management.  Again, such monitoring
can also identify illicit crops.  Distribution of surface minerals
and other earth resources can also be monitored by MIDIS.

<head><h2><center>TAPIN Assists Washington State Company in Virtual Reality Product
Development </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>The NASA Far West RTTC is helping a Washington State company
to gain access to technical assistance in the development and
commercialization of eye tracking technology for virtual
reality applications.
<P>
<li>The company is in negotiation with the Jet Propulsion
Lab regarding access   to the labs expertise in this field.
<P>
</ul>
A <b>Far West RTTC</b> client, located in the State of Washington, is
developing technology that will allow control of various operations
through eye movement. For example, moving our eyes to look from
the bottom of a computer screen to the top of the screen will
automatically move the cursor to the top of the screen.
<P>
Success in this endeavor requires that eye movement be monitored
very precisely, the beginning and end of the movement be linked
to an operation, and that the link operate in real time. The company
has developed a headmounted unit to measure eye movement. This
unit, Iglasses!, has the ability to track eye movement.
<P>
While doing its research, the company had come to the realization
that the right partner would bring real value to the research
effort. They  came to the Far West RTTC to ask for help in locating
a partner. The Far West RTTC introduced the company to NASA's
<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</b>
<P>
The company has shared with JPL a modified design of the company's
Iglasses!.  The modification adds an infrared video camera that
can image the external eye. The eye is illuminated via infrared
LED's and the image entering the camera is filtered to remove
the visible light image of the eye.  A patent is pending on the
configuration of this camera.
<P>
The camera arrangement allows the iglasses! HMD as before.  The
iglasses! are still see through and the display can be operated
without interfering with eye tracking camera.  The image of the
eye is fed to a computer board mounted in an IBM PC.  The computer
board processes the video image in real time and produces output
including horizontal and vertical eye position and pupil diameter.
 The system will have cameras for eyes so that a convergence measure
can be gathered.
<P>
This system is an experimental one and is being used for testing
of subjects wearing Iglasses!.  The company believes that there
are potential long term uses of this arrangement of  technology
including using directed eye movement as a method of moving a
cursor on a computer screen viewed in the display.  The advantage
of such an arrangement is that little or no calibration of the
eye tracking system will be necessary compared to a head free
eye tracker used in combination with an Earth fixed display.
<P>
The Far West RTTC is helping the company and JPL agree on a cooperative
work effort whose results will be useful to both NASA in its space
efforts, and the company in its commercial plans.

<head><h2><center>TAP-IN Helps Start-Up Company Work Towards Commercializing
Coast Guard Technology </center> </h2>
<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>A start-up company, which produces marine jet propulsion
system for mid-   size Coast Guard ships, was looking to enter
the commercial market.
<P>
<li>The company received assistance from NASA Ames and NASA
Lewis    Research Centers and is continuing to receive technical,
manufacturing and   business assistance from CTA.
<P>
<li>The company was awarded a grant under TAP-IN's Industrial
Design Pilot   Project to aid in adapting their product for a
commercial market.
<P>
</ul>
A small start-up company was seeking advanced Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) codes to analyze improvement in propulsion efficiency
compared to marine propeller systems. They were also seeking a
wide range of design talents to critique their design and recommend
material substitutions and design improvements. The company produces
marine jet propulsion systems for mid-size Coast Guard ships.
The system is a unique design potentially scaleable to serve the
small horsepower commercial recreation market and larger Naval
Commercial vessels market. 
<P>
The company needed access to sophisticated fluid flow analytical
tools to upgrade flow analysis and impeller/diffuser design capability.
They also needed help in the identification of alternative materials
including advanced composites as substitutes for metal components
and design optimization. Finally, they required assistance in
manufacturing planning for product design for commercial markets.
<P>
CTA, the Connecticut satellite office of <b>CTC</b>, drawing on the resources
of the <b>Northeast RTTC</b>, the local Manufacturing Extension Program
(CONNSTEP), and TAP-IN,  assembled a team of experts. CFD codes
available from <b>NASA Ames</b> and <b>NASA Lewis Research Centers</b> that
met the company's needs were identified and assistance provided
in obtaining these codes for their use. The expert team continues
to provide, technical, manufacturing and business assistance,
including identifying design improvements and material alternative
for current and future product needs.  The company was selected
to participate in the TAP-In Industrial Design Pilot Program.
<P>
CTA's assistance resulted in a significant upgrade in analytical
capability due to transfer of  CFD codes from the NASA Research
Centers as well as an increased potential for the application
of a defense (Coast Guard) product for commercial markets. The
incorporation of the new technology could lead to improved product
design for increased propulsion efficiency, reduced manufacturing
cost and extended service life/reliability resulting in a more
competitive product which could in turn lead to increased sales
and revenues. Due to a more efficient design, the propulsion system
is in closer compliance with standards and reduction in pollution.

<hr></head><p>
<body>

<ul>
<li>Marshall Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center, and
Langley Research Center helped a Connecticut company in the
identification of technologies to improve sailboat hulls.
<P>
<li>A Marshall representative worked further with the company
to discuss the    company's specific requirements.
<P>
<li>The company hopes to solve its technological needs in
the near future.
<P>
</ul>
A privately owned Connecticut corporation with $1.5M annual sales
was hoping to improve their product. Their business manufactures
small composite sailboat hulls, and accessories. Products are
sold to the commercial recreation market. They were looking for
a readily available or developing plastic material and coating
that would be more effective in protecting the outside and inside
of the hull that what they were currently using.
<P>
The company worked with <b>CTC</b> in trying to identify a plastic capping
(protection) material for use with thermoforming of ABS material
in a co-extrusion process and a spray-on coating for the urethane
foam inner surface of the hull. There are multiple advantages
from incorporating NASA technology. Use of materials and coatings
technologies could result in improved durability as well as more
competitive product and increased sales. Better scratch resistance
could also lead to reduced surface maintenance and better reduction
in use of surface chemicals.
<P>
Several viable materials and coatings available on the commercial
market were identified through the circulation of a descriptive
problem statement to select NASA Laboratories.  The company's
knowledge of available solutions was greatly expanded. Helpful
responses were received from <b>Marshall Space Flight Center</b>, <b>Ames
Research Center,</b> and <b>Langley Research Center</b>. A representative
from Marshall met with the company to further discuss their requirements.
The company is in the process of following up on these leads and
will select the best solution in the near future.

<h2><center>Luncheon Series Results In Agreement</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
<ul>
<li> Due to a Midwest RTTC/NASA luncheon series, a company now has an
 agreement with NASA to evaluate NASA-developed samples of silicon carbide.<p>

<li>If the NASA process for making silicon carbide meets the company's
specifications, the RTTC will help the company pursue commercialization of
the process to make monolithic ceramics.<p>
</ul>

A luncheon series, developed by NASA's Midwest Regional Technology Transfer Center
(RTTC), NASA Lewis Research Center, and Enterprise Development Inc., is providing
Northeast Ohio companies with opportunities to work with NASA. With the RTTC's help, a
subsidiary of a Cleveland-based petroleum company is currently working with Lewis to
evaluate a Lewis-made silicon carbide ceramic.<p>

The <i>Technology Dialogue Over Lunch</i> series began in March, discussing
advanced ceramics and Lewis' process for making silicon carbide using a low-cost polymer
resin and bulk silicon. The luncheon brought several companies in to Cleveland to hear about
the Lewis technology and a complementary industrial technology. Through this exchange, the
subsidiary learned that Lewis' expertise in ceramics could be applied to its needs and became
interested in pursuing a work agreement.
<p>
Two weeks after the luncheon, the company telephoned the Midwest RTTC and asked to
have a meeting with Lewis researchers set up to further discuss the Lewis-developed process
for making silicon carbide. The company believed the ceramic might have application in
markets for at least three different products should the process meet specifications such as
surface finish and cost. The company requested some samples of the silicon carbide ceramic
to evaluate in-house and offered to share the results with Lewis.
<p>
The company visited Lewis researchers with the RTTC and discussed details of samples for
the company to evaluate. Lewis is currently in the process of making the samples. Lewis will
provide the samples, as well as information about the process parameters for input into the
company's cost model, at no charge to the company. The company will polish the samples
and evaluate the surface finish, and will in turn provide, at no charge to Lewis, test data
related to how well the samples polished. The company will also provide information about
the relative costs of the process and the estimated cost of a typical part.<p>

Without the Midwest RTTC's assistance, the company may not have considered Lewis'
expertise and technology in the field of silicon carbide for monolithic ceramics. The company
knew of Lewis research in the ceramics field, but thought it only applied to fiber reinforced
ceramics. If the Lewis process for making silicon carbide meets the company's
specifications, The RTTC will help the company pursue commercialization of the process to
make monolithic ceramics.  The company's evaluation of the Lewis samples should occur
within the next three months.<p>

The RTTC worked through the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN)
program to initiate the luncheon series with NASA and Enterprise Development Inc.<p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #4</title>
<h2><center>TAP-IN Assistance Helps Start-Up Commercialize Technology</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
<ul>
<li>The Northeast RTTC helped form a new company to commercialize a wealth of technology
        in the microelectromechanical devices (MEMS) field.<p>
<li> With RTTC assistance, the company licensed technology developed under
         ARPA and NSF funding at Cornell University.<p>
<li>The company's technology could substantially impact NASA, aerospace, and defense guidance and control systems of the future.
</ul>

With help from NASA's Northeast Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC), a new
company was formed and is now licensing 27 technologies from Cornell University. The
RTTC is helping the company through the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-
IN) program.<p>

TMS Technologies focuses on the development and manufacture of microelectromechanical
devices and systems (MEMS). With MEMS, integrated circuit fabrication techniques are
used to reduce mechanical devices to the miniature dimensions of microelectronics. The
integration of mechanical devices with electronic circuits on the same chip offers a wealth of
new product opportunities in many industries. A recent Battelle Europe study estimated the
world-wide market for micromechanical devices in 1990 to be $500 million growing to $1.8
billion in 1995 and over $8 billion by the end of the century.<p>

MEMS technology has numerous applications in commercial and defense industries. TMS
intends to grow into a successful company for developing the next generation of MEMS
applications. TMS has a proprietary technology offering superior performance and lower cost
than existing microelectromechanical technology in development or in the current
marketplace. The company seeks to apply this technology to advanced devices for the health
care, aerospace, telecommunications, and defense industries. <p>  

With Northeast RTTC support, the company recently raised over $1 million in capital from
private sources and licensed 27 patents from Cornell University. Most of the technologies
were developed under funding from the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and
National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST).<p>
 
TMS' technology has several significant advantages over existing technologies for
micromechanics, giving the company potential to become an international leader in the
commercialization of MEMS technology. TMS proprietary technology allows it to fabricate
devices in single crystal silicon with higher aspect-ratio structures, large arrays of MEMS
devices, a low processing temperature for compatibility with prefabricated microelectronics,
and an ability to fabricate nanometer scale tunneling tips. These abilities provide TMS with
an edge over other domestic and foreign companies in the MEMS field. <p>

The Northeast RTTC was one of several organizations which helped form this new venture.
The RTTC is a member of TMS board of directors and continues to help guide operational
efforts to make the company a leader in the area of MEMS technology. The company's
technology could substantially impact NASA, aerospace, and defense guidance and control
systems of the future. With RTTC help, the company is now one of 83 finalists for the
Advanced Technology Program (ATP).   <p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #5</title>
<h2><center>TAP-IN Helps Company Manufacture New Product</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
<ul>
<li>Northeast RTTC assistance is enabling a Massachusetts company to improve a
         defense technology and introduce new products into the commercial
         marketplace.<p>

<li>The company has partnered with a French company to improve existing flat
        panel displays. The partnership is expected to position the company as the
        U.S. leader in the market, which is projected to exceed $10 billion before the
         year 2000.
<p>
<li>The commencement of manufacture in the U.S. will create thousands of jobs
      in the Quincy, Massachusetts area.<p>

</ul>
The "next generation" of flat panel displays will soon be widely available due to assistance
from NASA's Northeast Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC). The RTTC, working
through the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN) program, is helping a large
Massachusetts-based company introduce the new technology into the marketplace.<p>

A new partnership between Raytheon Company of Massachusetts and Pixel International of
France is allowing the Massachusetts company to improve existing flat panel displays used
for commercial and defense purposes. The partnership could position Raytheon as the U.S.
leader in the burgeoning display market, projected to exceed $10 billion before the year
2000.<p>

"The emerging market for advanced flat panel displays is extraordinarily significant, and
Raytheon's aim, to lead in this area where no other American company has, extends our
established capabilities and market reach," commented Raytheon display product manager
Thomas Holzel. "A formal licensing agreement between Raytheon and Pixel positions
Raytheon strongly in the development and manufacture of field emission displays, a new
advance that eliminates many of the limitations of currently used leading displays. This next
generation of flat panel displays appears to be far superior to all other commercial products
available, Holzel continued.<p>

The partnership enables the technology to be used in commercial manufacture within the
U.S. at a Quincy, Massachusetts site. The new products will allow Raytheon to broaden
technologies originally developed for the military and expand commercialization to
nonmilitary markets and applications.<p>

At the beginning of the project, Raytheon approached the Northeast RTTC for assistance
developing the display market. The RTTC evaluated the company's options, analyzed leading
flat panel technologies in the U.S. and the world, and recommended the best options for
market entry and the most promising partner for acquiring and developing this new
technology. The Northeast also helped Raytheon identify new product applications and win
an Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) grant. The company maintains that this
assistance was pivotal in its decision to invest heavily with its own resources to expand
domestic commercial manufacturing.<p>

The RTTC's technology transfer and acquisition assistance prompted the manufacture of new
commercial products projected to fill a $10 million market niche by the year 2000. The
company is expected to create a significant number of jobs at the future U.S. production
facility. The new technology positions the company as a future leader in commercial flat
panel displays.<p>

<h2><center> Company Solving Problem Through TAP-IN</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
    
<ul>
<li>The Mid-Atlantic RTTC and NASA Langley Research Center are helping a
          West Virginia company solve a nagging technical problem affecting the
        development of a new defense product.<p>

<li>Upon successful testing of a Langley technology, the company will pursue a
    license of the technology.<p>

<li>Because of TAP-IN assistance, the company expects to complete development
          of a new product for the defense marketplace and eventually bring other dual-
         use technologies to market.<p>
</ul>

NASA's Mid-Atlantic Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) is helping a West
Virginia company solve a nagging technical problem affecting the development of a new
product. The RTTC is providing the almost completely defense-dependent company with
technical and commercialization assistance through the Technology Access for Product
Innovation (TAP-IN) program. <p>

Alliant Techsystems in Keyser, WV, was already a Mid-Atlantic client when the RTTC
suggested TAP-IN could help. The small defense contractor uses titanium components as
stabilizing fins in its tank cannon-launched projectile. These fins need to be coated, but the
coating Alliant currently uses is expensive, thick, and massive. The thickness affects the
reliability of the fin deployment mechanism. Alliant wanted to find a better performing and
more cost effective coating. The problem with the fins was holding up development of the
company's new defense product. <p>

The Mid-Atlantic RTTC located a technology at the NASA Langley Research Center. The
Langley technology is based on a sol-gel dip application in which micron-thick coatings of
Al2O3, SiO2, Al/SiBx, ZrO2, or Y2O3 are applied and air dried at elevated temperature.The
coatings retard oxidation in a high temperature oxidizing environment and consequently
retain the mechanical properties of the titanium, two necessary qualities for Alliant. <p>

The company and Langley signed an agreement to have the technology tested as an integral
part of the new Alliant defense product under development. Langley will coat approximately
30 fins using the sol-gel process. The fins will then be used in flight tests. If the new coating
works as anticipated, Alliant will pursue a license of the technology.<p>

With the RTTC and Langley assistance, the company expects to complete the development of
a new product for the defense marketplace. Additionally, as the company's familiarity with
the coating process is acquired, Alliant expects to find other commercial (dual-use)
applications as spin-off business opportunities. Upon completion of successful testing, the
Mid-Atlantic RTTC will help Alliant pursue a license of the Langley technology and will
continue to provide business and commercialization services.<p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #7</title>
<h2><center> TAP-IN Helps Develop New Family Of Products</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
           
<ul>
<li>The Mid-Atlantic RTTC is helping a Pennsylvania company develop a new
          family of products using defense technology from the NASA Langley Research
          Center.<p>

<li>The RTTC is helping the company negotiate a Space Act Agreement with
        Langley for joint R&D on a gas sensor.<p>

<li>Because of TAP-IN assistance, the company expects to have a new gas sensor
        ready for market by summer 1996.<p>
</ul>

Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN) is helping a Pennsylvania company
develop a new family of products using defense technology. NASA's Mid-Atlantic Regional
Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) is working with the small company to expand its
markets with the federal technology.<p>

The RTTC originally recruited the company to participate in a NASA Langley Research
Center technology showcase event. The company wanted to develop a family of laser-based
gas sensors. The sensors would be the same size and price as existing products on the
market, but would have superior operating characteristics. By using differential absorption
techniques, the sensors would allow the concentration of a gas to be determined along the
optical path between a laser transceiver and inexpensive retroreflecting material commonly
found on road signs. By strategically locating the retroreflecting material, many gas
measurement applications would be possible. Time constraints, however, for applying the
appropriate technology hindered the company from making progress on the project.<p>

The Mid-Atlantic identified researchers at Langley who could help the company and arranged
several meetings between the parties. The RTTC is now helping the company negotiate a
Space Act Agreement with Langley for joint research and development to adapt a Langley
technology to particular classes of industrial boiler stack gases. The Langley technology was
originally developed for atmospheric measurement programs.<p>

The Mid-Atlantic continues to help the company by locating lower cost system components
for its sensors. The company expects field testing of prototype sensors to be complete in
early 1996 and also anticipates that the first commercial sensors will be ready for market by
summer 1996.<p>

With RTTC assistance, the company has found technology it can use as the basis for its
product idea. The Mid-Atlantic RTTC has expedited many matters, including identifying
federal technology and NASA personnel, arranging meetings with the technical staff, and
facilitating a Space Act Agreement. Without this assistance, time constraints most likely
would have prevented the company from completing any of these activities.  <p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #8</title>
<h2><center> TAP-IN Identifies Defense Technologies For Use In Water Filter Products</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
<ul>
<li>The Mid-Atlantic RTTC is helping a Pennsylvania company apply defense
        technologies to its products and introduce a revolutionary new product.<p>

<li>The project is part of a wastewater technology initiative the RTTC has
          launched to bring federal water filtration technologies to industry for
          commercialization.<p>

<li>The water filter manufacturer is currently considering several NASA
       technologies for commercialization.<p>
</ul>

A large water filter company is applying federal technology to its products and developing a
revolutionary new filter thanks to the help of the Technology Access for Product Innovation
(TAP-IN) program. NASA's Mid-Atlantic Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) is
working with the Pennsylvania company through TAP-IN to introduce defense technologies
into its products.<p>

U.S. Filter is a large manufacturer of water filtration products. The Pittsburgh company is a
strong competitor to French and Japanese companies that are monopolizing the American
ceramic membrane water filter market. With its new type of product, however, U.S. Filter
expects to regain a substantial portion of the American market share.<p>

Although water filtration technologies developed by NASA, EPA, and other federal agencies
have been commercialized in consumer markets, there has been very little impact of federal
lab filtration technologies on industrial or municipal wastewater treatment systems. To
address this, the Mid-Atlantic is launching a wastewater technology initiative to bring the
federal technologies to industry for commercialization. As part of the initiative, the RTTC
called U.S. Filter as a member of the target industry that could use federal technology.<p>

Coincidentally, U.S. Filter had previously decided to acquire technology from outside
sources rather than conducting internal R&D. The RTTC was able to identify several
technologies of interest to the company and U.S. Filter is currently considering a number of
these for commercialization. The two leading candidates are a monolithic ceramic matrix and
an ion exchange filter. The matrix, developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
contains many small flow passages and selective permeability properties. The ion exchange
material was developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center and removes toxic heavy metals
from water. In addition to these technologies, the company is assessing technologies from the
NASA Johnson Space Center and Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<p>

The Mid-Atlantic RTTC will continue identifying relevant federal technologies for U.S.
Filter and will facilitate meetings and subsequent licensing activities. The TAP-IN assistance
enabled the company to learn of several defense technologies that can be commercialized
without the time and expense of doing its own basic (and applied) R&D.  Once these
technologies are applied, the company expects to introduce a revolutionary product and
regain some of the American water filter market. <p>

<h2><center>Texas Company Diversifies With TAP-IN Assistance</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
<ul>
<li>The Mid-Continent RTTC is helping a Texas defense contractor diversify into
        the fiberoptics market.<p>

<li>The company attributes its expected market diversification of half a million
       dollars, an expected increase in its market share of nearly 1.2 million dollars
       per year, and the creation of additional company jobs to the RTTC. <p>

<li>The Mid-Continent is now helping the company locate federal technologies to
      license and manufacture.<p>

</ul>

A Texas defense contractor is receiving assistance diversifying into commercial markets
through the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN) program. NASA's Mid-Continent 
Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) is helping the small Grand Prairie
company enter the fiberoptics market. <p>

Witter Manufacturing was entirely dependent on the defense industry and wanted to diversify
into other fields. The company identified fiberoptic cables as a potential market but needed
verification that this was feasible before beginning to transition itself. The North Texas Small
Business Development Center suggested Witter work with the Mid-Continent for help
identifying diversification options. The RTTC conducted a study of the company's current
market, as well as the fiberoptics market, and then made recommendations to Witter.<p>

Since completion of the study, Witter has taken steps to diversify. Due to the
recommendations, Witter credits the RTTC with its expected market diversification of half a
million dollars, an expected increase in market share of 0.6 to 1.2 million dollars per year,
and the creation of additional jobs (12) in the company. At a time when most defense-dependent 
companies are facing cutbacks, Witter expects a 57 percent increase in its work
force. Charles Stanley, vice president of Witter, boasts that  "we have expanded our
customer base significantly."<p>

Witter also is now interested in looking at federal technologies available for licensing.
The Mid-Continent is helping the company locate appropriate technologies and will facilitate
a license once a technology is identified. <p>

Witter's objective when it first approached the Mid-Continent was to expand into commercial
markets. The RTTC's help enabled the company to make the first moves to diversify and
also exposed the company to opportunities available with federal technologies. The Mid-Continent 
RTTC continues to help Witter in its quest for new technology to manufacture.
Without the RTTC/TAP-IN assistance, the company's diversification efforts would have
taken considerably longer.<p>

<h2><center>TAP-IN Helps Commercialize NASA Technology</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
          
<ul>
<li>TAP-IN is helping a Texas company license a NASA Johnson Space Center
    medical technology.<p>

<li>With Mid-Continent RTTC assistance, the company will commercialize the
          defense technology for civilian use.<p>

<li>The company expects to increase its business and profits by using the NASA
          technology for commercial applications.<p>
</ul>

NASA's Mid-Continent Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) is helping a Texas
medical engineering company license and commercialize a NASA defense technology. The
RTTC is working through the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN) program
to provide the company with technology opportunities. <p>

Vanguard Medical Engineering has long had an association with the Mid-Continent RTTC
through previous projects. The Mid-Continent knew the Athens company wanted to diversify
it product line by manufacturing a new technology. The RTTC identified a NASA Johnson
Space Center medical technology as a potential opportunity for Vanguard to develop a
commercial application. The Mid-Continent RTTC is helping the company pursue
commercialization of the NASA technology and the company expects to greatly increase its
business and profits.<p>

After discussing the blood separation and storing technology with the RTTC and Johnson
Space Center, Vanguard investigated potential markets and decided to pursue a license.
Johnson originally developed the technology for use in military and space applications, where
access to hospitals is either difficult or impossible.  <p>

The Johnson technology separates the cellular and acellular fractions of bodily fluids (such as
blood) for analysis. In addition to being less expensive than traditional centrifugal methods,
the Johnson method allows separated components to be stored for a longer period of time. It
also collects more of the acellular component than other filtering techniques and permits a
variety of tests to be conducted on a single sample. The technique also accommodates
simultaneous collection and testing of samples.<p>

Vanguard expects a license to be complete by March 1996. Due to the RTTC's past
association with Vanguard, the Mid-Continent was able to identify opportunities of direct
interest to the company and enabled Vanguard to react quickly. The company expects to
increase its business and profits by using the technology for commercial applications.
Without TAP-IN and the Mid-Continent RTTC, the company would not be pursuing a license
with Johnson and would most likely still be looking for new technologies to manufacture.<p>

<ul>
<li>The Mid-Continent RTTC and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center are
         helping an Arkansas company produce a marine jet impeller prototype and
          commercialize the product.<p>

<li>Marshall saved the company time and money by providing an engine prototype
          and the two have a Space Act Agreement to continue refining the engine.<p>

<li>Because of the TAP-IN assistnace, the company hopes to win a multi-million
          dollar contract with the Navy, which would allow the company to expand its
       manufacturing facilities and hire 20 to 30 additional employees.<p>
</ul>

Through the efforts of the Mid-Continent Regional Technology Transfer Center's (RTTC)
Arkansas affiliate, Arkansas Science & Technology Authority, an Arkansas company is
receiving assistance from NASA to produce a marine jet impeller engine prototype. The Mid-Continent
RTTC, as part of the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN)
program, also is helping the Benton company commercialize the end product. The company
now expects to enhance its existing product lines and enter a new market for marine jets. <p>
 
North American Marine Jet manufactured engines primarily for commercial fishing and
pleasure boats. Roughly 20 percent of the company's business, however, was defense
contracts and industry competition for those contracts was intense. The company knew it had
to improve upon its 30-year old impeller technology and requested assistance from the NASA
Marshall Space Flight Center to determine if an engine design would fulfill performance
parameters.  <p>

Using computational fluid dynamics, Marshall found that North American Marine Jet's
design did not meet the needed performance requirements. Marshall identified the weaknesses
in the design and made suggestions for improved performance. Together with the company,
Marshall designed and tested a new impeller. The impeller did meet performance
requirements and was over 30 percent more efficient than the initial design.<p>

Marshall then used stereo lithography to provide a form, fit, and function prototype from
which the company could make a mold. Not having to design a mold from paper CAD/CAM
drawings saved the company a great deal of time and money, and allowed the project to
progress very quickly. North American Marine Jet and Marshall recently signed a Space Act
Agreement to further refine the engine. Marshall and the company will jointly design and test
the intake port for the impeller. <p>

The joint project with Marshall was the company's first major departure from its 30 year
old, base technology. The Arkansas Science & Technology Authority coordinated efforts to
help Marshall work with the company and now TAP-IN, through the Mid-Continent RTTC,
is helping with commercialization aspects of the technology. The RTTC is working with the
company to provide market information and leads within the government and private sector
to enable North American Marine Jet to launch its new product lines.<p>

Because of the RTTC/NASA assistance, the company hopes to win a multi-million dollar
Navy contract later this year. If awarded the contract, the company will expand
manufacturing facilities and hire 20 to 30 new workers. Though originally skeptical about
technology transfer, the company now encourages the use of its success story to assure other
businesses that technology transfer is effective.<p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #12</title>
<h2><center>TAP-IN Helps California Medical Company Develop New Product</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>

<ul>
<li>The Far West helped a San Diego company successfully license a NASA Ames
        Research Center technology for use in its breath analysis diagnostic equipment.<p>

<li>Through Far West RTTC efforts, Ames and the company also negotiated a
          Space Act Agreement to cooperatively solve both the company and NASA
          mission problem of making spectroscopic isotope analysis more usable and
         stable in application.<p>

<li>Due to the RTTC and NASA assistance, the company expects its products to
         initiate the creation of hundreds of jobs and significant revenue.<p>
</ul>

A California start-up company expects to revolutionize the medical diagnostics industry with
the help of NASA's Far West Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC). The Far West
RTTC is assisting SpiraMed Corp. with developing, manufacturing, and marketing
non-invasive diagnostic instruments and supplies which detect disease through the analysis of
exhaled breath. SpiraMed hopes to initiate the creation of hundreds of jobs and significant
revenue with these products.<p>

SpiraMed was interested in a NASA Ames Research Center technology developed to
determine the historical existence of life on other planets. Ames, in collaboration with the
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and San Jose State University, developed a
carbon isotope analysis technique to analyze soil samples from other planets. SpiraMed
believed the technology could be used as a basis for its medical diagnostics equipment
because the analysis of carbon isotope ratios in soil and in breath can use the same
technology. However, for the technology to be feasible for both NASA and the company, an
alternative to cryogenically cooled equipment was needed.<p>

SpiraMed requested the Far West's assistance accessing and commercializing the technology.
The RTTC and SpiraMed approached SETI and San Jose with their applications for the
technology, and SpiraMed is now helping the two organizations pursue patent rights to the
technology. If successful, SpiraMed will be the exclusive licensee in the medical diagnostics
industry. SpiraMed will use the carbon isotope ratio analysis technology in breath analysis
diagnostic instruments that will save time, money and be more comfortable for the patient. <p>

The Far West and Ames have negotiated a Space Act Agreement with SpiraMed to solve
both the company and NASA mission problem of making spectroscopic isotope analysis more
usable and stable in application. The agreement allows for the development of a solid-state
technology to replace awkward cryogenic technology in both the NASA mission and medical
application. The Space Act Agreement also will involve cooperative development to model
and prototype medical equipment for the company. <p>

SpiraMed is also negotiating with several venture capital firms and medical product
manufacturers to fund the development stage of the project. The Far West RTTC continues
to assist SpiraMed by locating interested companies and agencies to assist with 
the project. <p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #13</title>
<h2><center>TAP-IN Helps California Company Diversify</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
           
<ul>
<li>The Far West RTTC is helping a California company diversify its NASA and
       defense technologies into sports products.<p>

<li>TAP-IN assistance from the RTTC and NASA Langley Research Center is
     helping the Camarillo defense subcontractor develop its first sports product, an
         epoxy composite one-piece golf club.<p>

<li>The company has formed a subsidiary to manage the sales and distribution of
          the products resulting from the RTTC/NASA collaboration.<p>
</ul>

Through the TAP-IN (Technology Access for Product Innovation) program of NASA's
Regional Technology Transfer Centers (RTTCs) and in cooperation with KPMG Peat
Marwick, the Far West RTTC is helping a defense subcontractor diversify into several
commercial markets. The California company has expertise in the fabrication of composite
material components for high technology applications.<p>

In the past, the company focused on the fabrication of one-of-a-kind, low quantity, high cost,
high precision components for military, aerospace, and space applications. Now the company
wanted to merge into mainstream commercialization with its technologies and expertise, and
asked the Far West RTTC for business assistance to expand into new markets.<p>

The Far West is helping the Camarillo company identify new product markets for its
applicable defense technologies developed under NASA and defense contracts. The first of
these projects is the development of a completely new process for manufacturing an epoxy
composite for a one piece golf club. The technology, derived from injection gas molding
systems, initially was developed by the company for the production of Sikorsky Helicopter
lightweight ballistic resistant floor panels and the structure of NASA's Space Station
Freedom.<p>

With RTTC assistance, the company negotiated a Space Act Agreement with the NASA
Langley Research Center to develop net manufacturing techniques for composite titanium
metal golf club heads. The company also is working to develop scratch resistant coatings and
advanced adhesives for polymer composities. The improved golf club is one of many
company projects to improve existing products and create a competitive strength for itself in
the sports market. The company has formed a wholly-owned subsidiary to manage the sales
and distribution of these products, and to date has successfully raised $10 million in capital
for its new subsidiary.<p>

The Far West continues to help the company diversify. The TAP-IN assistance is enabling
the company to work with Langley to apply NASA technologies to the company's sports
products, thereby improving the products while enhancing the company's effectiveness and
competitiveness.<p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #14</title>
<h2><center>Defense Tooler Diversifies Through TAP-IN</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
          

<ul>
<li>The Far West RTTC is helping a Los Angeles defense contractor diversify into
        commercial markets using its existing technology and expertise.<p>

<li>The company is now working with an Australian firm to start a U.S.-based
       joint venture company which will develop, license, and manufacture
          combustion engines for a wide range of applications in world-wide markets.<p>

<li>Thanks to the RTTC diversification assistance, the company is now looking
        forward to greater revenue, added profit, and increased employment, as well
        as long-term stability.<p>
</ul>

A small California defense contractor wanted to use its existing unique competencies to
manufacture products targeted to the commercial marketplace and with the assistance of
NASA's Far West Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC), the company is well on its
way to doing just that. The Far West RTTC is helping the company increase its revenue,
profits, employment, and stability through the Technology Access for Product Innovation
(TAP-IN) program.<p>

A considerable portion of the tooling manufacturer's business was with the aerospace and
defense industries, so the company's exposure to the fluctuations within these two industries
was significant. In the 1980s, these industries were an abundant source of income, but recent
reductions had compelled the Los Angeles company to participate in aggressive marketing
programs to capture any business in the diminishing markets. This resulted in pricing
competition, which the company found undesirable and impossible to sustain. The company
suffered severe revenue and profit declines that forced its management to make some difficult
cost reduction decisions. The company needed to transition itself into commercial markets
using its existing technology and expertise.<p>

RTTC personnel familiar with the defense industry contacted the company and began helping
identify product and market opportunities the manufacturer could pursue to become less
reliant on the defense and aerospace industries. This would offer potential new lucrative
markets for revenue-generation and reduce the risks inherent in relying upon a handful of
industries (or clients) for business.<p>

To date, the Far West has initiated several diversification projects for the company. Of most
significance, the RTTC introduced the defense contractor to an Australian combustion engine
design firm that has developed and prototyped innovative and highly efficient engines. After
an initial review of these designs, the NASA Lewis Research Center agreed to participate in
a development and testing program for completion of the design process for specific
applications of the engine. The company has signed a letter of intent with the Australian
company to start a U.S.-based joint venture company which will develop, license, and
manufacture combustion engines for a wide range of applications in world-wide markets.<p>

The company continues to work with the Far West on other product and market
opportunities. Thanks to the RTTC diversification assistance, the company is now looking
forward to greater revenue, added profit, and increased employment, as well as long-term
stability. <p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #15</title>
<h2><center>Start-Up Company Launched By TAP-IN</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
                    
<ul>
<li>The Southeast RTTC's Tennessee alliance partner is helping a start-up
          company take a revolutionary forging process to the drawing board.<p>

<li>The company has a Cooperative Research & Development Agreement with
        Lockheed Martin to further develop the technology.<p>

<li>A Big Three auto manufacturer contracted the Oak Ridge company to help
         develop next generation auto products.<p>
</ul>

The NASA Southeast Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) Tennessee alliance
partner, Tennessee Center for Research & Development (TCRD) is playing a major role in
helping two inventors take a revolutionary forging process from the drawing board to the
marketplace. Through the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN) program, the
Tennessee center is providing business development and financing assistance to help the
inventors get their start-up company off the ground. <p>

With help from TCRD, the two inventors created a business plan and launched a new
company, Forged Performance Products, Inc, which introduced a new technology into the
marketplace. The company is based on a revolutionary forging process called PIF (Pneumatic
Isostatic Forging) which heals casting defects, fabricates powder metallurgy parts, and
improves product structural characteristics. It also allows industries to create more reliable
products at lower manufacturing costs.<p>

Initially, TCRD made a risk capital loan to Forged Performance, then helped convince
Lockheed Martins Tennessee Innovation Center to loan additional funds. TCRD also
facilitated a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the company and
Lockheed to further develop the PIF technology. The technology is expected to improve the
quality and cost of future vehicles and other products including those required for the defense
industry.<p>

Perhaps most importantly, TCRD helped identify the auto industry as a potential user of the
companys product and processes. As a result, one of the Big Three auto makers is interested
in the companys technology. They contracted Forged Performance to help develop next
generation auto products from powder metallurgy using the PIF process.<p>

The Southeast RTTC and its alliance partner provided an array of business assistance
services unavailable through other sources. When the inventors approached TCRD with ideas
for a new business, TCRD identified market opportunities, strengthened the business plan,
became an investor and board member, located additional investors, and helped the company
obtain affordable business space. Forged Performance now has contract commitments that
include a major Detroit auto maker.<p>

Forged Performance plans to operate a sample test facility in 1995, have a prototype
production facility in place and expand into new market areas not now using powder
metallurgy technologies by 1996 and become profitable in 1997. The prototype production
facility is currently in the planning stage. The company credits TAP-IN assistance with
advancing it beyond the conceptual phase into a functioning entity. In the future, Forged
Performance is expected to create new jobs in the East Tennessee region and help to create
better-made automobiles.<p>

<title>TAP-IN Success Story #16</title>
<h2><center>TAP-IN Helps Defense Contractor Maintain Market</center></h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
         
<ul>
<li>The Southeast RTTC and its Mississippi affiliate are helping a defense
          contractor  maintain its market by meeting new environmental regulations.<p>

<li>The RTTC's affiliate network is working with the Mississippi company to
          develop a new plastic that will rapidly degrade in salt water.<p>

<li>The plastic is about to be tested by the Army Natick Research, Development,
         and Engineering Center and is expected to exceed all regulations.<p>
</ul>

A Mississippi company was in danger of losing a sizeable portion of its defense market until
it approached the NASA Southeast Regional Technology Transfer Center (RTTC) and its
Mississippi affiliate, University of Southern Mississippi. The university's Mississippi
Polymer Institute is helping the company develop and test a new plastic to meet new
environmental regulations. The RTTC and affiliate are helping the defense contractor through
the Technology Access for Product Innovation (TAP-IN) program.<p>

The company manufactures plastic utensils for the Navy. New environmental regulations,
however, required that the company make the plasticware biodegradable for disposal at sea.
The company turned to the Southeast RTTC network for assistance maintaining its major
market for plastic utensils while complying with the environmental regulations.<p>

The RTTC and the University of Southern Mississippi determined that the university's
Mississippi Polymer Institute possessed, in raw form, intellectual property regarding
biodegradable plastics that could help the company. The Institute began work to apply the
technology to the company's plasticware. The Southeast RTTC and its affiliate located the
applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the development and use of biodegradable
plastics. They then approached the Army Natick Research, Development, and Engineering
Center about testing the new compound to verify that its properties would meet all of the
Navy's requirements. A proposal was drafted and sent to the lab. Pending the resolution of
intellectual property issues, the testing is anticipated to occur in the near future. 
The newly-developed plastic is expected to meet or exceed all regulations, allowing the
company to maintain a major market for its plastic utensils while complying with the
increasing demand for environmental regulations. The newly-developed plastic degrades
rapidly in salt water and helps meet all of the company's goals to date. Without the
RTTC/TAP-IN assistance, the company would still be looking for a solution to its plastic
degradability problem and would still be in danger of losing a sizeable portion of its defense
market. Upon successful testing, the company can look forward to an expansion it in its
products.<p>

<img src=sbir.gif align=left  vspace=10 border=0 ><br><h1> <CENTER>About the SBIR National Conferences<p></center></h1><p></head>
<body>
<center><IMG SRC="/flc/rainbow.gif"></center><p>

The SBIR Program funds firms with 500 or fewer employees to perform
cutting-edge R&amp;D that addresses the nation's most critical
scientific and engineering needs. Spanning the technology spectrum
-- from aviation and agriculture to medicine and manufacturing
-- the Program has awarded more than $6 billion since its inception
in 1983, with annual budgets now approaching $1 billion. The SBIR
program funds high-risk projects at the earliest stages of development
-- before companies can attract venture capital. Terms are extremely
favorable, and the industry partner keeps the commercial rights
to any resulting patents.
<P>
The National SBIR Conferences are designed to help you learn how
your company can tap into this tremendous resource. In one place,
at one time, you'll meet the Program Managers from every SBIR-sponsoring
agency and department, and the Small Business Administration.
<P>
Participating federal agencies and departments include:
<UL>
<LI>Department of Agriculture
<LI>Department of Commerce/NOAA/NIST
<LI>Department of Defense:
<UL>
<LI>Air Force
<LI>Army
<LI>Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
<LI>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
<LI>Defense Special Weapons Agency
<LI>Navy
<LI>Special Operations Command
</UL>

<LI>Department of Education
<LI>Department of Energy
<LI>Department of Health &amp; Human Services:
<UL>
<LI>NIH, HCFA, ACF, AOA
</UL>

<LI>Department of Transportation
<LI>Environmental Protection Agency
<LI>National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration
<LI>National Science Foundation
<LI>Small Business Administration
</UL>

<P>
In one-on-one sessions, SBIR managers, procurement specialists,
and large company representatives will meet with you to discuss
opportunities for funding, subcontracting, and partnering. Bring
information about your company to share with potential partners
during the one-on-ones.
<P>
Networking reception and meals offer the opportunity to talk to
SBIR award winners who have turned innovative ideas into profitable
products, and larger firms who are looking for strategic partners.
<P>
Daily seminars conducted by nationally-known experts will provide
a wealth of practical advice on preparing winning proposals, meeting
government accounting requirements, protecting intellectual property,
raising capital, building a management team, marketing high-tech
products, and more.
<P>
You could spend countless time and money tracking down the information
and contacts you'll get in just 3 value-packed days at the National
SBIR Conference.<p>

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A safety analysis was performed to assess the relative hazard of compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled vehicles traveling on various tunnels and bridges in New York City.  The study considered those hazards arising from the release of fuel from CNG vehicles
ranging in size from a passenger sedan to a full size 53 passenger bus.  The approach used was to compare the fuel hazard of CNG vehicles to the fuel hazard of gasoline vehicles.  The risk was assessed by estimating the frequency of occurence and the sev
erity of the hazard.  The methodology was a combination of analyzing accident data, performing a diffusion analysis of the gas released in the tunnel, and determining the consequences of ignition.  The study concluded that the overall hazard of CNG vehicl
es transiting a ventilated tunnel is less than the hazard from a comparable gasoline fueled vehicle.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Lead/Acid batteries are available in varoius types, and for electric vehicles it is vital to select the correct technology for each application.  The full range of types will be described, including new designs capable of very high levels of power.  For l
arger vehicles, particularly buses and trucks, tubular-plate lead/acid batteries are preferred. These offer an excellent cycle life and good energy density.  They may be adapted to reduce maintenance to very low levels through special charging systems and
battery construction.  Tubular-plate batteries using gel technology are maintenance-free and are well adapted to applications where opportunity charging is available.  For smaller utility vehicles flooded or sealed lead/acid gel technology batteries are
preferred.  Smaller urban vehicles require sealed lead/acid batteries with high power densities.  This is best provided by flat pasted-plate designs, using absorptive glass mat separators.  For hybrid vehicles, the duty cycle requires a moderate capacity
but high levels of power to provide good acceleration.  Sealed lead/acid batteries using pure lead plates offer enhanced high rate capability and have been developed to provide good cyclability.  Battery selection is, however, only one aspect of providing
the power source for an electric vehicle drive train.  The battery needs to be considered as a power module, with systems for charging, monitoring and control, thermal management and fault detection all integrated into the battery pack.  This systems eng
ineering approach will be described and reference made to examples where it has been put into practice.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This thesis was undertaken to determine the effect of operating dual fuel engines with gaseous fuels under cold temperature conditions.  The experimental work reported relates to a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine, where gaseous fuel was mix
ed with the intake air just outside the engine cylinder.  The engine was operated warm but with variable intake temperature conditions.  Combustion, engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics were examined for operation with methane, propane,
ethylene and hydrogen as main fuels.  The results show in general, the feasibility of employing a dual fuel engine to use natural gas either as LNG or under cold wintry conditions.  As well, dual fuel operation appears to reduce emissions of exhaust smok
e and oxides of nitrogen in comparison with the diesel engine

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A new concept of semicryogenic tank for storage and supply of natural gas into the cylinders of an internal combustion engine is presented.  It allows the gas to be pressurized before injection and uses the heat entering the tank as the means to evaporate
the natural gas introduced in a liquid phase to the tank.  To limit the heat transfer to the tank and the gas pressure increase, the semicryogenic tank has to be well insulated.  However, it has to be also preheated to accelerate the gas pressure increas
e, as required.  To maintain the right pressure and temperature of natural gas an electronic control of the semicryogenic tank is needed.  The gas preheating system uses the waste heat of engine exhaust gases, and therfore, contributes to the increase of
the thermal efficiency of the engine through the injection of hot natural gas.  Practical information fo manufacturing of the semicryogenic tank, based on the use of regula standardized cylinders for CNG, is given.  (Author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The particulate emissions of a normally aspirated Caterpillar 3208 diesel engine have been determined for operation on dual fuel (diesel/natural gas) using steady state test procedures.  These results have been compared to diesel only operation.  For peak
loads the particulate emissions are considerably decreased on dual fuel (up to 90% reduction).  At light loads the particulate emissions are comparable on either fuel.  The particulate emissions show a strong dependence on the mass flow rate of diesel fu
el used in the combustion process.  (Author Abstract) NOTE:  A longer version of this paper is available in citation 1202

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

We are accustomed to thinking that gasoline and diesel oil are the only practical transportation fuels.  However, rapid price increases for petroleum products and our dependence on foreign supplies have stimulated the development of domestically produced
alternatives Propane (sometimes referred to as Liquefied Petroleum Gas or LPG) was the first alternative fuel to be widely accepted as a gasoline or diesel oil substitute.  It is clean burning, widely available and safe However, there are other possible a
lternatives and today natural gas is on the threshold of widespread and lasting use in Canadian transportation Natural gas is not a new transportation fuel.  Other countries have pioneered its use in transportation and have compiled an impressive record o
f technological development and safety.  In those countries where stations are being established, natural gas presents an interesting and inexpensive fuel option Natural gas, like propane, represents a good alternative to gasoline and offers many of the s
ame advantages

Numerical Analyses results are presented for 20.0MPa, 444K, natural gas injection into 4.0MPa cylinder air where the ambient turbulence fiel is representative of diesel engines.  Two observations;  first, th seemingly reasonable spatially uniform velocity
profile currently used a the injector exit is not appropriate, second, a spatially uniform, injecto exit, temperature profile results in local temperature overestimates a large as 300K.  Considering the strong role of temperature on chemica kinetics, thi
s second observation may have profound implications o the validity of conclusions reached using uniform exit profiles. (fro Authors' abstract

This report presents the results of a continuing program funded and managed by the Gas Research Institute to investigate microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) in the natural gas industry.  The program consists of four phases. In Phase I, the object
ive was to develop methods of defining MIC and to test assumptions about MIC which were the basis for operating protocols.  The Phase II objective was to determine whether existing methods of controlling internal sidestream test devices were developed for
use by gas industry personnel.  Phase III studies are examining external corrosion and investigating mechanisms in more detail.  Phase IV will focus on the development of new detection, prevention and mitigation strategies.  (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

After 14 years of testing my own electric/hybrid design and extensive studies of more than 50 hybrid systems used in the two hybrid challenge programs, apparently the parallel hybrid can double the fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine used a
lone.  The series hybrid is abandoned for this paper as it appears that the maximum MPG achieved was 40.Accomplishments of Ballard Technology's PEM Fuel Cell I believe signals the end of the IC engine early in the 21st century.  This paper presents a ne
ar term solution to the inefficient IC engine and will approach or exceed the 80 MPG goal of the supercar program.  Ultra-lite construction, quick charge batteries and high tech electronics, integrated and matched to achieve maximum efficiency.This pape
r also explores new power sources that will make a total electric drive system possible early in the 21st century.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The effects of engine operating parameters on the speciated engine-out hydrocarbon emissions from a natural gas fueled spark ignition 16 valve four-cylinder were examined.  Total hydrocarbon emissions were dominated by methane, the main component of natur
al gas.  The non-methane hydrocarbons consisted primarily of ethane, ethene, and acetylene.  Except for changes in the fuel-air equivalence ratio rich of the stoichiometric condition, emissions of unsaturaed species were found to be less sensitive to engi
ne operating parameters than were the fuel components.  A single species, ethene, dominated the engine-out hydrocarbon reactivity, accounting for over 80% of the NMHC reactivity.(from Author's abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This bulletin addresses three factors which can contribute to loss of power in an engine converted to CNG.  These include fuel related factors, engine related factors, and CNG conversion system related factors Due to the differences in combustion characte
ristics of CNG and gasoline, and because a proportion of the normally aspirated air is replaced by CNG in a converted system, there will be an unavoidable power difference o about 10%.  Most vehicles can be expected to show a difference in ful throttle po
wer of between 10-20% depending on design.  These results ar based on the assumption that the engine is in good condition and performin well

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This is a final report on work undertaken in phase one of a longer program aimed at the exploration of a new approach to the reversible storage of hydrogen in solid hydrides in order to improve the performance and cost of stationary and/or mobile hydrogen
storage systems. The major features of this approach to the study of hydrogen storage in solid hydrides involved the use of an electrochemical cell technique employing carefully chosen molten salt electrolytes that transport hydrogen to and from the soli
d hydrides. By avoiding the use of aqueous constituents, and using molten salts that have very low oxygen activities, one can avoid the common surface poisoning and concomitant loss of capacity and deteriorating kinetics generally found in other investiga
tions.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Solutions to today's energy problems are closely related to the use of alternative fuels, particularly natural gas, in internal combustion engines (ICEs).  These gas-fueled engines have very stringent oil requirements because of specific conditions that e
xist with these engines.  These conditions are: a high compression ratio, increased combustion temperature, elevated levels of NOx, and sensitivity to ash deposits in the combustion chamber.  The oil for ICEs therefore must have: high antioxidant properti
es, similar detergency levels to diesel oils in API class CB, CC or CD, good resistance to nitrogen oxides, minimum sulfated ash, and low sintering tendency, corrosiveness and abrasiveness of the ash oil.  There is some evidence to suggest that gas-fueled
automotive engines that are not supercharged will not need special oil.  Many of the oil requirements related to the need for serviceability of ignition plugs can be eliminated for dual fuel engines

A compression ignition engine was operated on a fuel principle inducting two commercial fuels and four pure hydrocarbon fuels in turn through intake manifold along with air and injecting diesel fuel to initiate the combustion in the conventional manner.
The engine was operated at different loads and at each load the quantity of inducted fuel was increased gradually till knocking set in.  The engine performance and exhaust pollutant emissions were recorded at different operating conditions.  It was observ
ed that the extent of induction and the effect on the performance depends on the properties of the inducted fuel.  With the dual fuel operation, the thermal efficiency at part loads was observed to be less compared to neat diesel operation.  The thermal e
fficiency reduced with the increase in the quantity of inducted fuel

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Investigations have been made into control of knock in spark-ignited dedicated gas engines.  Knock is a limiting factor determining the realizable rating of a spark ignited engine, and constraining the selection of fueling and ignition characteristics for
optimum efficiency and emissions.  The knock phenomenon was studied using four multi-cylinder engines widely used in heavy transport applications, and adapted to high compression spark ignition with natural gas fueling.  Appropriate knock control strateg
ies were developed and refined to accommodate the demands of field application in multi-cylinder engines.  A knock control unit is operative for particular engines on which it has been characterized.  Continuing development will include use of adaptive co

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report provides a review of the state of the art and projected development of adiabatic engines.  The term adiabatic means no heat transfer to or from a system and, in the context of an internal combustion engine, refers to insulation of the combusti
on chamber and other parts of the engine to reduce heat loss to the cooling system and environment.  However, the term adiabatic has come to connote other advanced engine developments occuring in conjunction with the development  of low heat rejection eng
ines (LHRE), such as exhaust energy recovery.  LHREs can be designed in a variety of ways, one of which uses ceramic coatings or ceramic parts to cut down on heat transfer and withstand the much higher temperatures which exist in LHREs.  There has been a
great deal of development over the last 12 years in the U.S., Europe, and Japan to develop this technology and measure the performance benefits.  (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

TransCanada experienced five ruptures and one leak as a result of stress corrosion cracking between 1985 and 1992. Four of the five rupture occurred on tape coated sections, located in remote Northern Ontario. The fifth rupture occurred on an asphalt coat
ed section located between Montreal an Toronto. The cracks were found to be non-classical. Classic SCC occurs at locations where pH is high (about 10), cracks develop rapidly with increasing temperature and the cracks are intergranular and branching. In c
ontrast, the non-classical form of SCC found in Canada is characterized by low pH electrolytes, lack of temperature dependency and wide open transgranular cracks. They also seem to occur when cathodic protection is weak or absent. Both forms occur when th
e coating is separated from the pipe. A leak or rupture occurs as a result of the interlinking of numerous small cracks. Shallow cracks (less than 5% of wall thickness) do not currently pose a threat to the system. Surveys can be carried and hydrostatic t
ests carried out but SCC are small and inaccessible  many may exist and remain undetected. The recommendations include more frequen hydrostatic testing, carry out more extensive testing of thick walled pipe, continue development of its SCC model and risk
analysis approach and urges continued research into the nature of SCC, its detection and its repair

This workshop was conceived and developed to address an issue that has evolved into an important area of endeavor in the research and development of automotive engines and fuels.  It considered the question of how future light, medium and heavy duty vehic
les will be optimized for using natural gas.  Workshop organizers felt that this question should be answered now, in order that research agendas can be established and programs can be developed to address the agendas For the most part only abstracts of pr
esentations are included

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Chrysler Corporation teamed up with Norvik Traction in Jan. 1993 to develop the concepts of "Smart Charging" for Electric Vehicles (EVs).  This resulted in creation of the Battery Energy Management System (BEMS).  BEMS utilizes the MINITCHARGER (TM) ultra
fast battery technique introduced by Norvik in 1988.  The technology of the MINITCHARGER has been expanded to the monitoring and the control of the entire battery charge/discharge cycle, including fast and overnight charging, vehicle operation and standb
y.  BEMS allows for precision monitoring of the individual battery modules, prevention of abuse from excessive overcharge or overdischarging, on-board based battery maintenance.  In addition, an accurate "fuel gauge" is a byproduct of this method of manag
ing the battery charge.  By Dec. 1993, the first BEMS prototypes were tested in the lab, and road tested in a Chrysler TEVan.  This paper reports the current progress, experimental results and the directions pursued in the on-going technology development
program.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Ontario Bus Industries, and its U.S. subsidiary, Bus Industries of America are major manufacturers (ORION) of transit buses in North America.  In this paper, the readiness of the manufacturer to deal with the stringent emissions standards being set for 19
91 (in the U.S.) is discussed.  To date, an engine which is capable of meeting the particulate heavy duty diesel standard is not available.  A number of options currently available to manufacturers to 'get around' the 1991 guidelines are identified.  The
potential use of the alternative fuels methanol and CNG, is discussed briefly

One of the major problems involving operation of a dual-fuel engine is poor fuel economy at partial load operation with constant air supply.  This paper discusses this problem and how it can be corrected -- in particular using governor control and throttl
ing the air in proportion to the governor arm position

These six papers presented at the symposium deal with research into using a wide range of fuels to operate engines.  In all cases in these early (1960's) tests, the results were only partially successful.  In most cases it was felt with further modificati
ons or new developments in equipment there was a very real future for the concept of a multifuel engine

The performance of lean-burn stationary engines fueled by natural gas has been investigated.  Relationships have been established between design parameters and process conditions on the one hand and power capacity, specific fuel consumption and emissions
on the other.  The paper shows that limitations for the NOx emissions restrict the developments in cylinder load and shaft efficiency.  Opportunities exist for decreasing the CO and HC emissions.  (author abstrac

This paper will display the results of the Durability perfromance test of dual-bed converters designed for light and medium duty natural gas vehicle applications.  The test is performed by the Southwest Research Institute.  This research compared the conv
erters using Palladium-only rear bricks to the dual brick Platinum/Rhodium converters.  Both converters were aged 600 hours, simulating approximately 100,000 or more vehicle miles, in order to meet the requirement for the Chrysler's California Air Resourc
es Board (CARB) certification of the natural gas van.  The air/fuel ratio window for effective simultaneous conversion of THC, CO, and NOx, was observed to be more narrow for CNG-fueled engines than for gasoline-fueled engines, thus the CNGvehicles requir
ed more accurate AF ratio control than for the gasoline vehicles.  Converters with highly loaded Pd-only rear bricks exhibited the highest overall engine and vehicle conversion efficiencies.  With six of eight converters, full-size van tailpipe emissions
appeared to meet CARB 50K ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) standard.  Mini-van tailpipe emissions easily met CARB 120K ULEV standard. with all 600-hour aged converters.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

There has been some speculation that the use of natural gas in diesel engines in dual fuel configuration can dramatically reduce the particulate emissions, since only a fraction of the normal diesel amount is burned.  To investigate this claim particulate
emissions were determined for a Caterpillar 3208 diesel engine operating on both diesel and dual fuel using steady state particulate tests.  Exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold was mixed with clean air in a mini-dilution tunnel, cooled, and then filter
ed through ultrafine filters which are weighed before and after the test.  Measurements were conducted for engine speeds of 1400, 1800, 2400, 2600 and 2800 rpm with loads of 40, 50, 80 and 100% maximum for both diesel and dual fuel operation.  At maximum
load operation dual fuel particulates were always less (up to 85% less) than diesel emissions.  For part load operation dual fuel particulates were either less than or equal to diesel NOTE:  A shorter version of this paper was published as ASME Paper 88-I

The desirability of methane, either in the form of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), as a fuel for spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines in vehicles was studied by considering the attributes and disadvantages of methan
e as a vehicle fuel, the availability of engines designed for methane operation, the cost of engine conversion systems, on-vehicle fuel storage systems, environmental effects, vehicle performance, safety, economics, fueling facilities, and US supplies of
methane

Seven natural gas conversion kits have been tested on three vehicles, a Ford F-250 truck, a Chevrolet 5-10 truck and a Dodge 600 passenger car.  Power, fuel consumption and air fuel ratio were measured as functions of speed and load.  The conversion kits
all produced approximately 20% less power than the unconverted vehicle operating on gasoline.  The differences in power and fuel consumption between kits were most pronounced in the Ford, the test vehicle with the largest engine

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Discussed are the future possibilities of L.P.G. gas as an automotive fuel in comparison to the use of L.P.G. for chemical feedstock and under burner fuel.  Further on the safety records of L.P.G. so far are mentioned.  In more detail will be reported abo
ut the behaviour of L.P.G. fuelled vehicles in crashes Also crashes of vehicles against L.P.G. fuelled city buses will be discussed.  These are results of a crash program carried out by TNO in order of Sonatrach Algeria, on the new full scale crash facili
ty at TNO in Delft.  Further on the behaviour of automotive L.P.G. tanks in fire will be reported The final conclusion which will be stated is that L.P.G. fuelled vehicles are safer than petrol fuelled vehicles in crash.  The safety of L.P.G. fuelled vehi
cles in fire seems to be acceptable when a safety relief valve is installed

A Dodge Omni electric car was prepared for competition in an electric "stock car" 2-hour endurance event, utilizing a series-wound, direct-current 21-hp electric motor controlled by an SCR frequency and pulse width modulator.  Two types of lead-acid batte
ries were evaluated and the final configuration was a set of 16 (6-volt each) deep-cycle units.  Based on test data, a strategy was developed for the event to allow 2 hours of continuous operation, while maximizing distance traveled.  This resulted in a p
lan of 90 amperes at approximately 30mph.  Possible improvements are suggested.  Paper no. 911684 in "Alternative Fuels in the Nineties"  (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Among the alternatives to the present engine fuels of gasoline and diesel, the gaseous fuels LPG and methane represent good performance engine fuel although some disadvantages have surfaced eg., heavy and bulky fuel tanks.  In Europe LPG is usually employ
ed in a dual-fuel mode although this method does not utilize all the advantages of LPG.  An optimized engine-vehicle concept is discussed which promises better performance.  There are very few methane powered vehicles in Europe.  Examples were drawn from
prototype vehicles in Europe and from test fleets in other countries.  The future for gaseous fuels will depend on the market situation in various countries.  The engine manufacturers require obligatory specifications for the fuel quality.  Based on our o
wn experience with test vehicles and fleets Volkswagen is ready for the production development of gaseous vehicles provided there is sufficient market demand.  (From author abstract

This paper will discuss the general aspect of the safety issues of electric vehicles.  Crashworthiness, Structural Integrity, and Electrical safety are some of the safety issues that are outlined in this paper.  After a review and public comment period in
1992-1993, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has determined that EVs should be required to meet essentially the same standards as IC vehicles, and therefore should provide at least comparable levels of occupant protection.  This pape
r will also discuss the details on the safety certification for EVs in terms of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA) mandated that alternative fuel demonstration projects be conducted on light-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, and transit buses across the country.  The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Alternative Fuels
has given the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) project management responsibility for these demonstration projects.  This paper will present the results of data collection efforts for the light-duty vehicles, including information on fuel econo
my, maintenance, and emissions.

Passenger cars are a major source of air pollutants in Sweden.  This thesis presents a study concerning the utilization of a fuel which would reduce this disadvantage.  Implications of choice of fuel on environmental are discussed.  The work presents a st
udy using decomposed methanol, i.e. hydrogen and carbon monoxide, as a fuel for spark ignition engines.  Engine performance and exhaust emissions data were studied.  Alcohol vehicles are not easily started at low ambient temperatures.  A cold starting met
hod for neat methanol engines was also studied.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Two perspective alternative fuels implementation scenarios were created to quantify the potentiol range of compressed natural gas use in fleet vehicles.  The scenarios are based principally on the clean-fuel fleet vehicle provisions contained in the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, the California Low Emissions Vehicle Regulations, and the assumed future capability of compressed natural gas to meet various levels of tailpipe emission standards.  The potential for using compressed natural gas in fleet vehi
cle applications varies significantly between the scenarios primarily due to assumptions about differences in affected vehicle classes, timing of the reguelations and emissions levels.By 2010, the potential for compressed natural gas vehicle use ranges
from less than 840 thousand to 1.3 million fleet vehicles of all types with corresponding ga sdemand reanging from 140 to 200 billion cubic feet per year.  Although the distribution by vehicle typ varies between the two scenarios, each of the affected veh
icle types contributes to the overall potential.  As a result of very stringent emission regulations adopted by California, between 30 and 40 percent of the annual natural gas demand would be in that state.  Furthermore, 40 to 53 percent of all new compre
ssed natural gas fleet automobile and truck sales would be in California

Experimental and modelling techniques were used to investigate the effects of swirl on combustion when the inducted kinetic energy is held constant.  An improved turbulence intensity model that includes the effects of wall shear due to swirl has been deve
loped and compared with measured burn rate data.  A model that accounts for flame stretching due to swirl was developed and validated with measured burn rate data.  Based on the data obtained, the two models appear to have the proper qualitative behavior
to changes in swirl velocities for predicting the turbulence level and flame area increase near TDC during the combustion process

NGV Reports, 2(4):4, 198       The United States Postal Service (USPS) plans to convert 78 vehicles and install a fueling station at its Reno, Nevada location.  The equipment supplier will convert 12 of the 78 vehicles, perform operating and performance t
ests on them, and train Postal Service mechanics 3.    "U.S. Postal Service Saves Money with NGV's", NGV Reports, II(6):1-2, 198       This brief report on the USPS's NGV test program finds that although some operating problems have been encountered, most
have been eliminated through changing operating practices or by replacing faulty equipment 4.    "U.S. Postal Service Tests NGV's in Rockford", Advanced Vehicle News, 14(3):10, 198       The Rockford (Ill.) Post Office is converting 140 of its fleet vehi

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A fully electronic dual fuel natural gas/diesel conversion system has been developed for the Caterpillar 3406 diesel engine with PEEC electronic engine control.  This system is microprocessor based, and interfaces with the Caterpillar PEEC system to allow
control of diesel injection timing as well as fuel quantity.  Control of injection timing allows pilot fuel levels as low as 3% at full load, however, to ensure good transient response, minimum pilot level is about 10%.  The completed system has similar
performance to the diesel engine, with comparable efficiency at full load.  Furthermore, the engine's governing characteristics are similar on dual fuel or diesel only operation.  Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon exhaust emissions are higher than on diesel
, particularly at light load, while oxides of nitrogen emissions are lower.  (author abstract

CNG has been used as a vehicle fuel in Italy since the Thirties.  This use increased during WWII, and survived the boom years.  In the Seventies a series of energy crises gave this sector of the NG market a new boost, and there are currently some 250,000
CNG vehicles fuelled by a network of around 230 service stations.  Mainly because of the inadequacy of the refuelling infrastructure, all these vehicles have to run on two kinds of fuel, NG and petrol.  Following rapid improvements in transformation techn
ology beginning in the thirties, further progress on the next stage continued until the seventies At that time, transformation components had reached a level which seemed to rule out further significant progress, but the advent of microprocessors and cont
inual investment in research led to the introduction of a new generation of highly sophisticated components.  Atmospheric pollution problems are now stimulating the conversion of urban buses and small fleets of service vehicles (From author's paper)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Based on a thorough review of background information on the performance of materials in condensing gas-fired heat exchangers and similar corrosive environments, candidate materials were examined on test equipment built to provide the varying corrosive con
ditions encountered in actual gas-fired condensing system heat exchangers. The 32 different materials tested in a one month screening test included: mild, low alloy, galvanized, solder coated steel, porcelain, epoxy, teflon and nylon coated and alonized m
ild steel; austenitic, ferritic, low interstitial Ti stabilized ferritic, and high alloy stainless steels; aluminium alloys, anodized and porcellain coated aluminium; copper and cupronickel alloys, solder coated copper; and titanium. In these tests, titan
ium, most stainless steels, and except at coating imperfections, porcelain and plastic coated mild steel performed well from a general corrosion rate and pit depth point of view. The most promising of these materials, including some coupons incorporating
welds, sharp bends and crevices, were then tested for periods up to six month ro evaluate the effects of these design features and to determine how corrosion characteristics change with time. All candidate materials including several plastics were also te
sted with similar results on a cyclic immersion apparatus with condensate maintained at 105_F.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

With the strong national interest in environmental problems, this study was initiated to examine the important underpinnings, or first principles, of vehicular emission formation using gaseous fuels, in particular natural gas.  This is accomplished throug
h the use of both combustion analysis and test data.  The study also outlines in simple terms the engineering and design steps necessary to achieve emission minimization, while simultaneously allowing good drivability in natural gas engines.  Achievement
of the potential emission benefits involves fueling the engine by methods which exploit the special properties of natural gas as a fuel, rather than by merely substituting natural gas fuel for other liquid fuels, as has been the practice heretofore.  The
results of this study indicate what can be expected.  (From author executive summary

A natural gas powered van that meets California's ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) requirements is available from an OEM.  It has a 300km range.  Th disappearance of cost barriers and the growth of the NGV market is presented An independent demonstration
of a similar van with an electric system tha gave a range of 240km highlights a discussion of the limits to batteries fo electric vehicles.  A super-capacitor may allow systems to achieve highe energy densities.  An aluminum-air system that is being comm
ercialized fo telecommunications could lea to a system cost  reduction that could allo zinc-air to be considered for vehicle use.  Unless carefully implemente alternative fuel systems do not always yield emissions improvements and th prospect for emission
s improvement of gasoline vehicles is identified The relative costs of infrastructure, vehicle and fuel for the alternativ fuels and gasoline underlie the difficulty the alternatives have in takin market share from gasoline.  For the next decade selection
s are set thoug revision of R & D objectives would be timely. (Author's abstract

This paper was presented at the Continental Conference on Natural Gas Vehicles at Norman, OK on June 4-6, 1991.  The unavailability of natural gas vehicle (NGV) refueling stations constitutes one of the major barriers to the wide spread utilization of nat
ural gas in the transportation market.  The purpose of this paper is to review and evaluate the current technical and economic status of compressed natural gas vehicle refueling stations and to identify the components or design features that offer the gre
atest potential for performance improvements and/or cost reductions.  Both fast-fill and slow-fill type refueling systems will be discussed.  (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This study applies a model of a motor vehicle stock turnover to estimate the effect of strengthened fuel enonomy standards on gasoline consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and hydrocarbon gas emissions by light-duty vehicles in the United States. Without
significant policy change, fuel consumption is projected to grow from a 1990 level of 6.3 million barrels per day (Mbd) to 9 Mbd by 2010. Five policy driven scenarios are analyzed, ranging up to a new vehicle fuel economy improvement rate of 6 % per year
. For the 6 % scenario, the analysis projects gasoline savings of 2.9 Mbd and emissions reductions of 147 million metric tons per year (carbon equivalent) of green house gases and 495 000 metric tons per year of evaporative hydrocarbons by 2010. The sensi
tivity of the projections to various factors is also examined. The most critical assumption is the baseline (i.e. the extent of fuel economy change in the absence of stronger  rebound, credits toward regulatory compliance, rollbacks of standards, upper an
d lower bounds on a percentage increase standard, possible vehicle market shifts and fuel economy shortfall, were on a percentage increase standard possible vehicle market shifts and fuel economy shortfall, were found to have smaller effects. Fuel economy
standards are projected to be reliable mechanism for controlling future gasoline consumption and associated pollution emissions in the United States. (Author)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In order to estimate power density of traction batteries, in connection with electric vehicles, the typical demands for the drive have to be specified.  If the demand cannot be fulfilled the battery will be overloaded. To make the power demand transparent
, a practical equivalent circuit diagram for traction batteries will be used.  Present batteries applied in vehicles are described with their characteristic curves.  To compare the battery data the batteries are converted into standard values: a nominal v
oltage Vn=100 V and a nominal capacity Qn=100 Ah.  Some figures show the voltage Vn and the internal resistance of the batteries.  The maximum power to be delivered is defined at a consideration of an energy content of 10 kWh and different discharge rates
.  A specific power density is calculated of a discharge rate of 50 %.  Further, three types of testbenches for electric vehicles are introduced: one for lifetime duration tests of complete battery systems, one for tests of single cells and modules and on
e for tests with pulsed current.  Finally measurements on NiCd and lead-acid batteries on the testbenches at the institute are presented.

Because the operating costs of LNG ships are appreciably lower than depreciation costs of the initial investment, it is important for any shipowner or gas distributor contemplating such an investment to make a careful examination of the various techniques
available for building LNG storage tanks and ocean transports.  Among the factors to be considered ar how well they will adapt to future traffic and operating conditions over a period of at least 20 years, safety and operating costs.  The design of self-
supported spherical tank ships developed by Technigaz is discussed

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Along with other alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs), electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining attention as a means of solving many of the problems created by our current dependence on gasoline-powered vehicles. EVs offer a number of benefits, as do the other AFV
technologies, but face critical market barriers. Successful EV development and commercialization will require the combined efforts of a number of players - politicians, analysts, and business and industry leaders - working to overcome those barriers. Whi
le many partnerships are emerging across the United States, coordination among national, high-level policy makers is necessary to fill a leadership gap. This coordination will help facilitate the timely market introduction of EVs, and the achievement of t
he benefits they offer. This report has been prepared to serve as a reference document that summarizes the state of the art of EV technology, explains the benefits of EVs over conventional vehicles, identifies key players and organizations involved in
commercializing EVs, and describes the issues and barriers related to EV commercialization.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Results of research conducted by the University of British Columbia, Mechanical Engineering Department, on a Caterpillar Model 3304 diesel engine, are reported.  A study of the operating characteristics of a diesel engine run on CNG indicates that unstabl
e operation and misfiring occur when either the diesel injection rate or the natural gas concentration is to low.  Also determined during the tests were efficiency and emission levels at various engine speeds and loads.  Studies on other diesel engines ar
e recommended to gain further insights into the combustion processes of dual fuel diesel/CNG engines

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The total number of vehicles fuelled with compressed natural gas, CNG, is relatively very small in comparison to gasoline fuelled vehicles.  Accordingly, because of the lack of statistics of accidents involving CNG fuelled vehicles, their safety aspects a
re evaluated in comparison to automobiles fuelled with gasoline or some other alternative fuels such as propane, hydrogen, LNG or LH2.  It is suggested that methane, CNG, has some excellent physical, chemical and combustion characteristics that make it a
safe automotive fuel.  These characteristics are reviewed and the superior relative safety of methane in automotive applications in comparison to applications involving the other fuels is demonstrated where well designed conversion systems and operations
are employed

DAUG has developed a fibre plaque technology which is used in maintenance-free sealed Ni/Cd traction cells.  The advantages consist in low operation temperature, reliability, and high cycle life.  The cell design can be used also in cells where the Cd-ele
ctrodes is substituted by metal hydride or a zinc electrode.  The complete power system including control devices for electric and thermal management of the battery is favoured for application in electric vehicles.  Field tests and applications of Ni/Cd b
attery systems in pure and hybrid electric cars are presented.

The operation of an Isuzu 6 cylinder turbo-charged diesel engine; with partial CNG substitution level was both speed and load dependent.  The maximum CNG substitution level of approximately 98% was achieved at 2000 rpm, full load.  At low loads the engine
thermal efficiency dropped in proportion to the increase in CNG substitution level.  The results are presented so as to allow selection of the most economic CNG/diesel profile of operation at all speeds and loads considered.  Three approaches to improve
thermal efficiency levels at light loads are described.  These methods include the increase in air intake temperature, advancing the static injection timing, and the partial recirculation of air after the turbo-charger to the intake manifold after the CNG
mixer (author abstract 12 tabs., 23 figs., 1 append

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

To achieve the highest-possible power density for given efficiency and performance constraints, the development of a comprehensive optimization technique for the electronically-commutated, permanent-magnet motor (ECPM) is necessary.  The Successive Quadra
tic Nonlinear Programming, also called the Han-Powell Method, is chosen in this paper as optimization mehtod.  To accurately compute objective and constraint functions, the key point is to calculate the magnetic performance of the ECPM.  In this paper the
solution is approached in two ways: the magnetic circuit approach and the magnetic field approach.  The method proposed in this paper makes the method of nonlinear programming combined with field computation turn out to be practically realizable. (from A
uthor's abstract)The successiveQuadratic Nonlinear Programming has proven to be a powerful optimization method to achieve an optimal ECPM design for the highest possible power density for given efficiency and performance constraints.  The optimization p
erformed in this paper results in a significant weight reduction of the machine without sacrificing performance. (from Author's conclusion)

High pressure injection of natural gas is being investigated as a means of fueling diesel engines and meeting increasingly stringent EPA regulations on emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates.  In the work described in this paper, the penetration in
to air of a sonic jet of methane emerging from a suddenly opened poppet valve has been modelled analytically and measured using flow visualization.  The injection pressure ratios were in the range of 1.5 to 5 and the conical jet sheet Reynolds numbers wer
e in the range 7000 to 56000.  Schlieren photographs revealed that the conical sheet gas jet exhibits an unstable behaviour between the upper and lower plates which simulate the fire deck and the piston.  The integral model developed indicates the princip
al parameters on which the gaseous jet penetration depends and establishes the requirements for scaling.  The conical sheet jet penetration is found to be approximately 30% less than that of round holes, given the same flow area.  (author abstract)  This
is the fifth paper in "Natural Gas: Fuels and Fueling"

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The present work describes an experiment during which propane has been injected in the inlet nozzle of a monocylinder Ricardo E-6 type diesel engine (four strokes and turbulence chamber).  The influence of the propane/fuel ratio (for different loads and r
otation speeds) on the power, the fuel consumption, the pressure and the exhaust has been studied by comparison with operating conditions with fuel only.  The study shows that for operating conditions above 60% of the full load, there is a decrease of the
specific consumption and a decrease of the exhaust gases temperature as well as a pressure increase and a large decrease of fumes exhaust.  The analysis of gaseous pollutants levels shows that they depend on the load conditions and on the mixture ratio o
f the components, but in every case the difference with respect to the diesel fuel only operation is small. (author abstract) French text

This three-volume report details an investigation into the technical and economic feasibility and market potential of gaseous fuel use in New York State highway fleet vehicles The report includes:  Volume I -- An executive summary; Volume II -- A Technolo
gy and Economic Assessment; and, Volume III -- Institutional Barriers and Market Assessment The conversion of gasoline-fueled vehicles to the alternative fuels -- compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, and liquefied petroleum gases -- was
assessed based on various issues and problems:  the state of the art of gas-fueled vehicles and refueling equipment; the economics of conversion; current research activities; future specific research and development needs; and, public actions that could
further conversion in the state.  Benefits of conversion include reduced dependence on gasoline and diesel fuel, reduced air pollution and development of indigenous New York State sources of these alternative fuels

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A two-dimensional optimization process which simultaneously adjusts the spark timing and air-fuel ratio of a lean-burn natural gas fueled engine has been demonstrated.  This has been done by first mapping the thermal efficiency against spark timing and eq
uivalence ratio at a single speed at load combination to obtain the 3-D surface of efficiency versus the othe two variables.  Then the ability of the control system to find and hold the combination of timing and air-fuel ratio which gives the highest ther
mal efficiency was explored.  The control system described in SAE pape No. 940546 was used to map the thermal efficiency versus the equivalence ratio an ignition timing.  NOx, CO and HC maps were also obtained to determine the trade off between efficiency
and emissions.  A load corresponding to a brake mean effective pressure of 0.467 MPa was maintained by a water brake dynamometer.  The optimization process adds small synchronous disturbances to the spark timing and air flow while the fuel injected per c
ycle is held constant for 4 cycles.  The engine speed response to these disturbances is used to determine the optimum values of spark timing and air-fuel ratio.  The maximum thermal efficiency was about 10% higher while NOx emissions were about 50% lower
than for stoichiometric operation This approach offers the promise of an engine control process in which th engine itself is the primary sensor.  The control system is fully adaptive to changes in fuel composition, operating conditions, engine wear, or ot
her factors which may not easily be measured.  It allows the engine to continuously remap itself. (from Authors' abstract

The concept of using natural gas to power internal combustion engines is not new.  Methane, the principal constituent of natural gas, has been used as a fuel since engines were first invented in the early years of the 19th century.  Methane was available
then in the form of coal gas Natural gas has been used to power vehicles in Italy for more than 40 years.  The technology is well established and many countries have recognized the benefits to be gained by converting to natural gas.  For example, there ar
e more than 300,000 natural gas powered vehicles in Italy.  New Zealand which, until recently, was dependent on high cost imported oil, has launched an intensive conversion program as a result of large domestic natural gas discoveries.  The New Zealand ta
rget of 200,000 vehicle conversions by 1990 represents a penetration of more than 10% of the total vehicle population.

Rapid bus applies rapid transit thinking to bus operation.  Designed to revitalize bus services, rapid bus is targeted at corridors where conventional bus service has reached sasturation, while investment in high capacity rail transit cannot be justified
for financial reasons.  Rapid bus uses new technology and rail based marketing to grow ridership in medium density markets.

An optimized type of high-turbulence combustion chamber for spark-ignition natural gas engines, the "squish-jet" chamber, has been developed and tested in a single-cylinder research engine. The chamber design incorporates a series of passages in the pisto
n face which direct the usual squish motion near top-dead-centre into a series of high velocity jets aimed towards the centre of the combustion chamber. These jets create high levels of turbulence in the chamber during the early stage of combustion, resul
ting in rapid burning of the air/fuel mixture.  Three UBC designs and a base case were tested under full load operating conditions, at three engine speeds and over a wide range of air/fuel ratios. Each design was optimized by adjusting the clearance hei
ght (distance between the cylinder head and the piston top at top dead centre) to find the combustion parameters which result in the fastest combustion rates. The results are summarized in table 4.3.1. The reduced clearance height had little effect at 100
0 rpm. The power output was generally higher at 3.3 mm clearance, with exception of the UBC # 2 piston, which demonstrated better efficiency at 1.7 mm clearance. Hydrogen emissions were lower at 3.3 mm for all cases, while oxides of nitrogen and carbon mo
noxide emissions remained unchanged. The general conclusion is that there is a negative effect of reducing clearance from 3.3 mm to 1.7 mm, evidently tends to increase the rate of heat transfer and quenching. The charge burning times of UBC # 1 are 5 % to
15 % shorter compared to the base case, which is summarized in Figure 4.3.65.Limited availability contact Kelly Darby of Gas Techology, Tel. (416) 449-0040, Fax (416) 449-4999

The primary purpose of this paper is to identify the emissions reductions available through the use of methanol and CNG in light-duty vehicles by projecting realistic emission factors for these fuels, and comparing these to emission factors for gasoline v
ehicles.  A secondary purpose is to outline some of the non-emissions issues that are relevant in any overall evaluation of the potential of methanol and/or CNG as a primary motor vehicle fuel.  (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In the framework of a programme supported by the Commission of the European communities, a study is being undertaken to assess the applicability of advanced technology Flywheel/Motor-generator units to electrically propelled vehicles. The application
opportunities are being with reference to two basic modes: 1) Flywheel unit as a buffer within a system based on a main energy souce, such as a storage battery or a fuel cell, and 2) Flywheel unit as the only on board energy source.The advantage in th
e first case consist of load levelling of the energy source, with consequent benefits in life and deliverable energy, more effective energy recovery; higher performance, independent of energy source conditions.  The second case is consiered as a possible
alternative to electrochemical storage batteries.  The potential specific characteristics (energy and power referred to weight and volume) are evaluated on the basis of possible short term and long term developments in new technology rim solutions and hig
h performance electrical machines.  Comparisons are made with Supercapacitors for the buffer solution and with Electrochmical Storage Batteries for the pure Flywheel solution.  Vehicle application is discussed with reference to the specification and p
redicted results for a new FIAT electric passengers car and urban mission operation.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The effects of ambient gas thermodynamic state and fuel composition on the autoignition of natural gas under direct injection diesel conditions were studied experimentally in a constant-volume combustion vessel and computationally using a detailed chemica
l kinetic model.  At temperatures less than 1200K, the experiments demonstrated that the ignition delay of natural gas under diesel conditions has a dependence on temperature that is Arrhenius in character and a dependence on pressure that is close to fir
st order.  Natural gas compositions did not change the nature of the dependencies but did affect the magnitude of ignition delay.  The measured ignition delays were longest for pure methane and became shorter as ethane and propane concentrations increased
.  At higher ambient temperatures (> 1300K), the experimental ignition delays approached a limiting value of that was consistent with physical delays associated with the injection system.  The trends with regard to composition and pressure discussed above
were in agreement with trends predicted with a detailed chemical kinetic model. (from Author's abstract)

The performance of six Hamilton Street Railway Company public transit buses is reported.  The buses are used primarily for peak period extra service because of insufficient fuel tank capacity.  The buses have performed well and exhibited few serious fuel
related problems.  The fuel consumption however, has been considerably higher than anticipated, and a series of valve keeper failures occurred in the latter stages of the project.  (author abstract

This paper investigates the use of eucalyptus and orange oils as sources of alternative vehicular fuels.  Both have high octane values and appear to have potential for use in spark-ignition engines.  Tests were conducted on engine performance, engine wear
and deposit formation during road tests.  Both oils, when blended with gasoline, were found to be nearly equal to gasoline in regards to engine startability and driveability

The air-natural gas ratio greatly influences the performance and efficiency of Otto-cyle engines converted to compressed natural gas (CNG) A systematic research has been conducted - and data collected by microcomputers installed on board a converted vehic
le - aimed at improving performances and efficiencies of gas engines by optimizing the air/gas ratio.  It was experimentally observed, however, that the best results could not be achieved by acting on the parameter alone.  It is also expedient to modify t
he ignition timing curve as a function of engine speed and temperature.  (Author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

From our previous work, it was noticed that in a Gobar Gas-Diesel oil dual fuel engine the combustion slows down considerably as gas is introduced, resulting in reduced thermal efficiency at part-loads.  To rectify the tendency the following measures were
tried out is the present work:  (i) increased compression ratio and (ii) advanced injection timing.  With increased compression ratio the combustion process is found to speed up and the thermal efficiency also improves.  A higher proportion of gas could
also be used.  Advancing the injection timing on the other hand was found to be ineffective in accelerating the combustion or improving the thermal efficiency Since the combustion process was found to slow down in the open combustion chamber, it was inves
tigated whether a cooper CVR-6 pre-combustion chamber engine, with high turbulence would be better.  Tests were performed with constant engine outputs with various gas-diesel oil proportions.  In this engine also there was a fall in thermal efficiency as
the gas was inducted but the rate of fall was lower than in the open combustion chamber engine.  The delay period decreases and the peak-pressure increases as gas is inducted, being diametrically opposite to the tendency of the open combustion chamber eng
ine.  This aspect requires to be studied further.  The power boost test of both the engines were studied and the performance characteristics are summarised in this paper

This summary report provides an overview of a methanol assessment study undertaken by the Government of Ontario to:  l) determine the role for methanol as an alternative transportation fuel in Ontario, 2) assess the prospects, timing and preconditions for
commercialization of methanol fuels, and 3) identify the best technology and feedstock combinations for production of methanol in Ontario.  Though methanol production in Ontario is not currently viable from a commercial viewpoint, it is felt there could
be a market by the 1990's.  A market for the fuel will have to be developed in Ontario, and in North America generally, a job which will take time.  Also, costs of natural gas and gasoline in the future will determine potential demand for methanol fuels

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The demands on the performance of spark plugs are increasing because of developments in lean-burn engines leading to adverse conditions for ignition and because of the desire for a longer life of the plugs.  For improving spark plugs and ignition systems,
more insight into the relationship between gap wear and spark-plug design, ignition-system characteristics and in-cylinder conditions is required.  For that purpose, an instrument has been developed to measure on-line the gap size of spark plugs.  This m
onitor can also be used for on-condition maintenance indicating that a necessary replacement of the spark plugs will be near.  The monitor, called SPECTOR, receives a signal from an inductive coil around the high-voltage cable which, under given condition
s, is representative for the gap size.  (author abstract)  This is the third paper in "Gaseous Fuels for Engines"

The use of natural gas as a fuel for transit buses is clearly attractive both for economic and environmental reasons.  This paper compares basic combustion characteristics of the diesel, dual-fuel and spark ignition engine.  It examines various parameters
that affect dual-fuel combustion and it outlines methods used to match and even exceed diesel performance in the demanding work cycle of a transit bus engine.  Included are performance emissions and economic data generated from actual road tests conducte
d on an 86 passenger transit bus powered by a dual-fuel Detroit Diesel Allison two stroke engine.  (Author abstract

The results of a collaborative project at CANMET strongly suggest that localize corrosion at crack tips, possibly preventable by cathodic protection is an important part of the failure process. This proposal describes a full-scale pipe test to examine the
mechanism and the penetration rates of this type of localized corrosion, to enable life prediction and the design of control and inspection procedures

EDF, the French national electricity utility has done considerable work over the last three years to prepare the recharge stations that will be necessary to charge the future electric cars.  It is now evident that home charging should be priviledged as th
is requires a minimal infrastructure and is most likely to aid with load levelling; but charging on the curb-side or in parking lots will certainly remain inevitable.  This is particularly so in the city centres and high rise residential areas where priva
te parking space is rare and personalized charging is impossible.  As a result, we have undertaken the development of several types of different charging systems that will be applicable to each of these situations.  Particular attention has been paid to s
afety issuses and the standardization of the main aspects of this new technological challenge.

This paper details work done using the hot-motored technique and a nitrogen technique to obtain three pressure-time records - one without either vaporization or chemical reaction; one with vaporization only, and one with both vaporization and chemical rea
ction.  This data can be used to determine rates of vaporization and chemical reaction during the ignition delay period in an operating diesel engine.  Examples are given for different fuels and operating conditions

The feasibility of CNG, propane, methane and various fuel mixtures of propane and methane as potentially viable automotive fuels is tested.  A feed-back loop system for mixture control allows the use of propane or methane or any proportion of the two gase
s to be used to extend the range of a methane fueled car.  A refueling system for propane was devised that allows a refill from a low pressure propane source, or a high pressure methane source.  It is felt that higher engine compression ratios would impro
ve vehicle performance and fuel economy benefits

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Injury and death incidence rates per vehicle mile traveled (VMT) for utlity fleet natural gas vehicles (NGVs) are significantly lower than comparable incidence rates for the entire population of registered U.S. vehicles. According to a recent A.G.A. surve
y, NGV fleet injury rates per VMT were 84% less than the national average for injuries per VMT.Since there were no deaths incurred in the cumultative 434.1 million miles driven by the sample fleet, it is impossible to compare, on a percentage basis.Co
llision rates per VMT were 4.2% higher for sampled NGVs as compared to the national average for all vehicles. Fire incidences per VMT for all U.S. registered vehicles is not compiled and therefore comparisons of surveyed NGV fire incidence rates to nati
onal averages is impossible. Our survey yielded a fire incidence rate per 100 million VMT of 2.3 for NGVs. Of these 2.3 fires every 100 million VMT, only 0.5 fires per 100 million VMT were directly attributable to the failure of the compressed ntural gas
(CNG) system.

In order to evaluate the feasibility of spark-assisted diesel engine concept for multifuel capability in which forced spark can assist ignition in case of no self-ignition, a spark plug was adapted in the pre-combustion chamber of a conventional diesel en
gine.  And performance tests and emission tests on the engine were carried out with methanol, ethanol, gasoline and diesel fuel.  And also injection and combustion characteristics with the fuels were measured for the investigation of difference with each
fuels The test results show that this spark-assisted diesel has multifuel capability and it is concluded that this type of engine has enough potential for the future and alternate low cetane number fuel use and the performance is comparable to a conventio
nal diesel engine with various fuels.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A two-stroke 250cc test engine was designed to experimentally evaluate ringless piston operation.  The test engine had a crosshead to minimize side loads on the ringless piston.  The crankcase was sealed and it was possible to eliminate oil in the combust
ion chamber.  A ringless molybdenum piston with labyrinth seals was designed and tested.  Ringed-to-ringless power ratios greater than 90 percent were achieved by controlling piston-to-liner clearance via cylinder cooling.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Several characteristics distinguish the combustion in large-bore engines from ordinary automotive engines; namely low rpm and associated long combustion duration, natural gas fuel, multiple spark plugs, lean operation, substantial unmixedness due to direc
t gas injection during compression, and low surface to volume ratio.  In order to better appreciate the effects of these factors on NOx formation, a phenomenological model of combustion in a 20-inch bore two-cycle natural gas engine is described.  The mod
el accounts for random "unmixedness" of the initial charge, stratification, and temperature gradients arising from successively burned zones.  Predictions are compared with experimental data for the effects of variations in timing, fuel-air ratio, stratif
ied charge, EGR, and turbulence

A panel of unbiased experts was assembled to estimate the hazardous behavior of various locomotive fuels for a set of specified locomotive accidents.  The five fuels of interest were compressed natural gas (CNG), refrigerated liquid methane (RLM), liquefi
ed petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and diesel fuel.  Ten accidents were analyzed that ranged from somewhat common and benign to uncommon and potentially catastrophic.  The results are estimates of the likelihood of occurence of fuel-injury, fire, and exposi
tion for each fuel in each accident.  In general, diesel fuel is the safest and LPG is the most hazardous.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

How well do natural gas vehicles do when competing with other alternatively fueled vehicles? The most recent AGA/EEI Fleet Management Committee survey shows the beginnings of what seems to be a growing market. The 1995 summary results include data from 10
3 companies, an unprecedented response rate of 80%.  The combined fleets of these 103 member companies include over 170000 vehicles. This market should be large enough to catch the eye of the big three auto manufacturers. But are these manufacturers res
ponding to the expanding needs of fleet  managers who must by law use alternate-fuel vehicles? Nearly 65% of these 170000 vehicles are powered by gasoline, while 28% are dependent on diesel motor fuel. Not surprising is the surge in alternative-fuel vehic
les, which has grown to approximately 13000 units or about 8% of this rather large fleet sampling. Present in total fleet mix are over 9000 natural gas vehicles including compressed natural gas and liquid natural gas vehicles 1200 propane vehicles, and ne
arly 1000 vehicles powered by methanol or ethanol. (author summary)

In 1990 Yugo-Tech, Mississauga, Ontario, embarked on the creation of a new natural gas conversion concept, they named the 'Advanced Gas Inducer System' (AGIS).  This presentation outlines the project tasks completed to data.  A prototype field test is exp
ected to commence in 1991, and production shortly thereafter.  AGIS is expected to provide greater control over the engines air-fuel ratio, reduce exhaust emissions, and provide a more flexible conversion system.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Neighborghood electric vehicles (NEVs) are a promising strategy for easing the growing tension between demands for greater automotive travel and calls for improved environmental quality.  By reducing performance and driving range expectations, NEVs overco
me the energy storage problem of larger electric vehicles, while still serving the mobility demands of many travelers.  The introduction of NEVs is likely to be slowed by a web of road and vehicle rules designed around the standard vehicle of the past and
by uniform vehicle-size expectations on the part of consumers, government regulators, and roadway suppliers.  The energy and environmental benefits are potentially so large, however, and the opportunity to create more human-scale communities so promising
, that it would be irresponsible not to pursue NEVs in a more deliberate fashion.

Gaseous fuels for engines are important in the Netherlands.  In the fifties, the Rotterdam refineries produced a lot of LPG as a by-product.   By means of fuel tax regulations, the Dutch government made it attractive to use it as an automotive fuel.  From
then onwards an industry making conversion kits and a refuelling network grew.  Now, about 600,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Netherlands.  They are refuelled from some 2100 filling stations In the sixties, large amounts of natural gas were discovered an
d exploited. About 150 MW (40% by units smaller than 200 kW) is operated as co-generation units.  This amount is rapidly increasing due to the attractive pricing of natural gas.  The use of CNG in vehicles is very small TNO (The Netherlands Orgnization fo
r Applied Scientific Research) has long emphasized the application of gaseous fuels in diesel engines.  The main reason is seen as the increasing worldwide demand for diesel oil surpassing its production.  This paper will deal mainly with Otto cycle heavy
duty engines, with an emphasis on optimisation for emission.  Described are the strategies, hardware and results (From author introduction 7 refs

The Canadian Navy has a requirement to increase the submerged endurance of its next genration of submarines. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) based Fuel Cell technology has been chosen as the most likely technology to meet the Navy's requirements. Presently
the Canadian Government is in contract with Ballard Power Systems (Ballard) of North Vancouver, Canada to develop an exploratory development model for integration in a future submarine. This "proof-of-concept"model consists of a 40 kW power plant based o
n PEM technology using reformed methanol and cryogenically stored liquid oxygen as the fuel and oxygen sources. The aim of this paper is to highlight progress to date in developing this power plant.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade around the world has grown three thousand-fold to a 1985 level of 47.48 billion cubic metres equalling approximately $9.2 billion.  Japan is the greatest importer, while Indonesia is the largest exporter of LNG.  As o
f 1985, 75 peakshaving facilities were operating internationally.  These facilities liquefy and store gas during low demand times then vaporize the gas for normal use during high demand periods.  Today's situation of gas oversupply and low energy prices i
s a threat to the LNG industry.  However the industry can rally if it can correctly predict the timing, volume and commercial requirements of demand for gas in the European, American and Pacific Rim markets and to plan LNG projects to meet those needs wit
h affordable gas prices

The report provides a review and analysis of existing and emerging CNG refueling technology aimed at defining opportunities for improvements and areas where technical solutions might be sought.  Interpretation of technical areas is broad, including not on
ly scientific and engineering studies, laboratory work and technology transfer, support to develop and simplify regulations and economic analysis of technology options.  The CNG refueling system is analyzed at several levels from an initial overview of th
e CNG market, at the area, refueling site, major equipment and component levels.  The information has been used to generate a portfolio of 24 tasks for consideration by GRI in development of its future R&D program in support of CNG.  (from author abstract

This survey to provide up-to-date information on the number of natural gas vehicles (NGV) currently in operation in Canada, provided an opportunity to obtain additional information concerning vehicle conversions as well.  Data on conversion costs, operati
ng problems service and maintenance, and fueling are included.  According to this survey average cost of conversion to a natural gas system is approximately $2,100 and approximately $450 of this is labor cost.  No major operating problems were reported by
installers though there is some complaint regarding loss of horsepower.  Most installers report a fairly steady flow of business and feel increasing refueling facilities would further improve the system

This paper presents compound diesel engines and discusses how a compound arrangement can improve fuel efficiency.  Basic thermodynamic considerations are examined and then two particular compound systems are discussed.  Performance characteristics for bot
h the Cummins and the Differential Compound engines are given.  The control system and the transient characteristics of the Differential Compound are examined.  It is concluded that compounding has been shown to make possible very significant advances in
Diesel engine performance and operational flexibility

An engineering research and design competition to develop and demonstrate dedicated natural gas-powered light-duty trucks, the Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) Challenge, was held June 6-11, 1991, in Oklahoma.  The competition consisted of rigorous vehicle testi
ng of exhaust emissions, fuel economy, performance parameters, and vehicle design.  Vehicles used were Sierra 2500 pickup trucks and a gasoline-powered control vehicle was included in the testing as a reference vehicle.  This paper discusses the results o
f the event, summarizes the technologies employed, and makes observations on the state of natural gas vehicle technology. (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Operating characteristics including ignition limits, cyclic variability, and exhaust emissions were studied in the combustion of natural gas in a spark ignition, single-cylinder, variable compression ratio engine, operated at intake mixture temperatures r
anging between 120 and -60 F The work confirmed in general the feasibility of using natural gas in spark ignition engine operated under extremely cold intake temperature conditions.  It was learned that both the maximum peak cylinder pressures and the mas
s of mixture inducted by the engine increased as the intake mixture temperature was lowered, and that the emissions of pollutants were not significantly increased These findings are thought to be particularly relevant to the use of natural gas in spark ig
nition engines, either as LNG or under very cold wintry conditions

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

An experimental evaluation has been made of the power output, specific fuel consumption and thermal efficiency of a modern 4 cylinder spark ignition engine operating on gasoline and natural gas.  Tests have been conducted at various speeds, spark advance
angles and air-fuel ratios, all at wide open throttle.  Performance on gasoline and natural gas has been compared and optimum spark advance determined for natural gas operation.  With natural gas operation, brake power was found to decrease by between 11.
3% and 16.6% compared to gasoline operation.  Brake specific fuel consumption was found to decrease by an average of 7.2%, although this is due to the higher calorific value of natural gas.  In terms of brake thermal efficiency, operation with natural gas
was found to be less efficient than with gasoline.  This is due to the lower flame speed of natural gas and the proportionally higher friction losses

This paper was presented as the keynote address at the conference on Combustion of Tomorrow's Fuels.  Twelve gas fuels and twelve solid or liquid fuels were chosen for comparison in searching for a quantitative scale of relative fuel values.  One finding
was that a comparison of gaseous fuels with liquids or solids on an RTV basis has some meaning, but the sometimes significant effect of gas emissivity on furnace performance reduces it 7 refs

This report concerns the current status and future direction of a project to develop and popularize an electric truck and a low-emission truck by the Company with the participation of 41 consumers' co-operatives.  The electric vehicle has gone through thr
ee stages of pre-production development.  The Company performed tests to determine the cost of fuel and gain operating know-how from using the vehicles in actual business conditions.  The report presents the results of those tests of vehicles using sealed
lead acid batteries as well as the results of tests using a rapid charger and a conventional charger on the battery.  The report concludes with a description of experiments planned to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of rapid charging on the
battery.

y cylinders, and a data logging system is fitted to monitor performance and fuel consumption of the truck.The truck is used in municipal service moving gravel and asphalt to work sites.  A typical day's use is about 200 km.The truck has been modified
significantly throughout the project.  A stoichiometric natural gas engine has been replaced with a lean burn engine and the fuel capacity has been increased.  One of the key findings in the demonstration has been that fueling stations must have their sto
rage sized to the fuel capacity of the largest vehicle in order to allow reasonable refueling times.

This paper reviews research conducted by the Plasma Physics Group on high energy ignition concepts for use in internal combustion engines.  Plasma jet ignition was chosen as the most promising system to incorporate in a multi-cylinder natural gas fuelled
vehicle on the basis of its proven potential for reduction of ignition delay and the enhancement of initial burning rates of methane-air fuel mixtures.  Projects reviews include:  the plasma jet and the single cylinder ignition system and, the plasma jet
and the multi-cylinder engine.  A mathematical model was developed to analyze problems associated with use of natural gas fuel and to suggest modifications to resolve them

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The sodium sulfur battery has always been recognized for its excellent energy capability while providing adequate power.  The battery developed in the mid-1980's by Silent Power was designed for delivery van applications requiring a moderate power-to-ener
gy ratio (P/E).  However, today's vehicle manufacturers are demanding higher power levels which the 1980 product cannot satisfy these higher P/E requirements.  The first prototype battery employing this high power technology has now been built and has met
all of its performance targets, exceeding the USABC mid-term goals.  This paper presents this "high power" (Mk6) battery design and discusses the results of the performance testing of the prototype battery.

The closed-loop threeway catalyst on the European market has considerably reduced the emissions of passenger cars in an absolute sense.  The question arose if gaseous fuels still have a real advantage.  To answer this question an extensive programme was s
et up to compare gasoline and diesel with LPG and natural gas.  Not only the regulated components, but also a whole range of unregulated components were measured.  The resulting data were grouped into environmental aspects, such as direct local toxicity,
longterm toxicity, smog, acidification, and global warming.  The conclusion is that gaseous fuels still hold an advantage over liquid fuels. (from Author's abstract)

NGV has been actively promoted by the Canadian natural gas industry for 6 years.  By 1992, the annual conversion rate is planned to exceed 18,000, bringing the cumulative number of vehicles to about 90,000 The government of Canada has been constant in its
support of NGV with conversion and fueling station incentives, and support for R and d and demonstrations.  Provincial governments have also favoured alternative fuels through tax concessions and R and D.  Industry looks for continued government support
in an extended integrated industry/government program The marketing activites described in the Plan concentrate primarily on the immediate opportunities to substitute NGV for gasoline.  In the latter part of the planning period two prospective development
s are expected to broaden the NGV market considerably.  These are the advent of the commercial use of NGV in diesel applications and the availability of an economically viable home compressor for refueling.  These developments in NGV technology are only t
wo of many projects which are supported by CGA's NGV R and D Fund whose program is an integral part of the Development Plan The Development Plan traces Canada's NGV marketing experiences and outlines the business strategies for reaching the ambitious five
-year plan (From author abstract Includes brief author biography

This paper provides an examination of five countries (two in the Atlantic area, three in the Pacific) and the potential use of their domestic natural gas reserves.  A critical issue for developing countries is determining whether to export LNG or use it d
omestically.  Markets and potential industrial use for natural gas are discussed.  For the criteria (wellhead netback value) used in the comparison, the domestic market appears to be the best option in all cases shown.  Electricity generation was found to
be a particularly attractive use of natural gas from an economic standpoint

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The contents deal primarily with the institutional barriers and market forces affecting the potential conversion of vehicles in New York State (NYS) to gaseous fuels. The results of a market research survey are presented along with the current supply cond
itions for fuels in NYS. The indigenous resources of gaseous fuels in NYS are identified and quantified. The potential number of vehicles in NYS that are favorable candidates for conversion are estimated, and the effect of these potential gaseous-fueled v
ehicles on NYS gaseous fuels supplies is presented. Volume II of this report explores the technological and economic aspects of vehicle conversion to gaseous fuels. Volume I is an executive summary of the entire report. It is estimated that about 35% of t
he passenger cars and 43% of the trucks in NYS are potential candidates for conversion to CNG. For LPG, about 36% and 46% of passenger cars and trucks are potential candidates.Applying a gross economic screen results in an estimated potential liquid fuel
displscement of 1.3 billion gallons in 1990. (summary)

Energy conservation in the Canadian transportation industry is approached by a study of truck fuel consumption.  Data was collected, a truck fuel consumption model developed for this study, and interpretation and conclusions are presented.  With the avail
able data two versions of a Canadian Truck Fuel Model were calibrated based on a) registration data and b) a survival curve.  The estimated truck fuel consumption as obtained from the models for the years 1979 and 1980 are 13.99 billion litres and 14.1 li
tres, respectively.  A detailed step-by-step method for further research in this area is outlined

A turbulent reacting flow working group has been established through the Dept. of Energy/Office of Basic Energy Sciences.  The purpose of this group is to establish and maintain a strong interaction and active dialogue between workers currently involved i
n modeling turbulent reacting flows and those involved in related experiments.  One objective of this collaboration is to develop an increased understanding of the fundamental interaction between the chemical and fluid dynamical processes occuring in chem
ically reacting flows and to utilize this understanding to improve predictive capabilities for turbulent combustion This document is a summary of discussions that took place at the Group's seventh and eighth meetings, which were held at California Institu
te of Technology, Pasadena, CA, March 25-26, 1986 and Yale University, New Haven, CT, October 13-14, 1985, respectively.  (Author Abstract)

Cyclic variations in engines have been the subject of much investigation and there are some excellent reviews of this research.  However, there is still a need to examine in an integrated manner the cyclic variation in performance parameters such as indic
ted power output, efficiency and cylinder pressure development in relation to the cyclic variation in some important combustion parameters notably those of the ignition lag, which is the time requirements to initiate a flame kernel following the passage o
f a spark and the duration to complete the combustion process particularly when gaseous fuels, notably methane are used The paper describes the results of an investigation with these objectives using a single cylinder, variable compression ratio, spark ig
nition, CFR engine, run at constant speed, operating mainly on natural gas.  Through the use of a data-acquisition system, engine performance, the corresponding combustion characteristics and associated cyclic variation were established.  The presence of
some diluents such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide and other gaseous fuels with the methane were also considered.

Leakage can have an adverse effect on a high pressure NGV system. The author states that there is a direct link between the type of connection used and the safety, profitability and reliability of a NGV system. He concludes that the designer must specify
female connections and thread styles that will ensure leak-free performance.

This paper provides a method of analysis of rate of return for CNG/LPG diesel conversion of large vehicles.  Simple, accurate procedures have been developed which take into consideration inflation, discounting of future benefits and the taxation provision
s for commercial and private owners.  The analysis requires engineering and vehicle cost data which is combined with data relating to the capital costs of the extra equipment

If agriculture is going to be used to produce energy as well as food and feed it will be necessary to rethink our agricultural policies.  This paper presents a stochastic simulation model to evaluate the implications of alternative gasohol programs for a
large segment of the food and agricultural sector -- corn and soybean producers, consumers and taxpayers. Results of the research indicate that alcohol production levels below 2.0 billion gallons will not result in serious dislocations in the agricultural
sector.  As the level of alcohol production increases however, problems can develop, i.e. higher corn prices, decline in export levels

Particulates in diesel engine exhaust have become a health concern in countries with a large number of diesel vehicles.  Legislation has been enacted which provides increasingly tightened emission standards.  Therefore particulate emission reduction has b
ecome a major goal of diesel engine manufacturers.  Unfortunately particulate formation is a very complex process and, to this day, is not completely understood.  Knowledge in this field is outlined and where further research is needed (Author abstract In

A probabilistic risk assessment was conducted to estimate the risk of accidental ignition (and consequent fire/explosion) from indoor refuelling and servicing of CNG fueled mass transit buses.  The probability of incident was estimated by using component
reliability data.  A publicly available database of safety-related information on NGVs was developed to support the PRA.  (from author abstract

The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Transportation has for many years displayed a commitment to assist in the development of technologies that will lead to the commercial production of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).  Th
e DOE has supported HEV research and development activities in many forms including collegiate competitions.  Foremost among these competitions is the 1994 HEV Challenge, which showcases the world's largest hybrid electric vehicle fleet.  Thirty six hybri
d electric vehicles designed and built by students from colleges and universities across North America compete each June in the Detroit, Michigan area.  These vehicles fall into three categories: Saturn vehicles converted to HEVs, Ford Escort conversions,
and HEVs built from the ground up.  Many of the vehicles use the alternative fuels such as ethanol and methanol in their combustion engines.  They must pass the performance events that test vehicle's designs and capabilities.  One of the main goals of th
e Challenge is to produce a "practical" transportation alternative, not just a low or zero emissions vehicle.  The performance events are designed to evaluate each vehicle under real-world conditions.  These events test the vehicle acceleration, ability t
o endure long-range and urban-type driving cycles, energy economy, and emissions.

This paper reviews the long term outlook for methanol supply, with respect to resources and price/economics.  Methanol can be made from a wide variety of raw materials but the focus here is on methanol made from natural gas.  Conclusions are that Canada w
ill continue to be a net exporter of methanol in the foreseeable future, and that there are a number of ways in which Canada can increase methanol supply through expansion of existing facilities, twinning of existing facilities and converting existing amm
onia facilities.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

As the use of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) increases worldwide, a clear understanding is needed of the environmental concerns connected with these vehicles.  This paper summarizes a U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) sponsored study by the Argonne National Laborat
ory.  Available data indicates NGVs have lower CO but higher total HC emissions than gasoline vehicles.  Nitrogen oxide emissions were higher than gasoline engines that were optimized for fuel economy and performance but lower for vehicles optimized for e
missions.  Safety considerations include fuel leakage in normal operation, fuel release in an accident or during refuelling and corrosion of storage cylinders.  There is not sufficient data to completely resolve the safety issue however no single issue di
squalifies NGVs from use.  While various regulations are in place in the U.S. that control exhaust emissions, safety and natural gas sales, these regulations are often confusing and not well defined.  Because of the potential for increased use of NGVs and
the lack of updated, comprehensive data it is recommended that more effort be put into emissions and safety research and review of regulations

Ontario currently has measures underway to lessen the demand for conventional petroleum-based fuels by encouraging conservation and more efficient use of these fuels, and by supporting the use of alternative fuels.  In this paper propane, compressed natur
al gas, and methanol are discussed in terms of their characteristics and current research activities being carried out in Ontario.  The aim of the research is to evaluate and improve the performance acceptability of the fuels in terms of their emissions,
driveability and energy consumption

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of methane as an automotive fuel has been inhibited by its slow burn rate and high activation energy which cause a loss of power compared to gasoline.  This paper examines the combustion process in methane-air mixtures to determine if a better ign
ition source can reduce combustion duration which in turn will minimize the power lost.  Ignition sources used were the conventional spark plug, plasma jet ignitor and multiple electrode spark plug.  Results indicate ignition sources only affect the initi
al stage (ignition delay) and not the latter part (flame propagation) of combustion.  Recommendations for further studies are presented

This paper examines the effects of the use of lead free gasoline in vehicles which were designed to run on leaded gasoline.  Potential damage in the form of exhaust-valve seat wear is of specific concern.  Comparisons are made of photomicrographs of exhau
st valve seats run with zero-lead and 0.5 gm leaded gasoline.  This work shows that the inclusion of phosphorus in zero-lead gasoline is not a complete solution to the exhaust-valve seat wear problem

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper describes a study which evaluated the costs to provide charging infrastructure for recently developed fast charge systems which are located on-board the vehicle and : 1) eliminating the need for off-board chargers/controllers, 2) provide high p
ower quality when charging.  The system also offer cost and performance advantages for car manufacturers by serving as a high performance EV drive controller which, at no added cost, can perform several other EV functions.  The study found that on-board h
igh rate charging could be supported relatively cheaply.  The total estimated cost for thirty 25 kVA high rate charging point was roughly $140,000.  This represented unit charging point costs of < $5000 and is nearly 20 times cheaper than with an off-boar
d charging approach.  It is concluded that these costs are sufficiently low to encourage the development of worldwide EV markets

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The New York Transit Authority (NYTA) buses have proven a major contributor to the air pollution problems in numerous studies over the last ten years.  One way of dealing with this bus emission problem is through the use of exhaust after treatment.  This
paper provides a fairly extensive review of a NYTA demonstration program for a trap oxidizer system for exhaust particulates.  Test results are presented in tables.  Conclusions indicate an 80% reduction in particulate emissions can be achieved, and that
by implementing recommended improvements 1991 U.S. EPA emissions standards can likely be met

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Canadian Gas Association Natural Gas Technology Development Plan (NGTDP), which is market driven, is designed to foster synergies between all industry initiatives. The initiative is build on the fundamental needs of value creation for gas customers an
d the industry through Research, Development and Deployment (RD&D), of international competitiveness, and of environmental stewardship.There are four key issues which provide either a challange or opportunity for the gas industry and its stakeholders.
These are:1. scarce and declining RD&D support and resources;2. natural gas demand in highly competitive energy markets;3. the challenges of sustainable development policies;4. Canadian needs to foster internationally competitive industry.The
NGTDP is based on three fundamental strategic directions. These are:- to maximize value creation for gas customers and the industry through RD&D;- to further the international competitiveness of gas industry stakeholders through     cost-effective pr
ocesses, product quality, productivity and environmental compliance    technologies;- to support the industry's environmental stewardship initiatives through technologies      that protect the environment and increase energy efficiency.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

GM is currently involved in a multiphase program with the US Department of Energy for developing and testing a proof-of-concept hybrid vehicle based on a PEM fuel cell power plant and a methanol fuel processor.  Other major participants in the program are
Los Alamos National Labs, Dow Chemical Co., Ballard Power Systems and DuPont Co.  In the just completed phase 1 of the program, a 10kW PEM fuel cell power plant was successfully built and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a methanol fu
el processor with a PEM fuel cell stack.  Progress achieved in phase 1 on the use of monolithic catalyst reactors in the fuel processor, managing CO impurity in the fuel cell stack, low-cost electrode-membrane assemblies, and on the integration of the fue
l processor with a Ballard PEM fuel cell stack will be presented.  In the phase 2 follow-on effort, the primary objective is to develop and test a 30 kW fuel cell power plant.  In addition to fuel processor and fuel cell stack components and systems devel
opment activities, control systems, sensors and ancillary equipment needed for integrating the brassboard system will also be developed and tested. Major challenges include the development of a compact and a quick starting methanol fuel reformer with good
transient characteristics and low CO emissions, and a low cost fuel cell stack with a high power density on reformate/air operation at relatively low pressures.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Phase 1 of a study to expand the performance and life cycle cost database for NOx control of gas-fueled prime movers has been accomplished through experimental evaluations of fuel effects, technical literature reviews of Japanese and domestic approaches t
o NOx control, and through direct contacts with manufacturers and users in the U.S. and Japan.  Engine tests confirm literature findings that natural gas and methanol provide an advantage over petroleum fuels in limiting NOx formation.  Presently, methano
l produced from feedstocks other than natural gas presents no threat to the natural gas market because of the high capital costs required to achieve high volume methanol production.  For lean-burn engines selective catalytic reduction offers the greatest
amount of NOx control.  Installation, operating and maintenance costs are very high; this method has received moderate acceptance in Japan but limited use in the U.S.  For rich-burn engines, nonselective catalytic reduction is gaining acceptance for NOx c
ontrol.  This method is basically the adaptation of automotive three-way catalyst technology. (Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This study is concerned with the characteristics of dual fuel operation under cold intake temperatures, primarily from the viewpoint of engine performance and exhaust emissions.  The gaseous fuels employed were methane, propane, hydrogen and ethylene.  Th
e addition of the inerts carbon dioxide and nitrogen were also considered.  Comparison with the corresponding normal diesel operation was made throughout.  A Gardner Diesel Engine IL2, a single cylinder diesel engine, was used in these experiments.  It wa
s coupled to an electric dynamometer and flow control valves regulated the temperature of the intake valves while a system of choked nozzles controlled the fuel supply.  With operation at cold intak temperatures, some of the main conclusions were:  (1) ma
ximum power output is increased (2) NOx emissions are decreased (3) knocking tendency is decreased and (4) air induction is increased

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

There is little in the way of engine technology that is not currently operating in the school bus fleets owned by Cook Illinois Corp. Diesel engines, gasoline engines and natural gas and propane fueled engines all power some segment of the company's fleet
.  There aren't any gas turbines in the operation at this point, but don't bet against it.  "We'd be interested," said company President John Benish Why all this interest in different types of engines?  "Fifty-two cents a gallon," Benish said, talking abo
ut his natural gas-fueled fleet.  "If we could get out of gasoline engines completely we'd do it," he said.  "It jus costs too much to run a school bus fleet on gasoline".  Benish readily admits that with some school buses, especially the smaller vans use
d for low volume student populations, a ready alternative to diesel is not available, yet

This thesis was undertaken to investigate the effects of turbocharging on the combustion of natural gas in a spark ignition engine and to determine factors influencing engine performance.  A combination of experimental and analytical methods were used.  E
xperimental data was obtained from a instrumented, four cylinder, Toyota engine mounted in a test cell.  Cylinder pressure data obtained during testing were recorded and analyzed using a computer routine to provide information on mass burning rates and bu
rning velocities.  Computer routines were also developed to simulate various aspects of the combustion process, including a comprehensive engine simulation program.  Results obtained during the study indicate that it is possible to recover the power loss
experienced by an engine running on natural gas by boosting the intake pressure to 3 psig (20 kPa) above that provided when the engine is running on gasoline

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas has considerable potential as a "clean" fuel for motor vehicles.  This paper reviews the present state of the art in natural  gas vehicles, focusing on engine technology and emissions.  Natural gas engines generally show very low emissions of
reactive hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, but NOx emissions can be fairly high.  Approaches to NOx control include stoichiometric operation using a three-way catalyst and air-fuel ratio feedback, and "lean-burn/fast-burn" engines wit
h NOx controlled through reduced flame temperature.  Engines of both types have demonstrated excellent emissions performance - exceeding U.S. 1994 emissions requirements for heavy-duty engines.  Optimized natural gas engines are significantly more efficie
nt than present gasoline engines, with lean-burn natural gas engines approaching diesel efficiency.  (author abstract)  This is the fourth paper in "Gaseous Fuels: Technology, Performance and Emissions"

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper focuses on the use of energy in Canada's transportation sector, specifically, the road segment of the sector. The road segment is the focal point because of: its high levels of CO2, NOx, HC, CO and VOC emissions; and the potential to significan
tly reduce those emissions and improve efficiency in fuel consuption.There is an essential role for the Government of Canada to play in order to ensure the optimal development and management of our energy resources in the transportation sector. A part
nership between government and industry is required and should be firmly grounded in consultation.What is presented here is a portfolio of proposed transportation energy research, development and deployment strategies which lead to a range of proposed
program actions. The goal of the proposed Transportation Energy Technology Program (TETP) is to move toward a transportation system that is more environmentally-benign than that which we have today and which includes more environmentally-compatible t
echnologies and fuels, in such a way as to reduce costs.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The California Air Resources Board's (CARB) regulations for motor vehicles have become one of the most influential forces shaping the evolution of motor vehicle technology.  In particular, its Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEV) mandate has raised significant op
position and calls are coming from various quarters to change it, mainly by softening its application and by making room for hybrid vehicles.  This paper examines the impact of CARB regulations on the development of electric vehicle technology (EVT) and o
n its eventual acceptance.  The paper also discusses the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), an electric vehicle with a second fuel system on-board.

The New Zealand CNG refuelling station development programme started with what has been termed as "The Great Kiwi Trek".  Interested parties from various organizations journeyed to Italy, Europe and the U.S. in the search for technology and hardware suita
ble for refuelling vehicles.  The final analysis back in 1979 was that there was no CNG infrastructure set up anywhere in the world which New Zealand could emulate as a model for our own fledgling industry Some areas of compressor faults experienced are a
s follows: valve failure, water cooling, excessive oil usage, crankshaft failure, mechanical seal failure, filtration, excessive noise and excessive final gas temperature (From author paper

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The application of variable valve timing (VVT)  to spark ignition engines is reviewed.  In addition to higher performance, there are opportunities to improve the ECE-15 vehicle fuel economy by up to 15%.  Added friction from the VVT system itself could ho
wever significantly depreciate the potential benefit.  A selected number of VVT concepts developed by Ford are described.  (Author Abstract)
