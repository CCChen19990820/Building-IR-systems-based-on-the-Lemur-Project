MIN'S EXCLUSIVE ANALYSES OF THE WEEKLIES'/BIWEEKLIES' 1995 AD PAGES:
"FORBES" FOUR-PEATS; "TIME" BEATS "NEWSWEEK" BY A "NEWT."

If American voters support Presidential candidate Steve Forbes in 1996
in the manner that advertisers have supported his magazine since 1992,
he can start pre-paring his guest list for his January 20, 1997,
inauguration.  For in the business magazines' 1995 ad-page race,
Forbes won by 731.47 and 1,350.38 "landslides" over Business Week and
Fortune, respectively.  Since 1991, when BW last beat Forbes, the
biweekly's ad pages have shot up by 977.60 to last year's 4,543.60
(+27.38% versus 1991; +9.32% versus 1994).  It is a fine salute to the
just-retired vp-advertising/promotion Steve Nicoll, who worked at the
magazine for 31 years (10 fewer than editor Jim Michaels).

* House Speaker Newt Gingrich's impact on Washington, D.C., made him
Time's 1995 "Man of the Year" (see page 1), and Newt's puss on the De-
cember 25 cover provided the difference of the year in Time's 19.10 ad-
page margin over Newsweek.  The latter's associate publisher, Greg
Osberg, is not perturbed, telling min that "exclude the intra-company
'affiliated' ad pages [19.60 out of Newsweek's 2,299.10], and we win
hands down."  Whatever, the change in the Time managing editor lineup--
Walter Isaacson for Jim Gaines--should add further spice to the 1996
contest.  And don't yet count out U.S. News & World Report, which
finished third last year (-5.71%) after being the newsweeklies' champ
from 1992 through 1994.

* Although USN&WR was one of only seven out of the 31
weeklies/biweeklies to lose ad pages in 1995, the overall momentum
from 1994 continued.  If the monthlies' performance is a barometer,
then this year should start slowly...except for Financial World
(-11.96% in 1995), which--believe it or not--expects to set an all-
time ad-page record (dating back to 1902) with its January 16
"Forecast 500" issue.  In min next week: weeklies'/biweeklies' year-
end "numbers crunch" plus fourth-quarter and five-year data.

OKLA. CITY HORROR GENERATED--PROBABLY--NEWSWEEKLIES' 1995 BEST-
SELLERS.

The horrific photograph of firefighter Chris Fields holding the
lifeless body of one-year-old Baylee Almon--among the youngest of the
169 victims of the April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing of the Alfred
Murrah Federal Building--unofficially produced the second consecutive
unanimous best-sellers for Newsweek/Time/U.S. News & World Report (May
1 issues), thus matching the obituary of Jacqueline Onassis (May 30,
1994, issues).  We qualify the USA Today compilation (in its December
18 edition) because it doesn't take into account November and December
issues, which  often affect the standings.  Our comprehensive
"official" listings appear in March.

(October 16) edged "Howard Stern Gets Serious" (November 20); (2)
Sports Illustrated--the August 21 obituary of Mickey Mantle followed
the omnipresent "Swimsuit" leader (February 20); (3) Ladies' Home

Gifford (April); and (4) Disney Adventures--December's all-in-the-

IN MIN'S "GUESS 'TIME'S' MAN OF THE YEAR" CONTEST: RUNAWAY VOTE-GETTER
RABIN LEAVES NEWT KNOTTED IN RUNNER-UP TIE.

When the newsweekly's editors deferred to Pope John Paul II as "Man of
the Year" 12 months ago, many thought ascendant House Speaker Newt
Gingrich deserved the honor.  But when Gingrich--who is now dropping
like a rock in the polls as rigor mortis sets in on the idled U.S.
government--was named this year's designee (December 25, 1995/January
1, 1996), some felt the Pontiff, fresh from a whirlwind East Coast
visit, better fit the bill.  Such is life when it comes to choosing
Time's annual honoree.  

* The 125 entrants in min's sixth annual "Name Time's Man of the Year"
contest experienced a few difficulties of their own.  While Gingrich
tied with computing pioneer Bill Gates for second place in the min
tallies (15 votes apiece, or 11.9%), Yitzhak Rabin (part of Time's
quartet of 1993 winners) won going away.  But even though the late
Israeli prime minister garnered 35 min votes (28%), no dead
person--not even JFK after his 1963 assassination--has ever been
selected since "Man of the Year's" inception in 1923.  Other popular
choices: Internet (13 votes); O.J. Simpson (12); Bill Clinton and
Colin Powell (five each); and Cal Ripken, Jr., and Balkans leaders
Izetbegovic/Milosevic/Tudjman (four each).

* As for min's prize-winning prognosticators, ad sales rep Ed Bowen
takes the cake--and our $350 first-place check.  Not only was our top
dog the first to pick Gingrich--who represents the Marietta, Ga.-based
Bowen Group principal in Congress--but he also clicked on both
tiebreakers (Winston Churchill was Time's "Man of the Half-Century"
[1949], with Mikhail Gorbachev named "Man of the 1980s" [1989]). 
Runners-up Elizabeth Ruch, who works with NAA's Newspaper National
Network, and paper market analyst Mak Kenyon of A.T. Clayton & Co. get
min checks for $175 and $75, respectively.  

* We also salute these 12 readers who correctly named Gingrich but
finished out of the money either because of filing later than our
winners or missing the tie-breakers:

WITH THE MPA'S PRE-CHRISTMAS REALIGNMENT: IT'S COLEMAN-TO-KENNEY,
ROUND 3.

"I thought I was finished with Tom," jokes Reader's Digest publisher
Greg Coleman, "but I guess the gods wouldn't accept it."  He is
referring to this trifecta: (1) the November promotion of Reader's
Digest Association/USA president Tom Kenney to president of RDA's
Global Magazine/Corporate Development unit; (2) last month's election
of Kenney as chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America board of
directors; and (3) the fact that it makes Kenney serve as Coleman's
"boss" for the third time.  When Kenney moved up at RDA, it seemingly
ended a direct working relationship with Coleman that dated back to
the early 1980s at Woman's Day, and entered a second phase at RD in
1990 (min, November 13, 1995).  But Kenney's MPA election--made
necessary by the resignations of Claeys Bahrenburg and Francis
Pandolfi--puts him in charge of the 1996 American Magazine Conference
[October 13-16], which is being put together by a team led
by...Coleman.  If he and Kenney work as well with the AMC as they did
at RD, it should be an acceptable--and "Digest-ible"--affair.  Con-
ference details are to come.
       * Coleman and Kenney set a precedent with two executives from the
same company holding key MPA positions, but a more significant
precedent is the election of Essence Communications founder
(1970)/publisher/ceo Ed Lewis as MPA secretary (succeeding Kenney). 
Lewis is the first African-American to serve on the board of
directors, and if the ascension proceeds accordingly, he will be
chairman in 1998.

JOE OSTROW IS A CONTENTED CABLE CAMPER.

       Later in January, he will celebrate his "sweet 16" (months, that
is) as Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau president/ceo, and Ostrow
tells min that his industry's best of times is now.  He points to the
November sweeps that showed the combined ABC/CBS/NBC/Fox audience down
to 53% (from 59%) in November 1995, and basic cable's best-ever 19.5
rating for the week ending December 10.  "The 'sea change' is perman-
ent," he says. "Viewers are looking for programs more closely aligned
with their particular tastes and interests, and it is time for [ad]
agencies to realize that the broadcast networks are on a perpetual
downslide." 
* Ostrow, who spent three decades on the agency side (most with
FCB/Leber Katz Worldwide Worldwide), concurs with McCann-Erickson
Worldwide senior vp Bob Coen's +14% cable-advertising forecast for
1996, but disagrees with the $5.3 billion sum.  "Bob used an old $2.31
billion figure for 1994 as his base, which was later adjusted by Niel-
sen, Competitive Media Reporting, and others to over $3 billion.  We
should exceed $6 billion this year."  As for overall 1996 advertising,
Ostrow predicts a "strong first half, with the second-half outcome
predicated on the presidential candidates [who they are], and how
successful new business ventures are.  I'm bifocused."

TICKETMASTER GOES "LIVE!" WITH 40 AD PAGES IN MAGAZINE DEBUT.

     When the curtain goes up on Live! January 23 (February issue), it
will be more than just another of some 800+ magazine launches
anticipated in 1996.  At least that's what its parent, Ticketmaster
Corp., hopes.  Under editor Annie Gilbar and publisher Carole Ference
(ex-House Beautiful), the company believes it can exploit its
entertainment world contacts and vast database of people who regularly
attend live events to forge its place among entertainment magazines. 
With $1.6 billion in 1994 sales, the giant ticket "middleman" may be
on to something.  In its debut, Live!--the brainchild of Ticketmaster
chief Fred Rosen--will run 40 ad pages from the likes of Estee Lauder
and Chrysler Corp..  In coming months, Ference and her sales staff (ad
director is Hearst alumnus Michael Petruncola) will duke it out with
the likes of Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, Rolling Stone, and US for
the almighty ad dollar.  In her first pitch, Ference tells us, "We
know who entertainment customers are and what they buy.  And we have
many ways to reach them: the magazine itself, concert promotions,
ticket stub backs, customer databases, even the Ticketmaster Web site"
(http://ticketmaster.com).  Let the battle begin.

RON GALOTTI AS MATINEE IDOL?  NO...BUT HE GETS A TASTE OF SOAP
STARDOM.

     This Monday (January 8), the Vogue publisher can be seen--and maybe
heard--on a segment of the ABC-TV soap-opera "The City" that airs at
12:30 p.m. (Eastern).  Galotti plays a magazine publisher (who else?)
hosting a party attended by "The City" star Morgan Fairchild.  Whether
this turns into a recurring role will depend on his "Q" rating, which--
if the magazine community comprised the entire viewing audience--would
go through the roof.  As of now, Galotti is not a nominee for any of the
Soap Opera Digest awards, which are scheduled for a Valentine's Day
telecast (during the "heart" of the February sweeps) on NBC-TV at 9 p.m.

PIB: 1995 MAGAZINE AD $$$ SHOULD BREAK THE $10 BILLION BARRIER.

     The 201 measured Publishers Information Bureau magazines need to
accumulate $805.1 million in December 1995 ad revenues to achieve the
goal, and that should be a cinch, given that the then-185 PBI members
totaled $825.0 million in December 1994.  Still, last month's ad-page
slowdown (the monthlies in min's boxscores were cumulatively -1.15%)
will be reflected in the ad-revenue differential, which will be nowhere
near December 1995's +18.0%. Year-end results will be in the January 15
min; January-through-November categorical data are below:

figures should be viewed with caution.

AT&T TO OFFER ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE

Through its Consumer Communications Services business unit, AT&T has
just filed a proposal with the FCC to offer an "electronic directory
assistance" service. The service, which as of yet has not been
officially named, becomes effective January 18, according to
spokesman Bruce Reid.
 The service targets high-volume directory assistance users (banks,
financial services firms and retailers, for instance). Subscribers
access the service via an identification code and password through
either AT&T's Accunet(R) Packet Service or through the originating
telco packet switch network. The prices vary according to which
method of access subscribers choose. Using Accunet, the price is a
$2500-per- month subscription fee, plus a $22-per-hour holding time
charge, and 35 cents per screen. Using the local telco, the price
would run $500 for the monthly subscription fee, $22 hourly holding,
and 40 cents per screen. (This pricing structure is Southwestern
Bell's; other telcos may vary.) Mr. Reid pointed out that "a nickel
difference between per- screen charges doesn't seem like much, but
with the volume of accesses expected, these fees will most likely
balance out." He also added, "We are offering a promotion for those
who order an installation by February 28. We'll waive the monthly fee
through March (subscribers begin paying it in April), plus we're
offering one free ID and password--a savings of $100."
 What do subscribers get for their investment? Access to the same
screens directory assistance operators call up in response to
customer inquiries. When the EDA service starts up in January, the
Southwestern Bell area listings will be available. AT&T is
negotiating with the other RBOCs and hopes to work out agreements
with all of them for complete national access to directory assistance
listings.
 U S WEST has also agreed to have its directory assistance listings
available on the AT&T service, but not until a pending waiver request
is granted and tariff filed. U S WEST's proposed Electronic White
Pages (EWP) service was originally formulated when AT&T approached U
S WEST about the plans for this electronic directory assistance
product. U S WEST opted to build and maintain the database
themselves, making AT&T a non-exclusive distributor of the
information. As stated in the December, 1989 issue of The Morgan
Report, U S WEST has plans for other vendors to offer the database,
although AT&T is the only one in place at this time. Several sources
intimated that NYNEX would also be entering into an agreement with
AT&T, but this was not confirmed as of press time.
 TMR wonders what impact an electronic (computer-access) directory
assistance service will have on the white pages CD-ROM products on
the market. A number of niche markets for the CD-ROM products would
not be touched, such as smaller companies with local and regional
markets, and those using the CD-ROM white pages for  specialized
searching. But the big-dollar markets, including banks and retailers
with large volume look-up requirements, and for whom up-to- the-
minute accuracy is important, are likely purchasers of this service.
 Several RBOC's and private firms currently offer white page listings
on CD-ROM. None has national coverage. All of these companies have
acknowledged intense customer interest in obtaining national
coverage. TMR sees the potential for this new national electronic
directory assistance service to take business away from the CD-ROM
products. However, since the CD-ROM products offer more developed
searching features, they will probably remain competitive in certain
niche markets, attracting users in areas such as law enforcement,
market research and bill collection. These white page databases,
among the largest in the world, have been sought after by a number of
publishers.  Some have sought to link all seven RBOC's in some
fashion, but none has been successful at it. If AT&T pulls all the
RBOC's together to create what is effectively a gateway into these
seven physically separate databases, it will be a first. TMR expects
mounting activity in this area as the complex legal issues
surrounding ownership of this information continue to be explored.
Ownership and access to this information is of major interest to all
those professionally involved in building information products.
 Editor's Note: At press time, it was reported that AT&T has also
reached agreement with CompuServe to offer its 800 number database on-
 line to CompuServe's over 500,000 subscribers free of connect time
charges. An AT&T spokesperson preferred to characterize the
arrangement as a "unique form of directory assistance" and not a
foray into electronic publishing. TMR will continue to watch with
interest as AT&T continues its slow but seemingly inevitable movement
toward becoming a major player in electronic and possibly print
publishing.

AMERICAN BUSINESS INFORMATION'S BUSINESS INFOLINE

American Business Information, Inc. (Omaha, NE) has begun a 900-
number directory assistance service based on its business information
database.
 Called "Business Infoline," the service provides live operator-
assisted access to ABI's database of U.S. yellow page listing
information. Operators can conduct searches by category (type of
company), company name, partial name, or area code and phone number.
Geographical searches can be done on the basis of city, three- or
five- digit ZIP code, state, or nationwide. In addition to names,
addresses and phone numbers, operators can give users additional
information on a company based on its yellow page advertising
profile. For instance, one caller wanted to know if a particular
florist also carried balloons. Based on the company's advertising,
the operator was able to determine that yes, the florist did in fact
sell balloons.
 According to Bill Chasse, vice president of online products with
ABI, the most frequent calls so far have been requests for phone
numbers when the whereabouts of a company is unknown. "About half of
the calls from our business clients are consumer-oriented. For
instance, one man had his windshield broken. He called us to find the
nearest windshield repair shop, after he looked in the yellow pages
and found there weren't any suitable shops in the local area it
covered."
 Usage of the service has reportedly been very good. "When we first
launched the service, we estimated calls would last an average of 3
minutes. We have found that calls are actually averaging 6-8
minutes," Mr. Chasse said. "When the first request gets a hit, the
caller gets excited and can generally think of a number of other look-
up requests."
 The cost is $2 for the first minute and $1 for each additional
minute. Mr. Chasse explained that it doesn't take callers long to
figure out the economics: "They know if they have their look-ups
ready to go, our operators can do quite a few searches in that one or
two minutes."
 Business Infoline is intended both for business customers and
consumers. Marketing has been conducted via press releases on a
regular basis to a database of 5,000 media personnel and space
advertising in a number of business-
oriented publications (such as the Wall Street Journal, and The
Washingtonian). "We have primarily been marketing to our existing
customers by including flyers and information sheets in every order
and mailing we send them. Starting the first of the year, we will be
doing a little direct mail, sending out a plastic card people can
keep in a wallet; we realize how important it is that people remember
the number," explained Mr. Chasse. "We will also be stepping up our
consumer-oriented advertising, with TV and space advertising geared
toward them. We see the Infoline as a 60% consumer, 40% business
service."
 The Morgan Report has been watching 900 numbers as a potentially
excellent way to distribute directory information and charge for it
easily. But success in 900 numbers is a pure dollars equation. The
question is, can you afford enough promotion to build adequate call
volume? A company can have the slickest service in the world, but it
cannot prosper if people don't know about it.
 TMR expects to see a lot more directory publishers looking into 900
numbers. The ability to offer live operators assistance on 900 lines
is a fairly recent development, and should make 900 that much more
attractive to many directory publishers.
 Interested TMR subscribers may call the "Business Infoline" at
900/896-6000.
 Editor's Note: As TMR expected, American Business Information, Inc.
will be launching a new CD-ROM product based on its nationwide
database of approximately 8.3 million companies. The information is
not current, published about 4-5 months after the publication of the
yellow page directories from which it is culled, but searching will
be sophisticated. TMR will be watching this product closely. It is

PUBLISHING SUBSIDIARY
 Oracle Corporation (Belmont, CA), reportedly the world's largest
supplier of database software and the third largest software and
services company, has announced the formation of a new publishing
subsidiary. The new company is called Oracle Data Publishing (ODP).
 ODP's charter is to provide its customers access to a variety of
computer-based information services which can assist them in making
critical business decisions. It will acquire and sell, in electronic
format, a broad range of data and information which many Oracle
customers already use in print form. Dick Brass, a pioneer in the
field of electronic publishing, has been named president of the new
subsidiary.
 "Oracle Data Publishing is a natural extension of our proven
expertise in database software and services," said Larry Ellison,
Oracle's president and CEO. "With ODP, we will give customers the
information they need in addition to the software required to access
and manipulate that information."
 According to Mr. Brass, the growing transition from printed to
electronic information distribution, coupled with the proliferation
of database management software, makes Oracle a logical entrant into
the data publishing arena.
 Prior to joining Oracle, Dick Brass was founder of General
Information (Kirkland WA), which publishes The National Directory of
Addresses and Telephone Numbers, and other products in both print and
electronic formats. Before General Information, Mr. Brass acquired
the exclusive electronic rights to a number of important reference
works, including The Random House Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, and
Black's Law Dictionary.
 This development is an important one to watch. Oracle is well-known
for its aggressiveness in its markets, one of which is now in the
directory realm. No specifics were available on products planned, but
rollout of its first products are expected within the year.

U S WEST ON SPECIALTY DIRECTORY PUBLISHING

U S WEST is the only Regional Bell to refrain from publishing
directories outside the traditional yellow page arena. The Morgan
Report recently spoke to Philip Unger, director of marketing with U S
WEST Direct, about the company's point of view on specialty directory
publishing, which should be of interest to all directory publishers.
 "We did analyze the possible needs for specialty directory
products," Mr. Unger said. "Our first conclusion was to concentrate
on our 14- state area. Otherwise, outside our region,  we felt we'd
start with two strikes against us" in an unfamiliar publishing
venture in an unfamiliar market.
 "We also scoped out the size of the breadbox, and saw that there is
a lot less money (in specialty publishing) than we're used to in the
traditional yellow page arena. We saw that the margins would be much
lower--with increased costs for distribution, sales, databases--
particularly the distribution database, where we'd be starting from
scratch. The sales cost would be much higher per dollar of revenue,
so we saw publishing specialty directories would be smaller in
revenues and in profit.
 "After we had looked at size, we looked at need. We didn't want to
just throw something out there--it would have to meet a real need.
And there would have to be a high quality editorial effort as well,
to create strong editorial content--
not just a 95% advertising product. We made a list of the top 20
specialty directories that would fit into our region. We prioritized
them, and did a business case on two of them. We found that we
couldn't both meet the need and make a profit. We could do a great
job but lose money, or we could cut corners and make money--and have
it fail the second or third year. We didn't like either of those
options."
 Mr. Unger said that U S WEST Direct continues to look at specialty
publishing, but doesn't want to go into it for the PR value alone.
"We are in business to meet needs and keep shareholders happy."
 It should be a reassuring note to non-yellow page directory
publishers that despite virtually unlimited resources, the RBOC
publishing organizations have such a high cost of doing business that
there are few directory opportunities they can justify pursuing. The
thinking is becoming increasing common among the RBOC's, that few, if
any, start- up directory opportunities are worth the risk.

AMERICAN EXPORT REGISTER DISCOUNT OFFER

An unusual renewal program instituted by Thomas International
Publishing Company (New York, NY) for its American Export Register
recently came to The Morgan Report's attention. "This program, the
Qualified Lifetime Subscriber Program, allows all overseas buyers who
purchase their first set at the full retail price ($120) an 85%
credit toward all future consecutive editions they purchase,"
explained circulation director Ms. Renate Oechsner.
 The program was first offered to purchasers of the '87-88 edition
when it came time for them to purchase the '88-89 edition of the
Register. Ms. Oechsner said that the response to the offer "has been
very nice. People are even paying by credit card, because the price
is low; it used to be such a hassle for them to get a check in U.S.
funds and send it."
 The reason given for the program, which reduces renewal subscription
rates to shipping costs ($18 surface, $39 air mail), is an effort to
build circulation. "It does our advertisers no good if people buy one
year and not for the next four." As many publishers have suffered, so
the Register has suffered the whims of those who go several years
before updating to a new edition of the directory. Because the
American Export Register is primarily advertising-based, fluctuating
sales are particularly exasperating. "With increased circulation, our
advertisers will be happy, and more will want to get into the
Register--the two things go hand in hand, and hopefully will get
better and better," Ms. Oechsner added.
 According to Ms. Oechsner, the directory is "not quite controlled
circulation (with this program), but we do qualify (subscribers) with
a questionnaire. It helps give us develop information we can then
give to advertisers, such as where subscribers buy materials and how
many companies they have contacted through the directory."
 The American Export Register is an annual guide to U.S. products and
services available for export. It targets "businessmen,
industrialists, and government buyers worldwide." The directory is
comprised of a two-volume set.
 This move by Thomas is interesting because it creates a whole new
relationship with subscribers. It asks them to pay for a directory
the first time around, proving their interest and setting the value
of the directory. From then on, only a small annual maintenance fee
(enough to cover shipping) is required to continue receiving future
editions. This pricing strategy allows Thomas to offer advertisers a
paid subscriber base, and the nominal price allows Thomas to offset
some of its costs--important with the cost of shipping a two-volume
directory overseas. The final benefit to Thomas is that the nominal
invoice it renders each year is a continued check on subscriber
interest and helps keep the circulation file clean and current.
Overall, this strategy may be worth looking into, even for some
domestic buying guides.

MARKET OVERVIEW: ADOPTION DIRECTORIES

The Morgan Report has noticed a rise in activity in the field of
adoption information. A variety of first-edition directories covering
this information have appeared in the last 12 months or so, building
on the hodge-podge of directories and directory sections of other
publications already published. Here's the run-down:
 The Adoption Directory (Gale Research, Inc.). Billed as "a guide to
agencies, state laws on adoption, exchanges, support groups, and
professional service in domestic and international adoption,
including foster parenting and biological options." The directory is
arranged alphabetically within subject-oriented chapters, and is
supported by keyword, agency name and geographical indexes.
Approximately 1,500 listings are included. A typical agency listing
covers information on application procedures, prerequisites, fees,
length of waiting time for a child, and a description of the children
placed. It sells for $55.
 CWLA's Guide to Adoption Agencies: A National Directory of Adoption
Agencies and Adoption Resources (Child Welfare League of America).
Editor: Julia L. Posner (with James Guilianelli, contributing
editor). This directory appears to be in direct competition with the
Gale directory. This directory has going for it the prestige of being
associated with the Child Welfare League--no small benefit. The
directory sells for $15.95.
 Adoption: The Guide to Successful Adoptions (Ulick Publishing
Company). Another newcomer to the field, but in a magazine format.
Julia Posner contributed the section on traditional agency adoption;
she is, as noted above, the editor of CWLA's Guide. The magazine
targets adoptive or prospective adoptive parents, and others seeking
to wade through the adoption mire. The National Adoption Directory,
comprises half the magazine's pages and lists "adoption facilitators"
state-by-state, within categories (agencies, case workers,
foundations, lawyers, support groups, etc.). The directory only
includes those who returned questionnaires. The reason given for this
is the desire only to present those "who want to help with your
adoption." A number of adoption facilitators have their hands full
and chose not to list. Listings include name, contact name, address,
phone, local or national operation, and number of years in operation.
A banner at the end of the directory section states that more
listings will appear in the next issue of Adoption magazine. The
cover price for the magazine is $5 an issue, $30 per year
(bimonthly). Revenues are generated by subscription; no advertising
is included.
 Adoption: Parenthood Without Pregnancy (Henry Holt and Company). The
directory content is secondary, with an appendix listing agencies and
support groups. The last edition published was 1986, which sold for
$18.45.
 Adoption Resource Book (Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.). The
directory section is secondary and covers public and private adoption
agencies and support groups. Listings include agency name, address,
phone, and special requirements. The latest edition was published in
November, 1987 and sold for $17.95 (hardbound); $8.85 (softbound).
 Our Child: Preparing for Parenting in Adoption--Instructor's Guide
(Our Child Press). This directory lists as part of its appendixes
audiovisual aids, resources, books, and periodicals available to
those teaching courses on adoptive parenting. The last issue was
published in 1988, with another due out perhaps in 1990. The primary
content of the publication is a curriculum guide for instructors of
new parents.
 SourceList (Committee for Single Adoptive Parents). This is an
annual directory of about 50 agencies and organizations that are
sources of adopted children accepting unmarried applicants. It has
international coverage. The listings are geographically arranged and
sell for $15 including three updates, but the directory is sold only
to unmarried members of the organization.
 Discussion: The activity in this market appears to be an example of
social tide driving the need for (and the provision of) information.
It is unusual for several directories with virtually the same content
and scope to appear at the same time, as is the case with the CWLA
and Gale directories. Gale has a strong hold on the library market,
and the CWLA directory has substantial prestige behind it. How well
these directories fare will depend in large part on how well they
reach their target markets. Other opportunities in this field seem to
lie in areas touched but not yet fully developed. For example,
SourceList covers an important and needed body of information, but is
seriously undermarketed, and has the potential for greater
information development. TMR expects more titles in this field
because the need for information continues to grow, and new user
constituencies are likely to emerge, bringing with them a need for
more timely and detailed information in this field.

BARCLAYS LAUNCHES SHARE DEALING BY VIDEO

Barclays Bank has unveiled the BarclayZone interactive sharedealing and
information service, a prototype version of which went live on Monday
in three branches, Fenchurch Street, City of London, Crawley, West
Sussex, and Maidstone, Kent.

The system, developed by Barclays Multimedia, the bank's interactive
technology unit, has no keyboard, and customers operate the terminal by
touching the screen. The menu of options includes simple tutorials
about financial topics such as the stock market. For #2.50, paid by
credit card, users can obtain investment opinions on any of 100 FTSE
and a further 25 popular stocks from a printer built into the system.
It also offers a real-time account of City news via a MarketEye screen.

Unlike the touchscreen PC-based sharedealing service which National
Westminster Bank has operated in its high street network since 1986,
BarclayZone includes a videoconferencing link to an adviser at Barclays
Stockbrokers' head office in Glasgow. This is used for buying and
selling shares, with dealing costs starting at #15, the same as dealing
by telephone.

The same video technology could allow Barclays, subject to customer
acceptance, to offer a broad range of financial services such as
insurance, tax services and mortgage advice through computer screens in
bank branches or kiosks in public places. Last year, it set up
BarclaySquare, an Internet-based electronic shopping mall, as well as
an interactive information service for its customers on the Internet.

SILICON GRAPHICS EXPERIENCES REVENUE SLOWDOWN

Silicon Graphics, the US graphics workstation vendor, warned that
earnings per share for its second quarter to 31 December 1995 would be
around 30 cents, down from 34 cents a year earlier. It also said
revenues would rise by only 23% to $675m from $550m in the same quarter
of 1994.

Analysts had predicted 43 cents a share and a 40-45% increase in
revenues for Silicon Graphics' second quarter. Following the profit
warning, which led to an immediate 16% drop in Silicon Graphics' share
price, analysts cut their earnings estimates for the financial year to
30 June 1996 by 15-20%.

Chairman Edward McCracken said revenue growth in Europe and North
America had not met the company's expectations, due to a slowdown in
sales to the US government as a result of federal budget uncertainties
and also to economic slowdowns in the UK, France and Germany. Sales via
third party channels were below expectations, he added. Revenues were
also affected by customers who decided to wait for a new range of high-
performance Silicon Graphics computers due to be launched this month
based on the new R1000 microprocessor.

Silicon Graphics has been experiencing annual revenue growth of 45-50%
over the last few years, more than double the growth rate for the
entire workstation market. Capitalising on demand for graphical
workstations in fast-growing markets such as video editing, Web site
design and computer game development, Silicon Graphics is now number
three behind Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.

Analysts said that although Silicon Graphics faces a threat from
aggressive price cuts by Sun Microsystems and the new breed of high-
specification multimedia PCs, it does not face any long-term problems.
Its 23% second quarter growth rate is above the industry average, for
example, and its new Indigo2 Impact workstation, launched in the second
quarter, has received an "outstanding" response from customers.

EPIC RECEIVES 3I CASH INJECTION

Brighton-based Epic Multimedia Group has received #1m in funding from
venture capitalists 3i.

EMG, which was set up in 1985 as a multimedia production company
working for corporate clients such as the BBC, National Westminster
Bank and BT, will use the funding to expand its consumer game and
educational CD-ROM publishing activities. "We are looking to develop
our own content with reduced involvement from large publishing co-
funders", says managing director Jim Brathwaite.

EMG is also preparing for a flotation sometime next year, says newly-
appointed finance director Andrew Duncan. However, Mr Duncan stresses
that the timing and access route for a public offering have yet to be
determined. The options under review include joining London's new
Alternative Investment Market for smaller stocks or a full listing on
the Stock Exchange. New York's Nasdaq is also a possibility, given the
importance of the US market to EMG, Mr Duncan says.

EMG, which in November 1995 completed a #1m private placing of
convertible loanstock with Henry Cooke Lumsden, has quadrupled in size
over the last two years and now has a staff of around 150. In May 1994
it raised #1.5m from UK venture capitalists Quester and from Dutch-
based Atlas Venture.

In an interview published in the Financial Times management report
Financing Multimedia in Europe by Janet Robson, Gerard Montanus of
Atlas Venture said that Atlas sees multimedia as a specific niche
market within IT. Multimedia companies such as EMG are currently
regarded and valued more like IT businesses than as publishing
businesses, Mr Montanus suggested. Atlas typically invests in companies
for four to six years, normally structuring its deals as equity and
subsequently putting in follow-on capital.

Publishing partnerships

EMG's publishing division has four separate units - Learning,
Entertainment, Medical & Healthcare, and Lifestyle. It develops CD-ROM
and CD-i titles in association with major international companies, but
retains significant intellectual property rights. Its $3.6m three-year
development funding and publishing deal with Time Warner Interactive
provides EMG with marketing and distribution channels for releases such
as Thumbelina, a children's title based on an animated Warner Bros
feature film by Don Bluth of the Hans Andersen story.

EMG Publishing is involved in three multimedia development operations -
the Spice Factory joint venture with film producers Jason Piette and
Michael Cowen specialising in fantasy/adventure games as well as films
and TV programmes; Eagle Peak, a collaboration with independent
producer New Media Vision specialising in interactive comic books and
encyclopaedias; and children's and educational publisher Labyrinth.

EMG provides all the funding for each of these companies but gives the
individual developers an equity stake in their own venture in addition
to considerable creative independence.

Eagle Peak is developing the Takeru series of CD-ROM titles based on
the highly-popular Japanese-language comic books of the same name.
Labyrinth is working on a number of CD-ROM titles funded by Time Warner
Interactive such as the multimillion pound project Drowned God
(previously given the code name Iron Horse), tipped as TWI's lead for
its Christmas 1996 release schedule.

The Spice Factory is developing a CD-ROM game jointly funded by EMG
Publishing and film company Pachyderm (a subsidiary of Goldcrest Films)
based on the science fiction film Space Truckers. The game is being pre-
sold country by country with the film. Spice Factory is also due to
release its first feature film, The Killer Tongue, this year.

Although 50-60% of EMG's business comes from its long-established
corporate communications work, it sees most of its future growth coming
from consumer multimedia publishing. In addition, EMG has set up a team
to design user interfaces for interactive TV networks such as BT's East
Anglian trial for which EMG also produced National Westminster Bank's
interactive banking interface.

Another significant growth area for EMG is likely to be the Internet.
Just before Christmas, Scotland Online, a joint venture between
Scottish Telecom and cartoon publisher D.C. Thompson, went live with
Web pages designed by EMG Interactive, EMG's corporate communications
division. In addition to the corporate Web site market, EMG sees great
potential for its intellectual properties in consumer Internet
publishing and games-on-demand.

1996 is likely to be an exciting year for EMG's CD-ROM publishing
division, with the launch of the first fruits of its three publishing
joint ventures. In addition, several major new titles are expected by
December which will eventually be available over the Internet, says Jim
Brathwaite. He also promises a deal with an unspecified UK partner to
produce a CD-ROM and hard copy tie-in.

INNER WORKINGS INTERIM SALES AHEAD

Inner Workings plc, the Glasgow-based CD-ROM developer, reported sales
of #186,911 for the six months to 30 September 1995, compared to
#24,142 a year earlier.

The loss on ordinary activities widened to #115,736 from #65,983 last
time, reflecting the company's investment in production facilities and
staff outlined in its prospectus at  its Alternative Investment Market
flotation last August. Inner Workings raised #1m net of costs to fund
expansion through its share placing.

Alistair King of London stockbrokers Charles Stanley predicts that
Inner Workings will become profitable in 1997 and suggests that it
might be acquired by a larger concern interested in its skilled staff.

Last year the company completed the first two titles in a range of four
children's CD-ROMs for Oxford University Press, The Fish Who Could Wish
and A Christmas Story. Eight foreign language versions of these titles
are under active negotiation, with the first of these due for delivery
to the European market by spring 1996. The remaining two OUP children's
titles, Winnie the Witch and Dragons, will be launched in May.

Chairman Lesley Keen says Inner Workings has established the
foundations of an advanced software engineering facility which is
intended to be used to produce the company's own educational and games
software. The first "own brand" title is planned to go into production
in late spring 1996.

The first product in a three-title CD-ROM deal with Reed Consumer Books
is expected to be released for the Christmas 1997 market, says Ms Keen.


Inner Workings is close to signing a co-production deal with a major
global publisher on a children's activity game title for the Christmas
1996 market, and is entering the prototype development phase on a CD-
ROM title for Philips Media for the US market.

APPLE, REPRISE RECORDS IN NEW MEDIA PARTNERSHIP

Apple Computer is to work together with Warner Music label Reprise
Records to promote Reprise artists in tandem with Apple new media
technology and software. The collaboration will include joint
promotions, co-launching products such as enhanced CDs and cross-
promoting Web sites.

Apple is already working with UK-based record company EMI's new
multimedia division to produce enhanced CDs, soundcarriers which can be
played like ordinary audio CDs or run on a CD-ROM drive to view the
text and video they contain. In December Apple and EMI opened the Abbey
Road Interactive multimedia studio in London.

Reprise already has a reputation for innovative use of Apple technology
in its recording studios. Its Web site, which runs on an Apple server
and features e-mail access to artists such as Neil Young, Morrissey and
Enya, receives around 20,000 hits a day. In addition, the label plans
to release its first three enhanced CDs in first quarter 1996.

POLYGRAM ISSUES PROFIT WARNING, BUYS GOLDWYN LIBRARY

PolyGram, the Philips-owned entertainment group, warned last month that
profits for 1995 would be static against 1994, following a poor second
half. In the six months to June 1995, PolyGram, which has achieved a
20% compound annual growth rate in net income since 1990, saw profits
rise 15%.

In 1994 PolyGram recorded pre-tax profits of Fl 1.08bn (#436m) on sales
of Fl 8.6bn. Chairman Alain Levy said the group would return to profit
growth this year, due to an improved album release schedule including
new work from artists such as Sting, U2 and the Cranberries. He blamed
1995's poor performance on a below-par release schedule in the second
half, delays in the delivery of big albums, the lack of a major film
hit and the strength of the guilder.

In a bid to expand its four-year-old film business, PolyGram agreed
last month to buy the film and TV library of The Samuel Goldwyn
Company, the financially troubled US film group, for $62m (#39m) in
cash. Goldwyn, which has been seeking capital to reduce its debts, sold
the rights to 850 feature films including recent productions such as
The Madness of King George and Much Ado About Nothing as well as
several TV series.

The deal follows PolyGram's $156m purchase last January of Los Angeles-
based ITC Entertainment which owns the rights to 350 feature films and
vintage TV series in addition to running a programming distribution
business. Last year PolyGram entered the video CD market with a batch
of releases including its 1994 movie hit Four Weddings and a Funeral
and titles from rock bands such as Wet Wet Wet, Abba and The Who.

For Alain Levy, the key word is "leverage" - squeezing more revenue
from PolyGram's copyright material by leveraging it across multiple
distribution channels. This explains PolyGram's interest in
establishing more TV channels along the lines of its music video
channel collaboration with Viacom subsidiary MTV, a customer for much
of its music. It hopes to sell Goldwyn's film back catalogue as a
package to cable and TV channels with new films from its PolyGram
Filmed Entertainment unit.

However, although Mr Levy has abandoned his initial scepticism about
the information highway and his company is actively setting up
promotional Web sites, he believes that electronic distribution of
music via the Internet will never replace physical retailing. "Buying
music is a social experience, and the packaging of a product is very
important", he says.

TOTAL CD-ROM UNIT SALES UP 125% IN 1995

The seventh edition of US consultancy InfoTech's Optical Industry
Publishing Assessment predicts that total 1995 worldwide unit sales of
CD-ROM titles rose by 125% to 206m from 91.8m in 1994. The reports
covers all categories of CD-ROM titles.

Worldwide CD-ROM title revenue rose by only 70% to $18.1bn from
$10.7bn, due to the rapid expansion of the consumer sector where steep
discounting prevails because of intense competition for shelfspace and
widespread bundling.

In 1994, just over 20% of total worldwide CD-ROM revenues were derived
from consumer sales, with the remainder coming from the professional,
corporate and educational markets. The number of consumer CD-ROM titles
in print doubled to over 3,000 in 1994 and is expected to have doubled
again in 1995.

InfoTech predicts that in 1995 the consumer sector grew to 24% of the
total CD-ROM market. Led by strong sales of multimedia home PCs, the
worldwide installed base of CD-ROM drives for both PCs (all platforms)
and TV set-top systems such as CD-i, Sega and 3DO grew to 26.9m in
1994, and is forecast to rise by over 80% to 49.5m in 1995.

In 1995, for the first time, more CD-ROM drives were sold in new PCs
than in multimedia upgrade kits, by a margin of more than 2 to 1.
Preliminary research for 1995 suggests that around 35% of notebooks
sold worldwide were CD-ROM equipped, InfoTech says. By the year 2000,
more than 80% of all desktop PCs will have a CD-ROM drive and at least
50% of all TV set-top systems will have a CD-ROM drive instead of or in
addition to a cartridge player.

APPLE WARNS OF CHRISTMAS QUARTER LOSS

Apple Computer warned that it would post a loss for its first quarter
ending 31 December 1995, stunning analysts who had predicted net
profits for the quarter of around $87m. Apple has traditionally enjoyed
big sales in the run-up to Christmas and in the quarter to December
1994 posted net profits of $188m.

Apple said that an aggressive price-cutting campaign begun in August
had failed to stimulate expected demand for its Macintosh computers in
its key markets of Japan and the US, leaving it with unsold inventory.
Analysts now expect Apple to drastically streamline its operations
through up to 2,000 job losses and speculate that it will seek a merger
partner or put itself up for sale. Speculation centres on IBM, Sony or
Oracle as the most likely buyers. Oracle is believed to have made an
offer for Apple's Newton personal digital assistant unit to support its
own mobile computing ambitions.

In the quarter to 30 September 1995 Apple regained lost market share
and its position as the largest PC manufacturer in the US market.
However, this was due mainly to existing Apple users upgrading their
systems. Apple's latest financial results suggest that it has failed to
persuade new purchasers that the Macintosh is better than its Intel-
Microsoft equivalent.

250,000 Apple computers in Germany in the fiscal year to 30 September
1996, 7% of the total market.

In the year to 30 September 1995, Apple's central European division
sold 220,000 computers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and eastern
Europe, generating a 21% rise in revenues to $573m. This year it is
looking for revenues of $800m in the region.

APPLE TARGETS 3D GRAPHICS MARKET

Apple hopes to exploit the relative confusion in the Intel-Microsoft
camp with regard to multimedia standards to provide a clear lead in the
low-cost 3D graphics market.

In November Apple launched the QuickDraw 3D graphics accelerator,
which, coupled with its QuickDraw 3D software, is claimed to increase
the speed of 3D rendering by up to 12 times. Plugging into the PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) slot on a Power Macintosh, the
graphics board costs #299.

Apple claims that a high-specification PowerMac equipped with the
QuickDraw board and software offers professional designers and
developers a low-cost alternative to a 3D graphics workstation from
market leader Silicon Graphics.

CIRRUS LOGIC DELAYS OFFERING AFTER PROFIT WARNING

Cirrus Logic, the US audio, video and graphics chip manufacturer, said
last month that it expects earnings of about 13-19 cents a share in its
third quarter to 31 December 1995, well below the consensus forecast of
44 cents. In the quarter to December 1994, Cirrus earned $14.5m net, or
46 cents a share.

Following a sharp drop in its share price in response to the profit
warning, Cirrus said it would delay a planned offering of 6m common
shares and $500m in convertible subordinated notes. It also said it
would reduce fiscal 1997 and 1998 capital expenditure by over $600m,
although it still intends to expand its manufacturing capacity during
1997-1999.

Cirrus has expanded over the last few years due to the growth in demand
for multimedia PCs. In the year to April 1995 it posted net profits of
$61.4m on sales of $889m, compared to net profits of $45.4m on sales of
$557.3m in 1994.

The company said results in the quarter to December had suffered from
softer than anticipated conditions in Taiwan and slower than expected
growth in the home PC market. Sales for the quarter ending March 1996
would depend on the success of several new graphics and audio products,
it added.

In November 1995, Cirrus warned that third quarter revenue growth would
be hit by reductions in orders for its multimedia chips from a major
customer, believed to be Intel. Analysts said Intel had cut its orders
because US computer manufacturer Packard Bell had stocked too many PC
motherboards containing a 32-bit Cirrus chip and had lost sales to 64-
bit versions from rival vendors such as Compaq. Packard Bell has also
suffered from overstocking of 75MHz Pentium-based PCs at a time when
consumers are opting for faster, competitively-priced PCs from other
vendors.

Tom Rigoli, vice president of corporate communications at Cirrus, said
that several customers are now seeking to have their advance chip
orders fulfilled sooner, suggesting a potential recovery in home PC
sales. Nevertheless, several key US analysts lowered their estimates of
Cirrus' earnings in fiscal 1997. Drew Peck of Cowen & Co, for example,
cut his forecast from $2.72 a share to $2.22.

AMSTRAD CUTS BACK CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ARM

Amstrad has announced a restructuring of its lossmaking Ace division
which produces a range of audio, video and satellite TV equipment for
the fiercely competitive consumer electronics market.

The decision to scale back Ace - once the core of Amstrad's empire -
and concentrate on Amstrad's higher-margin activities in direct PC
sales, modems and mobile telephones led to the resignation last month
of chief executive David Rogers, half way through a three-year
contract.

According to the Financial Times, an internal strategy paper was
presented to Amstrad's board last month warning that Ace could not be
revitalised and would not break even in the year to June 1996. In the
year ending 30 June 1995 Amstrad posted a pre-tax profit of #3.06m
after three years of losses and despite continuing losses at Ace
(Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/2/7).

ESCOM HIT BY PC PRICE WAR

Escom, the German PC manufacturer and retailer, says losses in calendar
1995 are expected to reach DM45m (#20.2m), due to the costs of its
rapid European expansion, weak fourth quarter sales and fierce price
cutting in the consumer market.

Sales rose from DM2.15bn in 1994 to only DM2.35bn last year, following
an "unsatisfactory" second half. In 1994 Escom posted profits of
DM11.1m.

Last May Escom bought over 200 Rumbelows stores in the UK, which it
expects to make "a considerable contribution to profits" in 1996.
Escom, which is the second largest PC vendor in Germany behind Vobis,
says it has completed its European expansion programme. It now has 455
European outlets compared to 268 at the end of 1994.

TIMETABLE FOR GERMAN TELECOM BILL AGREED

The German government and the main opposition party, the Social
Democratic Party, have agreed on a firm timetable for legislation to
liberalise the telecom market and end Deutsche Telekom's monopoly by 1
January 1998. A consensus on the main terms of the deregulation bill
had already been reached in November (Multimedia Business Analyst,
2/4/4).

This latest deal is important in ensuring that the legislation passes
both houses of parliament - the lower house (Bundestag) controlled by
the governing Christian Democrat/Free Democrat coalition and the upper
house (Bundesrat) controlled by the Social Democrats. It will go before
the Bonn cabinet on 24 January and parliamentary debate will begin next
month. With all-party consent, the new telecom bill is expected to
become law this summer.

This month, the Finance Ministry will hold a meeting to finally resolve
the political deadlock over the role of the telecom industry regulator
which will need to be set up prior to deregulation. It is thought
likely that the Finance Ministry will be responsible for the
government's stake in Deutsche Telekom after its partial privatisation
in late 1996 through a DM15bn share issue.

The bill will open up the DM75bn German telecom market, the third
largest in the world after the US and Japan, from 1998, while
preventing companies from abusing dominant positions. It will also pave
the way for an influx of investment by international telecom operators
such as BT, AT&T and Cable & Wireless, building on alliances they have
already formed with German companies.

The content of the bill will be largely as agreed by the political
parties in November. As well as paving the way for large operators to
offer nationwide services, the bill foresees a role for smaller and
medium-sized companies providing services. It will allow frequencies to
be made available locally to promote more competition through wireless
links.

The bill will also include an obligation on the government to ensure
the universal provision of affordable, high-standard telephone services
to all users. Telecom Minister Wolfgang Botsch says voice services
should have "advanced digital characteristics", ensuring that any
customer wanting ISDN services can expect to have them.

Providers of universal services - comprising standard home or office
services, pay telephones, directory enquiries and access to emergency
services - will be obliged to keep up with the latest technological
developments.

EC PASSES MOBILE TELEPHONE DEREGULATION DIRECTIVE

The EC announced before Christmas that a directive on mobile and
personal telecoms will come into effect from the beginning of January.
The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive and
special rights in the mobile communications sector for monopoly
operators and to establish fair and open licensing procedures.

Operators holding licences for one mobile service will be able to apply
to run all digital mobile services such as GSM, DCS 1800 minicell and
DECT cordless. Member states may not refuse to allocate licences for
public access/Telepoint applications using the DECT short-range system
or, from 1998, licences for mobile systems on the DCS 1800 standard.
Moreover, they may not restrict combinations of mobile technologies.
The directive also gives mobile operators the right to build their own
infrastructure or to make use of alternative telecom infrastructures
run by railways and utilities.

AT&T AND BROADBAND ANNOUNCE LOW-COST ATM BREAKTHROUGH

North Carolina-based BroadBand Technologies and AT&T Microelectronics
have developed a low-cost chipset which they claim will enable
affordable ATM broadband services to be transmitted directly over
ordinary copper telephone wire to homes and businesses.

Kris Nasta, vice president of BroadBand's European operations, says the
chips will deliver the full functionality of fibre-to-the-home networks
but at costs approaching that of a normal telephone service.
The Multipoint Broadband Access (MBA) chipset offers 52Mbps ATM
transmission and incorporates Broadband's switched digital video (SDV)
technology and AT&T's 16-CAP (carrierless amplitude and phase
modulation) encoding and compression system. BroadBand's FLX (FibreLoop
Access) SDV System transmits bi-directional interactive multimedia over
fibre-to-the-curb networks to groups of 20-30 houses via an Optical
Network Unit (ONU). Because of its use of 16-CAP, FLX can carry
analogue cable TV signals as well as interactive services into the home
over the same coax wire using a diplexer.

16-CAP allows the re-use of existing Category 3 unshielded twisted pair
(UTP) copper wiring, the standard for kerbside-to-home installation,
for digital ATM and telephony traffic. It eliminates the need for the
complex modulation schemes, adaptive equalisation, high-frequency
analogue tuning and forward error correction required by competing
encoding/modulation technologies, Mr Nasta says.

The MBA chips are already being implemented as part of planned
deployments of BroadBand's FLX SDV System by France Telecom and of AT&T
Network Systems' SLC-2000 Access with FLX SDV System by Southwestern
Bell and Disney's Celebration Community, a test-bed for interactive
communications being built in Orlando, Florida.

TELECOM COMPETITION SPURS MULTIMEDIA GROWTH

The liberalisation of voice telecommunications across the European
Union from 1998 will lead to the growth of new services, including
multimedia, as operators look for new sources of income, says a report
from Cambridge-based Analysys Publications.

Existing telecom players - cable TV companies, managed network service
providers and telecom operators (TOs) - are all looking to secure
advantage. New players such as rail and power companies, entrants
backed by industrial consortia and start-ups based on advanced
technologies are already breaking into the lucrative ECU129bn telecom
market which is growing at a rate of 7% per annum, says Paul Knott,
author of New Network Operators in Europe.

Many of the new entrants look set to pursue niche market strategies,
targeting their price and new services at particular groups of
customers, in contrast with the broader marketing strategies pursued by
the incumbents, says Mr Knott. As they are not hampered by legacy
infrastructure, new entrants are busy investing in modern network
technologies such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SDH
(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). SDH is a prerequisite for ATM and both
technologies are important in the delivery of multimedia services. The
table on page 9 summarises current and planned deployment of of ATM and
SDH by a range of regional and national licensed TOs, managed network
service providers and infrastructure suppliers.

To date, most new operators are concentrating on building an initial
market position with modern technology, but with a fairly basic range
of services. Unless they choose to compete solely on price, a strategy
at which only one operator can be successful, they will need to develop
new services to maintain their revenues in the longer term.

"While modern technologies can help new players avoid many of the
legacy issues which affect the incumbents, they would be wrong to
assume that it necessarily gives them a competitive advantage", says Mr
Knott. "New operators will have to translate technology capabilities
into end-user services such as LAN interconnection, Internet access,
business video and interactive multimedia services, if they want to
maximise the value of their investment."

Incumbent TOs will need to respond to these attacks across all of their
markets. The report contends that their best strategy for confronting
the new operators may be to force the pace of competition by
aggressively introducing new services. With entrants busy investing in
expanding infrastructure and coverage, incumbents could use their
financial strength to fund the development of a broader range of
intelligent network services, multimedia and personal mobility
functions. However, new entrants or established managed network
services providers will also need to provide intelligent network-based
voice services.

The new entrants' initial infrastructure roll-out provides a ready made
market for new SDH, ATM and fibre optic systems, and the desire to
launch services as quickly as possible after 1998 means that many
operators will want off-the-shelf products. Although new deployment of
broadband infrastructure will provide growth in the short term, the
major opportunity for technology suppliers will be in developing and
enhancing products which support innovative new services.

Investment

Investment by utilities and other industrial companies has been a
feature of new network development, says Mr Knott, with a  third of the
total investment being contributed by them. Surprisingly, the finance
sector has contributed only around 15% of all direct investment,
although this figure excludes loans and other funding arrangements with
the companies making the investment in infrastructure. The chart on
page 10 estimates the spread of sources of finance for new UK
infrastructure covering the period 1991-1996.

A similar range of investors is already evident across the rest of
Europe, although a lack of data makes it impossible to assess the
relative financial contributions of each group. Major groups of
corporate investors include investment banks and similar institutions
(Telenet Vlaanderen, ISIS Multimedia), public and private sector
utilities (Telivo, EnterTel, etc.) and parent industrial companies
(Thyssen Telecom, Tele2, etc.).

North American investment is widespread across Europe. The initial wave
coincided with the licensing of independent mobile network operators.
This was followed by several regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs)
taking stakes in the cable TV sector in France, Spain and Scandinavia,
following their move into the UK cable market.  More recently this has
been followed by a wave of alliances with European partners seeking to
enter voice telephony markets, an example of this being the
collaboration between BellSouth and Thyssen.

STREAM "FLOUTS" ITALIAN CABLE TV RULES

Stream, the multimedia division of Italian state telecom holding
company Stet and its subsidiary Telecom Italia, has announced plans to
provide TV programming services over the broadband fibre-optic network
under construction by Telecom Italia, reports New Media Markets.

However, Stream's plans may be thwarted by the Italian government's
draft cable TV legislation which aims to prevent Telecom Italia
becoming a direct provider of broadcast-type TV services (Multimedia
Business Analyst, 1/23/3 and 2/1/1).

Stream hopes to begin offering a package of TV programming from
September over the hybrid fibre optic/coaxial cable network being
deployed by Telecom Italia. It plans to provide four cable TV channels,
two premium pay-per-view channels and a home shopping service.
Programming will cover films, music, documentaries and sport.
Stream claims to be an independent programming distributor and says
that, although initially it will provide programming over Telecom
Italia's broadband network, it will consider using other operators'
infrastructure - such as Videostrada, the Olivetti-US West joint
venture - when this becomes available. However, analysts are dubious
about the legal validity of Stream's argument, given that it is
assuming responsibility for packaging, pricing and marketing and that
Stream and Telecom Italia are part of the same organisation. Telecom
Italia is seen as trying to get round the proposed ban on its providing
entertainment services by using Stream.

By the autumn, when Stream's programming service will start, Telecom
Italia's broadband network should have reached 14 major cities, with
optical fibre in the trunk network and coaxial fibre running to the
home. By mid-1997 coverage should have been extended to 25-30 cities.
Assuming that optical fibre costs fall sufficiently over the next three
years, Telecom Italia hopes to start laying optical fibre to the home
by the end of 1998. It originally planned to deploy optical fibre to
10m homes by late 1998, but merchant bankers Robert Fleming Securities
says that it will achieve only a third of this number.

Stream launches VOD trial

Stream and Telecom Italia launched a commercial trial of VOD services
at the end of last month to 1,000 homes in Milan and Rome. The
Videomagic service runs over Telecom Italia infrastructure, initially
providing entertainment programmes, children's TV, local information
services and home shopping. Stream plans to launch the service
commercially in early 1997, making it available to Telecom Italia and
other broadband network operators.

Despite Telecom Italia's new policy of only using optical fibre for
multimedia services, Stream is using asymmetric digital subscriber line
(ADSL) technology in the Videomagic trial. Bell Atlantic is providing
equipment for the pilot, which follows a technical trial starting in
December 1994.

ITALIAN BANKS TO INVEST IN MEDIASET

Six Italian banks led by credit institute IMI have agreed to take a
combined 5.49% stake - worth L370bn ($233m) - in Mediaset, the newly-
formed TV and advertising arm of former Italian premier Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest media group. The banks also agreed to help with
the subsequent flotation of part of Mediaset with a preliminary
commitment to underwrite L1,025bn worth of shares.

Mr Berlusconi plans to reduce his family's stake in Mediaset to under
50% through public offerings on the Milan, London and New York stock
exchanges beginning in mid-1996.

State-owned BNL is considering becoming the seventh bank to invest in
Mediaset via its Albacom telecom joint venture with UK carrier BT.
Mediaset is known to be seeking a telecom company as a partner.
However, should BT consent to Albacom making this proposed L70bn
investment, it is unclear how it would affect rival Cable & Wireless
Europe's negotiations to use Fininvest's Italian TV transmission
network for fixed and wireless telecoms (Multimedia Business Analyst,
2/3/3).

A consortium of foreign investors including German media magnate Leo
Kirch, Prince al-Waheed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and a group
controlled by South African financier Johan Rupert already owns around
18% of Mediaset.

TWO WAY TV RAISES FUNDS FOR NATIONAL SERVICE

Two Way TV, the London-based company which launched a terrestrial
interactive TV service in Birmingham in November, is in the process of
raising #30m-#40m in new capital. It hopes to launch throughout the
Central Television area in the Midlands this spring followed by a
nationwide rollout during 1996.

Investors so far include Electra, Mercury Asset Management, Murray
Johnstone and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Multimedia
Business Analyst, 2/3/2). The Two Way TV system broadcasts data and
graphics to accompany TV programmes via spare capacity on conventional
TV frequencies in the same way as teletext. Subscribers receive four
infra-red handsets and a Motorola set-top box equipped with a modem
which communicates their answers to interactive TV quizzes via a free
telephone connection to Two Way TV's server.
Two Way TV has reached agreement with all the UK's broadcasters to use
their programmes and receive copies in advance so that additional game
formats can be added by its staff.

Executive chairman Bill Andrewes, a former chairman of Granada's rental
and leisure divisions, says that initial market research suggests
consumers find the Two Way TV system attractive and that it increases
viewing in homes which subscribe. He is encouraged by the service's 8%
take-up rate in the Birmingham area, particularly as a planned TV
advertising campaign has yet to start.

TV ADVERTISING REVENUE PREDICTIONS

UK terrestrial TV advertising revenues are unlikely to be seriously
affected by new media for the next 10 years, according to a report by
UK agency Abbot Mead Vickers BBDO. The report predicts that satellite
and cable TV channels are unlikely to reach half the country before
2010. Consumer resistance and BSkyB's monopoly are cited as limiting
factors.

NTT CLAIMS INFRARED PUBLISHING BREAKTHROUGH

Japanese telecom operator NTT has formed a strategic partnership with
TV Interactive Corp of the US to develop multimedia communications
services using infrared ray technology.

The TVIQ system enables television viewers to access online shopping
and other interactive TV services by touching text and graphics in
printed publications such as home-shopping catalogues, claims its
developer, Silicon Valley-based TV Interactive.

TV screens will display videos and music chosen by the user when a TV
set-top box, containing CD-based information, responds to infrared rays
emitted from chips embedded in the publication. The system is
particularly intended for consumers such as old people or housewives
who are unfamiliar or apprehensive about interactive technology.

NTT and TV Interactive plan to make their infrared technology an
industry standard by presenting it at a US meeting early this year of
IrDa, the infrared standards body. IrDa has recently standardised
infrared technology for short-distance communications between PCs and
peripherals such as printers, but has yet to begin research into
technology for longer-distance communications such as the TVIQ system.

NEW UK ELECTRONIC SHOPPING TRIAL PLANNED

This April sees the launch of Project SUMMON, an electronic shopping
trial involving 40 major UK retailers and service providers and managed
by Rickmansworth-based start-up Virtual Precincts Ltd.

Project SUMMON (Sales Using MultiMedia On Networks) will site a series
of multimedia kiosks in public places in west and north west London
during 1996. Each kiosk will house a virtual shopping mall in which the
trial participants will offer their wares for purchase by credit or
debit card. Around 100,000 members of the public are expected to use
the system during the lifetime of the trial.

Virtual Precincts' managing director Alan Leibert says that the mall is
not a 100% replica of a standard high street in order to reflect the
participation of mail order and direct-to-market companies as well as
local authorities.

London-based cable TV operator Videotron is supplying the 10Mbps
connections linking the kiosks to SUMMON's server. Data is delivered in
real-time from the central database, allowing the system to be used to
sell cinema, theatre and travel tickets. Towards the end of 1996,
Virtual Precincts intends to offer SUMMON over coax cable TV links to
set-top boxes in subscribers' homes, and is currently talking to a
number of possible equipment suppliers such as games console
manufacturers.

Mr Leibert says that unlike Cambridge Cable and BT's trials of
interactive TV-based shopping, SUMMON is based on open standards,
allowing participating retailers to reuse their "shops" on other
interactive systems. SUMMON's use of the Internet's TCP/IP protocol and
HTML language also means that, once sufficient bandwidth becomes
available, the service could be offered over the Internet, says Mr
Leibert.

Illustra, the US software company taken over by database giant Informix
just before Christmas, is supplying the multimedia relational database
technology for SUMMON. As the Illustra system is based on independent
data types, it is able to assemble HTML pages of information requested
by users "on the fly", says Mr Leibert.

Cambridge-based smart card specialist General Information Systems is
providing the secure payment environment, based on a secure "pipe"
running from each kiosk to a payment server sited alongside the main
server but in a physically secure area. The payment server is connected
to the acquirer and authorisation networks operated by the various card
companies participating in the trial. Once a purchase transaction is
completed, the kiosk prints a receipt for the customer.

Suppliers participating in the project can either set up electronic
links to their own fulfilment systems or take advantage of SUMMON's
fulfilment service.

Other technology companies involved in SUMMON include Glenlake which
designed the virtual mall environment; Point 4 Consulting which
supplied the Access/Register system to track activity at the kiosks;
ICL's kiosk manufacturing unit; and Silicon Graphics which supplied the
central server.

Mr Leibert, a veteran of the smart card industry, says that Virtual
Precincts has decided not to seek finance from the City because of the
short-term approach taken by many investors. Instead, it is seeking
long-term backing, possibly from an international network operator or
from one of its technology partners.

EUROPEAN TELCOS AND UNIVERSITIES LAUNCH AMUSE

A consortium of four universities and 18 telecom operators, equipment
and content vendors including Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia,
Siemens, GPT, Videotime and Online Media has launched a project to
carry out trials of residential digital multimedia services at sites
across Europe. These comprise Milan, Munich, Mons (Belgium), Cambridge,
Aveiro (Portugal), Iceland and Basel (Switzerland).

The AMUSE (Advanced Multimedia Services for Residential Users) project
is under the banner of the ACTS Programme, part of the EC's Fourth
Framework R&D initiative. Each organisation will contribute its own
expertise to the project which will embrace all aspects of multimedia
delivery including set-top boxes, video servers, ATM switches, core and
access networks as well as content creation and service provision.

In addition to testing alternative access network technologies such as
hybrid-fibre-coax (HFC), passive optical networks (PON) and asymmetric
digital subscriber line (ADSL), AMUSE will examine the possibility of
delivering interactive services via broadband ISDN. It will also look
at issues such as delivery platform interoperability and user interface
design.

AMUSE's first phase will provide services such as video- and news-on-
demand, tele-travel agency and Internet access, followed by additional
services in its second phase such as home shopping and tele-games.
Prior to the start of the second phase, the performance of the delivery
platform will be upgraded to improve the picture quality of material
displayed on users' TV screens.

OECD CONFERENCE SEEKS ENCRYPTION COMPROMISE

International business and government representatives meeting in Paris
on 20 December reached a compromise which may lead to formal global
policy guidelines on the encryption of online networks being prepared
by the summer.

The meeting discussed the conditions under which governments seeking to
track illicit activity should be empowered to decode encrypted computer
transmissions, an issue of major concern to private and business
computer users and law enforcement agencies.

Although it had no formal legal authority, the forum, sponsored by the
International Chamber of Commerce and the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development, marked the first occasion that a large
number of delegates from governments, businesses and the IT industry
have gathered to discuss developments in encryption.

The forum agreed that controls should be kept to a minimum, consistent
with the requirements of law enforcement and national security. The
next step will be for governments to formulate guidelines for national
policies with a further joint business-governmental session to provide
private sector input scheduled for the first half of 1996.

The development of a global electronic commerce market on the Internet
potentially worth over $300bn has led to calls from computer companies
such as Microsoft and banks for the US government's strict controls
over the export of encryption algorithms to be relaxed.

Currently, only businesses based in the US have access to high-level
(128-bit) versions of Internet encryption software from companies such
as Netscape and Microsoft (Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/1/9-10). The
universal nature of the Internet means that any encryption software
governed by export regulations cannot legally be distributed online as
it risks being downloaded by users outside the US.

Law enforcement agencies are concerned that if highly secure encryption
technology is exported, it may fall into the hands of money launderers,
drug dealers and terrorists. They have therefore demanded the right to
hack into computer transmissions for counter-intelligence and criminal
investigation work in the same way that they are already able to tap
telephone conversations.

A significant feature of the Paris meeting was that business delegates
agreed in principle to allow such official access to take place as long
as sufficient safeguards are in place and "electronic search warrants"
are issued under due legal process. A number of governments appear
willing to permit relaxation of export controls on high-level
encryption devices as long as these safeguards are in place.

Among the issues which experts on both sides need to resolve are the
ways in which private software "keys" allowing computer transmissions
to be decoded would be handled. The US government's proposed solution -
the Clipper chip which would give its agencies "backdoor" access to
private keys while unauthorised keys would be outlawed - has been hotly
contested by both US computer users and industry players such as Apple,
AT&T, IBM and Microsoft.

The Council of Europe's similar proposal, dubbed Euro-Clipper, has been
rejected by major commercial users, such as investment bank J.P.
Morgan, which said they would take legal action against any move to
force them to use only approved encryption technologies.

However, a number of business organisations have backed the European
Commission's proposal to license trusted third-party escrow
organisations, which would be independent of government, would hold the
keys and would hand them over to government investigators when their
demands were justified. These could be telecom operators, postal
authorities or financial organisations with transaction expertise.

According to CommunicationsWeek International, the EC expects to adopt
a directive backing the use of trusted third parties for encryption in
the first quarter of 1996.

However, a number of critical issues need to be resolved such as how
such custodians could be made legally liable for any unauthorised
access to encrypted information and for the costs of its misuse. In the
hands of a totalitarian government, the legal power to hack into online
networks or to read encrypted data contained on computers or smart
cards could have very serious consequences.

Analysts warn that if governments do not ensure secure communications
in their countries and reasonable safeguards against unjustifed
official intrusion, international companies are likely to transfer
their operations elsewhere.

Moreover, a global solution to encryption is seen as essential.
Businesses view the prospect of a patchwork of different national legal
regimes governing encryption as highly undesirable, as this would
severely delay the advance of international electronic commerce over
the Internet.

COMPUSERVE SUSPENDS ACCESS TO INTERNET NEWSGROUPS

CompuServe has temporarily suspended access to over 200 Internet
newsgroups following a threat of legal action by the German authorities
over illegal pornographic material available on some of the user
forums.

The move follows a raid on CompuServe's German offices during which
federal investigators examined computer equipment. It is believed to be
the first time an online service provider has restricted access to
newsgroups in response to threatened legal action.

A CompuServe spokesman said that the online service provider, which now
has 4m subscribers worldwide including 500,000 in Europe, has to comply
with the laws of the countries in which it operates. "However, laws in
different countries are often in conflict, and this creates challenges
unique to the online industry." CompuServe is now investigating ways in
which it can restrict user access to specific newsgroups by
geographical location, a capability which, like other service
providers, it currently lacks.

As an Internet access provider, CompuServe is not responsible for the
origination or nature of content on the Internet over which it has no
creative or editorial control, the spokesman stressed. Nevertheless,
its move to block access to certain newsgroups won it plaudits from
users, pressure groups and legislators concerned about the largely
unregulated content available on the Internet.

QUOTES FROM THE WAY AHEAD BY BILL GATES (VIKING)

* The benefits and problems arising from this upcoming communications
revolution will be much greater than those brought about by the PC
revolution.

* The information highway will extend the electronic marketplace and
make it the ultimate go-between, the universal middleman....This will
carry us into a new world of low-friction, low overhead, in which
market information will be plentiful and transaction costs low.  It
will be a shopper's heaven.

* Microsoft is investing more than $100m a year on research and
development for the highway.  It will almost certainly take five years
or more of this kind of investing before the results of the R&D bring
in enough revenue to make the money back, so we're making a $500m bet.
It could prove to be a half-billion dollar losing bet.

* The experience of poker strategising - and the money - were helpful
when I got into business....

* The building of the highway will be a learning process, and some
companies will lose their shirts....Gold rushes tend to encourage
impetuous investments.  A few will pay off, but when the frenzy is
behind us, we will look back incredulously at the wreckage of failed
ventures and wonder, "who funded those companies?  What was going on in
their minds?  Was that just mania at work?"

* Beware!  Mergers that are attempts to bring all aspects of highway
expertise into one organisation should be viewed
skeptically....Companies merging, or failing to merge, is no indication
of progress or the lack of it.

* Success is a lousy teacher.  It seduces smart people into thinking
they can't lose.  And it's an unreliable guide to the future.

* I used to date a woman who lived in a different city.  We spent a lot
of time together on e-mail....In the future this sort of "virtual
dating" could be better because the movie watching could be combined
with videoconferencing.

* First thing, as you come in(to my house), you'll be presented with an
electronic pin to clip to your clothes.  The electronic pin you wear
will tell the house who and where you are....Someday, instead of
needing the pin, it might be possible to have a camera system with
visual-recognition capabilities....The house will remember everything
it learns about your preferences.

* Some governments may insist that each (safe and encrypted) mailbox
have a second door with a separate key that the government keeps, but
we'll ignore that political consideration for now and concentrate on
the security that software will provide.

* What today seems like big brother might one day become the norm if
the alternative is being left to the mercy of terrorists and criminals.
 I am not advocating either position - technology will enable society
to make a political decision.

EUROPE ONLINE TO OFFER ACCESS TO T-ONLINE USERS

Europe Online finally launched its multilingual online service on 15
December, although teething problems meant potential subscribers had to
wait to this month for full access. In November it jettisoned AT&T's
proprietary Interchange platform in favour of open Internet standards
and Netscape Navigator.

The Luxembourg-based venture also announced a tie-up with Deutsche
Telekom which will provide the 1m subscribers to the telco's T-Online
German-language online service with "easy" access to Europe Online. T-
Online users subscribing to Europe Online will be also billed by
Deutsche Telekom.

Subject to approval by the EC and by Germany's cartel office, Deutsche
Telekom also plans to invest in the rival online service launched in
late November by America Online and Bertelsmann (Multimedia Business
Analyst, 2/5/3). By allying itself with Europe Online in addition to
AOL/Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom hopes to fend off any anti-trust
investigations.

INFORMIX TO BUY ILLUSTRA

Informix, the California-based relational database management software
company, is to buy Illustra Information Technologies in an agreed share-
swap deal worth around $385m. The deal is intended to enable Informix
to capture the expanding market for multimedia content management,
particularly on the World Wide Web.

Under the deal, all Illustra's outstanding shares will be exchanged for
12.9m newly issued Informix shares. Illustra, based in Oakland,
California, is a major supplier of dynamic content management database
software and tools used to manage data in the Internet, multimedia
entertainment, financial services and other markets.

The acquisition will enable Informix to integrate Illustra's software
into its core parallel database technology, giving it a significant
competitive advantage.

GLOBAL MULTI-MEDIA INVESTMENT TRUST

London stockbrokers Raphael Zorn Hemsley in partnership with media
consultant John Scaife has announced a media fund investing exclusively
in film, TV, print publishing and multimedia stocks. First Media
Investment Trust plc will focus on companies creating, owning,
distributing or exploiting media assets and intellectual property. It
will however not invest in hardware companies or directly in media
titles. According to NatWest Securities, media stocks have been the
third-fastest-growing sector of the UK stock market since 1973.

To be floated on the Stock Exchange at the end of January, First Media
aims to place between 40m and 100m #1 ordinary shares, with warrants
attached, which will be used to buy stakes in quoted and unquoted media
companies around the world. Mr Scaife, a former head of the European
media and telecom team at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, expects
the trust to raise more than #50m at flotation, given the commitments
he has already received from a number of institutional investors. The
UK already has another specialist media investment trust, Herald
Investment Trust plc. Set up two years ago by Rutherford Asset
Management to handle smaller quoted companies with market
capitalisations under #300m, Herald raised #65m at flotation from 120
institutional investors (Multimedia Business Analyst, 1/14/12-13).
First Media, by contrast, is seeking to invest 30% of its assets in
unquoted companies within a two-year period. It is targeting
institutional investors, although small investors will be able to own
shares at the outset.

Initially, 40% of First Media's portfolio will be in the US, with the
remainder spread throughout Europe, although it may expand into
emerging markets. It will invest 35% of its portfolio in computer games
and interactive multimedia stocks; 25% in cable and broadcast TV
companies including listed conglomerates such as Viacom and Pearson;
15% in film and TV producers; 10% in multimedia publishing support
services such as 3D graphics; 5% in book and print publishing,
particularly with CD-ROM tie-ups; and 10% in Internet companies,
expected to be the growth stocks of the next century.

The initial net asset value of the trust will be 97% of net proceeds. A
1.5% annual management fee will apply, plus a 0.5% premium on dealings
in unquoted stocks. For details, contact Michael Rosenberg on +44
(0)171 628 4000.

Software Publisher Salaries On The Rise, According To SPA Survey 


Software publisher salaries are on the rise, according to a recent survey
conducted by the Software Publishers Association.

The SPA's Software Industry Salary Survey 1995 reported that the average
managerial salary increased 7.3% and the average non-managerial salary rose
6.9% in 1995 compared with 1994.  The average salary for all software
publishers is expected to increase 6.6% in 1996.

Companies surveyed publish software as a primary or secondary business.  Among
the 197 publishers surveyed are Acclaim Entertainment, Edmark, Sanctuary
Woods, Grolier Electronic Publishing and Headbone Interactive.

The managerial position salary that increased the most was international
director of sales -- up 16.7% to $72,900.

Smaller Company Salaries Increasing Faster

The survey also broke publishers down into four revenue categories:  below
$500,000; $500,000 to $3 million; $3 million to $25 million; and above $25
million.

Companies with revenues between $500,000 and $3 million increased managerial
salaries 8.5% in 1995, the largest increase of the four revenue groups.  The
largest projected increase for 1996 managerial salaries was 9.2% for companies
with less than $500,000 in revenues.

Publishers with revenues of less than $500,000 posted the largest increase in
salary for non-managerial employees -- 7.8%.

The SPA Software Industry Salary Survey 1995 is free to SPA full members.  It
is priced at $500 for non-SPA members.  For more information, contact the SPA
at (202) 452-1600.

Bill Gates' "Other Company" Licensing Digital Images


All title publishers know about Microsoft.  But few know of Bill Gates' other
company -- yet.

Corbis Corp.  (previously known as Continuum) was formed by Gates in 1989.
The company is collecting rights to intellectual property, including images
from the Bettmann Archive and the State Russian Museum.

In January 1995, the company formed Corbis Media specifically to license
Corbis-owned digital images to multimedia CD ROM publishers.  Corbis images
are available in subject areas including:  the arts; biography & portraits;
history; natural & life sciences; people & cultures; political & social
issues; sports; and physical & life sciences.

The Bellevue, WA-based company can provide publishers with images within 24 to
48 hours in most cases, Mark Daniel, Corbis manager of sales, told MBR.
Images can be sent on CD ROM or via online.  Corbis Media has approximately
150 employees.

Price -- $79 to $400 Per Image

Licensing the rights to one image ranges in price from $79 to $400, depending
on how the image will be used and the total number of images being licensed.

Among Corbis Media's customers are Questar Microsystems and Future Vision,
which was recently acquired by SoftKey International (MBR, 7/21/95).

A Lot Of Money To Pay Back

Corbis Media had "significant revenues" in 1995, according to Daniel, although
he wouldn't go into detail.

Acquiring rights to all of the images Corbis owns was expensive, Daniel
admitted.  It will take Corbis a number of successful years to recoup those
investments.

Corbis Media Contact

Contact:  For more information on licensing the rights to digital images from
Corbis Media, contact Mark Daniel, manager of sales, at (206) 649-3383 or
markd@corbis.com.

E3 vs. CES Orlando Highlights First Half Of 1996 Conferences


The long-awaited battle between Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and CES
Orlando (formerly the Summer Consumer Electronics Show) highlights 17
conferences planned for the first half of 1996, according to MBR's Conference
Planner.

Both E3 and CES Orlando focus on the retail market for electronic/interactive
products.  E3 was launched in 1995 by Knowledge Industry Publications and
Infotainment World.  Much of its success stemmed from the fact that the
Electronic Industries Association (EIA) did not hold Summer CES last year.
EIA revamped the show and renamed it CES Orlando.

This year, the two competing shows will be held within a week of each other --
E3 will be held May 16-18 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and CES Orlando
May 23-25 at the Orange City Convention Center in Orlando, FL.  E3 is
projecting 40,000 attendees and CES Orlando 30,000.

Attendance To Average 4000 Per Show

Attendance at the 17 shows will range from as few as 75 for the Institute for
International Research's Intelligent Set-top Box conference up to 80,000 for
the NAB's MultiMedia World show and EIA's Winter CES.  On average, 4000 people
will attend each show.

Exhibitor rates average $26/square foot -- about $2.75/square foot less than
last year.  Attendance fees average $1200 per show, ranging from free for both
CES Orlando and Winter CES to $1995 for Demo '96.

COMPUSERVE FORCED TO CENSOR

Officials at CompuServe Inc. scrambled last week to devise a way
to allow its 4 million members to regain access to more than 200
sexually explicit Internet newsgroups.  On Dec. 28, in response
to an order by the government of Germany, CompuServe suspended
access from its service to the controversial newsgroups,
spokeswoman Daphne Kent said.  German law enforcement told the
world's second-largest online service that the content of the
newsgroups was illegal under German law.

CompuServe subscribers worldwide, not just in Germany, are
affected by the action.  Kent would not speculate as to when, or
even if, access would be restored but said the company is "always
concerned" that blocking access to information could cost it
customers.  Kent said no other online service was similarly
restricted and said "we were likely targeted because of our
size."  Although smaller than its chief competitor, America
Online Inc.,  CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of
any consumer online service.  In Germany it claims 100,000
members.  The number is insignificant, though, in comparison to
the more than 1.8 million individuals who use the Internet in
Germany and whose access to the same newsgroups is harder to
restrict, depending upon their method of access.

Kent said CompuServe is "looking at several options," among them
implementing a system that would restrict access to newsgroups by
region of the world and a "software solution" customized to abide
by each country's laws.

2MARKET, 2MARKET TO FIND A GREAT SALE

If fighting the post-holiday crowds in search of sales in the
shopping malls is not your idea of a bargain, perhaps 2Market
Inc.'s merchants' offering of after-Christmas merchandise online
is more what you had in mind.  A special sales area began Dec. 26
to give 2Market customers reduced prices at Greet Street
(greeting cards), Eddie Bauer (home and apparel), Chef's Catalog
(kitchen ware) and Windham Hill (holiday music CDs).  Access is
through the Marketplace area on America Online Inc. (AOL) or on
2Market's Holiday Edition CD-ROM.

Other merchants are expected to begin offering sale merchandise
through 2Market.  Valentine gifts will be available by the middle
of this month.  "Customers who may have waited in the past for
sale catalogs or a clearance sale at a retailer can now turn to
2Market for even more value and convenience," commented Tom Burt,
president and CEO of 2Market.

2Market's combination of CD-ROM and online technologies makes it
possible for shoppers with the CD-ROM (MMD 5/25/95) to connect
automatically to AOL, tap the online messages and receive price
updates, new products, special promotions and other vendor
information.  A professional gift expert is available to assist
with gift selections.  A CD-ROM can be ordered by calling 
1-800-622-6600 or from the 2Market area on AOL.  (2Market

SOFTKEY, LEARNING SAGA COMES TO CLOSE

After months of controversy, haggling, threats and lawsuits,
SoftKey International Inc. finally has completed its acquisition
of The Learning Co. pursuant to a merger agreement signed by the
two companies in early December (MMD 12/8/95).  Approximately 95
percent of the outstanding shares of Learning stock, or 7.7
million shares, were purchased for $67.50 per share in cash as
payment for the company on Dec. 22, and the merger of Learning
into a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftKey was completed late last
Wednesday.

Learning originally had resisted SoftKey's courtship - which
began last October with a cash-and-stock offer worth $606 million
(MMD 10/31/95) - because it already was in merger talks with
Broderbund Software Inc., but also because Learning felt it would
not be able to realize its full market potential under ownership
by SoftKey, a company in whose business philosophy it had little
faith.  But money talks, and a sweetened offer by SoftKey (MMD
12/5/95) led Learning's board of directors to change their tune
and accept the new bid.

SoftKey also has closed a previously announced deal with Tribune
Co. to merge the latter's Compton's NewMedia Inc. and Compton's
Learning Company (different from The Learning Co.) units into
SoftKey (MMD 12/1/95).  As part of the deal, SoftKey last week
tendered 4.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for
both Compton's companies, which now operate as wholly owned
subsidiaries.  SoftKey also issued 587,036 additional shares to
Tribune last Thursday to cancel $14 million of intercompany debt,
and also executed a promissory note to cancel $3 million of such
debt.

AOL, COMPUSERVE:  5M IN EARLY 1996

Amrica Online Inc. (AOL) announced last week that its number of
subscribers has surpassed 4.5 million.  The announcement came
less than a week after CompuServe Inc. announced that it now has
4 million subscribers.  Both companies said they expect to be
serving 5 million subscribers in the near future - AOL "early in
the new year," and CompuServe "next spring."

"New computer owners are realizing the value of the online
service and the Internet," said Bob Massey, CompuServe's
president and CEO.  "A computer that is not connected to
cyberspace is like a television without sound and color." 
CompuServe said it is adding 200,000 new members to its service
every month.

AOL, for its part, has tripled its subscribership since a year
ago, when it had just over 1.5 million members.  "Not only are
consumers in the United States showing a strong preference for
AOL as their means of access to the Internet and the world of
online services, but initial response to GNN, our new Internet-
only service ... has been gratifying," said Steve Case, chairman
and CEO of the company.

Although AOL has a larger subscriber base in the United States,
CompuServe has a larger international base.  Last month,
CompuServe announced that it had reached the 500,000 subscriber
mark in Europe (MMD 12/22/95), and that it intends to double that
number in the next year.  But AOL is expanding internationally as
well.  In late November it launched service in Germany in
partnership with Bertelsmann AG (MMD 11/29/95), and intends to
take France, the United Kingdom and Japan online during 1996.

DAVIC ADOPTS GLOBAL STANDARDS

The Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) has finalized its first
set of global technical standards for "end-to-end" digital
multimedia systems and now will focus on adding specifications
for cable modems.  In the future, DAVIC will tackle the
development of standards for video servers, 3-D animation, high-
quality video and sound, and network interfaces in the home, a
DAVIC spokesman said.

The new "DAVIC 1.0" standards, which allow for content and
hardware interoperability, were adopted Dec. 16 in Berlin at the
end of a weeklong series of meetings involving about 400 DAVIC
representatives.  The International Telecommunication Union is
expected to ratify the standards this month.      DAVIC is a
coalition of communications and entertainment companies that is
creating voluntary standards for digital audio and visual
services.  Council officials said earlier this year that the
first set of standards would be adopted in December (MMD
9/19/95).

The new standards will enable equipment manufacturers to develop
network hardware without having to worry about whether their
product conforms to proprietary standards, the spokesman said. 
In addition, programmers will be able to convert existing content
- or develop new content - according to uniform specifications
for digital systems.  The spokesman emphasized that the DAVIC
standards process will be an "ongoing" effort, with additional
specifications incorporated periodically into the standards.  The
council's "highest priority" now is to develop cable modem
specifications for "DAVIC 1.1," he said.  DAVIC is working in
conjunction with Cable Television Laboratories Inc. to develop
those specifications.

In the coming months, DAVIC also plans to develop specifications
for Internet access, system security, return channels for
satellite TV transmission, and "modulation schemes" for wireless
cable TV service, the spokesman said.  Such specifications would
be added as "building blocks" to existing DAVIC standards, he
stressed.  DAVIC's next meetings will be held in Seoul, South
Korea, in March and New York City in June.  In addition, a
special May meeting is being planned to discuss "more rapid
consideration of [cable] modems," the spokesman said.

In a newly published book - Bill Gates: The Robber Baron of
Cyberspace - author Anthony Martin, executive director of the
Committee to Fight Microsoft Corp., provides an antidote to
Gates' vision of the future (MMD 11/29/95).  "Gates' world is one
in which ordinary Americans are monitored relentlessly," said
Martin at a press conference last week.  "My book ... exposes the
truth behind Microsoft Corp. and its drug-crazed culture....  Mr.
Gates may have fooled some of the people some of the time, but he
will not be allowed to fool all of the people all of the time." 
That's tellin' 'em!  (Martin 212-879-0086)

At first it looked as if the computers would win, but on Day 2 of
the Harvard Cup Human Versus Computer Chess Challenge the humans
staged a comeback and grandmasters Joel Benjamin and Michael
Rhode emerged victorious.  The top-scoring computer games were I-
Motion Interactive's "Virtual Chess" and "Chessmaster 4000 for
Windows 95" from Mindscape Inc., the principal sponsor of the
competition.  (Mindscape 305-321-6334)

Demand for 16-bit video games and video game players was greater
this holiday season than it was for the newer 32-bit platforms,
according to the Wall Street Journal.  Executives from companies
such as Nintendo of America Inc. and Sega of America Inc. were
quoted as admitting they could have done more to prepare for what
could have been a windfall season for them, had they not run out
of 16-bit products.  It seems the newer games simply couldn't
compete with the price and installed base of 16-bit machines.  Go
figure.  (Sega 213-782-6600, http://www.segaoa.com; Nintendo

      CENTREGOLD AND SEGA SEE SHORT FUTURE FOR CARTRIDGES

Centregold has issued a trading statement blaming a 23% decline
on lean demand for 16-bit cartridges but it said larger companies
such as Sega have suffered even greater losses.

Centregold Plc's trading statement on the six months to January
31 said the company's turnover had dropped 23% to GBP41m, leading
to a pre-tax loss of GBP3.6m, GBP2.9m of which came from stock
provisions.

Geoff Brown, Centregold's chief executive, believes his
announcement is the visible tip of a much larger iceberg,
claiming Sega Enterprises Ltd dropped 2m units before Christmas.
"Anything sold below GBP29.99 was sold below cost," he said.

Sega could not confirm losses but did admit that market response
had presented problems for the company recently. Mark Maslowicz,
Sega's UK software manager, said the delays would give cartridges
a life of little more than two years.

Centregold operates from US, UK, France, Germany and Japan,
incorporating publishers US Gold and Core Design, the budget
software label, KIXX, and the software research and development
company, Silicon Dreams, which has exclusive rights to the
Olympics '96.

Following the statement, Brown said the lack of dynamism in the
games cartridge industry could force it to give way to CD-ROM.

According to Brown, the three months it takes to order, assemble
and distribute games cartridges means that players cannot respond
to the upswing or inertia of the market. As a result, businesses
may fail to supply an eager market in time or have shelves piled
with unwanted products. "You put your finger in the air," he
said, "and see how it goes."

The company's San Francisco outlet has taken the largest hit and
is already moving towards PC CD-ROM, which takes one to two weeks
to get onto the shelves giving a high, cheap turnover for a near-
guaranteed market.

The lack of dynamics in the market has meant that promises of 64-
bit machines has kept customers waiting for their next purchase.
As one observer asked, "would you buy a TV today if you knew a 3D
TV was going to be out next year?"

Centregold had GBP430,000 in 16-bit machines on the books at the
end of last year and has been forced to drop its sell-on price
from GBP17 to GBP5 to shift GBP350,000 since then.

Analysts say they had been expecting losses for some time
although broker firm Smith New Court still predicts profits in
1996. Durlacher believes the time to earnings is closer to three
years and investments should not be earnings-based for at least
12-18 months.

Centregold's Geoff Brown believes the company has come out
"unscathed" but this year he is setting his sights on selling
40,000 units of the company's new football title, Fever Pitch,
compared with sales of 300,000 units of the World Cup cartridge
last year.

"In about two years the money made on CDs will exceed the money
made on cartridges," he said. "Admittedly, CD drives cost more
but cartridges cost more than CDs. In an ideal world everything
would be on CD."

Centregold's Geoff Brown sees the cartridge waning in
manufacturers' popularity. "16-bit cartridge is dead," he said.
"We've two more products then we'll leave it."

          INTEL SPELLS OUT NEW COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
                  TO DODGE HESITANT AUTHORITIES

As the US vice president vows to open telecoms markets, Intel
executives have warned that Europe's restrictive telecoms
legislation will motivate computer users to open new
communications pathways via the Internet.

In an exclusive interview with Multimedia Futures, Claude
Leglise, Intel Corp's worldwide director of multimedia, warned
that citizens would soon find new ways of communicating if
governments continued to avoid deregulation of the telecoms
networks.

Vice President Al Gore told ministers at the Group of Seven
information technology conference on February 25, "whether by new
law or new legislation we intend to open foreign investment in
telecommunications services in the United States."

The statement was backed by AT&T chief executive, Robert Allen,
who said, "if the dominant telecoms operators of Europe are to
become self-sufficient, profitable companies, they need the
stimulus of a truly competitive market.

According to Leglise, high charges for ISDN lines are "an
artefact of government regulation". He highlighted the difference
between the computer business and the telecoms business as one in
which the first is impatient to find new ways to expand, the
other loaded with legislation.

"One is right," he said, "the other is... not right."
"Deregulation of communications services is what will make this
thing grow. In North America the cable companies want to get into
the phone business and the phone companies want to get into the
video business. If none of these guys do anything, let me propose
that the computer industry and the computer users will start
creating their own (telecoms) network using Internet."

February saw the birth of at least two Internet telephone
companies: VocalTec Inc in tel Aviv, Israel (mf issue 2) and
Electric Magic Co in San Francisco (mf issue 3). Digital
Equipment Corporation has also said it will market its own
Internet phone by June and Cirrus Logic Inc has expressed an
interest in licensing VocalTec's software.

Although the software is still in its early stages, Leglise said
it is only a matter of a few years before the Internet, with an
infrastructure already laid and waiting for the innovation,
becomes a cheap alternative to the telephone companies.

He is critical of authorities for not responding to the
situation. "There was a time when the buggy manufacturers were
not worried about cars. It took 25 years but ultimately they
should have been worried" he said. "There's a large history of
small companies that became big. Intel is one of them, Microsoft
is another. What I'm saying is, it's pretty much inevitable."

"The question really is will the authorities provide a framework
that will make it happen quickly or not. What they can influence
is really the pace, but not the outcome."

             BERTLESMANN BATTLES MICROSOFT NETWORK

In a bid to pre-empt Microsoft Network, Frankfurt, Germany-based
media giant, Bertelsmann AG has paid $50m for a 5% stake in
America Online.

Bertelsmann has an option to increase its stake to 10% of the
Reston, Virginia-based company  while both will set up an
equally-owned European online joint venture. The target is 1m
subscribers  and $685m annual turnover by 2000. The new service
is planned to begin in Frankfurt in six weeks.

The companies are inviting  would-be European partners, at least
one per country to take small stakes of not more than 10% in the
new venture.

       VIEWCALL SEEKS GBP700,000 FOR FRACTAL STILL VIDEO

Interactive Online system provider, Viewcall Europe Plc of
London, wants to raise GBP700,000 via an offer of shares for
subscription and will apply to trade its stock on the London
Stock Exchange under Rule 4.2.

Viewcall was established at the end of last year and is currently
the sole licensee of the Viewcall interactive on-line system,
which uses fractal compression at the host end.

If it raises the GBP700,000 it wants, it will be capitalised at
GBP4.8m. Rule 4.2 allows a company to be traded on a matched
bargain basis with no fixed price or market maker for shares. The
fractal technology the company uses has been pioneered by Walzer
Corp of Jersey over the past two years.

Viewcall will use the money raised to fund trials of its end to
end system that enables VHS quality still pictures to be passed
across the telephone network at speeds that make it fast enough
for on-line catalogue shopping, for example. The set-top box
decoder in the home then decompresses those images for the
customer.

The decision on the location of the trial will be made in the
next six to eight weeks from a shortlist of three locations and
should be live in the third or early fourth quarter. Walzer
currently holds the largest stake in Viewcall and shareholders
number around 50; broker is London-based Astaire & Partners Ltd.

The company has yet to confirm details of the manufacturer of the
systems and is holding back information on the details of the
hardware and software until this is finalised.

about 400mW at 50MHz.

The company has also built the core which it makes under licence
from MIPS Technologies Inc, into Southern Cross, which it
describes as a stand-alone microprocessor that enables users to
evaluate the R3900 and shorten time-to-market.

The 3900 offers variable instruction cache and data cache sizes
and parameters and includes on-board power management functions.
The part is also aimed at multimedia applications, facsimile
modems, games, laser printer controllers and X-terminals.

The R3900 is the first RISC microprocessor that was fully
specified by the Toshiba San Jose facility and was jointly
designed with Toshiba's engineering facility in Kawasaki.

The engineers took the standard R3000 architecture and designed
it into a 26 square millimetre part with 4Kb instruction and 1Kb
data cache, giving it the MIPS I+ enhanced instruction set and a
modified five-stage pipeline structure.

The set adds built-in branch-likely instructions that eliminate
the no operation instructions from the program flow for more
compact code, and there is a built-in one-cycle Multiplier and
Accumulation operation to reduce the multiplication and addition
functions into a single operation to provide signal processor-
like functions to enhances graphics and communications
capabilities.

The part runs off a 3.3V supply. Green Hills Software Inc will
supply C/C++ compiler, assembler, linker, library tools and
debugger and Hewlett-Packard Co is helping Toshiba with an on-
chip software debug module.

Samples of the Southern Cross - the TMPR3901F - will be offered
later in May, with volume set for the third quarter. Toshiba is
expecting processor prices to be $30 in 1,000-up quantities.

          THRUGLASS FOLLOWS FAO SCHWARZ WITH FACTURA

Following its success with FAO Schwarz, MicroTouch Systems Inc
has acquired the information kiosk housings maker, Factura
Composites Inc of Rochester, New York, on undisclosed terms.

The success of the New York toy store's multimedia touch
sensitive window display at Christmas prompted FAO Schwarz to
introduce trials of  Methuen, Massachusetts-based Microtouch
Systems Inc's Thruglass product in seven of its flagship stores
in the US.

Schwarz customers were able to touch, through 2" thick glass, a
picture of a toy that interested them and set off a digital video
demonstration of that toy on a 20" monitor.

This "kiosk through glass" system, the Targa Windowshopper, was
developed by Berlin, Connecticut-based Targa Systems Corp, and is
based on a Toshiba multimedia PC and Methuen, Massassechusetts-
based Microtouch's projected capacitive technology which enables
proprietary sensors to project  a low-voltage field through glass
or any other non-conductive material. Thruglass TouchPads - three
different sizes from 1" by 1" to 4" by 3" - can be affixed to the
back of photos or graphics  on the inside of a store window.

When a person outside touches the glass minute changes in the
voltage field are detected by the Thruglass controller, which
passes the selection to the computer. Sound is also available
with the system as is a sixteen pad keyboard.

The beauty of the system is its low-cost - just $500 for the
Thruglass equipment - to which must be added the price of a 486
PC and authoring software to develop a demonstration.

                CNET CELEBRATES DIAMOND JUBILEE
                WITH FIBRE-OPTIC 140Mbps ATM LINK

The Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET)
France's $500m national research giant, celebrated its fiftieth
anniversary in Paris by demonstrating France's Telecom's first
140Mbps fibre optic point-to-point Asynchronous Transfer link
with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG's CNET equivalent in
Darmstadt.

CNET announced its research targets over the next five years will
be technologies that will affect "planet telecommunications"
Asynchronous Transfer Mode - a technology it pioneered -
multimedia services, whether they be revamped PC versions of
Minitel or interactive cable television systems, mobile systems
and intelligent agents for filtering data from mobile or fixed
on-line services.

It is currently working to upgrade its Minitel viewdata services
for mail order, medical services, tourism, encyclopaedic and
educational sectors in France.

Michel Feneyrol, director of CNET said: "Between 26% and 30% of
the services we have now will be interested in having images
added and in more sophisticated, multimedia version of their
services."

Services using fixed images will appear on personal computers
between now and 2000, while services with moving images on
personal computers or televisions will appear by the turn of the
century, he added.

CNET and the national telecomms provider France Telecom, are
focusing on developing new on-line services and systems for
billing and network access, which they have perfected in 10 years
through operating the Minitel viewdata system.

Overall, Feneyrol believes that CNET will most probably
concentrate its R&D in software because "we see productivity with
software engineering tools growing much more slowly than, say,
the capacity of fibre optics".

France Telecom demonstrated the results of its partnership with
General Magic Inc on the use of intelligent agents to improve
user interfaces for telematic services.

"Our strategy, with General Magic is to add the nomadic dimension
to Teletel," said Jacques Guichard, associate director at CNET in
charge of multimedia.

The first market experiments using intelligent agents are
scheduled for next year. The applications, using personal
communicators from Sony Corp and Motorola Inc., are being
developed by France Telecom, General magic Inc and Philips PACE.
Gateways enable the communicators to interrogate existing Teletel
databases such as those of the national railway and highway
authorities.

Many of the CNET's development projects are currently being
exhibited as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, at the
Science City in Parc de la Villette, Paris until May 28.

         WHIRLPOOL DEMOS COOK-ON-DEMAND VOICE KITCHEN

The 'kitchen of the future' will cook on demand when Whirlpool
installs Voice Powered Technology's VoiceLogic technology in
kitchen applicances, but it will not allow you to shout at it.

The KitchenAid division of Whirlpool Corp has demonstrated speech
recognition in an oven, a refrigerator, a dishwasher and a
washing machine at the National Association of Home Builders
annual convention in Houston, Texas.

Whirlpool is currently reviewing the possibilities of using the
speech recognition technology from Canoga Park, California-based
Voice Powered Technology Inc. Whirlpool will not set a date for
KitchenAid Voice Command products to hit the shops until it has
fully evaluated the potential demand.

Speech recognition is about 97% accurate but still requires users
to press a button before speaking the commands. Voice Powered
Technology said there is still no reliable method for removing
background noise from the audio input.

"You can't just go into a room and yell at it," said a
spokesperson.

The system requires a short training session by each 'kitchen
user' who speaks around 30 words into the microphone. Then, in
the case of an oven, cooks can speak keywords like "prime rib",
"eight pounds" and "six pm", leaving the calculations to the
appliance.

Voice Powered Technology said it has been "looking to license to
home products for some time". A ten year old company with
revenues of $3.8m, it reported restructure losses of $290,000 in
December 1994 against a 1993 loss of $3.1m .

The company signed an OEM deal with Kong Wah Video Co Ltd in
April 1993. Kong Wah Video will use the technology in its Voice
Wand, a television remote control that operates with speech.
It has two other speech products: VCR Voice Programmer and Voice
Organizer, which retail at $99 and $199 respectively.

               AMERITECH WIRES 6M WITHOUT TRIALS

Interactive television is well known enough to install without
trials, according to DEC, which is supplying Alpha-based servers
to Ameritech's installation of 6m homes in Chicago.

Chicago-based Baby Bell, Ameritech Corp awarded the $475m
contract jointly to Digital Equipment Corp, Scientific Atlanta
Inc and ADC Telecommunications Inc and Ameritech is planning to
connect up to 300,000 homes in its five largest cities
immediately, rising to 1m by the end of the year. The company
hopes to have 6m - almost half the company's 13m subscribers -
using interactive television by 2001.

It is usual for companies to install a small number, often less
than 3000, to test the technology and marketing prospects of
interactive television in the area.

DEC said the technology was so well known now that it made little
sense to meander into the technology, particularly as the cabling
infrastructure had to be upgraded anyway.

"There's nothing really substantial to be gained from a trial,"
said a spokesperson. "Ameritech and other regional Bell companies
are already spending billions on new infrastructure. They might
as well go right ahead and install media servers."

The contract is worth $40m to Digital and $400m to Scientific
Atlanta which will supply analogue and digital set-top terminals
and remote controls. The remaining balance went to ADC
Telecommunications which got a six-year contract worth up to $35m
for cabinets placed in neighbourhoods to house the link between
the fibre-optic network and coaxial cables running to
subscribers' homes.

Nynex Corp, which is also using DEC and Scientific Atlanta, is
playing safer with a 2,500 installation in three apartment blocks
on Manhattan Island.

The company plans to expand quickly now that it has Federal
Communications Commission approval. It said it does not consider
Manhattan to be a trial but a starting point.

Nynex recently won its application for trading video services
within its own catchment area under the FCC rule 2.14 (mf issue
2). The rule has allowed telephone companies to supply video
services to their own telephone customers since 1992 providing
they obtain permission from the FCC.

DEC also said that even though the technology was solid enough to
build an infrastructure straight off, there were still
developments to be made that would bring the cost of installation
down.

"It's not as if there's no more innovation to go. It's just a
question of cost-reducing innovation," said the company's
spokesperson.

                   INFOMERCIALS DEBUT IN UK

Infomercials have begun in Europe for the first time as UK
companies fight for growing advertising revenues and Carlton
secures Children's ITV as its first customer for the SpotPlus
interactive commercial.

Carlton TV, part of Carlton Communications, is the UK's largest
independent television company since it bought Birmingham's
Central TV less than a year ago. Carlton hopes the initiative can
keep it ahead of Granada TV, the UK's number two. Advertising
revenues are forecast by to grow 6% this year.

Infomercials have been operating in the US for two years now by
television companies such as CBS and this is the first
introduction to Europe.

SpotPlus is a way for advertisers to add more information about a
product by screening extended details at 5.30 in the morning. A
number is displayed with the main advert and, by keying this
number into a VideoPlus remote control, the viewer sets their
video recorder to record the early morning commercial
when air-time costs are at their lowest.

SpotPlus infomercials cost GBP9,000 for the three and a half
minute slot compared with up to GBP1m in prime-time.

Children's ITV Interactive magazine (CITV), an interactive
television programme, is the first advertiser to make use of the
infomercial slot, which has been on trial since November last
year. The extended portion of the commercial will demonstrate how
to access the programme using a PC and a modem and offers a
chance to win a Compaq Presario 520.

Martin Bowley, managing director of sales at Carlton UK, sees
this as an opportunity for companies such as travel firms and car
manufacturers to use prime-time advertising space for brief
commercials which will include pointers to more in-depth
information.

            NTL PROMISES TERRESTRIAL DIGITAL TV ON
                 CONVENTIONAL SETS IN UK BY 1997

NTL, claiming the world's most ambitious terrestrial broadcasting
project, is promising UK viewers 12 digital channels using normal
television sets and aerials by 1997.

National Transcommunications Ltd was the engineering arm of
Independent Television (ITV) before being privatised in 1991 and
currently has a turnover of around GBP115m. It claims 30% of the
world market for video compression products other than
transmission equipment.

Based on MPEG-2 video compression, digital television is claimed
to improve the quality of broadcast signals and permit television
companies to offer services such as interactive programming and
wide screen TV. The broadcast quality of digital television
enables television to compete more equally with cable and
satellite.

NTL said the digital system will adhere to normal television
equipment as much as possible, adding a GBP300 set-top unit to
decode the digital signals to a conventional stereo PAL colour TV
signal. It expects the project to cost "tens of millions" of
pounds.

The digital broadcast started at the end of February on
757.25MHz, known as UHF Channel 34, carrying four additional
programmes in digital format in place of the normal PAL channel.

Reuters reports that NTL's plans throw down the gauntlet to the
UK government and its state-funded British Broadcasting
Corporation. In its June 1994 White Paper, the government linked
the introduction of digital broadcasting to the privatisation of
the BBC transmission network.

NTL does not want to be relegated to second place because of
delays in broadcast legislation, causing it to lose leverage
against cable companies, already in reach of 4.4m homes in the
UK.

"Above all, we ask that the BBC must not be given a favoured
position," said NTL chief executive, Andy Sukawaty.

NTL has already offered to provide digital transmission of the
BBC's channels and is waiting its reply. It has already expressed
an interest in buying the BBC's transmission arm when it is
privatised, claiming it could make savings of up to #20m by
combining the assets of the two companies.

Digital transmission could bring back Channel Five, a station
which was to use channel 35 in the TV spectrum but was rejected
by the broadcasting industry because companies licensing the
channel would have to pay several million of pounds to convert or
re-tune customer's VCRs.

The reintroduction of Channel Five could improve the chances of
regional and minority broadcasts.

           UNIONS THREATEN GERMAN TELECOMS EXPANSION

German unions have threatened strike action if Deutsche Telekom's
modernisation continues to threaten jobs, even if it means
damping down the country's telecommunications explosion.

The German public telecommunications operator is planning to
install six interactive television trials in Berlin, Hamburg,
Koln, Leibzig, Neurenberg and Stuttgart by the end of the year.

Union pressure adds to existing concerns as to whether the
company will find enough technologies for the trials.

Deutsche Telekom has said it needs to become more efficient in
order to become internationally competitive, announcing plans to
double job cuts to 60,000 by the year 2000. After a meeting
between union officials and the phone company's management board,
Kurt van Haaren, chairman of the German Postal Workers Union
(DPG), said he was dismayed at the job cuts.

Deutsche Telekom's objective is to test different technologies
for delivering interactive on-line services at each site.
Participants and analysts believe open-ended licensing will build
an unpredictable market but that this unpredictability is
necessary for innovation in the industry.

Invitations are still open to participate in the trials but some
industry observres are dubious whether enough choices exist.

Michael Gell, of British Telecommunications Plcs, said companies
would have to guess their way through the coming years of
regulations.

            ACORN LOSSES FORCE CALL FOR GBP17M CASH

Acorn Computer Group Plc of Cambridge, England accompanied year-
end figures showing a loss of GBP34m with a GBP17m cash call to
fund its Online Media division.

Online Media requires further significant investment as the
directors do not envisage large scale exploitation of the
interactive multimedia market until 1997 at the earliest. Online
Media is the preferred supplier of Northern Telecom Ltd for
television set-top boxes for trials in the UK and the rest of
Europe.

It warned that there were considerable risks attached to Acorn's
entry into the interactive television market.

Acorn's principal shareholder, Ing C Olivetti & Co SpA will not
be taking up its entitlement in the issue. Its shares will be
placed with institutional shareholders, reducing Olivetti's stake
to 58.9% from 78.5%. The balance of the proceeds will be used to
support the core business, Acorn Computers Ltd, after a diffcult
year.

               PERSONAL COMMUNICATORS TO SUPPLY
               WIRELESS VIDEO IN FIVE YEARS' TIME

Wireless personal communications will include video multimedia
within five years, according to industry executives who expect
wireless ATM by 2000.

Reuters reports that telecommunications officials expect business
users and consumers to turn to wireless personal communicators to
use interactive services across the world within five years.

Speaking at a telecommunications conference in February, Leif
Kallan, chairman of Sweden's Telefon AB, said, "voice telephony
is not enough. The ultimate standard should be radio ATM. We
believe this can be brought to market by the year 2000."

ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a high bandwidth networking
protocol that is vaunted by interactive multimedia companies as a
prerequisite technology for sending high volumes of data along
network wires. It is used by telephone carriers and large
companies who need capacities up to 65 times those of
conventional networks such as ethernet, and has not yet reached
the desktop.

Mobile phones and pagers are the most common wireless devices and
Reuters reports that industry consultants, Frost and Sullivan
Inc, project the worldwide market for personal communication
services and handsets worldwide will grow from $88m in 1993 to
over $8,000m by 2000, rising to $19,000m by 2002.

"Wireless is the fastest-growing segment of the
telecommunications industry, which is the fastest-growing
industry in the world," said David Rogers, president of Rogers
Cantel Mobile Communications Ltd. He thinks there is strong
growth potential in developing countries which are expected to
feature strongly in the cellular boom.

Michael Patriarche, vice president of market development at
Northern Telecom Ltd, told Reuters that the cellular phone market
was growing by about 20% a year in developed countries and 80% a
year in emerging markets.

But many executives consider newer markets such as personal
wireless communicators as having even more exciting growth. Les
Shroyer, general manager of Motorola Inc wireless data systems
division, has predicted that 16% of the laptop computers sold in
North America will have wireless modems by 1998, compared with
2.5% today.

For multimedia to become a reality on the personal wireless
communicator, the communicators will have to be capable of
transmitting and receiving faxes, information services and email.
Shroyer said communicators are expected to have speech and
handwriting recognition by the end of this year.

He added that wireless multimedia, including moving images, will
begin in 1997 predicting that sound, text and motion will be
available at the turn of the century.

           PACIFIC BELL CONDEMNS FCC PRICE INCREASES
                      FOR CALIFORNIAN ISDN

Pacific Bell has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to withdraw plans to raise ISDN line charges in California,
which the regional Bell believes will push prices up by as much
as 50%.

ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) employs a single line
with multiple channels to provide high-speed digital transmission
of voice, data and video services. The technology provides much
faster access to information services and is claimed to be
essential for the successful take-up of video telephony.

Subscriber charges for ISDN are currently based on the number of
lines. The FCC wants to introduce a new charging structure that
will charge for the number of channels within the line. Basic
Rate ISDN can have up to three channels per line, while Primary
Rate ISDN lines can have up to 24 channels.

Under the new rate schedule for Basic Rate SDS, Home and Centrex
ISDN services, Pacific Bell customers will be charged for one,
two or three lines, depending on the configuration. Primary Rate
ISDN customers will be charged for either 23 or 24 lines.

Pacific Bell said the new charging structure will raise Basic
Rate Home and Centrex ISDN prices by up to 29%, SDS ISDN prices
by up to 43% and Primary Rate customers by up to 50%.

Pacific Bell issued a formal request to the FCC to waive Section
69.104 of the ruling, allowing the company to retain its current
method of charging by line rather than channel.

"ISDN has become a very cost-effective way to enter the
Information Superhighway," said John Gueldner, Pacific Bell's
vice president of regulatory affairs.

"But now, the mandated increase in ISDN line charges is a major
roadblock. Pacific Bell has made a concerted effort to keep its
prices for ISDN lines affordable."

He criticised the FCC for wanting to introduce a damaging mandate
"at the very time that ISDN is growing rapidly among small to
medium-sized businesses".

"These price increases will severely curtail this growth," he
said, adding that they could even reverse this enthusiasm to the
point of impeding future research into the technology.

Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis Group, provides
ISDN services to areas in California.

           AUSTRALIA PUTS GBP5BN INTO VOICE-TO-VIDEO

Australia Telecom is planning a GBP4,600m venture to upgrade its
cable network to include a new voice-to-video broadband network.

The planned infrastructure will improve the service of cable
television and introduce new features such as broadband telephony
and video conferencing.

Time scales were not available from the telecommunications
company but the plans would mean bringing forward the upgrade of
Australia's cable system, which is the basis of a pay-per-view
venture between Australia Telecom and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

Telecom's cable network is currently under construction and is
intended to connect 4m homes at a cost of GBP1.64m over the next
four years. Current plans run the cable alongside copper wire
telephony.

Australia Telecom's chief executive, Frank Blount, confirmed to
the Australian Financial Review that the national carrier is
reviewing the economics of maintaining and upgrading a phone
network based on a copper wire technology that is rapidly
becoming obsolete.

Although Blount would not be drawn on the costs of an integrated
network, the Federal Government appointed Broadband Services
Experts Group has said that a network of this kind would cost "in
excess of (GBP4,600m)".

Blount said that he intended to keep telephony separate from
Telecom's pay-per-view venture with Murdoch, but National
Australia Bank's magazine, Decisions, quotes Blount as saying,
"if we can make a case that we're going to integrate telephony
and broadband at the same time, we may be able to see our way to
justifying that kind of expenditure and wire up the whole
country".

Faced with the distances involved in the project, Blount
acknowledged that satisfying demand in a sparsely populated
country would be difficult but the company planned to use central
points in towns, such as libraries, as the broadband access
points from which homes could then be connected.

The move being explored by Telecom would complement strategies
mapped out for the development of a broadband services industry
to be unveiled by the Government through the release of the final
BSEG report, said the Australian Financial Review.

Australia Telecom's rival, Optus Vision, is using digital
technology to deliver pay-per-view and telephony on an
infrastructure that could be expanded to video telephony. Optus'
system drops optical fibre and coaxial cable to homes mostly hung
from overhead power cables.

Australia Telecom and News Corp are fine-tuning their pay-per-
view venture with a strong alliance with satellite licensee,
Australis Media Ltd. Telecom-News and Australis are considering a
cross-equity arrangement under which there will be an allotment
of shares and options. These will allow the groups to consider
possible strategic alliances in the future.

          ROCKWELL HAS PERSONAL CONFERENCING CHIP SET

A modem chip set that enables speech and data transmission
simultaneously down a telephone line will drive new applications
such as personal conferencing.

The RC288ACi/SVD, which will ship next month for $100, was
announced by the Digital Communications Division of Rockwell
International Corp, which also sees the modem chip being used for
multi-player computer games and technical support.

It enables PC users to exchange speech and data simultaneously
down a single telephone line, supports the V.34 standard for
28.8Kbps transmission, and conforms to the Digital Simultaneous
Voice and Data specification agreed between Rockwell, Intel Corp,
US Robotics Inc and Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.

It is combined with its own DigiTalk speech compression
technology that allows conversations at the same time as data
transmission at speeds up to 19.2Kbps. It also detects periods of
silence, when it boosts the data rate back up to 28.8Kbps
Rockwell International Corp's Rockwell Telecommunications has
opened a new wafer fab in Newport Beach, California and bills it
a key step towards its goal of becoming a $2,000m company by2000.
It aims to double its annual sales of data and facsimile modems
to about $1,000m by 1999, it said, adding wireless and multimedia
communications products to reach its 2000 target. The upgrade of
the plant to 8" wafers cost it $170m.

                HISTORY OF MULTIMEDIA - PART 2
            THE RULE OF CD-ROM AND VIDEOCONFERENCING

Multimedia technology main successes are in two areas: CD-ROM
and videoconferencing.

The most successful - and the first to be proven - is CD-ROM
(Compact Disc Read Only Memory) technology both as a means to
read large amounts of software and for companies to store large
amounts of data. Volume of information is the key. Each disk can
hold the equivalent of 300,000 pages of text - each disk holds
640Mb of information. The CD-ROM drive and a sound card provide
the baseline Multimedia PC (MPC) configuration.

                             CD-ROM

The number of drives shipped in 1993 soared by 170 per cent on
the previous year to 7.2 million worldwide. Research by Infotech
suggests that by 1999, 8 out of every 10 computers will have a
CD-ROM drive attached. The reason for the take-up is three fold:
they are cheap, they work and, with the increasing bulk of
Windows software, they fulfil a very useful function.

As with all emerging technologies, pricing is the key. CD-ROM
drives are available to computer dealers for under $100. They are
also being heavily pushed by software giants such as Microsoft,
which has used the increased user base of the drives deliver a
range of innovative software that takes advantage of CD ROM's
massive storage capability by allowing the user to run video
clips or search huge databases.

The Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM was set in 1986 by Philips
Electronics NV and Sony Corp. This set of guidelines for how data
was compressed and laid down onto the tracks of the disk.

Further standards allowed for compressed audio to be interwoven
with data - CD-ROM XA. The emerging Orange Book standard, which
is still under development, covers CD-R (recordable CD-ROM). At
present CD-ROM disks can only be record in one pass, unlike
magneto-optical (MO) disks and is a drawback of CD-ROM - that,
although it is very cheap for software houses to publish software
onto it - it is more expensive than conventional MO disks for
ordinary users to save data to.

The other CD-ROM standards relate to the drives themselves. The
original MPC (Multimedia PC) standard stated that the drive must
have a 'sustained data transfer rate' of at least 150Kb per
second, while using no more than 40 per cent of the CPU.

This standard was soon superseded, as a data transfer of 150Kbps
proved too slow to accurately produce seamless video on screen. A
second generation of 'dual speed' CD-ROM drives, which read the
disks at speeds of 300Kbps and above, have been developed by
manufacturers including NEC Corp, Pioneer Corp and Toshiba Corp.
The new MPC2 standard reflects the requirement for digital video
stored on disk.

                       VIDEO CONFERENCING

The second successful usage of multimedia technology is full
motion video images run on a PC. This technology - primarily
driven by advances in compression algorithms - means that faster
and better quality video can be played on the PC.

The obvious and concrete benefits for business are apparent:
Computer Based Training (CBT), presentations, point of sale
displays and - potentially the one with the widest impact - video
conferencing.

Video Conferencing is an area of concerted development for large
companies such as Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, mainly because
the technology developed for businesses will also crossover to
the perceived lucrative area of domestic video-on-demand
services.

Both Intel and high end workstation provider Silicon Graphics Inc
have developed video conferencing systems for the PC - although
both have been held back by the limitations of the personal
computer which when it was originally designed, or as it evolved,
was not expected to survive in so many manifestations.

As a consequence, video data can be sent at speed along ISDN
lines (although even these are slow offering 64 or 128Kbps
compared with fibre optic cables which can run parallel channels
each containing many megabits per second) but is brought
shuddering to a halt when it gets to the PC.

"The biggest bottleneck on sending and receiving video is the
system bus" said Silicon Graphics Steve Webb."

"Development there has not kept pace with processor development."
Launched in mid-1993, the Silicon Graphics Indy Workstation was
the first PC system built for dedicated peer-to-peer video
conferencing. It came with a 30 frames per second video camera
bolted to the top of the monitor and an ISDN port.

On the Intel platform, the struggle has been to improve the
compression of the mass of video data coming into the PC. Intel
itself released its Smart Video Recorder and Indeo compression
card in April 1993, but admitted that peer-to-peer video
conferencing required compression beyond what was available at
the time.

Intel limited its efforts to allowing PC users to view video
clips and this is where video on the desktop has stalled for a
while.

Many of the technical problems with the PC's capacity to handle
video have since been improved but there is one major obstacle to
overcome.

The lack of a nation-wide fibre optic cabling structure means
that video conferencing will - initially, at least  - be limited
to within a specific site, rather than over wider sites where it
is really most useful.

                          POINT OF SALE

Point of Sales Kiosks are a spin-off from PC video conferencing,
but a spin-off with, real spin. Point of Sales (POS) kiosks are
designed to run full motion video product demonstrations for
customers. The more sophisticated can also provide a 'real time'
video link to remote sales staff.

The Thomas Cook multimedia travel kiosk - at the firm's flagship
Marble Arch branch - is a good example of POS multimedia in
action.

Using a system developed and installed by Olivetti, prospective
tourists are wafted to their dream destinations without even
having to leave the travel agents. The system, which ended its
trials in prototype in mid-1994, uses 17" touchscreen to allow
customers to access video and audio presentations of popular
holiday destinations.

The POS system is more than just a fancy travel brochure. It has
an integrated video link so the customer could call up a
salesperson in the top corner of the screen. The system even
accepts electronic payment by credit card.

"Pushy sales staff scare off more customers than technology,"
says the Inteco Inc research firm, adding that certain types of
retail operations - where the products being sold are technical
or sophisticated - are better suited to selling by kiosk than
others.

The Thomas Cook system was based around a 486 PC with video
camera and board, ISDN connector, CD-ROM drive and, most
importantly, a touchscreen. Previous research has shown that the
keyboard is the major cause of fear and loathing amongst the non-
computer-literate.

The real interest with multimedia kiosks though, is as a
precursor for the world of home shopping.

This is where much of the development is, with the idea that the
user can summon up product information and make purchases from
their own home. The first moves in the UK have been through Intel
and Microsoft signing up with US cable companies to provide a
limited form of 'video-on-demand.' Multimedia kiosks are seen as
a link to the lucrative world of home interactive shopping.

                               CBT

Computer Based Training (CBT) and Presentations were the first
real uses of multimedia, and are still the biggest employers of
interactive technology.

CBT is primarily a way for the largest companies to standardise
the training that they give employees - by making sure that
everyone gets exactly the same message at the same time.
Multimedia sales presentations have traditionally been the
preserve of the largest corporates, which usually focus more on
an identical message tailored by bespoke software providers, than
on any egalitarian cutting edge technology.

The growth in CBT and presentations has come as they have been
opened up to smaller companies and developers, fuelled by the
launch of multimedia authoring tools.

The market leader for Windows authoring packages is Multimedia
Toolbook 3.0 from Asymetrix, which allows full-motion video
editing and the incorporation of video on the desktop. The
programme can then be imported into a more conventional
presentation package. As the use of multimedia extends to the
less bold, authoring tools will be used by wider  audiences
developing a broader range of interactive applications.

            3DO DENIES IT NEEDS EXTERNAL FINANCING

3DO has denied reports that it is looking for increased financing
despite stockbrokers recommendations that the company look
outside for cash before the end of the year.

Reports from Reuters in January had suggested the Interactive
Multiplayer device maker's chairman, Trip Hawkins, was making
calls for external financing for the 3DO graphics accelerator,
the M-2.

But a spokesperson for the company countered the report, saying
that the company would call on its existing associates, including
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd and Goldstar Co Ltd, before
casting a net out for new investors.

"If we do need financing we would prefer to go to our partners
first", the company said, adding that Hawkins had only suggested
that the M-2, codenamed 'Bulldog', as "an attractive strategic
business partnership for outside businesses".

But David Tabizel, a multimedia analyst at Durlacher stockbrokers
in London, thinks the company will need more money in the next
six to nine months and should not accept it from its existing
partners.

"They're grown up now and should see if they can fight it out on
their own," he said. "They ought to be looking at the US
investment community based on the M-2."

Tabizel also voiced concern about Matsushita's involvement with
other manufacturers such as Panasonic Co and Japanese Victor Co.
"They're hedging their bets," he said.

Trip Hawkins said that the M-2 accelerator was scheduled to be
shipping later this year. He also claimed that the accelerator,
and other manufacturing cost savings that he would not specify,
could take $100 off the $400 3DO price tag.

The timing of M-2's release is vital against other platforms due
for release, he said.

"M-2 is going to transform 3DO into one of the most feasible
platforms," he said, although he added that it depends on the
successful release of other 64-bit machines such as Sony's
Playstation and Nintendo's Ultra."Atari's Jaguar, he said, is
"nearly dead in the water".

3DO shares took a hit in May last year, falling 20% when Hawkins
was reported to be putting $10m of his own money into the company
to support it over 1995.

However, the company said Hawkins had always put his own money
into the company. "It's never been a problem for us to raise
capital," the company said.

        KODAK SNAPS MOVING PICS WITH HIGHEST RESOLUTION

Eastman Kodak Co claims to have produced the world's highest
resolution SLR 36-bit digital camera that can be taken into the
field, the DCS 460, available immediately for GBP25,000.

The DCS 460 is a single shot camera that can take a colour image
with a single exposure rather than the multiple exposure needed
for most digital cameras limiting them to still life photographs.

The news follows an announcement in January that Canon, Nikon,
Hasselblad, Mamiya and Sinar are to use Kodak's digital imaging
technology from the DCS 400 series for their digital cameras.

The CCD imager that sits behind a standard 35mm camera enables a
total resolution of 6m pixels compared with other cameras that
offer 4m pixels. The imager sits in a special electronic back
fixed to the body of a Nikon N90 camera.

The DCS 460 is a 'multi-megapixel' camera that does not require
multiple exposures to render a single colour image, a
characteristic that limits other cameras to still life
photographed in a studio. Kodak claims the single exposure camera
increase portability to the field or the studio.

Time taken between power-on and the first shot is 0.25 seconds
with about 12 seconds between shots while the camera saves the
image to disk. The DCS 460 can store images on removable PCMCIA-
ATA cards and includes a battery pack that is claimed to provide
power for over 300 images in a single charge.

Sound annotation can be included in the image for tagging or
identifying the image with a built-in microphone.

The imager for the DCS 460 is available separately as the DCS 465
Digital Camera Back. The digital imager fits to the body of 4" by
5" SLR devices. Pricing was not available.In February, Sony Corp
challenged Kodak's Photo CD by joining Japanese camera company,
Konica Corp, to develop a digital imaging system that records
film on Sony's 2.5" Mini Discs.

Sony's system enables users to record images from photographic
negative films, slides, prints and printed materials directly
onto the optical disks, and edit the recorded images and
manipulate them into various formats. The system comprises an
image recorder, an image processor and a scanner. Up to 200
images can be written on one disk, and it takes seven seconds to
record one negative. Prices and marketing for Sony's system have
not yet been set.

       ASYMETRIX SELLS ENTERTAINMENTS FOR WINDOWS TOOLS

Eighty nine people are to go at Asymetrix Corp, Bellevue,
Washington which is selling its entertainment division in order
to focus on Windows tools for multimedia development and client-
server offerings.

It said that it is in talks with potential buyers but no sale has
been made.

The company's acting president Vern Raburn said that although the
company had doubled its revenue over the last year it had become
clear that if it were to achieve its long-term business and
financial goals, it had to focus its resources in those areas
that would provide the most opportunity for growth.

It sees these as visual and multimedia authoring software with
appropriate add-on tools; graphics tool for creating three
dimensional images and animation; and a video editing tool.
The core product in the client-server tools business is Asymetrix
InfoModeler version 1.5, a visual modelling tool for database
design.

The entertainment division's products include screen savers based
on Jurassic Park, the Pink Panther, Rocky and Bullwinkle among
others.

Asymetrix says it is also attempting to sell Compel, the
company's multimedia presentation graphics product.

                     THE GREAT EXHIBITION

The US, UK, Japan, France, Germany, Canada and Italy - the Group
of Seven - met in the weekend of February 25/26 to discuss the
impact of the information superhighway on jobs, culture and
economics.



"The distances which separated the different nations and parts of
the globe are rapidly vanishing before the achievements of modern
invention, and we can traverse them with incredible ease ...
thought is communicated with the rapidity, and even by the power,
of lightning."

So said England's Prince Albert in a speech given to Royal
Commissioners of the Exhibition in preparation for the Great
Exhibition of May 1, 1851. The Exhibition was the world's chance
to show off the latest and greatest technology and gave the
analysts of the age an opportunity to discuss what could be done
to make it better.

Almost 150 years later, G-7 ministers in Belgium over the weekend
of February 25/26 were surrounded by a trade fair of scientific
sorcery from more than 100 of the world's leading technology
firms.

The amazement was apparent as delegates watched demonstrations
including machines to check hand prints instead of passports,
two-way educational link ups for schoolchildren in isolated areas
and virtual reality guided tours of world museums.

Winding up the conclusion of the Conference, the Chair said, "Les
temps est venu." The time has come... again.

But the G-7 conference differs from its Victorian equivalent is
that the participants do not believe we are creating a perfect
world.

Jaques Delors, chairman of the Information Society Round Table
said, "I am not saying that a globalised world will be better
than a non-globalised one. Maybe we lived better in the 15th
Century... one must face reality."

This reality has added two uncomfortable lessons to the
unswerving passion that enthused the Victorians to consider
theirs the"period of most wonderful transition" that held the
world for a little under a century.

The fact that some countries have lagged the technological leaps
of the US, Europe and Japan has not been lost on the G-7's
ministers. To avoid a two-tier system, ministers are talking of
bringing developing countries up to speed by allowing them to
"leap-frog" the technological evolution over which they have
presided. Open access to networks and the equality of opportunity
are central principles of the G-7 framework.

But jumping evolutionary stages and avoiding the instability that
can occur in economies swamped by technological revolution is no
easy process.

In cases such as Singapore, which is small enough to share the
benefits equally among its population, little administration is
needed.

In others, with urban and rural areas so far apart that whole
cultures differ within the country, the two can work in conflict.

As one economist pointed out, the conference would not attempt to
solve the world's problems, but the adverse affects of hasty
evolution is evident in the trade wars between US and China.

China, like Japan, has been leap-frogging technology for years
and the US, having most to gain from deregulated competition due
to a massive and highly sophisticated telecommunications
infrastructure, is aware of the threat to fair competition that
is inherent in an unbalanced global system.

China suffers - or will suffer - from a culture that has not
grown up with copyright law and expects the black market to act
as a valid sector of the economy. That same culture will find it
difficult to marry urban and rural areas when faced with the
scale of telecommunications multimedia.

Technology can be treated as an exogenous variable in economics,
driving or being driven by a country's internal money system.
Small countries such as Singapore can benefit easily if the gains
due to technology can be distributed quickly and fairly around a
small population.

But a country the size of China, or the former Soviet Union,
requires a stronger hold on the infrastructure and education
Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's vice president, sees investment in
domestic labour as the greatest benefit G-7's ministers can offer
his country.

He sees his society becoming a mere consumer of information
unless foreign companies move manufacture to the newly
democratised country. "Come and make your computers in Ghana," he
said. "Come and make them in South Africa."

If the US gets its way and Al Gore, chieftain of its information
revolution, opens its telecommunications market to foreign
investment "up to 100%", there seems a much reduced role for the
authorities.

Computer standards - like governmental regulation, customarily
subject to the chore of an administration - have been in the
hands of the industry for years. But there is a central
distinction between the computer industry, with its competitive,
consumer-driven motivation, and the telecommunications industry
which has been the ward of government since it replaced the
railways.

It is a familiar saying by now that free trade tends to be
advocated by those people who have most to be gained from it.

Two weeks after the Great Exhibition of the 19th Century, the
editor of Illustrated London News pointed to the hoards of
working men and women who swarmed around the exhibits, "the men
who made the Exhibition what it is, and who, we fervently hope,
will derive the greatest advantage from it."

                      OUTSOURCING THE NET

CERN has passed responsibility for the Internet to MIT and the
French research institute, INRIA. Marsha W Johnston talks to the
Internet's adopted parents.



In the coming months, network security and commercialisation
issues, such as how to create paying services, will be the
highest priority subjects for Internet development, says Olivier
Muron, director of promotions and technology transfer for
France's National Institute of Research in Informatics
and Automation (INRIA).

Up until a few weeks ago, INRIA was just another Internet service
location and Muron's sentiment would have been just another Web
user's speculation. But following an agreement with the European
Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, INRIA, along with
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is now
responsible for supporting and managing the evolution of World
Wide Web (W3) technology.

CERN has been the centre of W3 technology since Tim Berners-Lee,
a CERN researcher, invented it in 1989. That the invention came
from the elite international community of high-energy physics was
not surprising, since it "is a very geographically distributed
and computer-literate community that has been using computer
networks to distribute documents and for email for a long time,"
says Mike Sendall, secretary for CERN's Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) experiments committee.

W3 was a welcome development because it alleviated the
physicists' headache of using multiple, incompatible networks
around the world to exchange the voluminous test data that is
critical to better understanding the behaviour of the universe.

Having invented W3 technology, CERN naturally developed as the
centre of the standardisation effort for 'The Net' (aka
Internet). "In the early days of The Net, it was entirely
appropriate for us to be the focus of activity," Sendall says.

Today, however, there is an entirely different story. No longer
is the Internet the privileged domain of a largely academic
computer user audience. The Internet Society reported that new
Net subscribers grew 22% in the fourth quarter of 1994, while the
(.)net domain, used largely by commercial service providers, grew
at an astonishing 66%. At this rate, the society predicts the Net
will count 100 million hosts by 1998.

"The centre of gravity has shifted, if you like; the Net is now
of much broader interest than just to our community," Sendall
said, by way of explaining why CERN chose to disengage itself
from W3  development and promotion.

"It was a question of the amount of work there is to do and to
what extent it maps onto CERN's mission," said Sendall. He added
that the approval in December of the Collider project made it
increasingly difficult for CERN to continue its historic W3 role.

At the time, Sendall was already in discussions with MIT and the
European Commission on establishing joint European/US support for
the W3 standards. "Both the EC and CERN wanted a strong European
presence with the standard and INRIA seemed like a good bunch of
people to take it over," he said.

Indeed, INRIA has been the starting point for some of France's
hottest young information technology companies, including Object
Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS) developer O2
Technology, C++ tools editor ILOG and SGML expert Grif. Aside
from running its own professional Web service.

INRIA developed a Web service '100 Years of Light in the
Paintings of French Museums' for the Ministry of Culture and was
retained by the EC as a 'national host' for advanced Web services
in its Advanced Communications Technologies & Services.

"INRIA has done quite a lot of Web development. They have not
played a big role in central standardisation issues, but they are
quite experienced in networking and security issues," Sendall
said, adding that those are the two most important areas for The
Net at this stage.

No decisions have yet been made on how to split development
duties, he said. Service support will be "divided up more or less
geographically to minimise our telecom charges, but it will be
transparent to the user," he said.

Broadly stated, however, INRIA and MIT's work will comprise four
main areas:
- evolution of Web components, including the markup language,
html, the client/server dial-up protocol, http, and url, the
universal residence locator;
- development of a reference code;
- supply of general information about the Web; and
- promotion of the technology and its distribution.

Sendall said CERN will continue Web developments that are
targeted specifically at its own user community, rather than
generally focused issues.

Muron places great importance on the informational aspect of
INRIA's charter. "We have to provide enough detailed information
about the Web so that someone who doesn't know anything about it
could learn on their own how to use W3 technology," he said.

In the meantime, INRIA is planning an increase in its own Web
service. "To pass the level of directory service consultation as
CERN's, which is automatically accessed by thousands of users
every day, we need bigger workstations and increased network
capacity," he said.

Sendall is not worried that CERN's departure will cause standards
to evolve away from the users. "We use lots of other standards
that we don't define."

                   REAL ACTORS TAKE A BREAK

Virtual actors are to be used in a commercial for Rowntree
Macintosh to be screened in May.

Rowntree, a subsidiary of Swiss food giant, Nestle SA, has
contracted Snapper Productions, a London-based production
company, to make the commercial using a virtual simulation
technique known as Motion Analysis.

Details of the production are a closely guarded secret but Robert
Goldbold, the producer of the commercial, said the techniques
used were "like nothing before".

Motion Analysis begins with a digital coding technique called
Cyberscanning which captures colour and texture data such as that
on a person's face. The data is then "wrapped around a geometric
wire-frame" and animated.

Cinesight Ltd, a digital production house working on Lawnmower
Man 2 in London and Los Angeles, said it was not aware of any
other commercial using this technique.

The lack of virtual reality technology in commercials was
emphasised by Pat Joseph, production director for The Mill, which
recently made an advert for the Nationwide building society , the
second biggest in the UK. The Mill's advert merged an image of
Alfred Hitchcock with a lookalike reading the script.

"There's very little VR in television commercials at the moment,"
he said, stressing that although using technology to sell was
impressive, "the most effective commercials are still the comic
ones".

Walt Disney Co has registered a patent that manipulates video
textures such as the face of a recording of a live actor.

            VIRTUAL SCHOOLING TRAVELS TO 14 STATES

The US West Foundation will be taking virtual reality across 14
states to schools which are unable to motivate children to
learning.

The Foundation is the philanthropic arm of telecommunications
company, US West Inc, which spent $1.2m of its annual $25m budget
on the project.

Two Virtual Reality Roving Vehicles (VRRVs) were proposed by the
Foundation in collaboration with the University of Washington's
Human Interface Technology Laboratory (HIT Lab) and UK virtual
reality systems firm, Division Ltd. The vehicles are actually
just vans carrying the virtual development equipment to schools
across US West's 14 state territory.

Virtual reality environments are ideal for stimulating children
who are not attending classes to take a more active role in the
lessons, according to Jane Prancan, executive director of the
Foundation.

Children and teachers are taught to use a menu-driven version of
Division's authoring software, dVise, to build virtual
environments in which they can move around rainforests or see the
movements of molecules."

It does require kids who put the virtual environment together to
do a lot of their own research," she said.

Clive Jones, a marketing manager for Division, said the menu-
driven system was far easier to use than language-based
programming environments.

Bringing up a menu, the children can choose shapes and colours,
positions and constraints, then scale or colour the virtual
world, he said. The developing environment enabled children to
create worlds with icons on screen or author on the fly in free-
space.

"The object of the programme is to bring in interest from
students who are switched off from schooling," he said, "using it
as a stimulus to bring them back into the learning process."

The Foundation first took the VRRVs to Garfield High School, a
school in a low-income, high-minority area of Seattle,
Washington. The vehicles will cover the rest of Washington before
moving on to Nebraska. The VRRV is also intended to be taken into
rural areas where technology is not given the funding afforded
metropolitan schools.

Division donated one third of the cost of the two GBP65,000
ProVision 100 systems and head mounted displays and the company
is keen to increase its presence in educational products like the
VRRV. It is currently involved in the 'Train to Travel' project
in Miami which uses virtual reality to teach mentally
disadvantaged children to use the local bus service.

The Foundation, which has donated more than $50m over the past
two years, also funded a $550,000 project in Denver, Colorado, to
create the on-line Families and Children Network launched in
February in partnership with advice agencies, in particular the
national non-profit network, HandsNet, and the Centre for Human
Investment Policy (CHIP) at the University of Colorado, Denver.

The Network links families to consultants in professional advice
agencies.

           RENDERMORPHICS 3D APIs DUE FOR WINDOWS96

Microsoft has acquired RenderMorphics to include 3D application
interfaces in versions of Windows after Windows95.

London-based RenderMorphics Ltd has been converting its Reality
Lab 3D rendering library to run on a variety of operating systems
including Windows NT 3.5 for iAPX-86, WinG, Alpha, PowerPC and
the next release of the Sony Playstation.

All employees will be brought into the Microsoft fold. Reality
Lab development will remain in the UK but the marketing personnel
will be relocated to the US. Terms of the deal were not disclosed
but Microsoft shares rose 50c to $62 following the news.

Anne Mitchard, senior Windows product manager in the UK, has been
given responsibility for Microsoft's development of the Reality
Lab 3D library. She said the technology would be used to develop
3D application programming interfaces (APIs) to be included in
future versions of Windows although it will not be available in
Windows 95.

She confirmed that the technology would increasingly become a
feature of future operating systems although she would not say
whether this meant an immersive environment for Windows.

"You're going to see a lot more 3D influence in operating system
environments," she said.

Nor would Mitchard comment on what the successor to Windows95
would be called although Brad Silverberg, vice president of
Microsoft's personal systems division, told PC Week in February
that the incremental upgrade would be called Windows96.

RenderMorphics sales would not be affected by the acquisition and
products, she said. Reality Lab 3D version 1.1, due by the end of
April, would still be available to outside developers. Version
2.0 is currently in beta.

Microsoft has been demonstrating a number of products at the
Multimedia Reviewers' Workshop in February, including the
Enhanced CD standard due to replace Multisession CD, and
Mediamatics Inc's software MPEG player that is planned for
Windows 95.

AOL.COM

A small advertisement in the local newspaper has had a group of
campaigners for better behaviour all over the place, Dutch and
Gloria Pruyne, picketing Fry's Electronics in Fountain Valley,
California, part of a seven store chain for two consecutive
weekends.

The ad read "Meet Dominique St Croix, Penthouse magazines'
Hottest pet! She'll Autograph Your Copy of the New Penthouse
Photo Shoot CD-ROM Volumes I, II and II, Saturday 2pm, Fry's
Electronics, Fountain Valley, California".

The Pruyne fliers read "Studies show that urban areas with
sexually-oriented businesses have higher crime rates than similar
areas without such businesses".

I spoke to Mrs Pruyne who advised me that she would not want her
daughter going out with a boy who had just pored over nude
bodies.

She doesn't actually have a daughter but two sons, one David, 27,
who lives at home with his parents and does have a CD player for
his PC. He claims never to have seen an 'adult' CD-ROM but says
he "gets the basic concept".

Gloria Pruyne complained that men had been coming out of the
store "waving the CDs in our faces".

"When men are into pornography, they desensitise themselves to
normal sexual stimulation," she said lowering, her voice to warn
me, "then they lead their wives into kinky sex".

A spokesperson for Fry's - usually impossibly difficult to
extract a comment from, in Palo Alto who would only identify
herself as "Janet" pointed out Dominique St Croix would have her
clothes on at the store when she arrived. When we checked at the
store, we found that Penthouse CD-ROMs have sold out with another
order placed and on the way.

                  CROSS DRESSING NEVER EASIER

The virtual mirror, which enables people to try clothes on using
the computer, has been developed by Spanish firms, Arcast SA and
Cyan Animatica SA.

Arcast's Luis Claudio Arfuch described the system as a "kind of
automatic cash-dispenser, with a built-in camera that captures a
high-definition image of the potential customer".

A height and weight sensor helps to adjust the parameters of a
standard model to each person. The biggest technical challenge is
creating certain effects, such as tucking a shirt into trousers.
Once items have been chosen, the machine prints out a ticket
showing  size and price.

The machine will operate interactively 24 hours a day, so it can
be consulted even when the shop is closed.

                   AMERICA ONLINE PRESSURES
              MICROSOFT NETWORK WITH 2M SUBSCRIBERS

America Online has added over 500,000 subscribers giving it a
total of 2m users of a service which analysts reckon is cheap and
intuitive enough to threaten the Microsoft Network due later this
year.

Figures from America Online, the largest on-line service in the
US, show that it has more than trebled its subscriber base in
just over a year. The on-line service provider had 600,000
subscribers in January 1994.

Lorraine Sileo, an on-line analyst for Simba Information Inc,
admitted she found it hard to believe America Online's success
was sustainable but the company's low and predictable connection
costs would put it at the head of its competitors for some time.

Although America Online claims to have spread "through word of
mouth", she said it had gained a considerable number of
subscriptions from the access software being included in bundles
with PCs. America Online spokesperson, Pam McGraw, refused to
comment on how many subscriptions arose from PC bundles.

Sileo said affordable charges with no surprise bills was the most
important factor to families. "You know what your bills are going
to be," she said.

While this applies to present competition such as Compuserve Inc
and Prodigy Services Co, Sileo also drew attention to the
Microsoft Network as a potential victim to home consumers'
prerequisites, citing too few free areas and the possibility of
an unreliable launch.

"Microsoft probably won't launch until the end of the year
considering its anti-trust problems," she said, "and when it does
I don't think it will have the content. There will probably be
more premium services (than America Online). Right now America
Online doesn't have to worry about the Microsoft Network."

Refusing to comment on America Online's competition, McGraw said
the success was due to the mix of features and affordable price
of the on-line service.

          LONG-DISTANCE PROVIDERS GET "WAKE-UP CALL"
                    FROM NETPHONE ON INTERNET

The pending Internet telephone service is a "wake-up call" to
purveyors of long-distance telecommunications, said Andrew Green,
founder and president of Electric Magic Company in San Francisco.

The three-year-old company is currently sampling a demo version
of its voice Internet software product, NetPhone, over the World
Wide Web.

Because of the proprietary nature of the few Internet Phone
methodologies now hitting the market, long distance carriers are
not under a threat - for the moment, Green said.

"I see Internet telephone service as an inspiration and a wake-up
call to the telephone industry," he said. "This is something that
can't come from the top down. It has to come up from the bottom
roots of the industry.

"I don't see Internet telephones replacing normal phones, but
acting as an adjunct to them."

Right now, interoperability and the fact that relatively few
people are hard-wired into the Internet, are the biggest factors
holding back the technology.

But all it takes is time, he said, adding, "give it a couple
years. It's just a matter of cranking out the software".

Internet telephones will provide much more flexibility because of
the lack of regulatory controls and standards existing on today's
long-distance carriers.

"You can't even do something as simple as split the cost of a
phone call," Green pointed out.

Internet phones are a good use of the bandwidth using only about
one-sixth of the carrier. Internet packet-switched signals travel
at about 10,000bps as opposed to the 64,000bps required for
normal connection-switched voice calls.

NetPhone software, which Green developed with his partner, Denise
Meyers, runs only on Macintosh LC II computers or better with
800Kb of memory available.

System requirements also include a microphone and a serial-line
Internet protocol (SLID) or a point-to-point protocol (PTP)
Internet connection.

NetPhone uses Electric Magic Company's own audio compression
algorithm which compresses the voice bandwidth to 10,000bps over
the Internet.

The software is available for demo review over Info-Mac and its
UK mirror site. NetPhone is available for purchase at $55 for one
copy and $85 for two.

VocalTec Inc, based in Tel Aviv, IsrAel, and NorthVale, New
Jersey, announced the Internet Phone last month. the software
allows a TCP/IPconnection to carry an international telephone
call via the Internet at the cost of a connection to a local
Internet provider at local prices.

VocalTec is offering the software at $50 with plans to double the
price when the company's trial period finishes in April. An
evaluation copy is available from VocalTec's Internet Web site
which had 25,000 accesses in the first three days of opening.

will carry out text searches of all Web documents on the net as

this facility makes the software technically superior to other

expansion through subscription, advertising or making a charge

Maudlin said that Lycos has downloaded about half the World Wide

Summer by making the "uglier bits more visible". Peter Welsh,

Euromagnetics, said the new moulding design will do to the PC
what Swatch did to the watch. Transparent panels will overlay red
and black mouldings to make the internals of the PC visible and a
big, red knob on the front. Virgin began production of PCs in
1993 with targeted sales of 25,000 a year but failed to secure
sufficiently firm retail channels for the PCs. The company hopes
its OEM agreement with ICL last September will put it on sturdier
ground.

Full and immediate competition in the communications industry

Full and immediate competition in the communications industry
would create 48,100 new jobs in Massachusetts by the year 2000,
according to a study released by internation economic forecasting
firm, The WEFA Group. The study concludes that immediate
competition would result in the creation of 3.4 million new jobs
in all states and all major industry groups by the year 2005.
Legislation currently being debated in the US would repeal
federal restrictions prohibiting competition in local and long
distance telephone, cable television and manufacturing. The WEFA
Group Study found that full and immediate competition would lower
telecommunications and cable rents by nearly $55 billion per
year. In fact, cost savings associated with competition would add
$850 to the annual disposable income of every US household.

Singapore Buys Into U.S. Video Server Technology

The Republic of Singapore with 3.2 million population and a land area
smaller than New York City has emerged over the past decade as one of
the economic tigers of Asia. Already a powerhouse in electronics
manufacturing, Singapore seems destined to emerge as an important stop
on the information superhighway.

According to the World Competitiveness Report, which ranks the
economic strength of countries across eight categories, Singapore
ranked first in telecommunications infrastructure, largely because all
of Singapore's telephones are digital, and all of its telephone
exchanges are linked through optical fiber. All Singapore homes are
expected to be connected to fiber-optic cable by the year 2005. In
addition, about 99 percent of the Singapore population owns color
televisions; 84 percent own video cassette recorders; and four percent
own video laser-disc players.

And Singapore has also just launched a video-on-demand trial using ATM
and a Hewlett-Packard video server that will bring it firmly into the
21st Century. Initially, the system will cater to 300 households, of
which 20 will be completed in third quarter 1995 (first phase) and the
remaining 280 homes in fourth quarter 1995 (second phase). The total
contract amount for the Project will amount to about $9 million.

The HP Connection

The Singapore video-on-demand trial, which is being built and operated
by Singapore Telecom, will be using the same Hewlett-Packard
MediaStream Server video servers that are being used by Pacific
Telesis, BellSouth and SNET in the U.S.

Unlike some other video dialtone solutions, HP's MediaStream Server
video server is designed explicitly for interactive video services.
HP's video server is based on a new hardware architecture called the
"video transfer engine," which HP says is built for moving vast
quantities of video data across networks in a way that lowers the cost
of delivering each video stream to users. HP's video transfer engine
technology is scalable and modular, allowing interactive-television
providers to add capabilities to each video server and to connect
servers in a network as consumer and business demand for
interactive-television services grows. For example, a single HP video
server can be scaled to deliver from 75 to 10,000 video streams, and
when multiple servers are connected, millions of households and
businesses could use the network to receive video-on-demand.

Joining HP to provide technology and services for Singapore Telecom's
video-on-demand trial are Mitsui & Co. Limited as the consortium
leader; Fujitsu Limited of Tokyo, which will be system integrator and
supplier of ATM switches and network technology; and Philips Singapore
Pte Limited of the Netherlands, which will supply settop boxes.

Sybase in Singapore

The other major vendor involved in the Singapore trial is Sybase, Inc.
of Emeryville, Calif. HP will integrate Sybase's software to run on
the MediaStream Server product. Sybase's Intermedia architecture
software includes three products:

- Intermedia Server for control and integration

- Gain Momentum for multimedia authoring

- Gain Interplay for settop box integration.

The deal marks the company's first overseas agreement for Intermedia
and follows on the heels of announcements that Sybase software has
been chosen by SNET and Cox Cable for their interactive television
trials. In Singapore, the Sybase software will be used to author,
deliver and manage ITV applications and integrate these applications
with Singapore Telecom's back-end subscriber and accounting systems.
In addition to working with Singapore Telecom on the ITV trial, Sybase
is also providing the company with relational database management
software to manage key business applications at Singapore Telecom,
including the company's cellular billing system.

The Intermedia products, in conjunction with video processor hardware
and settop boxes provide a complete environment for authoring,
delivering, and managing interactive multimedia applications and
services. The Intermedia Server is based on Sybase's SQL Server RDBMS
technology and provides two critical components: control and message
integration. The control component stores and manages information
about multimedia data objects (such as names and locations of movies
or product descriptions). The message routing component provides
routing of requests to and from the various components (settop box,
video server, and back-end business systems for billing and
subscriptions).

Gain Momentum is an object-oriented multimedia authoring environment
"for developing visual, intuitive, and entertaining applications." In
addition, Gain Momentum can access and manipulate data from Sybase and
other databases, allowing customers to integrate multimedia
applications with their existing and future business systems. Gain
Interplay is a software tool that allows interactive multimedia
applications to be played on low-cost, small-memory, hardware devices
such as the television settop boxes and home personal computers that
will be used to access a variety of multimedia offerings. The Gain
Interplay product will be available on a variety of settop boxes,
including Phillips' CD-I, Scientific-Atlanta's PowerTV,
Hewlett-Packard's Kayak, as well as on Windows-based personal
computers.

Content and Beyond

The Singapore video-on-demand trial is part of a broad government
initiative called "IT 2000." The goal of IT 2000 is to build a
state-of-the-art, broadband communications infrastructure and
supporting services to further strengthen the competitiveness of the
Singapore economy and to improve its residents' quality of life.
Singapore Telecom's multimedia trial will offer a broad range of
content, including customized interactive news, home shopping,
interactive learning for children and adults, documentaries, movies
and sports.

Because the population is predominately English-speaking, Singapore
Telecom expects early programming for its interactive-television
service will be primarily in English.

In the trial, Singapore Telecom will offer interactive services such
as movies-on-demand, interactive news and education, as well as home
shopping.

U S West Announces Omaha Multimedia Trial Deployment Plans Following
FCC Action On Channel Allocation

Following the December 23, 1995 Federal Communication Commission
action approving U S West Communications' channel allocation proposal,
the company has announced plans to move forward with its interactive
multimedia trial in Omaha, site of the largest interactive multimedia
trial in the United States. The company said it intends to move
forward as soon as an FCC order is released.

The next step, according to Larry Levine, vice president and general
manager of U S West, is to notify the video content providers (VCPs)
who requested to participate in the trial as to the number of analog
channels each will receive as a result of the FCC's decision. The VCPs
who requested analog channel capacity in Omaha are: Interface
Communications Group, Inc.; U S West Broadband and Multimedia
Services; Cablewest Communications Corp.; MetroVision, Inc.; Henry W.
Harris; Cable Video Store; and The Knowledge Network of Greater Omaha.
USA Video Corporation and Telephone Video of America have requested
capacity on the digital video network only. U S West Broadband and
Multimedia Services group has requested only one analog channel which
it intends to use as a promotional channel.

"We expect the video content providers will convene in January to
select the programming which will appear on the shared analog
channels," said Levine. He said U S WEST will provide a facilitator to
assist in these deliberations, but will not itself participate in any
decisions concerning selection, pricing, or presentation of video
programming.  Levine said he expects this allocation process to take
60-90 days.

Following that process, all of the video content providers (also known
as "level 2s") can proceed with activities necessary to launch their
consumer offerings. U S West Communications' "level 2" organization
expects to begin a "friendly user" trial to homes of about 50
employees starting in late first quarter. Following successful
completion of its friendly user trial, U S West will make its services
available to customers in a market trial area of more than 40,000
homes. This is expected to start during second quarter 1995.

In other FCC action, the Commission dismissed without prejudice four
video dialtone applications for Albuquerque, N.M.; Colorado Springs,
Colo.; Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "While we are disappointed
with this action, we believe the fact they were dismissed without
prejudice is a positive sign," said Levine. "We intend to make the
necessary revisions and re-file them as soon as possible." U S West
Communications announced in February 1993 that it would build an
interactive multimedia network serving customers in its 14-state
region. Two months later, the company revealed plans for the technical
and market trials in Omaha. The suppliers for the Omaha technical
trial are Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. (video transmission components and
digital settop terminals); 3DO (settop terminal technology); Digital
Equipment Corp. (video server); New Century Communications
(subscriber-management software) and AT&T (telephony components).

Intelligence at Large Offers Expanded Functionality for Document
Conferencing

Intelligence at Large, Inc. has introduced BeingThere Sidebar, a
multimedia utility for video mail and document collaboration.
BeingThere Sidebar is currently bundled exclusively with the company's
BeingThere conferencing software, providing a sophisticated video mail
application at no extra cost. BeingThere Sidebar acts as an on screen
"conference table" for users to drag disparate information, such as
files, text, graphics or recorded audio and video. Once information is
on the table, users can display, resize, edit and synchronize it for
creating video mail, multimedia presentations and QuickTime movies.
Although feature-rich, BeingThere Sidebar provides an intuitive
interface, leveraging the drag-and-drop technique familiar to
Macintosh users.

In conjunction with the company's BeingThere 2.0 software, users can
share the information on the table with multiple users in
collaborative meetings and conferencing sessions. This feature works
even when the host Macintosh is unattended, so that remote users can
call at their convenience to access and share data. By providing
synchronized audio, video and text, users can easily create video mail
messages for efficient communications. In addition, users can send and
receive Sidebar audio, video, graphics and video presentations using
Apple's PowerTalk which is built into System 7.5. Intelligence at
Large recommends using System 7.5 on a Macintosh 68040 or Power
Macintosh with 8MB RAM for best performance.

Sun and Thomson Alliance Launches Open TV Interactive Multimedia
Environment

Open TV, an operating environment for interactive television, has been
introduced by the alliance between Sun Microsystems Inc. and Thomson
Consumer Electronics SA. This is the first product from the alliance,
presenting a platform-independent solution for delivering interactive
services to consumers. Demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) were samples of applications the alliance expects will be built
by developers using Open TV technology, including ticket channel,
interactive advertising and video-on-demand. The Open TV environment
allows cable, telco, satellite, and other broadcast network operators
and content providers to download interactive applications to settop
decoders through existing networks. The applications then use the
return path of the settop box to provide full interactive
transactional capabilities.

Open TV is platform-independent, designed to run on a wide range of
settop systems and it can be deployed on broadcast or ATM switched
networks. The commitment to open systems is driven by the philosophy
of both Sun and Thomson to develop interfaces based on industry
standards and protocols. At CES, the alliance team demonstrated a
number of sample applications running in the Open TV environment on a
live digital interactive decoder. In the demonstrations, viewers were
alerted to the presence of Open TV interactivity by an on-screen icon.
Through the remote control, the viewer could make selections that
include requesting information, ordering products, or additional
services. The sample applications shown included:

- A ticket channel application demonstration begins with MTV-style
programming and then overlays interactive graphics, allowing the
viewer to choose and order tickets to musical events.

- The interactive advertising demonstration shows traditional,
currently running ads and then invites the consumer to request further
information or browse through a product catalog and order specific
products.

- An video-on-demand application provides a scrollable list of
available films and concerts. The viewer makes a choice, and the
selection is immediately downloaded to the television through the
digital interactive decoder. This application offers full VCR control,
including fast forward, rewind and pause.

- The alliance will also support a set of authoring tool solutions for
Open TV applications focused on speeding the development, production
and deployment of new interactive programs.

Microsoft to Use Mosaic

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has announced that it has signed
an agreement with Spyglass Inc. to license Spyglass and National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) technology that includes
the widely accepted Mosaic multimedia software for browsing the
Internet's World Wide Web. Microsoft intends to enhance and integrate
the technology, including NCSA Mosaic-based browsing, into various
Microsoft products.

Microsoft disclosed in a related announcement today it will use this
enhanced browsing technology in combination with The Microsoft
Network, Microsoft's planned online service, to offer members of The
Microsoft Network seamless access to both World Wide Web sites and The
Microsoft Network content and services. Microsoft has formed a
strategic relationship with UUNET Technologies Inc. to build a new,
dedicated, global TCI/IP network so members of The Microsoft Network
can connect directly to the Internet. Microsoft is planning for this
new network capability and the browser software to be available by the
end of 1995.

"By choosing NCSA Mosaic as the basis for World Wide Web browsing
capability in future products, Microsoft is building on the de facto
standard for the Internet," said Mike Maples, executive vice president
of products at Microsoft.   "We have always believed in providing open
technologies for our customers and industry partners, and we want to
extend that belief by adopting Internet standards in our products."

Microsoft will work closely with the University of Illinois' NCSA in
helping to develop, use and create protocols for future Internet
technology. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign originally
licensed its Mosaic technology to Spyglass in 1994.

CableLabs Board Approves 1995 Budget

The Board of Directors of Cable Television Laboratories Inc. has
approved a $13.1 million budget for 1995 that authorizes CableLabs
management to raise the CableLabs staffing level to 61 positions.
There are now 50 staff members. The budget breakdown is as follows:
$9.5 million in operations; $2.9 million in the research and
development project pool; $700,000 for capital equipment. The project
pool is apportioned throughout the year for non-overhead projects.
Funding is based upon approval by the CableLabs project planning
process, which is open to all staff. The 1994 budget was about $12.6
million.

The Labs' two priorities in 1995 are providing members with
information about technologies that can enable cable operators to
enter into new businesses such as the telecommunications business, and
assisting members to deploy digital transmission and compression
technology.

To be added to CableLabs' employee complement are three unfilled
positions from 1994:  an engineer for radio frequency and digital
signal processing, a video and telephony engineer, and a vice
president for network architecture and design development. The new
positions are a membership services representative, a director of
operations engineering projects, two MPEG software engineers, three
administrative assistants, and a senior advisor.

Probita and General Instrument to Explore Level One Gateway Solutions

Probita Inc. and General Instrument Corporation have announced the
companies will work together to explore Level One Gateway solutions
for the management of connections in interactive video networks. The
Level One Gateway connects consumers with multiple information
providers by coordinating all elements of the Level One transport and
access networks. The two companies have agreed to leverage their
respective expertise in the development of the gateway for interactive
environments. The eventual system will, the companies said, manage
interaction among settop terminals, video servers, headends and
optical nodes on a real-time basis.

As multiple services come on-line, the Level One Gateway software will
control the switch fabric much like a telephony central office switch.
It will be a critical, 24-hour facility that must remain in continuous
operation while the network hardware, service definitions, and its own
software evolve through experience. Unlike central office switches,
however, the Level One Gateway will control a diverse distributed
switching system environment and support a variety of operator-defined
call models and applications.

"The architecture of the GI Level One Gateway will create an open
system usable in a multi-vendor environment," said Robert Lund,
director of network architectures and products for Probita. "It will
accommodate a wide range of subscribers on a variety of hardware
platform configurations. These two points appear to be of critical
importance to Level One operators."

CHIP BRINGS QUALITY VIDEO AUTHORING

Digital Equipment Corporation has announced a powerful, new
video coder/decoder (codec) chip that delivers high-quality,
30-frames-per-second (fps) video compression and decompression
for desktop PCs. The PCI-based 21230 codec chip puts
affordable video authoring and video conferencing on a wide
range of platforms based on Pentium, Alpha, and PowerPC
microprocessors.

Ed Caldwell, vice president, Digital Semiconductor, a Digital
Equipment Corporation business, said, "With the 21230 video
chip, PC vendors can deliver affordable capability on the
desktop for creating and using video-enhanced presentations,
interactive training, video conferencing, on-line monitoring,
and other forms of multimedia communication."

Video Compression Essential

Susan Yost, Digital Semiconductor's multimedia marketing
manager, called image compression/decompression "essential" to
reduce the heavy data storage and bandwidth demands of video
applications.

"Video authoring and video conferencing need a video codec
that not only compresses data efficiently, but delivers
high-quality video that accurately represents the original
material. And they need it in real time," she said.

"The 21230 chip is the first video codec to meet this
challenge at an affordable price," Yost continued. "The 21230
video chip implements state-of-the-art compression and
filtering techniques that provide efficient data compression,
exceptional image quality, and realtime performance. In
addition, as a PCI-based, single-chip implementation, it is
designed and priced for the PC market."

According to Peter Hess, manager of OEM development for FAST
Electronic US, Inc., a manufacturer of multimedia products,
"The 21230 chip is capable of encoding video and audio data
from tapes and laser disks into MPEG-1 format in real time for
storage and playback on digital compact disks."

Video Chip, CPU Work Together

Designed as a coprocessor, the 21230 chip takes advantage of
host CPU computing resources while concentrating on codec core
processes to achieve maximal functionality in a cost-effective
package.

The superior image quality of the 21230 video chip reflects
the product's sophisticated filtering, motion estimation, and
scene characterization capabilities, which enable optimal
video compression and decompression for excellent image
sharpness.

The chip interfaces directly to the PCI local bus and features
glueless interfaces to industry-standard NTSC and PAL
decoders, audio digital signal processors (DSPs), optional
peripherals, and external memory, greatly simplifying system
and board design processes.

Supports Video, Audio Standards

For video authoring, the 21230 chip supports MPEG-1
IB(B)P-frame and I-frame standards from constrained bit rates
(1.15 Mb/s) to higher bit rates. For video conferencing
applications, it implements the H.261 video compression
standard for H.320 video conferencing. In addition, the 21230
codec chip is architecturally compatible with the H.263
standard for H.324 POTS video conferencing. The chip also
offers resolution and format flexibility to satisfy customers'
specific needs.

Mikhael Haidar, general manager, Software and Systems
Technology Division at Analog Devices, Inc., said, "We have
worked cooperatively with Digital Semiconductor to provide our
industry- leading family of audio DSPs and codecs to complete
the audio subsystem of the 21230 solution," Haidar said. "This
combination furnishes outstanding multimedia capabilities for
desktop PCs at the lowest cost."

Pricing and Availability

Digital Semiconductor's 21230 video codec coprocessor chip is
priced at $75 in quantities of 10,000. Volume shipment is
scheduled for spring 1996.

The 21230 chip will be packaged with software drivers,
libraries and utilities for Windows 95 and Window NT to
expedite development on standard consumer platforms. An
evaluation board, documentation and supporting software also
will be available from Digital early in 1996 to help board and
system suppliers to design the 21230 chip into their products
quickly.

Digital Semiconductor, a Digital Equipment Corporation
business headquartered in Hudson, Massachusetts, designs,
manufactures and markets industry-leading semiconductor
products including Alpha microprocessors and PCI chips for
networking, bridging, and graphics/multimedia, as well as
low-power StrongARM microprocessors under license from
Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. Digital Semiconductor operates
design centers in Hudson; Palo Alto, California; Austin,
Texas; and Jerusalem, Israel. A new, $450-million fabrication
facility in Hudson will begin revenue production in 1996.

MARKETING FIREPOWER AND PARTNERSHIPS WILL DETERMINE WINNER IN BATTLE
FOR DVD SHARE

  Competition among DVD hardware manufacturers is shaping up as a
marketing war in which the company that can take advantage of brand
name recognition, software cross-promotions and economies of scale has
the best chance of reaping top revenues.
      Thomson Consumer Electronics has a considerable edge, based
on the company's product positioning revealed at the recent 1996
Winter Consumer Electronics Show.
      The company expects to deliver product in late summer, likely
before any other vendor.
  On the manufacturing side, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
Ltd. will make DVD players for Thomson throughout 1996.  In exchange,
Thomson plans to manufacture digital satellite systems Matsushita will
sell under the Panasonic brand.  In 1997, Thomson will manufacture DVD
players and Matsushita will produce DSS systems.        
      "We're putting the band back together," said Joseph Clayton,
Thomson executive vice president for marketing and sales, referring to
the OEM agreement the company struck with Matsushita in 1970 in the
VCR category.  
      Thomson today commands roughly a 20 percent share in VCRs and
is aiming even higher with DVD.
      "What other company has three brands as powerful as RCA,
ProScan and GE?" said Guy Johnson, Thomson vice president for video
and multimedia.  "Nobody even comes close." 
Clayton's company will combine the manufacturing capabilities of
Matsushita with Thomson's worldwide presence, under such brand names
as Telefunken in Germany, Thomson in France and Saba throughout
Europe, for the DVD launch.  Such a massive product rollout translates
into economies of scale, which will mean a price advantage at retail.
       At press time, only two companies had announced DVD hardware
pricing.  Thomson plans to sell its basic model for $499, and Toshiba
America Consumer Products Inc. will bring in its entry-level model at
$599.  
      To let consumers know DVD is a technology that will not
become outdated anytime soon, Thomson is relying on alliances and
cross-promotions with content providers, namely Warner Home Video. 
Warner will release software titles concurrently for DVD and VHS.  The
company also plans to deliver the movies and properties already out on
VHS in DVD format.
      But Warner is not relying solely on Thomson to grow the DVD
software market.  The firm plans to co-market with Toshiba as well. 
  "We will co-promote with several hardware companies," said Warren
Lieberfarb, Warner Home Video president.  Lieberfarb described his
modus operandi as "counterintuitive" but said Warner "holds several
hardware co-patents on DVD components with Toshiba." 
       Toshiba executives promise to deliver hardware to retail
prior to Labor Day.
  Sony Corp., which will sell DVD hardware initially this fall, is
ramping up DVD software efforts.  Columbia/Tri-Star Home Video will
release 150 movies for DVD and plans to have 50 DVD titles available
to coincide with the hardware's launch.  Certain retailers who carry
Sony hardware also will sell the software. 
      In the marketing arena, Thomson has a decided advantage over
Toshiba, a company that promises to be among the top three share-
holders of DVD.

INTEL RAMPS UP NEXT-GENERATION CHIPS TO GIVE PC MAKERS MORE OPTIONS

  By taking advantage of a .35 micron manufacturing technology,
Intel Corp. will be able to boost production on its 150- and 166-MHz
processors quickly, giving PC manufacturers an ample supply of the
next-generation processors they need to enhance their products.
  "This is by far the single biggest ramp we've had in the Pentium
history," said Joanne Hasegawa, a spokeswoman for the company.  "We
expect to see systems right off the bat." 
  Typically it takes Intel several months to produce enough new
processors to  fill demand, but PC manufacturers that spoke with
Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams said they expect an ample supply
of the new chips.
  NEC Technologies Inc. last week made its 150 MHz Pentium Ready
9552 available.  
  Other vendors Intel is supplying with its first 150 MHz and 166
MHz Pentium chips in quantities initially include Gateway 2000, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard Co..  IBM's 166 MHz unit is available.  (Intel, 408/765-

ATARI CORP. WILL BEGIN SELLING PC GAMES UNDER ITS NEW ATARI INTERACTIVE
DIVISION

  Hoping to leverage its library of video games including Pac Man and
Asteroids, Atari Corp. will begin selling PC games under its new Atari
Interactive division.  Analysts believe the company could have a tough
time selling its PC titles to retailers.  Atari has a history of poor
relationships with retailers because of overpromising titles, such as
its E.T. game, that flopped.  Atari has not had much success with its
Jaguar video-game console, which has sold approximately 200,000 units
since 1993.

CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WILL STORM THE MARKET
IN 1996 

     Three-dimensional graphics, improved chip functionality and
enhanced communications are the top three developments expected to
penetrate the home market for multimedia in 1996.  But do not look for
any major changes on the multimedia landscape before the second half of
the year.
  Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams spoke with several key
manufacturers and industry analysts to find out what trends and
technologies vendors should prepare to capitalize on this year.  Here is
what they had to say:    

  ...When Will the 3-D Market Explode?

  The most visible enhancement expected in the software and chip
businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.
  "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew of
features and performance that just aren't available today," said Ken
Wirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.  "By
the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of PC
systems come 3-D enabled."
  Wirt said at least 10 new 3-D companies entered the market last
year.
  What could slow the trend toward better graphics?  Insufficient
software.
  Experts involved with the technology disagree about when it will
hit the market in full force.
  "There'll be enough titles in the second half, say the September to
October time frame, that 3D is going to be a mainstream part of the
market," said Murali Dharan, vice president of marketing for consumer
PCs, NEC Technologies Inc.  "You'll see a few hit titles, and that's all
that'll be required.  People have bought Sony PlayStation and Sega based
on much less."
  Barry Lebu, president and CEO of Jazz Multimedia Inc., is even more
bullish on 3D.
  "It's really going to explode," he said.  "You'll probably see two
dozen titles out there in the next 90 days."    

  ...More Functions, Fewer Chips

  Look for more consolidation in the chip industry, with companies
attempting to buy each other and integrate several functions onto a
single chip.
  "People who have had strong markets in one area [audio, video or
communications], are going to try to expand," NEC's Dharan said.  "I
wouldn't be surprised if S3 went out and bought some other companies. 
You might also see an established company (be it a single chip firm or
company that manufactures multi-functional chips) go out and gobble up a
specialty chip company."
  The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, but
more functions could be on the way.
  "There are some rumblings about communications," Wirt said. 
"There's a couple guys saying they are going to combine all this with
DSP."
  Such a move, however, requires keen timing and a heavy R&D
investment.
  "Video, audio and communications are three separate disciplines,
and you're competing against companies that all they do is one thing,"
Wirt said, adding that "development cycles aren't synched up exactly."   
  Whether these new chip designs make it to the motherboard is
another question.
  Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, an
enhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia extensions,
sometime in 1996.
  "I don't think it will be ready until the second half of 1996,"
said Richard Chang, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. 

  ...Cable Modems On Hold

  Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means of
delivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in
1996.
  "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a game
through the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"
said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It can
take you two days to download the video we put on a couple of CDs."
  Others agree.
  Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmission
companies will begin work on new services.  But delivering service is
another story.
  "Anything beyond analog modems requires either the cable companies
or the telephone guys to upgrade their systems in some way," he said. 
"I don't think anything like that is going to happen widespread in
1996."

  ...Improved Communications Means Content Enhancements

  Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modem
technology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digital
simultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.
  Many vendors added high-end modems to their top PC models in 1995,
but the  technology is far from mainstream.
  "That's likely to happen in the second half [of 96]," said NEC's
Dharan.
  As a result, consumers will be able to do more things with their
PCs.  For example, they might use the technology to peruse information
about airline flights and make a reservation at the same time.
  Activision, and several other publishers, plan to leverage modem
technology to make better use of the Internet.  In the company's
upcoming title Spycraft, users will get information fed to them from the
company's Web site.
  "We'll be able to deliver extra levels, but the core game engine
and the graphics have got to be delivered on a CD-ROM," said Tenn.

  ...Budgets Grow, But Prices Continue to Fall

  Activision spends about $2.5 million to $3 million on development
per title, and company vice president Tenn sees that number rising.  
  "This business requires deeper marketing dollars and greater and
grander tools," he said.
  Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.
  "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points," said
Robert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average price
will go down because of the growth in the budget category.  It's going
to continue to sell."
  Activision's Tenn is not too concerned that the low-end titles will
bring down the prices of big-budget titles.
  "What you'll see is the back catalog will be priced down at $19 and
$20," he said.  "The consumer will continue to pay top dollar for the
top games."

  ..And on the Desktop Front

  Multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to drop
prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995 will
continue.
  "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that were
popular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with
International Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 price
points, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh features.
  And what are those features?
  By third quarter, 6x and 8x speed CD-ROM drives will become
standard features on PCs, along with 28.8 Kbps modems and 16 MB of RAM.

PACKARD BELL'S FORAY INTO SOFTWARE IS TOO BIG A STRETCH, `DOOMED TO
FAILURE'  

     Packard Bell Electronics Inc. is attempting to extend its brand
name into the CD-ROM business, but industry watchers are skeptical about
how much clout the firm will carry with software buyers.
  The company launched its Active Imagination software brand last
February as a pilot program, but is ramping up a grander CD-ROM effort
with updated packaging, a new distributions strategy and a new name--
Packard Bell Interactive.  
  The division's leaders believe it can rely on the operations
strength of its parent company for administrative, shipping and other
functions involved with selling software.
  "That gives us the opportunity to start this company with far less
revenue than a new startup would need," said Glenn Uslan, vice president
of corporate marketing.
  Analysts are skeptical. 
  "I think if they're going to try for synergies it's doomed to
failure," said Lee Isgur, an analyst with Jeffries & Co. Inc.  "There is
no evidence that a hardware brand has any impact on the success of the
software brand."
  Key industry players agree with Isgur.
  "Rarely, if ever, has a hardware company truly understood
software," said Ben Tenn, vice president of sales for Activision Inc.
  An executive who got his start selling hardware for Panasonic, Tenn
pointed out that industry heavyweights Matsushita and Sony have not been
able to translate their hardware expertise into the content arena.  "And
that's on a grand scale with enormous talent and resources," Tenn said. 

  But Packard Bell executives believe they can make the transition.
  "Our software will be available to all Packard Bell retailers this
quarter," said Uslan. 
  For the past six months, the company has bundled a two-for-one
software coupon inside its hardware to encourage customers to buy Active
Imagination software at retail.
  "By bringing the customer back in to buy more, we have a direct
contact with 3 to 4 million customers a year," Uslan said.  
  On the content side, Packard Bell is outsourcing title development
and focusing on the children's education market.  Four new CD-ROMs are
expected at retail in the next few weeks.  
  Rose Studios Inc. of Redmond, Wash., developed Little Red Riding
Hood and Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Australian-based Brilliant
Interactive Ideas Pty Ltd. developed Monster on the Loose and Dinosaur
in the Garden.
  Later this quarter, the company plans to bundle a copy of the
Yuckadoos, which hit retail last year under the Active Imagination
label, with every Packard Bell Interactive title.
  "We're hoping to sell 25,000 to 30,000 units in the first quarter
and give away that many," Uslan said.
  To aid the initiative, Packard Bell hired John Rutter, a former
marketing manager with Microsoft Corp., and Steve Boehm, who previously
held positions with Medio Multimedia and My Software Company.  (Packard
Bell Interactive, 818/735-7578; 206/654-4180.)

AMERICA ONLINE ACQUIRES IMAGINATION NETWORK; TWO DOZEN LAYOFFS
EXPECTED

     America Online Inc. [AMER] has acquired The ImagiNation Network
Inc. (INN), an online game provider, from AT&T [T].  The deal was
valued at more than $10 million, a source told MMWire.  As a
wholly-owned subsidary of AOL, INN will become a primary partner in
AOL's Games Channel, and is expected to strike deals with Internet
Service Providers as well as AOL's competitors, said Tom Monagan, AOL
spokesman.  INN's senior management team will remain intact, but the
company will lay off 24 employees, said INN spokeswoman Cindy Wilson. 
The game company has "critical experience" developing multiplayer
online games and the ability to "build community in the way we like,"
said Lawrence Schick, g.m. of games for AOL. INN will begin offering
games on AOL in the fall, and later this year will launch CyberPark, a
3-D environment in which gamers take on customized
characters--"avatars"--to play the games. (America Online, Ted
Leonsis, president, 703/448-8700)

$8.5+ MILLION CAMPAIGN FOR SEGA'S NiGHTS: CAN IT COMPETE WITH NINTENDO
64 DEBUT?

     In an apparent bid to upstage the much-anticipated debut next
month of the Nintendo 64 and its Super Mario 64 title, Sega of America
is launching an $8.5 million marketing campaign to promote its Sega
Saturn title, NiGHTS. ($49.99).  The title--which will debut on August
20--will come less than six weeks before Nintendo's debut on Sept. 30. 
"There's no question [Nintendo 64] will be a dominant voice in the
holiday period," Anne Moellering, Sega of America's marketing manager,
told MMWIRE.  "We're clearly aware of that," Moellering added.  About
80 percent of Sega's marketing budget will be devoted to TV
advertisements for NiGHTS on ABC, NBC, and other channels.  Moellering
added that it was a "coincidence" that Sega was debuting NiGHTS so
close to the Nintendo 64's debut.  Sales of the Nintendo 64 in Japan
have exceeded expectations thus far, and most analysts predict that
the 500,000 units Nintendo expects to ship in the United States this
year will sell out.  Nintendo reportedly is spending $50 million to
market the Nintendo 64 and its acclaimed Super Mario title.  Sega also
will sell a NiGHTS bundle pack ($69.99), which includes the title and
a 3D controller pad; and the 3D-controller pad ($39.99).  Sega's other
marketing efforts will include print advertisements, tie-ins with the
Six Flags resort, and in-store standup demonstration units.  (Sega of

background artists, animators, writers and storyboard artists.  This

EUROPE ONLINE GOES BANKRUPT

     Europe Online (EO) was declared bankrupt by the Luxembourg
commercial court, and its assets will be liquidated this week. 
CompuServe Corp. [CSRV] was one of several suitors that had worked to
bail out Europe Online. The court had set an Aug. 2 deadline for
bringing together a deal with new shareholders, after its largest
stakeholder, German publisher Burda GmbH, jumped ship in July. Deutsch
Telekom AG was a late bidder to save the company, while ITT Corp.
[ITT] already had made it known that it was eyeing the service.  
     Though EO had garnered only 25,000 subscribers since its March
launch, analysts called that substantial growth in a market where
income and penetration of PCs lags well behind the United States.  Lou
Kerner of Merrill Lynch pointed out that CompuServe's bid may have
been a strategy to win "mindshare" in Europe with a more familiar
name. Analysts speculated that what really hurt Europe Online was the
dropping out of its largest (one-third) shareholder, Burda. "Clearly,
they're scrambling," Kerner said.  (Europe Online, Luxembourg,

MMWIRE EARNINGS ROUNDUP:

     CyberCash Inc. [CYCH], a provider of secure transactions over the
Internet, reported revenues from credit card transactions grew to a
meager $16,086 for the quarter ending June 30. 
     The lackluster numbers are "not what's driving investor
enthusiasm," said Robertson Stephens analyst John Powers, adding,
"they're really paying for 1997, 1998 and beyond." 
     An "incredibly strong endorsement," Powers said, was Sun
Microsystems' [SUNW] decision to include CyberCash technology in
future releases of Java.
     Although the company posted a net loss of $6.2 million, or 59
cents per share, it has a $51 million "war chest," Powers said,
predicting CyberCash could be profitable by early 1998. (CyberCash
Inc., Gene Riechers, cfo, 703/716-5208; Robertson Stephens, John
Powers, analyst, 415/781-9700)

     Source Media Inc. [SRCM], which plans to roll out its
television-based Interactive Channel on Labor Day, reported revenues
for the quarter ending June 30 dipped 4 percent--to $2.3 million--from
the same period last year.
     A $2.8 million net loss for the second quarter was less than the
$3.6 million the company posted in the same period last year. (Source

SOUNDCARRIER GROWTH SLOWS DRAMATICALLY IN MAJOR MARKETS

Music & Copyright estimates that the combined sound-carrier sales of
the four largest markets in the world grew by only 6% in 1995. These
territories together represent almost two thirds of the world's
soundcarrier market.

However, apart from the decline of the MC format in all territories and
the recovery of the sale of singles outside the US, no overall pattern
emerges for the US, Japan, Germany and the UK. Japan and the UK
experienced double digit growth over the year, but there was little
growth in either the US or Germany. The table below shows Music &
Copyright's estimated individual growth rates for the world's top four
soundcarrier markets plus a combined growth rate for all four
territories weighted to account for the relative size of each market.

In 1994 there was a 16.5% increase in value of the world soundcarrier
market, according to record industry trade association IFPI. In the 30
national markets which represented over 90% of global soundcarrier
sales this fell to 14% in the first half of 1995 (see M&C 76/3). The
major cause of this was a decline in the growth of CD unit sales which
slowed down from 25% in 1994 to 19% for the first six months of 1995.
This decline continued into the second half of 1995.

According to US trade paper Billboard, SoundScan, which collects sales
data from music retailers, reported that 409.5m CDs and 245.7m MCs were
sold in the US in 1995. This represented a rise of 11.2% in CD sales
from 1994 and a 16.2% drop in MC sales.

Bearing in mind the higher price of CDs, in value terms, these figures
mean that the US market has hardly had any growth. Although the unit
figures of SoundScan and the US trade association RIAA are very
different, because one tracks sales and the other trade shipments,
their percentage figures for growth and decline have generally been
close.

Certainly SoundScan's percentage changes are close to the trade
shipments reported by the RIAA for the first half of 1995, which were
plus 13% for CDs and minus 15% for MCs. These contrast dramatically
with 1994 when the RIAA reported a 34% growth in CD trade shipments and
a 2% growth in MC shipments.

Moreover, US soundcarrier sales over the Christmas period,
traditionally the biggest sales period of the year, were flat.
According to SoundScan, unit sales were down 0.03% in December 1995
compared to the same period in 1994 and the growth rate for CD sales at
12.4% was lower than for the year as a whole. The International Council
of Shopping Centers, which tracks sales at 400 regional malls in the
US, reported that music and related home entertainment sales were down
0.3% on Christmas 1994 in contrast to a 4.7% rise in mall sales
generally.

Accordingly, most observers are predicting minimal growth in the value
of the US soundcarrier market in 1995. Some even predict that total
soundcarrier revenues will hardly top 1994's $11.84bn. They give two
main reasons: poor sales by superstar albums and increased competition
from computer software.

Although Hootie and the Blowfish sold an unprecedented 11m units of
their debut album Cracked View Mirror in the US, as a whole there were
fewer big-selling albums there in 1995 than in 1994. Only 278 albums
sold over 500,000 units each, compared with 340 titles in 1994. Among
the top acts whose albums did not meet expectations were Elton John,
Rod Stewart, Paula Abdul, the Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt and Michael
Jackson, whose HIStory only sold 2m units in the US.

In addition, video and computer games now compete for the dollars that
were traditionally spent on music. In the first half of 1995 software
sales grew by 12% (compared with 8% for soundcarriers) and in the last
quarter of 1995 several computer chains reported an average 40%
increase in sales of personal computers, with 30 of the US' 64 major
computer retailers reporting better than expected sales. Only 11
reported sales below expectations.

Soundcarrier sales in Japan totalled $5.43bn in 1994. Whereas there was
20% growth in the US soundcarrier market in 1994, sales grew by only 1%
in Japan that year. But sales of music in Japan grew by at least 10% in
1995. Western compilations were increasingly successful in Japan in
1995 (see M&C 79/3). CD titles of international repertoire manufactured
inside the country in the first 11 months of the year represented 39%
of the market, or 95.2m units. Shipments of international repertoire
grew by 19%, compared to 8% growth for domestic repertoire. However,
figures compiled by the Japanese trade association RIAJ, which show an
11% growth rate by value in the year to November, may underestimate the
situation. They do not include albums imported by Western-owned
retailers (such as Tower) and Japanese record companies, which
increased greatly in 1995. In the first six months CD imports rose 24%
by value to $193.4m and 40% by units to 32.7m (see M&C 74/6). Sales of
singles in Japan have also continued to rise. In the first 11 months of
1995 sales grew 22% in units and 18% in value.

Earlier in the year, observers predicted that Germany, which posted 3%
growth in value in 1994 and 12% growth in the first six months of 1995
according to IFPI, would have a 6% plus growth rate for 1995. However,
in the light of a disappointing summer, poor Christmas sales and fewer
major releases than expected, most have revised this figure downward.
The most dramatic fall in growth was of CD shipments, which fell to 7%
for the first nine months of 1995 after being in double figures
throughout the 1990s. In view of this and the 15% fall in MC shipments,
Music & Copyright estimates that in value terms the German soundcarrier
market will grow at between 1% and 2%. Taking account of inflation,
this figure represents hardly any growth at all in real terms (see
story on page 8 for more detail on the German soundcarrier market).

Huge Christmas sales, the continued revival of the singles market and
the Britpop phenomenon, which had a noticeable effect on album sales in
the second half of the year, combined to create double digit growth for
the UK soundcarrier market in 1995. Most observers predict the UK
market will grow by more in 1995 than the 17.4% increase seen in 1994
and the 18% growth reported for the first six months of 1995.

UK sales in the fourth quarter alone were over 20% higher than in the
same period of 1994. Almost 50m albums were sold, with just under 15m
sold in the two week Christmas holiday period. Of these sales some 2m
(or 4%) were accounted for by Robson & Jerome's eponymous debut album.
This was in addition to the sales of 2.8m copies of the duo's first two
singles. The Britpop effect can be seen in the Top 100 selling singles
of the year. In 1994, 39 of these were by British acts; in 1995, 49,
the highest ever number in the 1990s since 1991.

SHORTAGE OF SUPERSTARS BRINGS DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN CONCERT GROSSES

The value of concert tickets sold in North America fell by almost 33%
in 1995 to $950m, according to trade paper Pollstar. Nonetheless,
ticket sales in 1995 were the third largest in the history of the US
and Canadian concert industry. The top 50 grossing tours accounted for
78% of the total with combined ticket sales of $742.7m.

The two significant trends of 1995 were the decline in the number of
superstars touring and the emergence of a number of new headline acts.
In 1994 the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd together took $225m, which
was just over 16% of the $1.4bn raised by ticket sales in that year. In
1994-1995 the Eagles, whose Hell Freezes Over was the most successful
reunion tour ever, grossed $142.7m in total, of which $63.3m was earned
in 1995, representing almost 7% of the year's ticket sales.

However, few other superstar acts toured apart from R.E.M., Boyz II
Men, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page and the Grateful Dead. The Dead
cancelled their autumn tour following the death of group leader Jerry
Garcia and have since said they will no longer perform live.

Among the new acts who toured successfully were Hootie and the
Blowfish, who translated the 11m sales of their debut album Cracked
View Mirror into $8.8m in concert ticket sales. Other new acts which
grossed high figures on tour included the Dave Matthews Band ($9m from
130 shows), Jodeci and Mary J. Blige ($7.7m from 30 shows) and Phish
($15.7m from 79 shows). In the country field, Mary Chapin Carpenter and
John Michael Montgomery had large-grossing tours for the first time.

Several acts earned more from touring than their record sales might
have suggested. Among these were Page/Plant ($33.4m), Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers ($27.5m) and Elton John ($22.5m). More in line with their
record sales were the touring revenues of two country acts, Reba
McIntire ($27.4m) and George Strait ($15.2m). Strait's 49-show tour
helped his MCA box-set sell far better than expected.

Another reason for the decline in 1995 concert revenues was that acts
tended to play smaller venues. Whereas in 1994 three football stadiums
shared first place for mounting the biggest shows, no football stadiums
were among the leading venues of 1995. Similarly, whereas 17 concerts
grossed over $5m in 1994, none did in 1995.

However, as the table below shows, if 1994's exceptional figures are
excluded, the 1995 figures show a modest return to growth. This
moderate increase in ticket receipts is expected to continue into 1996.
U2 looks set to be the biggest tour of 1996, (although the group has
not yet announced dates). The Rolling Stones and the Eagles are
expected to continue their ongoing tours, but not in North America.
Bruce Springsteen's solo acoustic tour will probably include as many
bars as concert halls and accordingly will not be among the year's
largest grossing tours.

EMI MUSIC WINS RIGHTS TO LIFE FOR MRSE

UK Mechanical Collection Society MCPS has accepted EMI Music's claim
that the 10 works on Simply Red's Life album were not registered with
MCPS. This acceptance was reached at an MCPS board meeting before
Christmas and frees EMI Music to collect the phono-mechanical rights
due from Life directly from Simply Red's record company Warner Music
Europe. EMI Music intends to do this through Mechanical Rights Society
Europe (MRSE), a collection society it specifically set up for this
purpose (see M&C 80/5).

EMI says it wants to do this because of excessive delays in receiving
monies through the GEMA-Warner Music Europe central licensing deal and
the high rebate GEMA gives Warner. Prior to this, GEMA argued that the
works had entered the European copyright system through MCPS and that
EMI Music could not withdraw them. GEMA has now written to EMI Music
saying it accepts that the phono-mechanical rights in the works are
registered with MRSE.

Music & Copyright understands that EMI still intends to divide the
mechanical rights in the works between MRSE (phono-mechanical rights)
and MCPS (non phono-mechanical mechanical rights) which it expects GEMA
to collect on its behalf (see M&C 78/5). In response to the argument
that this will inevitably drive up the costs of rights collection,
because the revenues (roughly 20% of mechanical revenues) are more
costly to collect than phono-mechanicals, EMI points out that higher
commission rates for the various mechanical rights are already in
place. GEMA's response to this is as yet unknown.

However, there is growing evidence that despite having set up MRSE,
which had its inaugural board meeting two weeks ago, EMI is more
concerned to get GEMA to reduce its rebate and speed up payment than to
make extensive use of MRSE.

Music & Copyright understands that these were the main topics discussed
at a meeting between EMI Music and GEMA, the first between the leading
executives of both organisations, at London's Heathrow airport last
week. Although EMI Music says it has other projects that it is
considering putting through MRSE, including at least one act that
records for EMI Records, it seems far more interested in resolving the
problem within the existing operating structure of the European
collecting societies. A further meeting between GEMA and EMI Music is
scheduled to take place at MIDEM on January 22.

ITALIAN ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING FALLS 4%

Spending on entertainment in Italy in the first six months of 1995 fell
4.3% in real terms to L2,164bn ($1.37bn), according to Italian authors'
rights society SIAE. Because SIAE collects entertainment taxes on
behalf of the Italian government it is well placed to see changes and
developments in the amount of money spent on entertainment in Italy.

According to SIAE, for the first half of 1995 attendances at pop music
concerts and popular arts events rose 16% to 2.9m, although the total
number of events was almost unchanged at 8,300. Receipts rose 16.6% to
$40m and average ticket prices rose by 0.6% to $13.75. Receipts from
classical music concerts over the six month period rose 9.3% to $22.2m,
mostly because of higher ticket prices which rose to an average $10.75
each. Unit ticket sales only rose by 0.7% to 2.1m for 9,000 concerts, a
similar number to the first half of 1993.

There were 1,000 fewer cinema screenings over the period: down from
285,000 to 284,000. Ticket sale receipts dropped by 2.9% to $240m and
the number of cinema-goers fell by 7.1% to 44.3m. Average cinema ticket
prices rose from $5.18 to $5.42. Theatre fared better than most forms
of entertainment. Box office receipts totalled $105m, a 10.5% increase.
Average ticket prices rose by 3.5% to $11.40.

Spending on sport dropped by 7% to $229.5m, SIAE said, although
receipts rose by 4.6% to $141m. Over the six months a total of 7.1m
tickets were sold for top class football matches, an increase of 1.1%
over January-June 1994.

U2-PRS CASE NEAR SETTLEMENT

Irish group U2 has won at least part of its battle with European
collection societies to reduce the deductions made from performance
royalties and the speed of payment. French authors' society SACEM has
reached an agreement in principle with the group and its publishers.
SACEM has agreed to reduce its administration costs and the cultural
deductions it makes and to pay performance revenues within 28 days.

U2 issued a writ against UK authors' society PRS in February 1994 after
a two year dispute with the society over the methods of collecting and
distributing public performance royalties for songs performed on large-
scale international tours (see M&C 35/2). Music & Copyright estimates
the gross performance royalties earned by U2 on its 1992-1993 European
tour at a little over $1m. U2 said it received less than 50% of this
and wanted to establish a system whereby the group itself collected the
money, which is calculated as a percentage of gate receipts. When PRS
refused to give the group back its performance rights U2 issued a writ
demanding their return. Nine European collecting societies were co-
joined to the writ in June 1994 (see M&C 44/1). This was because the
group needed the return of rights from each national society in order
to negotiate fees with individual promoters in Europe.

As a result of the agreement with SACEM, the French society will be
dropped from the writ. If, as is expected, it is followed by similar
agreements with other continental societies, they too will be dropped
from the writ. However, before these agreements can be made, U2 and PRS
must formalise their arrangements. The two have resumed talks after a
considerable time and an announcement of a resolution of the matter is
expected at the MIDEM trade fair later this month.

UK COPYRIGHT GOES TO 70 YEARS PMA

The harmonisation of copyright legislation within Europe came a step
closer January 1 with the adoption in the UK of a law meeting the
European Union (EU) directive of October 29 1993 on the issue. Member
states had officially been required to bring the directive into force
by July 1 1995. The most dramatic effect of the harmonisation in the UK
is to end the disparity whereby copyright ended 50 years after the
author's death, 20 years less than the EU term. The law applies to all
composers from European Economic Area states, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Iceland, Ireland,
Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
the UK.

Publishers contacted by Music & Copyright had not seen the bill, which
was only finally published last week, so several key points, which the
EU directive left up to individual member states to decide, were still
unknown. A key issue is whether or not the bill stipulates reciprocity
with other non EEA countries, which would especially affect US authors.
The UK authors' society PRS thought an immediate rise in licensing
income unlikely since it issues blanket licenses to venues and
broadcasters. However some classical venues may now have to apply for a
licence. This would create extra income.

Publishers say that renegotiation of fees will have to take place with
broadcasters since some, notably Classic FM radio, currently pay PRS a
low fee because much or most of their output is out of copyright. Among
composers coming back into copyright will be Elgar, Holst and Arthur
Sullivan.

Among issues PRS would like to see clarified are third party rights,
for example the rights of the arrangers of works now returning to
copyright protection. Also at issue is how revenues will now be
collected globally, particularly from US collection societies, since
most US protection is for less than 70 years. Mechanical rights society
MCPS has provided members with notes to ascertain whether works are
covered by the EEA term or whether they revert to country of origin.

Identifying the works that have gone out of copyright will create
initial costs. Moreover UK publishers feel that, at first, the new
legislation will lead to only a small increase in their revenues.
However, they expect to eventually see a considerable increase in
income, both from copyright material coming back into copyright and
from existing copyright material, which will earn money for longer.

France is now the only main European market which has not introduced a
new law to comply with the directive. French authors' society SACEM
says legislation was not presented to parliament in time for January 1
and is scheduled to be enacted in the spring. French law has afforded
authors of musical works 70 years protection and neighbouring rights'
holders 50 years protection since January 1 1986. For several months it
has been remitting funds to European collection societies in other EU
states on a national basis. SACEM says that this was done after the
October 1993 Phil Collins ruling.

CHINA CLOSES SIX PIRATE CD FACTORIES

International record industry body IFPI has won two important successes
in the fight against piracy in China. Five CD plants have been closed
in south China and the trading licence of a further plant has been
withdrawn by the authorities. In a separate action, IFPI and 23 members
were awarded $800,000 in damages by a court in Shanghai, China. The
court declared that in 1993 Taiwanese Shi Hua-Lek had illegally
produced over 95,000 copies of 31 albums containing 306 sound
recordings. Shi was also fined $43,000, ordered to pay costs and pay
for a public apology in China Daily.

The fine is huge by Chinese standards, but nonetheless IFPI was only
awarded damages. In Taiwan following a successful High Court appeal Shi
was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. No criminal case has yet to
be brought against a copyright infringer in China, which with sales of
256m pirate units is the largest pirate market in the world.

The Chinese authorities have been generally more willing to bring civil
cases to court than to try to stop pirate production at source. From
this perspective the steps taken by the authorities in Hainan and
Guangdon provinces late in December are highly significant. They
ordered the stoppage of production at four CD plants - the Zhuhai
Jiwellian CD Production Company, the Chazhou Xinle Laser Disc Company,
the Chailing Sound Production Company and the Hainan Anmei Laser
Production Company - which were manufacturing pirate CDs, CD-ROMs and
pornographic video-CDs. They also withdrew another plant's trading
licence after complaints by IFPI and seized moulds and pressing
equipment from a sixth plant, whose senior management was also
arrested.

All six plants are currently under investigation and IFPI is reasonably
confident that within a month further plants will be identified as the
source of pirate and pornographic CDs and CD-derivatives. Despite this
action, IFPI has made no moves to re-open its office in Canton which it
closed after death threats against its staff (see M&C 80/4).

In a further move, China's State Copyright Bureau and Press and
Publication Administration issued a circular on December 7 requiring
that two inspectors from the State Copyright office be based at all 270
registered manufacturing plants of audio and visual products from the
beginning of 1996. The inspectors will check that a Source
Identification Code is present on all CDs pressed and that Title
Verification has been established. They will be paid from local
government funds and will be barred from receiving gifts in money or in
kind from the factories at which they are based. The move was welcomed
by US officials at a meeting on December 20.

In addition, a new consumer law in China is having some effect against
piracy. Under the terms of the law customers can return fake and pirate
goods to stores where they were bought and get back double the money
they paid if the store cannot prove the items are genuine. In turn the
store can get double what it paid from its supplier, which in turn can
get double what it paid the manufacturer. US trade officials have
welcomed the law, although they point out that it is less useful in
dealing with copyright piracy than with piracy of high fashion items.

These moves come just before the anniversary of the Memorandum of
Understanding, signed last February between China and the US, which set
out a detailed timetable for China to introduce measures of
intellectual copyright protection. But, since signing the Memorandum,
China has made no significant progress in intellectual property
protection. New talks between the US and Chinese authorities are due
soon.

Commentary: PolyGram was the market leader in both album and singles
chart shares in Europe in 1995, according to European trade paper Music
& Media. The table above shows that PolyGram had a 20.7% share of Music
& Media's European Top 100 album charts and a 25% share of its
Eurochart Hot 100 singles chart.

PolyGram's success came despite the fact that its most successful album
label, Mercury, was only the fourth most successful with a 4.9% chart
share. The most successful labels were Columbia (8.1%), EMI (5.15%) and
Virgin (4.9%). Similarly PolyGram's most successful single label, A&M,
was only the ninth most successful label with a 2.5% share. The leading
singles labels were Virgin (5%), RCA (3.8%) and Iceberg (3.5%).

PolyGram's most successful album acts were The Cranberries, whose
Island album No Need To Argue accounted for 4.2% of the company's chart
share, and Bon Jovi whose Mercury album Cross Road was the third best
selling album in Europe. The greatest successes of second place Sony
were Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, French singing
Francis Cabrel and Michael Jackson. Because the figures are only
calculated from the first 48 weeks of the year, third-placed EMI's
share does not include most of the chart points due from The Beatles
Anthology and Queen's Made In Heaven. If they were included EMI would
probably be in second place. The company's most successful acts were
Pink Floyd and Simple Minds.

Sony had the most successful single of the year, Michael Jackson's You
Are Not Alone, but was only the fourth-placed company. Second to
PolyGram was EMI with hits from Shaggy, Meat Loaf, The Connells and
Edwyn Collins. Almost a third of the chart points of third-placed BMG
came from the two hit singles of Scatman John and Take That's Back For
Good.

In 1994 a number of mainland European acts such as Eros Ramazzotti,
Snap and Patrick Bruel had European-wide hits. In 1995 there were fewer
such acts. Only Danish-based Scatman John and the Dutch-based Rednex
had any significant European success.

The figures in brackets are the percentage changes on the corresponding
period in the previous year.

The value figure for Canada is wholesale; for Japan retail.

Commentary: Shipments of all soundcarrier formats in Canada apart from
CDs were lower in November than in the same month of 1994. This is
hardly any better than the situation in October 1995 when shipments of
all formats were lower than in October 1994. Despite these poor
results, the year-to-date shows the value of the market was 11% above
that in the comparable period in 1994. However the unit growth is far
lower at 4%. For additional comment see story on page 1.

SLOWER GROWTH IN 1995 FOR THE GERMAN SOUNDCARRIER MARKET

An unusually hot summer, a dearth of major releases and a disappointing
Christmas depressed soundcarrier sales in Germany in 1995. Early
industry estimates of a 6% growth rate have been revised downwards to
nearer 2% growth in value terms, but taking account of inflation, this
represents a stalling of the soundcarrier market in real terms. Total
record sales in 1994 were valued at DM5.68bn ($3.95bn). Of this 83%
came from BPW affiliated companies, 8.5% from non-members, 6.5% from
direct imports, and 2% from pirate product.

Figures from BPW, the German record industry's trade association,
showed a continued decline in cassette and vinyl sales and a 7%
increase in CD sales for the first nine months of 1995 compared with
the same period in 1994. However, the increase in the number of CDs
sold is unlikely to translate into the same growth in value because
many of the year's best selling albums were special offer compilations.

Unit sales of MCs and vinyl LPs fell by 15.4% and 40% respectively in
the first three quarters of 1995, continuing the trend of the last
three years. Growth in the singles market also slowed. Although sales
of CD singles continued to grow, up 9.3% to 30.6m units in the first
nine months of the year, (compensating for the 41.7% decline in vinyl
single sales to 700,000 units over the same period), January-September
unit sales growth in singles was of 7.2%, compared with 15% in the same
period in 1994. Overall, soundcarrier unit growth to end September was
3.2%. There was mounting industry concern that the CD singles market
was growing at the expense of CD albums, since many CD singles contain
as many as six tracks. A maxi-single typically retails at just under $9
compared with a long play format CD at around $21 or more.

The Virgin-McDonald's CDs

Soundcarrier sales in July and August were down 17% from the same
months in 1994, blamed largely on the long hot spell, which affected
most of Europe. Full 1995 sales figures have not yet been compiled by
BPW, but after the summer lull sales fluctuated considerably. September
was a good month, largely because of sales of the Virgin-produced Rock
Superstars Vol. 1 compilation. This was marketed through McDonald's
outlets at just $6.92 and sold 2.7m units in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland. Sales in October were up 10% compared with the same month
of 1994, but then rose only 3% in November, despite key releases such
as the Beatles Anthology and new product from Queen and the Kelly
Family.

December saw the release of Rock Superstars Vol. 2, again marketed
through McDonald's, this time with a $3.5m advertising campaign. The 14-
track album sold virtually the same number of units as Vol. 1 at the
same price. Market research showed one in six buyers of the first
compilation had never bought a soundcarrier before and that of those
first-time buyers, half made a second CD purchase before the end of the
year. World of Music, Germany's largest music retailer, reported a
lacklustre Christmas; December sales, which normally account for 18% of
annual turnover, were only 16% and only four albums were big sellers:
Queen's Made in Heaven, Michael Jackson's HIStory, Beatles Anthology
and Pur's Abenteuerland. Sales of this last were 50% below Queen's.

If, as expected, the final figures show that album market unit sales
rose by 3% in unit terms to about 211m units in 1995, the two Virgin
compilations will represent almost 2.4% of album sales overall and
almost 3% of all CD sales in the year, although less in value terms
because of their low price. Other budget CDs also contributed to unit
sales increases, according to IFPI members' reports of sales to clubs
and dealers. Budget CD sales rose 22.3% in the first nine months of the
year, while full price CDs rose only 5.7%. Unusually, sales of mid-
price CDs, which had a boom year in 1994, were down by 3.2%. Industry
observers blame discounting on full price CDs by retailers for this.

There was big growth in sales of German-language repertoire in 1995.
The country's November album chart showed an unprecedented seven albums
by German artists in the Top 10, and sales of domestic repertoire sales
rose an estimated 11% to account for 40% of the market, a record high.
Domestic repertoire achieved a 24% share of the year's Top 100 album
charts, and a record 41.3% in the singles chart. Albums by German
artists such as Pur, Die Doofen, Die Prinzen, Die Fantastichen, Die
Artzte and Westernhagen all performed well.

The continued growth of German repertoire

Consumers and radio stations are abandoning their bias towards Anglo-
American repertoire, say industry observers. This and the continued
strength of the dance and Techno genres has also helped boost domestic
repertoire's share of the market - reflected most strongly in the
singles chart. The independents' share of the singles chart rose from
16.8% in 1994 to 18.3% in 1995. The most successful independent was
dance label ZYX with a 10.2% share. Other successful independents were
edel (5.1%) EAMS (1.5%) and Semaphore (1%). The independents' share of
the album charts also rose, from 8.9% in 1994 to 10.5%. Independents
who had over a 1% chart share were edel (3%), ZYX (2%), Semaphore
(1.2%), SPV (1%) and Rough Trade (1%).

The VIVA music TV channel, which plays 40% German repertoire,
contributed to the increase in singles sales by German artists. In
April 1995 the company launched a second channel aimed at older
viewers, but playing a similar percentage of German repertoire. The two
channels have a combined reach of 21m people in Germany via cable and
satellite and another 3.5m in Switzerland and Austria, as well as
viewers elsewhere in Europe under the Eutelsat footprint (see M&C
75/12). As a result of VIVA's success, MTV has increased the amount of
German repertoire it broadcasts. In addition a new channel, COM-TV, is
due to start soon. It says it will cater for the 30-55 age group,
broadcasting German Schlager, folk, jazz and soul music. The channel
could further exposure given to domestic repertoire.

Sales of classical repertoire fell steeply by 10% in the first nine
months of the year, with no indications of an improved performance in
the last quarter. As a result, classical repertoire's 1995 market share
is predicted to be well below 1994's 9.6% by value and 10.5% by unit
sales. Catalogue sales have fallen significantly as the classical
market is now. like the pop and rock markets, primarily artist-driven.
At the same time the process of vinyl replacement has virtually ended,
local industry specialists say. In addition, low price and budget
material now represents a larger section of the classical market.

Compilations were another key feature of the German album market in
1995, representing 22.7% of the album charts Top 100 over the year.
Sales of compilation albums were up 8.3% in the first 10 months of
1995, with 27.5m units shipped. But local industry executives are
starting to question the value of the costly television campaigns
employed to market these compilation albums.

The majors in Germany

The major labels all have offices in Germany, except for MCA which is
still distributed by BMG. A company breakdown by album chart share (see
page 8) shows EMI as market leader, in 1995, despite dropping 2.3% from
1994. EMI had a strong showing late in the year with two albums by the
Kelly Family, two by Herbert Groenemeyer, as well as product by The
Beatles, Queen, the Rolling Stones, Roxette and Meat Loaf in the album
charts Top 20.

PolyGram closed in on EMI in second place, raising its album market
share 2.1% points to 20%. BMG was stable at 16.6%, followed by an
improved Warner at 16.1% and Sony showing a 2.2% drop to an album
market share of just 13.7%.

German retailing

Retailing continues to be dominated by department and chain stores,
where 40% of all soundcarriers are sold. Media Market and ProMarkt are
the biggest chains and the most aggressive price discounters, a trend
which continued to increase in 1995. A discounted/loss leader album can
retail for as little as $5.56 compared with the standard retail price
of $24.34. But there have been talks between the record industry and
the chains and some observers believe that aggressive discounting may
soon be a thing of the past. The success of these chains has led to a
sharp reduction in the number of independent music retailers over the
past decade.

Wholesalers, including rack jobbers, are responsible for 38% of all
soundcarriers sold, direct mail 17% and other outlets 5%. Industry
observers say there are too many wholesalers operating in Germany, and
that many of these are not really wholesalers but exist only to service
their own outlets.

Among speciality music retailers, the 19-strong German-owned WOM chain
is still leader. The Saturn chain is its main competitor. WOM had an
estimated 1995 turnover of $130m (87% of that from CD sales, see table
opposite), a rise of 3.8% on 1994.

Otherwise successful non-German competitors have failed in Germany.
These include French retailer FNAC and Virgin, which closed its last
German store in August. Foreign retailers blame strict laws on opening
hours, high costs and problems with suppliers for their lack of success
in Germany.

Nevertheless, HMV still plans to open a 1,500 square meter store near
Dusseldorf in September 1996. German retail outlets may open only
between 9 am and 6:30 pm on weekdays (until 8:30 pm on Thursdays) and
must close at 2 pm on Saturdays, except the first Saturday of the month
when they can stay open until 6 pm. No Sunday opening is permitted. A
change in the law on Sunday opening is not foreseen, but the record
industry is optimistic a proposed relaxation of opening hours, due to
be approved later this year, will benefit soundcarrier sales.

CD player ownership has continued to rise. The number of households
with one CD player or more (saturation rate) rose to 59% in 1995 with a
penetration level (number of players per hundred households) of 78%.
Video recorder saturation is 66%. It is estimated that only one
household in 250 has either a MiniDisc or DCC player. However, an
estimated 50% of the German population never buys a record of any type.

The video market

The video rental and sell through market is still growing in Germany,
with sell-through revenues outpacing rental for the first time in 1993
and reaching $661m in 1994. Sell through revenues are expected to have
reached $696m in 1995, with the rental market growing 6% after a fall
in 1994. According to European Video Review, there are 6,400 outlets in
all for purchase or rental of video tapes in Germany, 3,000 of them
supplied by rack-jobber MedienPlus. As with audio retailing, the
sector's growth is hampered by Germany's strict opening hours and the
lack of speciality multiples.

A new higher tax on receipts from touring could be backdated six years
and managers of top international acts have already protested against
the move and threatened not to tour in Germany as a result. One British
concert promoter estimated his backdated tax bill could reach $1.6m.
High grossing acts such as U2 and Dire Straits would be among the most
seriously affected by the new tax. UK managers, accountants and
promoters met in December and formed a six-strong steering committee to
lobby for the decision to be reversed. They hope to meet with Germany's
finance minister to discuss the issue.

Following the incorporation of the European Union's cable and satellite
directives into German copyright law, which was effective from, January
1 1996, the country now enjoys one of the world's highest levels of
intellectual property protection. Directives regarding rental, and
duration of protection for producers, increased from 25 to 50 years,
came into force July 1 1995, with a one year retroactive provision.
This effectively ended the trade in unauthorised compilations by the
likes of Elvis Presley and the Beatles.

Germany had 600 CD rental shops as well as 2,000 video rental shops
which also rented some CDs before the new legislation was introduced.
The new law affords producers and companies the exclusive right to
sanction or prohibit rental. To date none has given approval for the
rental of their recordings. Rental CDs typically featured chart
repertoire and usually were rented out at $1.50 a time. An estimated
90% of them were taped.

Currency fluctuations and price differentials sparked an increase in
parallel imports to Germany in 1995. Most of the product came from
Sweden, because the value of the Swedish Krona fell steeply against the
Deutschmark, and also from Britain and Italy. Industry estimates
suggested the retail value of parallel imports could be over $140m in
1995, up from $125m the previous year.

Piracy

Piracy rates continued to fall, however, mostly due to the effective
enforcement of a new copyright law in Poland, which had long been a
major source of pirate product. Improved co-operation between Polish
and German customs officials has also helped stem the flow of
counterfeit material from eastern Europe. However, pirate material
continues to filter in from Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech and Slovak
republics and even Kazakhstan. The pirate market was worth an estimated
$97m in 1994, down from $153m in 1993. It is expected to drop again in
1995.

Until recently a so-called "protection gap" existed in German law,
whereby bootlegs of concerts by EU citizens were allowed to be sold in
Germany if they were recorded in countries which were not signatories
of the Rome convention - notably the US. This loophole was all but
eliminated by a European Court ruling in a case involving Phil Collins,
which immediately took hundreds of thousands of bootleg CDs out of
circulation. The protection gap was finally closed on January 1 1996
with the harmonisation of EU member states' copyright legislation.

LA CIENEGA RULING RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS OF US COPYRIGHT

On October 12 1995 the American songwriting and music publishing
community received the troubling news that the US Supreme Court had
declined to review the La Cienega Music vs ZZ Top case. The US High
Court's refusal to hear the case has left undisturbed the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals ruling, which earlier this year placed a cloud over
the copyright status of virtually every musical composition released on
a phono-record in the US prior to January 1 1978.

The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) and other American
songwriter and music publisher groups are currently spearheading the
effort to convince Congress to revise the US Copyright Act in order to
thwart the potentially disastrous effects of La Cienega. However, until
Congress acts, it will be very difficult for copyright owners and
proprietors to be sure of the viability of their pre-1978 music
copyrights, or to enforce their rights in such works through litigation
within the Ninth Circuit (which includes the state of California)
without placing such copyrights at risk.

In order to understand the full implications of La Cienega some
background information on a rather esoteric area of US Copyright Law is
necessary. Many aspects of copyright protection for works created prior
to January 1 1978 remain subject to the "old" US Copyright Act of 1909.
That act did not state with clarity whether the distribution of a
phonorecord would constitute publication of the musical work embodied
in that phonorecord. However, the music industry came to rely on the
interpretation of the US Copyright Office that such distribution did
not constitute publication. This view was confirmed by the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in New York in the case of Rosette vs
Rainbow Record Mfg Corp (1976).

For close to twenty years, therefore, it has been considered as a
settled issue in the US that musical works distributed on phonorecords
prior to January 1 1978 were not thereby published. Thus, no copyright
notice for the musical composition embodied in each phonorecord was
required and no renewal of the musical work 28 years following such
first distribution of phonorecords was necessary in order to keep the
work out of the public domain.

The court in La Cienega however, reached the opposite conclusion. The
case involved rock band ZZ Top in a copyright infringement action
brought by the copyright owner of La Cienega Music regarding John Lee
Hooker's composition Boogie Chillin. The court found that Hooker's song
was in the public domain, having been published upon its first release
on phonorecord in the late 1940s - "published" being the key word here.
Under the 1909 Act, the court said, copyright in the work had to be
renewed 28 years later in order to preserve protection. Even if such
renewal had been properly filed, the court went on to say, the absence
of copyright notice for Boogie Chillin on the phonorecords had likely
placed the work into the public domain anyway. Such copyright notice
was virtually never included on phonorecords.

The effect of the Ninth Circuit's decision could be to decimate the
music community in the US. If left in place, the decision threatens to
bring chaos to the industry, throwing doubt on the holdings of music
publishers and threatening the rights of the authors of works published
before 1978. Already there is evidence that some copyright users may be
attempting to use the decision as an excuse not to pay royalties on
such compositions, under the presumption that the copyright owner will
not risk exposing the copyright through litigation to a finding that it
has fallen into the public domain. The failure of Congress to intervene
could easily spell disaster for thousands of songwriters and music
publishers in the US, and for their foreign counterparts whose works
have been embraced by the American public.

NMPA has made the overturning of this precedent its most important
legislative goal this year. While the American music publishing
industry supports wholeheartedly legislation currently pending before
Congress to extend the term of US copyright protection, and opposes
vehemently legislation which would unfairly diminish US performing
rights royalties for musical compositions, the preservation of
copyright protection itself on thousands upon thousands of pre-1978
compositions must command all our energies. We are both hopeful and
confident that supporters of intellectual property rights in Congress
will act in a timely manner to cut off the potentially devastating
effects of the Ninth Circuit's decision in La Cienega before they have
a chance to take hold.

DUTCH MEDIA COMPANY WEGENER BUYS ARCADE

Dutch media publisher Wegener is to take over Netherlands' independent
record and media company Arcade. Wegener is paying around Fl400m
($186m) for Arcade. The deal should be concluded by late January,
effectively retroactive to January 1, 1996. The merged company will be
called Wegener Arcade.

Arcade is one of the world's last remaining major independent record
label groups. It is second only to PolyGram in the Dutch market, has
about a 1% market share in Germany and a 7% share of the compilation
market in France. Wegener is a publishing group with expanding
interests in electronic media. The company expects 1995 earnings of
$596.5m and a 15% increase in net profits to about $37m.

After the merger, Arcade's current activities will be grouped into a
division called Arcade Entertainment Group, which will be managed by
Arcade's current president H Heinsbroek. At present Arcade comprises
four main divisions: music, media, retail and film/video and employs
700 people. Arcade revenues in the 1994/95 fiscal year to March 31 were
$247.3m, with net profits of $10.5m.

The Arcade Music Company (AMC) has three divisions, the record company
CNR Music, the classical label Vanguard Classics and the Arcade TV
marketing company. CNR Music was set up in the 1940s and owns the
world's largest Dutch-language catalogue as well as representing
artists such as Barry White, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Commodores and
Depeche Mode in the Netherlands. Vanguard Classics represents artists
including Alfred Brendel and Arno Bornkamp and is the largest
independent classical label in the Netherlands. Arcade TV has marketed
compilations in Europe for 20 years.

AMC has offices in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
Germany, Austria and France. It expects to open an office in Finland
this year and is in talks with an Italian company about forming a joint
venture. Arcade signed the first central European licensing agreement
involving an independent label with Dutch authors' society STEMRA
effective July 1 1995. The three year deal covered the sale of
international repertoire from the group's labels on MC and CD.

The Arcade Media Group (AMG) is the largest commercial radio group in
the Netherlands. It includes three radio stations, two commercial
television stations, the cable channel TV 10 Gold, which shows mainly
American and British programmes, and the 24-hour Music Factory channel,
currently available to 3m homes. AMG also publishes four magazines
linked to the radio and television stations and to Arcade's record
shops.

The Arcade Retail Group consists of two wholesalers and the Music Store
chain of over 70 record shops in the Netherlands, which aims to expand
to 100 outlets within two years. The Arcade Film & Video division was
set up after the group bought CNR Film & Video and exists to exploit
films through all media. It currently has offices in the Netherlands
and Belgium and aims to expand via AMC's network of offices.

IFPI AND FIMI LINK TO FIGHT PIRACY IN ITALY

International Record Producers' Association IFPI is to mount a new
campaign against soundcarrier piracy in Italy together with the local
trade association FIMI.

Music & Copyright estimates the value of pirate product sold in Italy
was equivalent to 27% of the legitimate market in 1994. Pirate sales
rose that year by 38% to $142.2m, according to IFPI. Sales of pirate
MCs rose by 15% and sales of pirate CDs rose by 150% from 1993. Pirate
product represented 32% of the market in unit terms. Because of this
high level of piracy, IFPI estimates that record companies are losing
nearly $150m a year.

IFPI says that Italy accounts for 44% of the 47m pirate recordings in
the European Union (EU) and that Italy exported 15m bootleg CDs in
1994. According to IFPI, half of all MCs, which account for a third of
all recordings sold in Italy, are illegal copies. This seriously
affects Italian artists because 60% of all cassettes sold are of
Italian repertoire. IFPI says 20% of CDs sold in Italy are pirated.
These figures make Italy the fifth largest pirate music market in the
world.

IFPI argues that the high level of piracy has meant that companies have
not invested in their Italian operations. In 1991 Italy's share of
legitimate sales in the EU was 7%. This had fallen to 5% in 1994. The
growth of the Italian soundcarrier market has also been dramatically
affected by piracy. Between 1991 and 1994 the legitimate market shrank
by 20% to $535m, whereas legitimate sales rose 9% over the same period
in the rest of the EU.

IFPI and FIMI will open the offices of their new anti-piracy operation
Federation Against Music Piracy (FPM) in Milan later this month. IFPI
and FIMI and the six major record companies are to spend $1m on the
anti-piracy office. FPM aims to improve law enforcement in Italy. IFPI
points out, for example, that no convictions are expected in five cases
it began in 1994 until 1999 at the earliest. Similarly, a January 1995
change in the law, which closed a loophole and criminalised illegal
recordings of live performances, is ineffective unless authors' groups
use their legal rights to secure a long term bans on the licensing in
Italy of such recordings. FPM will help them do this.

FPM will also improve information gathering about the trade in
counterfeit and bootleg product in Italy. It is thought organised crime
is involved and that most of the pirate market is in the south of the
country with only 26% in the north. Naples is thought to be the centre
of the trade and the entry point for material from North Africa and
eastern Europe.

IFPI cites the example of Spain as evidence that anti-piracy campaigns
can work. In 1984 the piracy rate in Spain was 34%. This fell to 5% by
1989 after a concerted campaign and stronger copyright legislation, and
by 1995 piracy had been virtually eliminated.

encourage private sector broadcasters to follow the BBC's example. The
Bill, which is expected to become law in July, also ends the numerical
limit (at present 35) on licences any one company may hold. Instead
companies will be restricted to a 15% share in "radio points", a system
which takes into account the waveband and population size of each
licence held.

HIGH-COST NYNEX WANTS TELEWEST-TYPE SAVINGS

The restructuring plan unveiled on Monday by Nynex CableComms, which
involves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900 strong workforce,
follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is the
least efficient of UK cable operators.

Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs - through a mixture of
sackings, voluntary redundancies and natural wastage - and a saving of
between #7 million and #10 million a year, will enable it to reach
operating cashflow breakeven by the end of this year.

The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts resulted
from a #25 million investment in information-technology systems to
handle areas such as subscriber management and telesales.  The axe is
falling heaviest in sales and marketing, reflecting a move away from
door-to-door sales towards telesales, which Nynex regards as more
efficient (they accounted for a quarter of sales in 1995).

Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who has
just taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his old
role of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, who
drew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officer
Nicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New York
office to undertake a similar role.  There was only one senior
casualty:  Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block of
franchises.

Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industry
analysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UK
operators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs through
economies of scale.

The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing and
administration were 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine months to
end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per cent for
TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.

The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 by
the end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 too
many.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on an
expected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get the
television customers we expected, but the whole industry expected
more.''

In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UK
cable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- the
proportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in the
industry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on the
basis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be the
best, but it is close to the best and, at 30.3 per cent, contrasts
strongly with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.

On the other hand, Nynex's penetration -- the number of subscribers
expressed as a percentage of those who could take the service because
the cable passes their homes -- is much lower than TeleWest's: 18.9 per
cent against TeleWest's 21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8
per cent.  Nynex knows that it must increase its sales, but suggests
that the churn rather than the penetration figures may turn out to be
the biggest contributor to long-term success.

Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.
Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churn
lower and, indeed, has recently increased its spending.  According to
Mearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in terms
of customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we need
to make it more economic.''

Nynex hopes to reduce the cost of sales, marketing and administration
to 50 per cent of its revenue-base by the end of this year, the level
it expects TeleWest to achieve.

Nynex's restructuring could be be seen as part of a wider trend within
the industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general
panic, but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is
still not selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small
restructuring in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.

The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate culture
resulting from the UK company turning itself from a wholly-owned
foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone company into
a public company last June (though major policy decisions still have to
go through the slow process of gaining US approval).

The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuring
represented the opening shots of a new management style: it was purely
a coincidence that the moves were announced during the week of
Connell's departure.

As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up in
the wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &
Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,
before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turn
of the year.

Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-up
behaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel good
about it.''

Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,
Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a good
thing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to put
management resources as close to the franchises being managed as
possible.''

Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even with
the changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end of
the year.

Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves -- Nynex was, after all,
only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.
However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement (Monday
morning), closing at 105p.  It fell further on Tuesday to an all-time
low of 104p.

Nynex plans: Nynex is centralising the management of its three regional
franchise blocks in the south, the Midlands and the Manchester area.
Departmental executives will report to their central chief rather than
to regional bosses.  Nynex believes that one central sales organisation
covering all franchises and focusing purely on sales is more efficient
than having sales undertaken regionally and combined with marketing.

The main information system which is provoking the staff cuts is the
IBM-based ICMS integrated cable-television and telephony subscriber-
management system, which the company introduced last year.

The company is also adding a workforce-management system, designed to
improve efficiency between the sales and installation arms, and an
automated voice-response unit to handle all customer calls, directing
them to the relevant departments.  It plans to introduce tele-marketing
software which will be integrated with the ICMS system.

UK GOLD COMES OFF VIDEOTRON SYSTEMS

UK Gold, the Astra satellite entertainment channel, has refused
Videotron the right to distribute it on its cable networks in a bitter
row over carriage terms.

The channel, which carries archive BBC and Thames programmes, will come
off on February 12, losing 89,000 subscribers, two per cent of its
total satellite and cable subscription.

UK Gold, the most popular new-media channel among adults outside the
BSkyB stable, has told Videotron that it should be carried on
Videotron's lowest tier of channels, ensuring that it is seen by
virtually all subscribers.

Videotron, which owns networks in West and North London and in
Southampton, refuses to move it from a higher tier, where there are
fewer subscribers and therefore less revenue for UK Gold.

The row results from Videotron's policy of putting so-called ``basic''
channels into different tiers rather than a single ``big-basic''
package, which is the industry norm.

UK Gold said this week that is was prepared to compromise on its
principle that it should be received
by at least 95 per cent of an operator's customers and would accept
being put in a more restricted tier -- but only if Videotron were to pay
a higher per-subscriber fee to compensate it for a smaller reach.

It said that Videotron, whose packaging approach has upset several
programmers, is being inflexible.  It sent a solicitor's letter to the
cable company on Monday.

UK Gold used to be carried on a more restricted tier under the terms of
a contract which expired in November 1994.  Talks for a new contract
have dragged on ever since, with the channel being carried on a ``good
faith'' basis.  UK Gold said that Videotron had been paying it much
less than the 29p per subscriber per month it typically charges other
operators.

The channel said that Videotron only recently moved it from the highest
tier to the middle (standard) tier, despite a legal obligation to do so
before the expiry date of the last contract.

UK Gold is also angry that Videotron has been selling the channel on an
o-la-carte basis to people in the bottom tier -- illegally, in UK Gold's
view -- charging subscribers #1 but handing over only a few pence to the
channel.

Videotron, which is the fourth biggest cable operator in the UK, said
that UK Gold is asking it to pay 10p more than other operators pay --
that is, 39p.  UK Gold, however, said that it had put forward a range
of options with different prices, most of which were below 39p.

Videotron said that the price was unfair and suggested that the channel
was being punitive because of its refusal to carry UK Gold's sister
channel, the women's channel UK Living.  UK Gold denied the linkage.

Benjamin Ball, Videotron's director of programming (who, ironically,
helped to create UK Gold), said: ``We object to the idea that UK Gold
is trying to restrict our ability to offer our customers flexibility.
We want to carry the channel, but we are not prepared to sacrifice long-
term consumer benefits for short-term benefits to UK Gold.''

Videotron now runs three tiers: in ascending order, Option One,
Standard Pack and Super Pack.  The Standard Pack also carries the
channels of Option One, and the Super Pack also carries the channels of
both lower packs.

UK Gold wants to be carried in Option One, which contains only two
satellite channels, Sky One and Sky News, the only channels to be
watched by all Videotron subscribers.  At present, it is carried in the
Standard Pack and the Super Pack which, together, reach about 85 per
cent of subscribers.  The channel's coverage increases to 87 per cent --
89,000 subscribers -- because of Option One viewers who take it o la
carte.

Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, said: ``I feel bummed out
about disappointing the viewers, but someone's got to draw the line
somewhere.

``We are offering Videotron more flexibility.  We are even prepared to
allow the company to sell the channel o la carte, which means we have
to go back to other operators to give them the same flexibility.  But
our bottom line is that Videotron must pay a premium for the
flexibility.

``We hope that Videotron will reconsider its position.''

He said that the channel had little time for Videotron's controversial
packaging, which was designed to maximise consumer choice of
programming.  ``I would feel comfortable about the packaging if
Videotron`s penetration was double the industry's.  But I don't see any
evidence that this idea has improved penetration.''

Videotron's penetration on October 1 was 21.7 per cent, against an
industry average of 20.8 per cent.

Videotron argues that its three-tier approach has boosted penetration
and helped to cut churn to one of the lowest levels in the country, an
annualised 27.8 per cent (NMM 13:43).  Benjamin Ball, Videotron's head
of programming, said: ``Our strategy has been in place for more than
two years and has proved very successful.''

Steinberg said that he is concerned that the packaging of channels is
becoming the ``latest panacea'' to cure the UK cable industry's poor
cable-television penetration.  Like other programmers, he suggested
that what is needed is for operators to improve customer service and
marketing.

UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TV DIRECTIVE

The UK's Department of National Heritage reacted angrily to several
amendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directive
which were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culture
committee.

The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which would
give jurisdiction over a broadcaster to the countries receiving the
channels instead of to the country in which the broadcaster is
established.

The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principle
of the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcasts
which are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.

The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts to
tighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have at
least 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said that
amendments passed by the committee went against a ``political
agreement'' between the member states to stick with the existing
wording.

However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible for
the wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, will
get a further chance to quash the changes.

The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw out
the controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively on
the basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other states
have used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement.
 They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.

Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainment
programming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.

However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several other
controversial amendments, including one which would have banned
advertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and another
which would have required a health warning before advertisements for
alcoholic drinks on television.

The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament on
February 12.  But the committee has still not finished going through
the 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be considered
at a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51
amendments.

The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments before
sending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  The
council will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' on
the amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval by
the parliament.

The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has been
the one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After many
arguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should be
scrapped completely, and France, which believes they should be
tightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of last
year, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).

The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendment
under which certain light-entertainment programmes would not count
towards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would not
be eligble.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove
``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by these
shows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and films
to contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainment
channels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talk
shows.

A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soap
operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears of
some UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these would
still count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council and
the parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that there
would ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.

Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment which
switches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving the
broadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving country
jurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries with
jurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''

A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken for
granted that the parliament will accept what the committee has
proposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,
either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the council
of ministers.

The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope of
the directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-
demand.  It said that these services should properly be considered
separately under telecoms legislation.

TELEWEST CHIEF LEAVES

TeleWest's chief operating officer Danny Bryan has left the company
abruptly.  He is being replaced by former telecommunications head Lynn
Rexroth, who had been expected to return to shareholder US West to take
up a post in Japan.

Sources close to the company said that Bryan, who joined TeleWest from
shareholder TeleCommunications Inc a year ago, had found it hard to
adapt to the move from a well-established US cable operation to the
more start-up nature of the UK company.

GOLDEN STRANDS

UK Gold is creating three programme strands, which it describes as
``mini-channels'', as part of a plan to gear up for the launch of
digital satellite television.  The three strands may eventually be spun-
off to form separate digital channels operating under the UK Gold
umbrella.

From the middle of next month, the channel will have a two-hour
upmarket drama slot on Sunday nights, ``Masterpiece'', which will show
such series as I Claudius and Elizabeth R.

Earlier on Sunday nights, there will be a ``Showcase'' slot featuring
variety programmes such as Morcambe and Wise.  On Saturday nights, the
channel will run a drama slot, ``Spotlight'', covering themes such as
war, cops, spies and private eyes.

Further sub-brands will be based on situation comedy, science fiction,
action drama and alternative comedy.

LICENCE FEE TO SUPPORT NEW ARD, ZDF CHANNELS

German public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF will launch two new
cable and satellite channels in the next two years, one aimed at
children and the other a parliamentary channel.

The new channels will be funded from an increase in the licence fee of
DM4.45 a month (#2) which was proposed last week by the Kommission zur
Ermittlung des Finanzbedarss der Rundfunkanstalten (KEF), a commission
set up by the state governments to advise on the funding of ARD and
ZDF.

The commission is understood to have recommended that, out of the
DM4.45 increase, 15 pfennigs should be set aside to fund the children's
channel, and 7 pfennigs for the parliamentary channel.

The increase has still to be approved by the 16 state parliaments which
tend to rubber-stamp KEF proposals.

The news is a blow to Nickelodeon Germany, the children's channel
recently launched by US programmer Viacom and German toy manufacturer
Ravensburger.  Nickelodeon is Germany's only children's channel, and
has had considerable success in gaining cable carriage, despite a
continuing capacity crisis (NMM 13:42).

The launch of the new public-service children's channel, probably
during 1997, will offer stiff competition for viewers.  But it is also
likely to lead to serious cuts in Nickelodeon's cable distribution.
Distribution was granted by most media authorities only on a temporary
basis, in anticipation of the possible launch of an ARD/ZDF channel.

The idea of a public-service children's channel has long been mooted as
a means for ARD and ZDF to exploit their extensive libraries of
children's programming and to develop new programmes.  ZDF proposed
launching a children's channel in 1993, although at that time it was
being talked of as a pay service (Satellite TV Finance 4:19).  ARD
regional channel Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) also looked at launching
a children's channel (NMM 12:21).

The plans foundered because the two broadcasters are legally prevented
from launching advertising-supported channels.  Under the present plan,
the channel would be funded entirely from licence-fee revenues.

The idea of a parliamentary channel was put forward by WDR last year.  A
senior ZDF executive said this week that he was surprised that the idea
has received the support of the KEF, ``because we didn't really want
it.''  He said that ZDF had gone along with the proposal primarily
because it could be used to strengthen the argument for a licence-fee
increase:  ``Every politician is eager to see himself on TV'' (NMM
13:35).

According to the ZDF executive, the parliamentary channel could be
ready for launch late this year, with the children's channel following
early in 1997.

ARD and ZDF are desperate for an increase in the licence fee, because
the success of private commercial channels such as RTL TV, Sat 1 and
Pro 7 in recent years has led to heavy dents in the public-service
broadcasters' advertising revenues.  The viewing share of ARD's main
(national) network fell from 31 per cent in 1990 to 14.6 per cent for
1995, and ZDF's share fell from 29 per cent to 14.7 per cent.

The proposed licence-fee increase is in line with the amount requested
by the two broadcasters, but is being described as ``good news for ZDF
and bad news for ARD'', although ARD would get the larger share: DM2.35
against ZDF's DM2.05 (with another 5 pfennigs going to the media
authorities to fund their work).

ARD argues that it should have a much larger share of the increase
because, whereas ZDF is just one station, ARD has to support its
network of so-called ``third'' channels (regional television stations)
and also 11 radio stations, employing a total staff of 23,000.  This is
recognised in the way that the existing licence fee of DM23.80 per
month is split 70:30 in favour of ARD.

A senior ARD executive said this week that, if the KEF's recommendation
is ratified by the state parliaments in March, the broadcaster could
decide to take legal action against it.

The media authorities are also dissatisfied with the KEF proposal to
increase their funding.  The 5 pfennigs rise represents 1.12 per cent
of the overall increase, against the 2-per-cent share which the media
authorities take of the existing licence fee.

Any dispute over the apportioning of the increase is likely to lead to
delays in the launch of the two channels.

Further delays could result if, as seems likely, Nickelodeon takes
legal action against attempts to eject it from cable networks in favour
of the new public-service children's channel.

In several states, the channel is carried during daytime hours in the
cable slot used by the Franco-German public-service cultural channel
Arte, which broadcasts only in the evenings.  However, these states
have granted Nickelodeon cable carriage only until the end of the year,
in anticipation of the possibility that ARD and ZDF would want cable
carriage for their own children's channel.

Because the ARD/ZDF channel will be a public-service one, it will
automatically qualify for ``must-carry'' status in all German states.
Even in North Rhine Westphalia, the state which granted Nickelodeon's
licence, precedence will be given to the ARD/ZDF channel.

RTL-TV DRAWS UP PLANS FOR GERMAN NEWS CHANNEL

RTL TV, the top-rating German general entertainment channel owned by
Bertelsmann and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, is
considering launching a 24-hour German news channel.

The channel could launch in 1997 and would be broadcast in analogue
form via cable and satellite and would later move to digital.  RTL has
just launched a feasibility study on the planned channel.

RTL has also approached international broadcasters, including the US
network ABC, about providing foreign news coverage.  It is talking to
interactive software suppliers, such as Microsoft Corporation, about
the possibility of the new channel incorporating interactivity and
``news-on-demand'' facilities.

Hans Mahr, RTL director of information and sports, who is in charge of
the project, said that the main reason for launching a news channel is
that RTL correspondents are gathering far more news than can be used on
a general entertainment channel.  He estimated that the channel is able
to broadcast only one tenth of the news it produces.

Mahr said that the channel ``must be basically a German channel.''  Pan-
European channels such as Euronews ``would never succeed'' because news
is viewed ``from the perspective of where you live.''  Although the
channel is to be German-oriented, it would need foreign partners, such
as ABC, to give it an ``international context''.

Several German media regulators and television executives this week
questioned whether there is a market in Germany for another news
channel.  One regulator pointed out that national news channel n-tv is
``still struggling, despite the support of big players'' -- its US
shareholders Time Warner and CNN.  In 1995, n-tv's audience share was
0.3 per cent.

In addition to n-tv, Germany already has another national news and
information channel in Vox, the ``infotainment'' channel owned by News
Corporation, Bertelsmann and Canal Plus -- although the channel has
dropped a lot of its original news and information programming in a bid
to boost its ratings (NMM 13:30).

The RTL channel would also be competing with pan-European news channels
CNN, BBC World and Euronews; pan-European business channels NBC Super
Channel and European Business News; and the widely-respected news and
information coverage of public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF.  ARD's
8pm Tagesschau is still the most-watched news programme on German
television.

Mahr said that ARD's and ZDF's news coverage is ``all right for older
viewers who are used to that kind of presentation'', but that for
younger viewers a different style is needed.

Not all German commentators were against the idea of another news
channel.  One senior regulator said that the idea of the channel could
``make sense'' if viewers could receive the information when they
wanted it.  This would be ``a new form of bringing information to the
people.''

A former n-tv executive, who now works for a pan-European channel, said
that RTL would need only some new studios and perhaps 20 extra staff to
produce the channel for #20 million a year, which ``is not so much
money for RTL.''  He expected the new channel's approach to be typical
of RTL -- ``a little more bloodthirsty, a little more scandalous, a
little more mass market-oriented than n-tv.''

Most commentators agreed that that the channel would struggle if it
were supported by advertising alone.  However, several commentators
said that the channel would make sense if presented as part of a
digital subscription package, especially if it were the only news
channel in the market offering interactivity.

One senior ZDF executive said that if the channel is of a high
standard, and especially if it brings in good foreign news, ``then we
are in really deep trouble, because this is the last area where we
still lead.''

ARD AND ZDF LOSE SHARE AS PRO 7 SURGES FORWARD

German public-service channels ARD and ZDF continued to lose audience
share to their commercial rivals in 1995, with the two market-leading
channels RTL TV and Sat 1 maintaining their 1994 shares and the Kirch-
backed Pro 7 continuing its growth, particularly among children among
whom it is the most-viewed channel.

ARD and ZDF executives were this week comforting themselves that Sat 1
had not made bigger audience-share gains in the last two months of the
year, when Sat 1 introduced a raft of new big-budget programming.
However, one ZDF executive admitted that it is still ``far too early''
to judge the success of Sat 1's new schedules.

The executive warned against a too-literal reading of the figures,
which are skewed by the fact that they do not take into account the
distribution available to each channel nor the number of hours per day
in which a channel broadcasts.

The figures, from GfK, show that RTL-TV took a 17.6-per-cent share of
viewing in 1995, compared with 14.7 per cent for both Sat-1 and ZDF,
14.6 per cent for ARD and 9.9 per cent for Pro 7.

BBC World, the corporation's 24-hour pan-European cable and satellite
news channel, last week began a four-week period of terrestrial
distribution to five million homes in the Berlin Brandenburg area of
Germany.

The channel is being distributed for a trial period on the frequency of
ORB, the ARD regional station for the area.  According to BBC World,
this is the first time a foreign channel has been given distribution by
an ARD station.

RTL TV ABANDONS BID TO STOP HOT BROADCASTING

Germany's leading private television channel RTL TV said this week that
it is unlikely to challenge a decision by the Bavarian constitutional
court to allow the controversial home-shopping channel HOT to transmit
to German satellite homes.

Two lower courts had upheld RTL's complaint that the channel breached
German broadcasting legislation.  But the higher court, the
Verfassungsgerichtshof, ruled just before Christmas that HOT could
continue to transmit on Astra 1d to the whole of Germany.

RTL could appeal to the German federal constitutional court but says
this is unlikely because legal action is likely to be overtaken by
changes which are expected to be made to German media law which would
liberalise tele-shopping.

When HOT (Home Order Television), owned by Thomas Kirch's Pro-7 and
mail order company Quelle, was granted a licence to broadcast by
satellite to the whole of Germany by the Bavarian media authority on
December 14, RTL appealed against the decision.  Bavaria had previously
given the channel a licence for distribution on two Bavarian cable
networks.

RTL claimed that Bavaria's media law did not give it the jurisdiction
to license home-shopping channels as tele-shopping did not count as
broadcasting.

Bavaria is to change its media legislation with a new clause expected
to take effect on March 1 that will allow the media authority to
license interactive media such as shopping channels that might fall
outside the strict definition of ``broadcasting''.

Under both the European Union's transfrontier directive and Germany's
Rundfunkstaatsvertrag, tele-shopping channels are theoretically allowed
on air for only one hour a day, but Bavaria's media authority -- like
the UK's Independent Television Commission (ITC) -- has interpreted the
rule more liberally than some other states (NMM 13:41).  The EU
directive is now being revised (see story on page 3) and is expected to
allow home shopping channels on air 24 hours a day.

RTL claims that its legal action was not in vain: ``We've had two
courts saying that HOT is in breach of German media law.  I think it
was important to show this.''

RTL's chief executive Helmut Thoma has said that his shareholders CLT
and Bertelsmann are interested in setting up a tele-shopping channel
themselves and that the Bavarian media authority is giving HOT an
unfair competitive advantage by allowing it to transmit nationally
before the law has been changed.

HOT has also just been granted a licence from the UK's ITC.  HOT said
that it had applied in late November in order to hedge its bets in case
it was not allowed to uplink from Bavaria.

FRENCH REPORT QUESTIONS EUTELSAT DIGITAL PLAN

A report on the future of digital satellite television in France has
questioned the feasibility of the digital package proposed by French
public broadcaster France Television and commercial station TF1.

The report, from national audit body the Cour des Comptes, said that
the partners lack the technological and commercial expertise to operate
a digital bouquet.  It recommends that they consider joining the rival
package of Canal Plus and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.

Georges Vanderchmitt, the former director general of France 2 who wrote
the report, also suggested that France Telecom should abandon plans to
launch its next television satellite, Telecom 2d, and change its role
to that of satellite service provider, selling on capacity leased on
Eutelsat and Astra satellites.

The report, published last week, signals an increasing commercial
awareness in French governmental thinking.  It acknowledges the
importance of the Astra satellite system and of international
commercial considerations.  In the past, French administrations had
discouraged channels from using Astra satellites.

French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon said that he
favoured a wide alliance of private and public companies to launch
digital satellite television and enable France to catch up with the UK
and Germany.

Vanderchmitt said that public-service broadcasters such as Arte and
France Television as well as TF1 should negotiate with Canal Plus and
CLT for access to their Astra digital packages rather than press ahead
with plans for rival offerings on Eutelsat's Hot Bird satellites.
Canal Plus and CLT are due to launch their digital bouquets by the end
of February.

TF1 and France Television set up a joint venture company late last year
to look into the possibility of a digital package on the Eutelsat
system.

Vanderchmitt urged France Telecom to follow Deutsche Telekom in
investing in Astra owner Societe Europeenne des Satellites.  But Fillon
said that a better option would be for private French companies to
invest in SES.

OPERATORS AND CHANNELS LAUNCH CABLE SURVEY

Cable-only programmers and the UK's top cable operators next week
launch an audience research project designed to give an accurate
picture of television viewing in cable homes.

The research is needed because the existing weekly cable and satellite
research from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb) does not
give viewing details for cable-only channels because its cable sample
is so small.

Although channels have taken Barb data and re-cast it to derive a
picture of cable-only viewing, they admit that the derived figures are
not reliable enough for firm conclusions to be drawn.

The programmers want hard data to help them sell advertising space.
The operators are also keen to have an accurate picture of cable-only
viewing as part of their armoury in carriage negotiations with
programmers.

The survey is being funded by the main cable operators, United Artists
Programming, the Independent Television Commission and the cable-only
channels Live TV, Channel One, SelecTV and Travel.

The fruits of the two-week survey should appear in March.  The backers
expect it to confirm the picture shown by their analysis of Barb data,
and by a recently published survey of cable viewing from the
Independent Television Commission, that viewers in cable homes watch
more new-media television than viewers in satellite dish homes.

The new research is designed to be as close to Barb methodology as
possible, even though it will be diary-based rather than use ``people
meters'' like Barb.  Diary research is generally thought to
underestimate viewing to small channels, because respondents forget
that they have spent time watching them.  The research is being carried
out by Barb contractor RSMB.

The ITC survey, carried out over two weeks in October by Continental
Research, showed that the share of viewing taken by cable and satellite
channels in cable homes was 39.6 per cent.  This compares with a Barb
figure of 34.6 per cent for the same two weeks, according to an
analysis by New Media Markets.  The Barb figure covers cable and
satellite homes, but mainly satellite homes.

David Brennan, research director at United Artists Programming, said
that his own analysis of RSMB's Barb research showed three key
differences between viewing in cable homes and viewing in dish homes.

First, cable viewers watch more television than their satellite
counterparts.

Second, they spend a greater proportion of their time watching non-
terrestrial channels.

Third, more than half of children's viewing is of non-terrestrial
channels.

Brennan cautioned that such conclusions are based on a very small
sample.  Although Barb's cable and satellite sample is designed to be
demographically representative and reflects Barb's establishment
survey, the sub-sections of cable and satellite viewers are not in
themselves representative of the cable and satellite universes.

So, according to Brennan, when adjustments are made to the cable sample
to ensure that it is representative, its size is reduced from 180 to
90.  With such a small sample, there is a greater likelihood of
distortion, particularly with viewing for small channels and among
demographic sub-groups, such as children.

He said that the suggestion that cable viewers view differently from
satellite viewers needs to be supported by hard evidence, initially
through the new survey but eventually through Barb, when its cable
sample is increased as cable subscription in the UK grows.

``By the end of this year, the cable element in Barb should be about
300 homes which should be enough to allow us to look at it
separately,'' said Brennan.

He offered three main reasons why cable viewers might watch more non-
terrestrial channels than satellite viewers.

First, there are more channels to choose from.  Second, there is a much
greater penetration of second set-top boxes in cable homes than of
second satellite receivers in dish homes.  Third, cable viewers are
able to move from terrestrial to non-terrestrial viewing using the same
remote-control handset, whereas satellite dish users generally need to
use two separate handsets.

The ITC survey, carried out by Continental Research, showed that the
viewing share taken by cable and satellite channels in cable homes was
39.6 per cent.  Earlier surveys gave a viewing figure of 34.9 per cent
for 1994 and 42.1 per cent in 1993.  Last year, the ITC suggested that
the sharp fall in cable viewing might have reflected the fact that
newer cable homes were less interested in cable television because they
had taken a cable service primarily for telephony.

The ITC, which is carrying out a review of the annual cable viewing
surveys which it (and its predecessor the Cable Authority) have
commissioned since 1990, admits that it has found some of the research
implausible.  This year's survey suggested that the upmarket European
Business News channel was more popular in lower-class homes than in the
channel's target AB demographic group.  The ITC found this as hard to
believe as an earlier survey's suggestion of heavy viewing of the Adult
Channel among children.

Jon Davey, ITC director of cable and satellite, said:

"One of the problems has always been the relatively small size of the
sample and therefore there are difficulties in drawing too many
conclusions".  Although the survey involved 1,306 one-week diaries from
653 respondents, the number who watched individual channels was
sometimes in single figures.  The new cable research will involve a
sample of about 1,200 viewers.

The survey showed that Sky One has been overtaken by BSkyB premium film
channels as the most popular non-terrestrial channel in cable homes:
its share fell from 6.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent, while the Movie
Channel took top place with 5.8 per cent (up from 4.9 per cent) and Sky
Movies second place with 5.2 per cent (down from 5.4 per cent).

The NMM analysis of the dish-oriented Barb data for the same two weeks
in October shows several differences among channels.  UK Gold,
Nickelodoen, TCC, Discovery, Eurosport and MTV all did better in cable
homes.  Sky News did far worse.

Comparisons are difficult, partly because the ITC cable figures are for
all individuals aged two and above, whereas the Barb lower limit is
four years old.  Further, the ITC cable figures reflect each channel's
own universe of homes rather than all cable homes.  Barb covers all
cable and satellite homes.  For this reason, the NNM comparison covers
only those channels whose cable universe is close to (has at least 95
per cent of) the total cable universe.

Children's viewing of new-media channels in cable homes accounts for
well over half their total television viewing (54.4 per cent, compared
with 47.3 per cent in 1994).  Among younger children (2-9 year-olds),
the trend is more pronounced, with cable and satellite channels
accounting for 63.9 per cent of viewing.

The survey also showed that the penetration of second set-top boxes has
increased from 28.4 per cent of cable homes in 1994 to 34.8 per cent in
1995. The Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and the Cartoon Network
gained greater audience share among homes with multiple set-top boxes.

NETHOLD MAY NOT FIND PAY-SPORTS WILL EASILY BEAT A FREE CHANNEL

Can a free sports channel compete successfully against a premium sports
channel?  The UK experience suggests the battle would be one-sided,.
with the premium channel bringing in enough subscription revenue to make
it worth its while paying high prices for sports rights.

Scandinavia may well show that television life can be different that
Kinnevik's planned free sports channel, Sportkanalan, can beat
NetHold's recently-launched premium channel, Supersport.

There are many similarities between the two channels.  First, they are
not stand-alone channels, but intrinsic to the direct-to-home satellite
packages which the rival programmers are trying to push in the Nordic
market.

Second, each operator plans to run customised feeds to deliver opt-out
programming to the different language markets of the region.  Although
winter sports are popular in all Nordic countries, there are
differences of taste among the four countries.

Third, the channels look set to roll out very similar schedules: a
mixture of top sports and "wallpaper" sports.  Both have deep pockets
and are prepared to fork out the necessary cash for top sports events.

As the New Year gets under way, it does not appear that the premium
Supersport has significantly more top events than the free
Sportkanalan.  So it is hard to see how it will be able to establish
ascendancy quickly, at least not in the devastating way in which
British Sky Broadcasting's Sky Sports so easily pushed the established
Screensport into its terminal plight.

Supersport launched in Scandinavia last month using the Intelsat 601
satellite to reach cable head-ends.  Although it launched in analogue,
it will also become a key part of NetHold's planned digital satellite
package due to be launched on the Astra 1e satellite in the next few
months.  Sportkanalan is due to launch in March on the Scandinavian
Sirius satellite.

Most observers believe that the free Sportkanalan will be the likely
winner.  Few believe that there is room for two dedicated sports
channels in the Nordic market.  Some suggest that there may be room for
neither, given the presence of Eurosport Nordic, the regionalised
version of the pan-European Eurosport channel, which has the rights to
several top events, particularly in winter sports.

Peter Legaard, Nordic media director for Ogilvy and Mather, is
convinced that Sportkanalan stands the better chance in the region.  He
thinks that both channels have a good mix of programming and
advertisers will be pleased that they will appeal to young male
viewers.

But he believes that Sportkanalan will do better simply because it will
be free.  With more and more pay channels being offered, "there is a
limit to how much people will pay for television.  The time people
spend watching television will stay the same."

Scandinavian Broadcasting System's managing director Jan Steinmann
believes that Scandinavia is too small a market to handle and
advertising-supported sports channel.  He points to escalating rights
fees in the region and wonders if enough advertising revenue could ever
be raised to make a profit.  He claims that it is these high fees that
has convinced him to drop sports events on the cable and satellite
channel, Femmen.  It will now bill itself as the region's "sports - and
news-free" alternative.

Public-service broadcaster SVT and the Eurosport satellite channel are
also, not surprisingly, sceptical.

Bo Gentzel, SVT head of sport who turned down the job of managing
director at both new channels, does not believe that Scandinavia needs
more sports channels?  "We are not as television-mad as Americans.  I
don't think the audience for both channels will be very high.  Sweden
is half the size of London in terms of population.  So, we don't think
the channels will be a threat, but they will be good for the sports
idiot."

Eurosport also believes that Scandinavia is too small a television
market for three sports channels.  As a result, says Vincent Chupin,
the channel's head of sports acquisition, there may well not be enough
advertising to justify a free sports channel.

Both Supersport and Sportkanalan have had to agree shared deals with
established terrestrial channels, perhaps sub-licensing events from
them.  This is because so many rights in the region are already tied
up, and this will be the case until the end of decade when many come up
for renegotiation.

It is here that some observers believe Sportkanalan will have the
advantage, as Kinnevik already has a cosy relationship with terrestrial
broadcasters, especially SVT.  They argue that Kinnevik, as a powerful
regional programmer, is more knowledgable of the region's tastes.

Sportkanalan: Once bitten, twice shy, seems to be the guiding principle
behind Kinnevik's decision to create a free sports channel rather than
a pay-channel.

Kinnevik shut down the Filmmax pay-movie channel last autumn because it
could not get enough subscribers.  Subscriptions for its TV1000 film
and entertainment channel have not been good and the channel lost
SKr110 million (#10.7 million) in the first half of 1995.  There have
even been reports of talks between Kinnevik and arch-rival NetHold
about merging TV1000 into NetHold's FilmNet channels.

Kinnevik is not interested in getting its fingers burned again on a pay
channel.  It believes that its free sports channel can outgun NetHold's
pay-channel for three reasons:

* Sports fans in the region are used to watching sport on television
for free

* A free channel will attract more viewers than Supersport and this, in
turn, should enable it to attract more premium events looking for
``eyeballs''

* It will be easier to convince cable networks to take the channel -- an
important consideration in Norway where cable subscribers vote to
decide which channels are offered.

Sportkanalan will need to convince advertisers that a tiny viewing
share is worthwhile.  Managing director Lasse Haglund believes that the
channel can live with a 1-per-cent viewing share.

Veteran sports rights negotiators believe that a low viewing share
could scare off the owners of some events.  According to SVT's Gentzel,
``if you have only a 2-per-cent market share, there will be problems
with the sponsors of sporting events.  There's no point in doing a
channel unless you can get a 5-per-cent share.  SVT's normal share for
sports events is 15 per cent.''

Supersport: NetHold's Supersport is intended to be a must-have for
sports fans, whom the programmer hopes will flock to pay for digital
decoders -- at a cost of SKr6,000 each -- and pay the monthly
subscription fee.

At present, the analogue Supersport costs SKr179 a month if bought as a
stand-alone service or or SKr259 if bought as part of a package with
FilmNet1 and FilmNet 2 (the recently re-named FilmNet Plus and Complete
Movie Channel).

NetHold sees the premium sports channel as a key element in helping to
drive the penetration of its digital package.

With Supersport's raison d'etre dependent on its having more premium
events than Sportkanalan, access to rights is even more crucial.
Supersport's acting deputy head Ian Woodrow said that the channel's
survival will be linked to the number of live events it can show
exclusively.

He said: ``People are used to having sports for free, so we must have
the key sports.  We can't charge premium prices for incidental
sports.''

During the week, Supersport will broadcast six hours of programming in
the evening, expanding to 12 hours a day on weekends. It will have
separate feeds for each of the region's languages, with 70 per cent of
the programming the same for each country.

NetHold intends to run Supersport in parallel with its planned pay-per-
view channels to:

* Maximise revenue of an event by switching, for example, a final match
from Supersport to ppv;

* Increase interest in Supersport by using ppv sports events as a
teaser for the main channel.

Jan Friedman, vice-president of NetHold Nordic, admitted that the
strategy would take a degree of finesse to pull off: ``We don't want to
make loyal Supersport subscribers disappointed.''

Supersport's search for premium events has proven to be less-than-
ideal.  Some critics argue that the line-up (see box) is not worth the
subscription fee.

They point out that the channel does not have exclusive rights for
Swedish ice-hockey and that TV4, from which the rights are sub-
licensed, has a better deal.  Further, Supersport will show only the
Sunday and Monday matches of the English Premier League: rights for the
popular Saturday matches are held by terrestrial broadcasters.

Cable carriage will be another deciding factor.  NetHold is trying to
persuade the main cable operators in the region to sell it capacity to
carry four named channels, but with the freedom to use the capacity for
its full-blown digital service.  So far, none of the major operators
has signed the deal.

It is much easier for Sportkanalan to convince cable networks to take
one channel, rather than the minimum of four being offered by NetHold.

But NetHold's Friedman believes that the company is being generous with
its offer. ``Unless cable operators do a deal with us now, they will
get so many calls from customers wanting to watch Supersport.  In the
first couple of years we do need a parallel cable distribution because
the losses will be very, very high.''

Sportkanalan will broadcast 80 hours of programming a week, and
according to Sternmarker, has already acquired 2,000 hours of
programming.  This includes 500 hours of live golf and 100 hours of
sports documentaries produced by TWI.

Eurosport: The established player in the market, Eurosport Nordic, is
available to the DTH market on the Thor satellite and free on most
cable networks.

Eurosport's Vincent Chupin thinks that the channel can compete with
both new channels when it comes to rights and programming because it is
part of a pan-European network offering advertisers a large audience.

Eurosport, Chupin says, being part-owned by European Broadcasting Union
broadcasters, will be able to draw on a wide variety of sporting events
from across Europe to attract viewers.

Critics, however, argue that the same EBU broadcasters will be tempted
to sell some of the choicest programming to the new sports channels
purely because the money will be better.

They say all these public broadcasters share the same problems: too
much programming and too few slots in the schedule to show it; and
pressure from tight budgets to increase revenues where possible.  Under
these conditions, loyalty to the EBU and Eurosport could take a back
seat to lucrative sub-licensing deals.

Chupin thinks Supersport would do well in Sweden if it showed games
from the Swedish football league.  SVT has the rights for this year and
an option to renew them until 1998.

The key events which neither of the new sports channels have are this
year's Atlanta Olympics and European football championships, which are
both held by SVT and Eurosport.

As for Sportkanalan, Chupin thinks it will at best match Eurosport's
two to three per cent viewing share, something ``I'm not sure if you
can survive merely in Scandinavia.''

ENDEMOL MAY QUIT HMG AS BRUSSELS TURNS UP HEAT

Endemol Entertainment is considering selling its entire stake in the
Holland Media Group in order to safeguard its lucrative programming
contracts with the group's three television channels.

Endemol, the Netherlands largest independent production company, was
told last October by the European Commission that it had to reduce its
stake in the group from 23 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

But last month, the commission went further and said, in informal talks
with HMG, that Endemol should reduce the amount of programming it makes
for HMG's three television channels by at least 10 per cent.  Endemol
was also told that it would not be allowed a seat on the shareholders'
committee, which oversees the board of directors.

Endemol supplies 20 per cent of the output of RTL 4, RTL 5 and
Veronica.  It is likely to sell its HMG stake to one or more of its
partners in the consortium: broadcaster RTL 4, Dutch publishers VNU and
Veronica.

Last October, the commission's competition directorate (DG IV) said
that HMG was anti-competitive as it stood.  To satisfy Brussels, HMG
partner RTL 4 is selling 66 per cent of its satellite channel RTL 5.

ADULT CHANNEL SEEKS GERMAN RESPECTABILITY

The Adult Channel, already available to direct-to-home satellite
viewers in Germany, has applied to German media regulators for approval
to go on German cable networks.

The encrypted channel, which is licensed for satellite transmission in
Europe by the UK's Independent Television Commission, has asked for a
certificate of ``confirmation of non-objection'' from the DLM, the
umbrella body of the country's 15 media regulators.

This means that the DLM must monitor the channel's programming to see
whether it can be deemed to be pornography.  If the regulators decide
that it is pornographic, the channel can be refused permission to go on
cable under German media law.

Regulators say this is the first time they have had such a request.
There are no ``adult'' channels on German cable networks at present.

When the German pay-channel Premiere introduced an adult segment two
years ago, the DLM commissioned an expert from the University of
Hamburg to judge whether the programming was pornographic.

He judged it on sociological grounds, deciding that it was pornographic
because it had no plot and women had no role or character other than to
satisfy men, the typical role of women in pornography.  As a result,
the programming was withdrawn.

The DLM should come to a decision on the Adult Channel within six
months and may well commission an expert in a similar way.

LIVE TV HOPES FOR BOOST FROM DARTS, SOAP AND ADS

Live TV, the Mirror Group's cable channel, admitted this week that its
controversial screening of ``topless darts'', which started on Monday,
had been criticised by professional women's darts players.

The darts contests, filmed on Australian beaches, run for two minutes
each night at 11pm.  Live TV denied that the contestants -- women of a
certain age and shape -- had been chosen on the basis of their looks
rather than their ability to project darts at a board.  The programming
was neither sexist nor exploitative, said Live TV, but ``good clean
fun.''

The darts programmes will be followed next Monday by the debut of the
channel's soap opera, Canary Wharf, which is equally sexual in content,
featuring bed-hopping among television executives of a range of sexual
orientations.  Publicity for the programme promises that ``you're never
more than five minutes from a snog.''

The new programming is being backed by a #1 million radio and poster
advertising campaign which the channel claims is the biggest by a UK
cable-only channel.  The campaign uses the slogan ``Look on the bright
side'' -- something which the Mirror Group hopes to do if the new
programming boosts the poor ratings of the channel in which it is
investing #30 million.

PERFORMANCE TO EXPAND

Performance, the cable arts channel owned by Associated Newspapers, is
to move to satellite distribution in March via the Orion 1 satellite.

The channel, at present tape-delivered, will increase its transmission
hours and will seek to gain an audience on cable networks in
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries.

It will also introduce strip-scheduling, broadcasting jazz programming
at the same time each day during weekdays and opera at weekends.
Audience feedback for the channel, which is aimed at an upmarket
audience, suggested that jazz and opera were its most popular
offerings.

BRUNO AND MAN UTD TOP YEAR'S NEW-MEDIA CHARTS

Cable and satellite's most popular programme of 1995 -- and most popular
ever -- was Frank Bruno's successful challenge for the WBC World
Heavyweight Championship against Oliver McCall in September.

The programme attracted 2,248,000 viewers, giving it a TVR (percentage
of those people who could watch it) of 17.3 and a viewing share of 42.7
per cent in Astra dish and cable homes.

The charts have been compiled by New Media Markets as part of an
analysis of viewing data from Barb (Broadcasters Audience Research
Board).

The second most popular programme was one of last season's key Premier
League matches -- Manchester United v Blackburn Rovers, with 2,036,000
viewers (TVR 16.8 and viewing share 41.7 per cent).

Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic, came in at Number 3,
attracting 2,007,000 viewers for the Movie Channel.

The film was the only programme to break Sky Sports monopoly of the Top
10.  Only one other non-sports programme -- the film, Demolition Man, in
14th place -- made the Top 20.  Sports programmes took 26 of the Top 30
Astra programmes and 35 of the Top 50 programmes, with the premium film
channels and Sky One performing respectably in the 40s.

If Frank Bruno was new-media's biggest one-night stand, Manchester
United was its most consistent star.  Five top soccer matches took the
fourth-to-eighth positions, with Manchester United playing in all but
one of the games, as well as taking the No.2 spot.

The third most popular film of the year, after Jurassic Park and
Demolition Man, was The Fugitive, followed by Mrs Doubtfire and Jungle
Book.  Jungle Book, which launched the Disney Channel on October 1, was
the most popular non-BSkyB Astra programme, with 1,303,000 viewers.  It
was the only non-BSkyB programme to get more than a million viewers and
the only one to make the overall Astra Top 50 chart.

Disney also took the second and third places of the non-BSkyB chart,
both with screenings of the film, Cool Runnings.  But the chart was
dominated by the Cartoon Network, with 32 of the Top 50 programmes.

Sky One was the most popular channel over the year as a whole, with a
viewing share of 5 per cent, according to the New Media Markets
analysis.  The share was hit by a poor winter (only 4 per cent in
December).  Sky One's 1994 share was 5.4 per cent.

Sky Sports achieved 3.8 per cent for the year, 0.3 points up on 1994.
It had a good December, with 5 per cent, and a very good Christmas week
at 7.1 per cent, equalling its second-best weekly share.

MURDOCH CONSORTIUM BIDS #1.2BN FOR EUROPEAN TV RIGHTS TO OLYMPICS

A consortium backed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the leading
shareholder in British Sky Broadcasting, submitted a bid worth more
than $2 billion (#1.2 billion) for the European broadcasting rights for
the winter and summer Olympics between 2000 and 2008.  Olympic rights
have normally gone to the European Broadcasting Union, which negotiates
collectively on behalf of Europe's public-service broadcasters.

The consortium, which is thought to include other continental
broadcasters, would show the Olympics on terrestrial and subscription
networks.

The BBC's Arabic television service was repeatedly blacked out during
its coverage of the UK government's decision last week to deport
Mohammed al-Mas'ari, the Saudi dissident.  The service is shown as part
of an Orbit Communications package of channels distributed from Orbit's

FOOD GROUP TAKES A BITE OF PRO-7

Rewe, Germany's biggest food retailer, acquired 40 per cent of the
Kirch-backed Pro 7 general entertainment cable channel.

Rewe is believed to have paid DM120 million (#53.8 million) for the
stake, a sum described by one German media regulator as ``ridiculously
low'', in view of the channel's net profit last year of about DM200
million.

Pro 7 is selling a further 35.5 per cent on the stock market, in an
attempt to deflect criticism of Thomas Kirch, who was thought by many
regulators to hold his stake of 47.5 per cent in the channel on behalf
of his father Leo Kirch, founder of the Kirch Group.

PEARSON CLOSE TO BUYING SELECTV

Pearson TV said that it has completed due diligence on the purchase of
SelecTV.  But Flextech refuses to rule itself out as a potential
purchaser.

Pearson's purchase is being delayed because it says it is not
interested in buying SelecTV's cable channel or its 15-per-cent stake
in ITV company Meridian which will have to be sold separately.

The prospective purchasers are thought to be ITV franchise holder
Carlton, for the cable channel, and MAI, for the Meridian stake (MAI is
Meridian's main shareholder).

IBM ATTEMPTING TO SECURE CYBERSPACE FOR DEVELOPERS

       IBM Corp. is working to help protect copyright and licensing
rights of content developers heading for cyberspace. 
       To do that, IBM this spring plans to launch its cryptolope
technology which will protect copyrighted content from being pilfered
by cybersurfers who have not paid for the content.
       The issue is a huge concern for developers, who want to protect
their copyrighted material and ensure that they are compensated when
their content is downloaded from the Net.
       The technology will be available for use through IBM's new
Internet information service, infoMarket, which will provide
comprehensive financial and industry-specific information.
       "Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for buyers and
sellers to get together" in a secure environment, IBM spokesperson
Matthew Van Ryn told New Media Week.  "Right now...there's nothing to
prevent someone from dropping [copyrighted material] in e-mail and
sending it to 1,000 of their closest friends."
       Ultimately, the technology will give developers control over the
pricing and rights to a piece of copyrighted information.
       IBM plans to take 10 to 20 percent "or whatever it's going to
be," of what the content provider charges the user, said Van Ryn. That
percentage will be fixed and the company has no plans to charge
subscription or online fees.
       Industry analysts believe that the technology may even help to
encourage the proliferation of online content developers who have,
thus far, been weary of unauthorized mass-distribution of their work
over the Internet.
       In theory, online developers have instant access to consumers at
little or no transaction costs.  
       "The difficulty is that [their content] has been freely
forwardable to everybody else," said Dean Gloster, a partner in the
Multimedia group of San Francisco law firm Farella, Braun & Martel.
"Copyright infringement is a hobby on the Internet," he added.
Reaping Benefits
       It's not only IBM that stands to profit from the new technology.
             Developers will benefit in two ways:  they will not have
to convert their databases for online use, and they will have control
over how the content looks and how much subscribers pay for it, said
Van Ryn.
       The technology holds so much promise for increased security, not
to mention greater contact with customers, that such content providers
as American Business Information Inc. (ABI) have already signd on as
one of IBM's pre-eminent content providers.
       ABI provides Yellow Pages information for every U.S. community.
       IBM measured up to ABI's criteria for choosing an online vehicle
for its content.
       "What we do is look at the firewalls that [an Internet service]
can demonstrate to us," said Bill Kerrey, ABI's senior vice president
of business development.

CAMBRIX, TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX CROSS-PROMOTE AVIATION PRODUCTS

       Piggybacking on the marketing strength of major film studios,
new media companies like Cambrix Publishing are discovering that
cross-promoting their titles with hit movies is a sure-fire way to
boost unit sales.
       Last week, the company launched a marketing campaign with
Twentieth Century Fox to promote Cambrix's Wild Blue Yonder aviation
CD-ROM set and Fox's Broken Arrow feature film about futuristic B-3
bomber pilots.  
       Integral to the strategy is a rebate offer that aviation fans
may find hard to resist.  With any purchase of the CD-ROM set between
January 1 and April 15, Cambrix will rebate the full price of a movie
ticket (up to $7.50) to see Fox's Broken Arrow.
       "We [plan] to use the resources of the studios whenever
possible," said Cambrix Vice President Richard Hart.  
       One of the best ways to promote a title is tie it or complement
a movie.  "Then you piggyback on someone else's promotion," and
benefit from the association, said Hart.
       "The [airplane] technology you see in Broken Arrow...is very
integral to the [movie's] plot," he said.  "Because of that...people
will want to know more about what these fighters are all about."
       Hence, Cambrix's CD-ROMs that detail the history of aviation and
the technology "deepens people's appreciation for the movie," said
Hart.

Traditional Vs. Non-traditional

       Lauded as the first time a film studio and CD-ROM publisher have
cross-promoted somewhat unrelated products, the strategy is a mix of
traditional and non-traditional marketing strategies.
       The rebate offer requires the consumer to mail the CD-ROM
receipt and movie ticket stub into Cambrix for full refund on the cost
of the movie.
       With a suggested retail price of $19.99, Cambrix claims this is
one of the most significant rebate offers undertaken to date.  But
it's not the only movie rebate offer ever undertaken.
       Walt Disney last year recruited the 2,600 movie theaters
planning to show its animated film Toy Story to offer movie-goers a $5
Toy Story videogame rebate coupon at ticket windows.  Consumers had to
then bring their ticket stub to Toys "R" Us for their discount.

Marketing Beyond Rebates

       In addition to the rebate offer, Fox provided Cambrix access to
the movie, printed materials, movie posters that include the CD-ROM
advertisement and several pages within its Web site devoted to the
Wild Blue Yonder/Broken Arrow promotion. (The site will launch today
at www.brokenarrow.com.)  Fox also will further promote the Web site
heavily in print, poster and television advertising of the film.
       Within the site is an factual area on today's B-2 bombers and
related material of Cambrix's title.  "There's very nice synergy...and
also some real "meat" to the site itself," said Hart.  Users can pull
up aviation information as well as download clips from the site.  
       In return, Fox generates interest within the computer
marketplace.  "And because of the demographics and the technical base
of the movie...it ties in nicely," said Hart.  "For Fox, they reach a
market they didn't have access to."
       What's particularly unique about this campaign is that the
products are not directly related to one another.  They do, however,
share a common theme: Broken Arrow stars John Travolta and Christian
Slater as stealth bomber pilots engaged in an unimaginable conflict;
Wild Blue Yonder is a two CD-ROM disc interactive exploration of the
triumphs and tragedies of aviation.
       Finally, the marketing strategy also will include a sweepstakes
offering prizes including a trip for two to Hollywood and a visit to
Twentieth Century Fox lot.
       Fans can enter via the Broken Arrow Web site or through America
Online's Cinema POV Area, which also is highlighting the promotion and
enabling cybersurfers to enter the contest.

Exception or the Norm

       Several multimedia developers told New Media Week this size
marketing blitz is becoming more than norm than the exception.
       "If you look at the amount of money being put into developing
[titles], it's no wonder the cost of marketing them is going up,"
added Ken Christie, vice president of marketing for the Interactive
Multimedia Association.  "They have to get some kind of a return on
their investment."
       Cambrix, however, seems to be getting the best of both worlds: 
it's successfully sells its product to movie-goers on a national basis
while only chipping in $100,000 of its own marketing dollars.  
       And compared to Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Walt Disney
and Acclaim Entertainment's multi-million dollar marketing campaigns,
Cambridge's budget is just a drop in the bucket.

Security on the Horizon

IBM's upcoming cryptolope technology promises to offer security to
content developers considering online distribution of their material.
       Here's how it works: users who want to purchase any content
offered through IBM's infoMarket Service will receive the material in
a sealed cryptolope container (short for "encrypted envelope") along
with a key to unlock the package.
       Users can purchase whole or partial material. After the content
is downloaded, printed or read, the cryptolope reseals to prevent
subsequent copying or transmitting of the material, thereby ensuring
that the user pays for it each time.

EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TARGET SCHOOLS TO HELP BOOST SAGGING
RETAIL SALES

       With the top selling educational software titles scoring a
fraction of the sales of their entertainment counterparts, educational
software publishers must also begin tapping the school market to
generate additional revenue.
       Although Pixel Genius Entertainment's first title Pocahontas was
successful in the retail market-it ranked among educational top
sellers at 5,000 copies per month for its first five months-the
company has discovered that it can boost its profits by selling to
educational institutions.
       "There's a much more limited market segment for educational
titles [than entertainment titles], and this is no exception," said
Paul Janavs, co-president of Pixel. "Entertainment products are aimed
at a much larger target market. But the [education] market is growing
very rapidly and it still has a whole other side of distribution,
which is the school market."
       Pixel is banking on increasing its profits by 75 percent by
jumping into this virtually untapped market. 
       On Feb. 1 it will introduce the teacher's version of Pocahontas,
a reading-oriented title. Unlike the retail version, this one will be
packed with cross-curriculum activities, touching not only on language
arts, but on math and science as well.  
       The company declined to disclose sales figures or projections on
the upcoming version.

A Retail Supplement

Jack Bocock, marketing director of Boxer Inc., another educational
software developer, agrees that the industry can count on schools for
heavy sales.  His company targets only that segment of the market.  
       "Real education titles are natural for a school environment,"
Bocock said.  "The [retail] channel is a tough channel for all of us. 
There are few who make money in that channel, even entertainment
software.  For real educational titles, [the retail market] is not
feasible."
       But some industry analysts disagree.  Peter Rogers, an analyst
with Bear Stearns & Co. , said focusing solely on the school market is
rare.  
       Targeting consumers first has worked best for such major
educational software companies as The Learning Co. , Davidson &
Associates and Broderbund .
       "Sometimes they've supplemented their efforts by going  directly
to schools, but it's consumers that drive the business," he said.

Tackling Distribution

       Pixel, however, is not deterred.  To reach the education market,
the company first found a target market less crowded with competitors. 
             Pocahontas is one of the few educational titles that
targets an older age group, Janavs said. It's aimed at 5- to
10-year-olds instead of 3- to 6-year-olds, like most reading titles.
       On the distribution front, the company is signing up with
special wholesalers who distribute exclusively to education buyers.  
       Pixel also has contacted mail-order catalogs that cater to
teachers. 
       The company is even tailoring its packaging for the education
market by offering the teacher's version in bulk packs of 30 and
additional 5-pack for student computer laboratories.  
       By focusing its marketing strategy on this niche, Pixel is
betting it can earn profits totaling three-quarters of what it earns
in its retail market.  

Differentiating Itself 

       With competition fierce, Pixel implemented several strategies to
ensure the success of its Pocahontas school edition.
       Unique to this Pocahontas version are activities designed for
the Internet.  
       "We haven't seen [internet activities on educational software]
done, but we know schools are very excited about the Internet," said
Pixel's Janavs.
       "We're trying to provide [educators] with Internet activities
related to the Pocahontas story book so students will learn to use the
internet as a research tool by gathering information about the history
of Pocahontas."
       The teacher's version also includes a teacher's manual that
provides tear-out pages for worksheets and extension activities for
students.  

Future Plans

       Pixel also is taking great care with the versions of products it
hopes to distribute to nationwide classrooms.             
       Most importantly, the company learned from educators that
building a child's confidence in the title is more effective than
speaking down to them. "You don't need to oversimplify things for
children," he said.
       Upcoming company plans include expanding its Reading Success for
Kids series with Jack and the Beanstalk, due out this month, and an
Aladdin title, which will hit store shelves March 1.

NEW MEDIA NEWS IN BRIEF

Competition Heating Up
     U.S.-based multimedia developers soon will face even more
competition in light of the growing trend of distributing foreign
multimedia titles in the United States. 
     Case in point:  National distributor Navarre Corp.'s Digital
Entertainment subsidiary has entered into an exclusive U.S.
distribution agreement with OmniMedia, the U.K.'s first dedicated
multimedia producer and publisher.
     Digital Entertainment will begin distributing OmniMedia's CD-ROM
catalogue in late April, featuring such titles as The Ultimate Video
JukeBox: Volume 1 and The Greatest Toy Shop on Earth.
     Founded in 1993, London-based OmniMedia owns a best-selling
catalog with 12 titles, movies, general interest titles and children's
CD-ROM titles.  
     Digital Entertainment develops, licenses, publishes and
distributes interactive CD titles focusing on music and entertainment. 
It also merchandises, markets and distributes computer software titles
to traditional and non-traditional retail outlets.  (Tech Solutions
for Navarre, 212/696-2000)

Pulitzer Embraces the Web
     Signaling that big industry multimedia developers still believe
the Internet is a good place to leverage their content, Pulitzer
Publishing Co. has introduced the information service POSTnet to the
Web.
     POSTnet--the interactive supplement to the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch--includes news, sports, entertainment, directories,
community forums, chats and other material. Pulitzer also will be an
Internet access provider for people in the St. Louis metropolitan
area.
     Large segments of POSTnet content are available at no charge to
all Internet users, while use of full newswires, Post-Dispatch
archives, and POSTnet newsgroups are limited to POSTnet subscribers.
(Connie Hoffman, 314/865-8500).


Interactive Marketing Grows
     Multimedia developers aspiring to market their services
interactively take note: Interactive Media Works and Phoneworks have
teamed to form Phonivation, a new venture dedicated to developing and
managing interactive programs for major interactive marketing
campaigns.
     The alliance will market such proprietary products and services
as IMW's SampleNET CARD and Phoneworks' Electronic Green Stamps. 
     St. Petersburg-based Phoneworks specializes in using interactive
technologies for advertising, marketing and promotions, and works with
packaged goods, entertainment, cable, broadcast and Madison Avenue
companies to design marketing and implementation plans.
     Overland, Kansas-based Interactive Media Works specializes in
direct response and strategic marketing applications of interactive
media and other new technologies.  (Interactive Media Works
913/385-0055)

Crowded  Arena Developing
     Edutainment developers step aside for new competition.  Harber
Brother Productions has launched its new KinderActive children's
CD-ROM publishing arm.  In so doing, the company will produce and
market CD-ROMs and enhanced CDs that combine children's music,
characters and stories with digital graphics. 
     Leading the charge will be Nicole Silver, director of production. 
Silver is a producer at Lancit Media, a leading children's television
production firm that produces Puzzle Place, Reading Rainbow and
Backyard Safari.   
     Under the KinderActive line will be the KinderActive Musicals and
KinderActive Minds labels.  KinderActive Musicals is a new genre of
entertainment products for kids age three to eight that feature songs,
characters and stories on CD-ROM and enhanced CD formats.  (Tech
Solutions for Harber Bros., 212/696-2000)

Airview Appoints Maners VP
     The Network Connection Inc. last week named a new vice president
of marketing for its in-flight entertainment product called Airview. 
Del Maners, formerly vice president of sales for Burnes
Aerospace-West, joins TNCI's Aerospace division in that capacity.      
     Airview is among the first to deliver full-motion entertainment
screens mounted in seatbacks on passenger planes.  
     The Airview entertainment system consists of in-flight on-demand
movies, music videos, interactive computer games, destination travel
videos, city entertainment videos, faxing and Internet access for Web
site viewing.  (The Network Connection, 800/327-4853)

NBC Snags Boles 
     NBC Super Channel named Nicholas Boles head of new media,
responsible for the introduction of new revenue generating activities
in the areas of data broadcasting, interactive services, online
services, multimedia and specialized business broadcasting.
     Boles joins NBC from the consultant firm Media Strategy
Innovation.  Prior to Media Strategy, he held senior management
positions with EMI Music, Strategy Research Associates, Mirror Group
Television, British Satellite Broadcasting and BBC Subscription
Television.  (NBC Super Channel, 44 181 600 6600)

In Development: 
The "pornography police" will have a field day when they stumble upon
racks of "erotic" multimedia products displayed in plain view.
     Mature Multimedia, which is creating a merchandising program
aimed at snatching up prime retail real estate for its erotic
products, is planning to do just that.
     Wow!, the 60,000-square-foot multimedia superstore co-owned by
Tower Records and The Good Guys!, will be Mature Multimedia's partner
in crime, serving as the initial site for the pilot that will test
consumer acceptance of the program.
     Ten publishers of PG-13, NC-17 and R-Rated CD-ROM jewel-cased
titles will be involved in the market research study that combines a
low-tech retail merchandising display rack with high-tech multimedia
and the Internet.
     But those concerned about "negatively influencing" their
loved-ones' minds, beware.
     The CD-ROM sampler will use a 3D graphical interactive television
interface that will enable CD-ROM browsers to preview the products
sold.  (A Web address also (www.intermaginary.com) provides links to
all participating publishers' Web sites in the program.) 
     Until now, Mature Multimedia products have been classified and
displayed with graphic XXX adult products.  As a result, sales of
"softer erotic content" have suffered, said the company.  
     Hence, the pilot program opens a new channel to retail so
consumers can browse through the "in-between titles"-  those that may
not be suitable for young, hardcore gamers, but don't classify as
X-rated material.  

***
     Although maintaining a less-than-admirable track record as a
conduit for gameplay, at least three more multimedia industry giants
are betting that the Internet will, no doubt, be a great place for
synchronized PC gaming.
     The Total Entertainment Network, Catapult Entertainment and Mpath
Interactive are preparing Web-based services designed to enable
multiple players to battle it out over the Internet.
     But what about the never-ending complaints that the Internet is
simply too slow and unresponsive to attract hardcore gamers?  
"No problem," say each of the developers.   
     Overcoming this problem (believed to exist because of so much
incompatible software processing PC commands at different speeds) can
be overcome by writing their own proprietary software for synchronized
game play over the network.  Or so they say.
     

***
     It's kind of scary when chess software can beat the game's
leading human grandmasters--everytime. 
     Notably, in the Fifth Harvard Cup Human Versus Computer Intel
Chess Challenge, eight of the top chess programs on the market took on
six of the leading human grandmasters, and at the end of the contest,
WChess beat them all.
     Sierra On-Line, which has inked a deal to produce and sell the
software, will launch it in the form of a game called PowerChes in
November on CD-ROM for Windows 95.
     WChess A1, the engine behind the software, is the result of more
than ten years of development work by the programming team of
Intelligent Heuristic Programming Inc. (Sierra On-Line, Michael
Brochu, 206/649-9800)

***
     Targeting the choosy, hard-to-please or compulsive consumer,
Integrated Communications and Entertainment Inc. (ICE) is teaming with
WAVE Interactive Network (WIN) to allow consumers to taste-test
content before plunking down the big bucks.
     Mirroring furniture depots and office hardware suppliers across
the country, consumers will be able to buy diverse CD-ROMs on a
pay-per-use basis, rent-to-own, try-before-you-buy or by an outright
purchase through the new venture.
     In addition, consumers will be able to purchase or rent this
content via CD-ROMs, data broadcast, cable connections and through the
Net.  
     How?  WIN consumers will receive an enormous bundle of enabling
PC hardware, the WaveMeter, the WIN merchandising engine and 20 to 30
CD-ROM titles.

LETTER FROM THE EDITOR


Dear NewsNet Subscribers:

It seems only fitting that the first Action Letter of the 1990s be a
special issue--and we think it's a very special one indeed.

In less than a month, an all-new version of NewsFlash will be
released.  This issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to these
important enhancements: what does the new NewsFlash mean to you? How
does it work? Why was it designed?  This issue of the Action Letter
was written to help you understand the new NewsFlash, and to put it
to the most effective possible use.  Keep this issue as a reference
tool.

The new NewsFlash has been several years in the making, and was
officially unveiled at the Online '89 trade show, held in Chicago
this past November. The reactions from subscribers who came to the
NewsFlash sneak preview at the Online show were overwhelmingly
positive--and we hope yours will be, too.

The entire NewsNet staff has a had a hand in this project, and we've
worked long and hard to satisfy even the most demanding information
needs. Special thanks must be extended to the following members of
the Software Development team--Adrienne Adler, Lisa Byrne, George
Pickul, Edward Reese, Gary Rosenzweig, Tom Scott, Michael Stein; to
Andrew Elston, NewsNet's Executive Vice President, a wonderful
perfectionist whose quest for the ideal product has brought us (we
hope) pretty close; and to all of NewsNet for their testing help.

We'd also like to thank our beta testers, a dedicated and patient
group who never balked when we extended the test "just one more
week!" Thanks for all your comments and feedback. We couldn't have
done it without you.

And, last but certainly not least, we'd like to thank you, our
subscribers, for your suggestions and input. The design of the new
NewsFlash was based largely on ideas we've received from many of you
over the past several years. Thanks for your support and all your
ideas. We appreciate them all.

Let us know what you think of the new NewsFlash. We're starting work
now on the next phase--even more enhancements to the new NewsFlash!


Sincerely,


Patricia A. McParland
Action Letter Editor

NEWSFLASH: A NEW CLIPPING SERVICE FOR A NEW DECADE

It's official--the new version of NewsFlash is completed and
tested, and we're just about ready to release it.

Starting at the end of January, we will be releasing NewsFlash to
a group of NewsNet subscribers each week. All subscribers will be
converted to the new version by April.

The new NewsFlash incorporates features that you've requested for
years, including the ability to monitor virtually unlimited numbers
of phrases, use of complete Boolean logic to construct your keyword
phrases, and many, many other enhancements. See "Enhanced
NewsFlash... What It Means to You" in this issue for a rundown of
what the new version of NewsFlash has to offer.

Why the Rewrite?

NewsFlash, first released more than six years ago, has been one
of the information industry's premier electronic clipping services
(or, as they are also called, SDI or selective dissemination of
information services).

NewsFlash allowed NewsNet users to monitor up to 10 keyword phrases
for topics of interest to them, 24 hours a day. Any time information
matching the interests of a NewsFlash user was received at NewsNet,
that information would be posted to the subscriber's NewsNet account.

NewsFlash was an instant hit, and quickly became one of the most
popular features used by NewsNet subscribers. With NewsFlash, there
was no need for interactive searching--NewsFlash would monitor all
NewsNet services for your specified keyword phrases, and deliver the
results to you automatically.

Room to Improve

NewsFlash sounds like an almost ideal clipping service, and
in some ways, it was. As with just about anything else, however, there
was room for improvement, and frequent users of NewsFlash began giving
us suggestions on how to enhance the product.

We listened, and in 1987, we began actively soliciting feedback on
how we could best improve NewsFlash. What, specifically, did users
want?  We conducted several extensive telephone surveys, and found
that several suggestions were mentioned especially often:

    1.  The ability to monitor more than 10 phrases.

For anyone seriously involved in competitive intelligence, an
important application of NewsFlash, 10 phrases just isn't enough, our
subscribers told us. In fact, several of the subscribers we spoke
with had more than one NewsNet ID number in order to have more than
10 NewsFlash phrases.

    2.  Keyword phrases should support the use of full searching
        logic.

NewsFlash offered only one logical connector--the + sign, used to
indicate AND. Users wanted to be able to use such connectors as OR
and BUT NOT in their phrases, and to use options allowed in
searching, such as parentheses, string searching, and proximity
searching.

    3.  Users should be able to decide when articles found by
        NewsFlash are delivered.

NewsFlash automatically delivered matching articles (called "hits")
to the user's NewsNet account, and they were displayed automatically
upon signon. There was no way to bypass this notification--you had to
either read, save, or delete your NewsFlash hits before you could
enter the NewsNet database.

We took all of these concerns--and many others mentioned to us by
subscribers over the years--and began design work on a product that
would address them.

Many ideas and work hours later, at the end of last summer, a
vestigial version of the new NewsFlash was ready for testing.  We
rounded up several important industry figures--writers, researchers,
and publishers, to name a few--to help us beat up the new product.
The test period continued through the fall as we isolated and fixed
wrinkles and flaws in the new NewsFlash, aided by the expert
suggestions and opinions of our outside testers.

In early November, the new NewsFlash was officially unveiled for the
first time at the Online '89 conference in Chicago. NewsNet users and
non-subscribers alike attended the special NewsFlash sneak preview,
and the reactions were all we could have hoped for, and then some.
"This is great," one subscriber said. "I've been using five NewsNet
accounts just so I could have more phrases, and now I won't have to.
" Others were especially impressed by the complexity of the phrases
now allowed--up to 256 characters, including the use of full Boolean
logic--and by the fact that hits are delivered only when you want
them.

In This Issue

This issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to the NewsFlash
enhancements, and is designed to help you get acclimated quickly to
the new product.

"Applications of NewsFlash" covers uses for NewsFlash.  "Creating
Folders and Phrases" outlines the rudiments of setting up your
NewsFlash profile, while "Reading Your Hits: A Primer" shows you the
basics of hit retrieval. Keep this issue as you learn to use the new
NewsFlash, and refer to it.  And access the electronic clipping
service of the future--today.

APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW NEWSFLASH


If you've never used NewsFlash before--or if you've used it, but not
often--you may not be aware of the power and flexibility this
electronic clipping utility offers you.

Uses for NewsFlash are as varied as the people who use it--from fast-
food executives to the research department at National Public Radio.
Whether you need industry news or general news, if it's on NewsNet,
NewsFlash can find it for you.

Use NewsFlash to monitor:

    o  Your competition. What are others in your industry up to?
       Is your fiercest rival up for takeover? Will their new
       product offering eclipse yours?

    o  Your own company. What does the press have to say about
       your organization? Are you the subject of corporate
       rumors? Find out now--before it may be too late.

    o  Your trademarks. Is your company name--or the name of one
       of your products--registered? Keep tabs on it to make sure
       no one's making unlawful use of what's rightfully yours.

GLOSSARY OF NEWSFLASH TERMS

The following list outlines terminology used in the new NewsFlash.
Keep this list as a guide, and refer to it as you learn to make the
most of the NewsFlash enhancements.

?
Delivers a list of commands valid at that prompt and a brief help
message.

database range
Portion of the database being monitored by a keyword phrase. Database
range may consist of an individual service code, an industry code,
any combination of service and industry codes, or the entire database
(ALL), up to 256 characters.

default
With keyword phrase, folder, or global options, the default is the
standard setting. For the folder option "Display unviewed hits at
signon?," for example, the default setting is YES. If the user does
not choose to modify an option, the default setting will be used.


FLASH
Command used to enter NewsFlash mode, where folders can be created,
deleted, or listed, or options adjusted. The command NewsFlash can
also be used. (Neither command is case-sensitive.)

folder maintenance
Blanket term used to describe the process of establishing and
maintaining folders of keyword phrases. Also called NewsFlash set-up.

folder options
Set of specifications that allows the user to decide how individual
folders--collections of keyword phrases grouped by the user according
to subject matter--will be constructed. Folder options that can be
adjusted by the user include the foldername, the activity status and
activation date, the expiration date, hit sorting requirements, and
hit delivery method for this folder. The user can later any or all of
these options for a particular folder. If no specific options are
requested, the system will default to a standard set of
specifications.

foldername
The name, chosen by the user, that designates the contents of a
specific folder. The foldername can be set or altered at the folder
option level. Foldernames must consist of at least one, but not more
than 44 characters.

global options
Set of specifications that allows the user to decide how NewsFlash hits
will be sorted and delivered in all of a user's folders.  Global options
that can be adjusted by the user include when new hits will be
displayed, when saved hits should be presented, whether hits should be
saved or deleted after viewing, and whether or not the user should be
instantly informed of new hits that arrive during a NewsNet session.
The user may alter any or all of the available options, and may choose
to alter them permanently or only for the current session. If no
specific options are requested, the system will default to a standard
set of specifications.

hit
Term used to describe an individual article found, or "clipped", by
NewsFlash.

instant notification flag
A global option that notifies the user instantly of new NewsFlash
hits. Operative only while the user is actually signed on to
the NewsNet system.

keyword phrase
Word, phrase, or combination of words and phrase the user is monitoring
with NewsFlash. Each entry in a NewsFlash profile is termed a keyword
phrase. If a user were monitoring the entire database for mentions of
Iraq within sixteen words or Iraq, for example, the keyword phrase would
be IRAN W/16 IRAQ. Keyword phrases may consist of up to
256 characters.

line count
Part of both the brief and long headline displays. Shows the number of
lines contained in a particular item clipped by NewsFlash.

NewsFlash
1) NewsNet's SDI (selective dissemination of information) service, also
   called an electronic clipping service. Allows the user to monitor a
   particular service, any combination of services, or the entire
   database for specific terms, called keyword phrases, of interest.
   Monitors the specified service or services (called the database
   range) continously, even while the user is offline.
2) The command used to enter NewsFlash. While equivalent to the
   command FLASH, FLASH is preferable since it is easier
   to remember and shorter to enter.

profile
Same as folder. A collection of keyword phrases grouped together by the
user. A folder or profile may contain as few as one keyword phrase, or
as many as the user desires.

QuickFlash
A NewsFlash command that allows the user to set up folders and keyword
phrase without specifying option (default, or standard, option will be
set automatically). Designed for the new user, the user who wants to use
NewsFlash with a minimum of effort, or the user who is happy
with the current version of NewsFlash.

<RETURN>
A carriage return; also called Enter on some equipment.  Used to send a
line of input to NewsNet. Used by itself on a line in NewsFlash,
<RETURN> moves the user back one prompt at a time, unless it has some
special function at that prompt (if so, it will be mentioned in the
prompt, e.g. /<RETURN>/ for YES).

saved hits
Hits that the user has already seen, but that have been saved for future
retrieval. The user may choose, by altering the global option settings,
when to display saved hits--before new hits, after new hits, or by
request only.

word count
Displayed as part of both brief and long hit displays. Shows the number
of words contained in an individual article clipped by NewsFlash.

READING YOUR NEWSFLASH HITS: A PRIMER


The articles that NewsFlash finds for you--your "hits"--will be
displayed when you sign on, when you sign off, or only when you
request them, according to your global option settings.  Global
options govern how your hits will be organized and delivered
throughout the hit display system.  Use the OPTIONS command in
FLASH to adjust your global option settings.

If you have not changed your global option settings, hits will be
displayed when you sign on.

Regardless of when your NewsFlash hits are actually displayed, you
will receive a brief notification message each time you sign on to the
NewsNet system. This message, which displays the number of saved and
unviewed hits you have waiting, looks like this:

NEWSFLASH NOTIFICATION
======================

Folder FOLDER0001
10 unviewed hits, 12 saved hits


If you have no unviewed or saved hits, a message to this effect
will be displayed.


Reading Your Hits

If your hits are displayed upon signon, as they will be if you
have not adjusted your global options settings, you will be taken
directly into the NewsFlash hit display system immediately after the
NewsFlash notification message is displayed.

If you have more than one folder of keyword phrases, the first prompt
in hit display asks you to enter a foldername.  This prompt looks like
this:

Enter foldername, ALL, LIST (folders), or RENOTIFY
 -->

After you enter a foldername (or immediately after you enter hit
display, if you have only one folder), the main hit display prompt
will be displayed.  This prompt looks like this:

Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve
(saved or deleted hits)
 -->


At this prompt, you can enter:

HEAD to display the headlines of your hits. The order in which
these will be displayed depends upon the global option settings you
have established.  After the headlines are displayed, you can then
choose to display the full text of any that interest you.

TEXT to display the full text of all of your hits, in a
particular folder or for all folders. (Note: To display the full text
of all hits in all folders, you must have entered ALL at the "Enter
foldername" prompt.)

SORT to set temporary sort specifications for your hits.  These
sort settings will remain active in the current folder for the
current NewsFlash session only.

SUMMARY to display a count of saved and unviewed hits in each of
your folders.

ANALYZE to display a service code breakdown of publications in
which hits were found for a particular phrase or phrases.

RETRIEVE to retrieve saved and deleted hits.

Using the HEAD command is explained below.

Displaying Headlines and Text Using the HEAD Command

The most commonly used command to review NewsFlash hits is the
HEAD command. HEAD allows you to review the full text of your
headlines, and then select headlines numbers of which to review full
text.

To review the headlines of your NewsFlash hits, enter HEAD at the
top-level hit display prompt:

Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve
(saved or deleted hits)
 -->HEAD

The order and format in which your hits will be displayed is
determined by your global options settings. If you have not changed
these settings, your hits will be displayed as follows:

Any saved hits you have waiting will be displayed before unviewed
hits (hits you have not seen before).

Headlines will be displayed one screen at a time (approximately
four to five headlines per screen, depending on the length of the
headlines).

Hits will be sorted first by issue date from earliest to latest,
and then within that sort, alphabetically by keyword phrase.

After you enter HEAD and the first group of headlines is
displayed, you will be prompted as follows:

Enter Headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,
Renew (hits); More or <RETURN> for more hits
 -->

Your choices at this prompt are:


To display the full text of one or more headlines, enter the
headline numbers here. To display the full text of all headlines
in this group, enter ALL.

Separate multiple headline numbers with spaces.

PREVIEW to display just the few first lines of articles. After
entering PREVIEW, you will be prompted to enter the headline numbers.

AGAIN to display this group of headlines again.

SAVE to save any or all of the headline numbers displayed. You
can save headlines when you don't have time to display the full text
of them, or when you've displayed them, but want have them be
displayed again the next time you review saved hits. Saved hits are
retained for two days.

DELETE to delete any of the headlines in this group.  You will
then be prompted to enter the number or numbers of the headlines that
you want to delete.

RENEW to return hits to unviewed status. Renewed hits will appear
the next time you display unviewed hits. You are not charged another
clipping charge for renewed hits.

Enter MORE to leave this group of headlines and go to the next
page of headlines. The first group of headlines will be either saved,
deleted, or renewed, according to your global option setting.  The
default setting is DELETE.

Unless you have changed your global option settings, hits will
be deleted after you view them. Note that this default applies only to
unviewed hits, however. Once hits are saved or deleted, they will
retain that status until you specifically request otherwise.

Note that if you enter BACK, QUIT, or STOP at this point in hit
display, any remaining hits will remain unviewed or saved--whatever
they were before you entered hit display.

Pressing <RETURN> at this prompt is identical to entering MORE.


After you have viewed all the available headlines, you will see
a prompt:

Enter headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,
Renew (hits); or <RETURN> to continue
 -->

This prompt is the same as the one displayed after each page of
headlines, except that since there are no more headlines to be
displayed in this group, MORE is not an option. <RETURN> brings you to
the next prompt.

After your saved hits are displayed, you will be notified that
display of this category is complete, and you will then be brought to
the "Enter headline number(s) to read...<RETURN> to continue" prompt.
Press <RETURN>, and the first group of your unviewed hits will be
displayed.

The box below illustrates use of the HEAD command to review
hits.  Note that in this example, the order and format of the hits
have been determined by standard option settings.

You can customize NewsFlash hit display to suit your
specifications.  For more details, call NewsNet Customer Service at
800-345-1301.

SPECIAL HIT DISPLAY COMMANDS FOR ADVANCED USERS


by: George Pickul
    Software Development Programmer

In order to provide a simple, uncluttered environment, the
NewsFlash hit display software contains several "hidden" commands and
a number of special command options.

The "hidden" commands are not included in the list of suggested
commands displayed by typing a ? at any prompt in hit display, simply
because while they offer the flexibility required by the advanced
NewsFlash user, they may confuse novice users.  The special command
options increase the flexibility of several basic NewsFlash commands.

The hidden commands are all based on common NewsFlash commands, but
have an asterisk (*) appended to the end of the command. ALL, for
example, is a valid command at several prompts in NewsFlash; ALL* is a
hidden command with a special meaning.

Three Special Commands

There are three of these special "star" commands: ALL*, HEAD*, and
DELETE*.  These three commands work in a similar way to basic
NewsFlash hit display commands, but act on a larger group of hits.
They were created to aid the downloader and those who have to manage
large groups of NewsFlash hits.

Since each of these three commands is similar to another NewsFlash
command, they have been omitted from the prompts, and cannot be
abbreviated. They are intended specifically for the advanced user who
needs to access NewsFlash hits quickly and efficiently.

ALL*

The ALL* command displays the full text of all hits of the currently
selected type (saved hits, for example, or saved and unviewed hits),
and then changes the status of these hits to deleted. ALL* is
especially useful for those subscribers who want to print or download
the full text of all of their hits, and then quickly delete them.
Since ALL* was designed for downloading, the paging of text is
disabled.

ALL* can be entered at three different prompts in the NewsFlash hit
display system.

If you wish ALL* to operate on all of your folders, enter ALL* at the
"Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt, the
first prompt displayed upon entering the NewsFlash hit display
system. The full text of all of the hits from all of your folders
will be displayed, and then deleted.

ALL* can also be used to operate on all of your folders if you enter
ALL at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY"
prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAD for all
headlines or TEXT for all text."

If you only wish to view the hits from single folder, first specify a
foldername at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders) or
RENOTIFY" prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAd
for headline; Text for full text..."

The order in which hits are displayed, and the type of hits displayed
(saved, unviewed, or deleted), using the ALL* command, are determined
by your global options settings and any sort order changes made using
the SORT command.

ALL* can also be used in conjunction with the RETRIEVE command to
display the full text of all of your saved or deleted hits in a
particular folder.

HEAD*

The HEAD* command acts in a similar manner to that of the ALL*
command, and can be entered at the same prompts.  Instead of
displaying the full text of the hits and then deleting them as ALL*
does, however, HEAD* displays the headlines of all of your hits, and
changes the status of the hits to saved. HEAD* was designed to give
you a quick index of your hits: you can print or download the entire
group of headlines quickly, and then re-enter NewsFlash hit display
later to display full text of selected headlines.

DELETE*

The DELETE* command was created in order to let you qickly delete
large groups of hits. DELETE*, which can be entered at the "Enter
headline number(s) to read, ALL, AGain..." prompt, deletes all of
your remaining hits of the selected type (saved or unviewed), without
your having to delete them page by page or having to display them.
It's equivalent to the command STOP in the former version of
NewsFlash.

Other Command Options

When you access hits from all of your folders, you can bypass the
"Enter HEAD for all headlines or TEXT..." prompt that is displayed
immediately after you specify ALL at the "Enter foldername, List
(existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt. Simply add one of two
special command options to the ALL command: enter ALL -HEAD, or ALL
-TEXT.

ALL -HEAD, entered at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders),
or RENOTIFY" prompt, displays the headlines of hits from all of your
folders. ALL -TEXT, similarly, displays the full text of the hits
afrom all of your folders.

The command HEAD also supports two options: -BRIEF and -DETAIL. When
included on the same line as the HEAD command, the current headline
display format is changed from the setting specified in your global
options to either BRIEF format or DETAILED format.  HEAD is the
command issued to view the headlines of your hits, after you have
specified a foldername or all folders at the "Enter foldername..."
prompt first displayed upon entering hit display, or when using the
RETRIEVE command to view the headlines of saved or deleted hits.

The PAGING command in the new NewsFlash allows the use of four
different command options: -HEAD, -TEXT, -BOTH, -NONE.

The command PAGING, followed by any of these four options, can be
entered at any prompt in NewsFlash. The -TEXT option causes the full
text of NewsFlash hits to be displayed on page at a time. Entering
PAGING -HEAD will cause just headlines to be paged. Both headlines
and full text will be paged if you enter  PAGING -BOTH, and PAGING -
NONE disables paging completely.

For More Details

More details on all of these commands and command options are
available in the updated NewsFlash section of the NewsNet User
Documentation, being mailed to you within the next few weeks, and by
calling NewsNet Customer Service at 800-345-1301 or 215-527-8030.

THE NEWSFLASH CONVERSION PROCESS: WHAT YOU'LL SEE

If you're already a NewsFlash user, you may be wondering if your
existing NewsFlash profile will be compatible with the new NewsFlash
software, and if so, how the conversion will take place.

The new NewsFlash will be released gradually, a group of subscribers
at a time, starting at the end of January.

About a week before your NewsFlash profile is scheduled to be
converted, you will receive a call from a NewsNet representative, who
can answer any questions you may have about the conversion process.
When your profile has been converted, a special message will be
displayed automatically upon signon, letting you know that the new
NewsFlash is now active for you.

Your New Folder

Since the new NewsFlash is based upon groupings of keyword phrases
called "folders," a folder will be placed on your NewsNet account.
This folder, called FOLDER0001, will contain converted versions of
your existing keyword phrases.  All hits from your old NewsFlash
profile will also be transferred to this new folder.

Logical Changes

In the current version of NewsFlash, there is only one logical
connector: the + sign, used between terms to indicate AND. You can
also monitor exact, literal phrases, called "strings", merely by
leaving a space between the terms (INTEREST RATE, for example, would
be searched by the new NewsFlash as an exact phrase).

The new version of NewsFlash supports complete Boolean logic, like
that used with NewsNet's SEARCH command. The connectors AND, OR, and
BUT NOT can now be used, as can proximity searching, parentheses, and
quotation marks to indicate exact, literal phrases ("INTEREST RATE",
for example).

The + sign is no longer operative in the new version of NewsFlash,
and phrases not enclosed in quotation marks will be treated as they
are in SEARCH: as containing an implied AND connector. INTEREST RATE
in the new NewsFlash, for example, will be interpreted as INTEREST AND
RATE.

Your existing phrases will be converted automatically to the new
logical scheme:

    o  All + signs will be removed from your phrases, and
       replaced with the connector AND.

    o  All phrases now used as string searches (INTEREST RATE)
       will be enclosed in quotation marks ("INTEREST RATE").

    o  Any incorrect logical connectors accepted by the old
       NewsFlash (commas, for example) will be removed during the
       conversion.

Check Your Phrases

It is important that you check your phrases to make sure they have
been converted correctly. As soon as you receive the signon
notification letting you know that your NewsFlash profile has been
converted, enter the new NewsFlash set-up system by entering FLASH at
NewsNet's main command prompt (Enter command or <RETURN>).  At the
next prompt, enter LIST -ALL. Your converted profile will be
displayed.

Should you need to make changes to your profile, use the MODIFY
command. Enter FLASH at NewsNet's main command prompt, and, at the
next prompt, enter MODIFY.

After entering MODIFY, you will be prompted to enter OPTIONS or
PHRASES. Enter  PHRASES to change phrases, enter MODIFY at the next
prompt to change phrases, and then follow the prompts through
changing your existing phrases.  Figure 2 illustrates using the
MODIFY command to change existing phrases. [NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE
APPEARS IN THE PRINTED EDITION]

Option Settings

The new NewsFlash system also allows you to set global option
settings, used to customize the way your hits are delivered; folder
option settings, used to determine when monitoring should begin, how
hits should be sorted, and more; and phrase option settings, and
phrase option settings, which include the actual phrase being
monitored, service codes, exclusions, and when the phrase is to
become active.

For converted phrases, standard settings will be established for
your entire group of phrases (FOLDER0001).

Global Options

The standard global options settings created for you by the conversion
process determine that your hits will be delivered in the following
manner:

    o  Unviewed hits (NewsFlash hits that you have not seen
       before) will be displayed automatically when you sign on.

    o  If you have previously viewed your NewsFlash hits and
       saved any of them, all saved hits will be displayed before
       unviewed hits. Saved hits are retained for two days.

    o  After you display unviewed hits, they will be deleted
       unless you specifically request that they be saved or
       renewed (returned to unviewed status).

    o  The headlines of your NewsFlash hits will be paged
       (information will be delivered one screen at a time). Full
       text of any articles you display will not be paged.

Folder Options

    o  Your folder activity status has been set to active, which
       means that your phrases are being actively monitored.

    o  Your hits are sorted first by issue date, earliest to
       latest, and then, within that sort, alphabetically by
       keyword phrase.

    o  Your headlines are shown in brief format, which means that
       approximately four headlines will be displayed per page of
       headlines.

Phrase Options

    o  Services cross-referenced to the services you are

THE EVOLVING ONLINE DATABASE INDUSTRY

Over 25 years ago the commercial online database industry was born through
products such as Lockheed's Dialog and SDC's Orbit  with  their federally-
funded counterparts  such  as  NASA/Recon,  DOE/Recon  and Medlars.  These
services were begun when the "mainframe was king"  and  users accessed the
systems through "dumb terminals"  over private telecommunications networks
managed  by  these companies or   telecommunications  partners. Since that
time  there  have  been  major  changes  in  the  business,  computer  and
networking industries which have caused evolutionary changes in the online
field in  terms of  technology,  networking,  changing  economics  and new
advancements.  Probably  the two  most  significant  impacts  in  the last
quarter century are the emergence of  the international  Internet  and the
tremendous price/performance  advancements  in  computer  technology which
bring connectivity and very powerful computer technology  into every level
of the workplace and home.

The 'Gale Directory of  Databases',  long considered a "Bible" of database
selection  and mirror  of  the online  industry,  has listed around 10,000
databases from  3,500  database  producers  and  vended  through  over 800
online service providers.  Yet, with the emergence of the Internet and low
cost computing,  this measure is losing much meaning.   Literally hundreds
of  thousands of  database and  information services are  now available on
the Internet  from  the largest firms to  individuals at  home  using well
documented and easily  accessible  technology  such as the World  Wide Web
through which information can be organized and presented.  Everyone admits
that this  proliferation of  online  services  and tools is  confusing and
there are many poor services on the net,  and yet,  this trend is changing
the  way in  which traditional online  service providers must  address the
market.  Information producers no longer  necessarily need to go  to major
online vendors for providing wide scale access to  their information [yes,
there are still many advantages in doing so] and yet many are  now putting
their own online services directly on the Internet.

The Evolution of Computers and Networking

   *  Low cost access  to the  Internet through myriads  of local Internet
   service providers has meant that  the largest companies  to  home users
   can contract for connectivity at prices which are scalable to needs.

   *  Networking technology can now be purchased in bandwidth chunks which
   are scalable  to  local needs.   For  example,  high speed modems (e.g.
   28.8  Kbps)  which work over regular phone lines are under $200, easier
   access to ISDN [64 Kbps] is available in the home and office,  lowering
   costs of leased lines for higher speeds can even  provide T1  speeds at
   prices affordable by small businesses.

   *  Newer networking technology such as frame relay, ATM and plans being
   offered by  cable and phone companies for  optical  fiber  or  TV cable
   access to  the Internet  bring the hope  of  even  higher  bandwidth at
   affordable prices.

   *  Computing power in terms of instructions per  second has experienced
   huge growth ... Many PCs and Unix  boxes now have  more computing power
   than  supercomputers  of a  decade ago.   Intel's Pentium Pro processor
   currently  is  clocked at  200  MHz  and indications are that  the fast
   evolution  in processors will  continue.   DEC currently produces a 266
   MHz Alpha RISC Chip, Sun Microsystems now has RISC UltraSPARC chips  at
   just under 200  MHz,  and  the PowerPC RISC  chips being produced  as a
   cooperative venture with Motorola and IBM are in the same  speed range.
   Truly phenomenal computing speed is widely available.

   *   Hard   disk   storage   technology   has   experienced   the   same
   price/performance  improvements  as  the  microprocessor.   It  is  now
   difficult to buy disks with less than  1  gigabyte of storage at prices
   of just a few hundred dollars.  Many suppliers are commonly offering  1
   GB to 9 GB drives at very low costs per byte.

   * CD-ROM technology has found its niche in the home market for easy and
   cheap distribution  of  games,  databases and application  programs.  A
   quad-speed or faster CD-ROM is  now considered a  standard feature with
   most PCs.

   * Full multimedia on PCs and over the Internet are now commonplace.

   * The  operating systems which seem to be dominating the marketplace at
   this time are Windows 95  for individual  users,  Windows NT for larger
   multiuser database access and Unix.   There has been a dramatic decline
   in the use of traditional mainframe operating systems.

   *  About 80%  of the local area  network (LAN)  market is  now  held by
   Novell.  However,  it  is unclear whether  this will begin to  erode as
   multiuser operating systems such as Windows NT may make traditional LAN
   technology obsolete.   Clearly, Novell and other LAN developers need to
   offer a rich body of features and make their products  easier-to-use to
   keep ahead of the Microsoft juggernaut.

Evolution of System Features

   *  Many companies which began as producers of databases of CD-ROMs have
   now  broadened  their  market  to  offering  their  search  engines and
   databases for local loading under Unix or Windows NT.  Examples of this
   include  SilverPlatter with  their ERL service which  allows  the local
   loading  of  databases for multiuser access  under SCO Unix  or Solaris
   (Sun's version of Unix)  and they are beta testing a Windows NT version
   of  ERL.  Ovid Technologies (formerly called  CDPlus Technologies which
   shows their CD-ROM  origins)  is now primarily  distributing its search
   engines and databases for local Unix  servers.   Ovid  uses  CD-ROMs to
   distribute database  updates which local sites  copy  to  hard  disk to
   provide widescale multiuser access.

   *  Many companies which originally were not database vendors have moved
   into this marketplace because it nicely complements other products they
   vend.  For example, many developers of integrated library systems (CARL
   Corporation,  Ameritech's  VISTA  System,  Innovative  Interfaces  Inc.
   INN-VIEW system,  DRA operates the Open DRA Net service and others) now
   centrally mount suites of databases.   Although users of these services
   are typically  libraries  which  use  a  particular  integrated library
   system,  most of  these  vendors  are  trying  to  make  broader market
   penetration. Traditional cataloging utilities such as OCLC, RLG and WLN
   have all moved into the database vending market.  Their success in this
   is due to  a large existing  customer  base,  and  synergism with other
   products  they  offer (e.g.  link to  holdings, ILL/document delivery).
   Many publishers and database producers are beginning to offer their own
   online services.  Examples include Information Access Company (IAC) who
   has its own online system while still licensing its databases  to other
   vendors or  individual  sites;  EBSCO has  launched  its  own EBSCOhost
   system for offering its databases and those of  others,  Academic Press
   is  offering  its entire  family  of  print journals  on  the  Web, and
   Elsevier is offering  its huge  journal product in  electronic form for
   local loading.

   *  Online service providers are augmenting their traditional ASCII text
   search  interfaces  with  graphical user interfaces (gui).   Two trends
   seem  to  be  predominant -  many vendors are offering  proprietary gui
   clients for use with their specific online  system which  are rich with
   features;  many online services are now offering  web server  access to
   their database servers so that a person can use a standard  web browser
   (e.g.  Netscape,  Mosaic, Lynx) to search databases.  Web server access
   to database servers is advantageous because one does not  need to worry
   about client software distribution and the problems of  illegal copying
   of proprietary software.

   * Z39.50 client/server compliance is now supported by many major online
   services such  as CARL Corporation,  DRA,  Ameritech VISTA, EBSCO, OCLC
   FirstSearch, IAC, Innovative Interfaces, Ovid Technologies, RLG Citadel
   and SilverPlatter.   Thus users can select  the Z39.50  client of their
   choice and have a common  interface to many different  online services.
   Clearly this standard is still  rapidly evolving and  Z39.50 clients do
   not offer the rich  range of  features  as proprietary  clients and yet
   most feel that  the Z39.50  protocol holds great promise.   A number of
   Z39.50  clients now offer the ability  to  launch  searches  to several
   servers at the same time (e.g. DRA, Search Access).

   *  A  "link to  holdings"  feature  is  now  offered  by  some vendors.
   Although this can be handled in different  ways,  the main idea is that
   when a user  looks at  a bibliographic citation  (if full  text  is not
   online) the system indicates if a local library owns the citation. OCLC
   and RLG can perform this at the "title level"  for sites who catalog on
   their   systems.    Local  ILS  vendors   (e.g.  Ameritech,  Innovative
   Interfaces,  DRA)  can often link  to a serial summary  holdings record
   assuming the library uses the vendor in question.   Some products allow
   a library to create electronic lists of holdings statements  (e.g. IAC)
   so that when a citation is retrieved holdings show, and EBSCO indicates
   title  level ownership  information  on  its  EBSCOhost  service  if an
   organization uses  the EBSCO subscription  services  for  serials. Ovid
   Technologies does a Z39.50 call to a local Z39.50 compliant ILS so that
   the holdings information is  then  returned and displayed  to the user.
   The  link  is  up-to-date  and  does  not  require   the  creation  and
   maintenance of a second holdings file.

   *  Full scanned images are being commonly delivered by products such as
   UMI PowerPages, IAC, EBSCO and others. Full-text ASCII delivery is also
   common through vendors such as IAC, EBSCO, LEXIS-NEXIS and others.

   *  When full-text is not available online  (in either  ASCII or scanned
   images)  most online systems now offer the ability to launch a document
   delivery or ILL request.

   *  Multilingual support is  now being offered  more  frequently through
   PC-based  clients.   This  is  especially  important  with  the diverse
   American  culture  and  the  greater  internationalization   of  online
   services because of the Internet.

   *  Natural  language search interfaces  are appearing on  many consumer
   products such as "Homework Helper"  by Infonautics,  Cognito by IAC and
   EyeQ by DataTimes.

   *  Greater  sophistication  in  mapping natural language  to controlled
   vocabulary  is  appearing (e.g.  Ovid has extensive  abilities  in this
   area)  and  the ability for users to  interact  authority  or thesaural
   files is commonplace.

Changing Economics

Probably the biggest  financial trend in  the online industry in  the last
five years has been  a growing use of  "flat fee"  pricing  algorithms for
libraries and other institutions.   This originally began in the mid-1980s
when  academic  and  public  libraries  began  to  shift  away  from using
commercial timesharing services  for high-use databases  and replaced them
with CD-ROMs which could be  licensed for  a flat annual fee.   This trend
continued to evolve into the local loading of  databases  in institutional
database servers and has now gone full circle to  libraries demanding flat
fee pricing from online service providers.   This flat fee pricing through
online service providers has been challenging since one must get agreement
from  the  online  vendor  and  the  database  producer.   This  is  often
complicated by  factors such as libraries wanting to  subscribe  in groups
through consortia.   Online vendors and database producers  have developed
many unique pricing algorithms to maintain revenue while responding to the
need in many institutions for fixed fee pricing so  they  can manage tight
budgets.   The  most  common  algorithm  usually  involves  some  type  of
concurrent  user  model.   Most libraries,  however, still use many of the
commercial timesharing services for medium and low use databases where the
institution wants occasional access to many different files.

Many vendors are also developing personal pricing strategies in an attempt
to provide low cost access to database services over the  Internet for the
individual.   Typically,  these  involve billing or  credit  card payments
which an individual can afford  and the vendor  hopes to make a  profit in
volume.

Some  online  services  offer their  search  engine  for  free  if  a site
subscribes  to  or  locally   loads   some   of   their   databases  (e.g.
SilverPlatter, IAC,  most databases from ILS vendors) ... the library only
pays for the  database  subscription.   However,  there  are  some notable
exceptions   such  as  Ovid   Technologies   or   OCLC   SiteSearch  where
organizations are willing to pay a premium for specialized services.

Conclusion

With the emergence of the Internet and low-cost high-powered computing the
online industry is in a state of  flux.  Many traditional online providers
need to be flexible to respond to user needs.   Online services need to be
powerful  and yet easy-to-use,  must  be  client-centered,  and  must have
pricing options for many different market segments.  [GSM]

SILVERPLATTER ENHANCES ITS ERL TECHNOLOGY

SilverPlatter  Information,  Inc.  has  recently  announced  a  series  of
enhancements  to  its ERL  client/server  architecture  providing improved
access to databases and full text products.

WinSPIRS 2.0  is SilverPlatter's Windows-based graphical  client which now
provides the ability to interact with not only bibliographic databases but
also full-text products.  In full-text databases  users  may mark sections
and paragraphs of documents for later action  not just  entire  records as
was  previously possible.   Other improvements for WinSPIRS  include: more
accurate recommendations  in  the  Suggest  feature  for  alternate terms;
improved customization of defaults  which enable  system administrators to
manage end-user activities for showing,  printing  and downloading; easier
movement between screens;  expanding a search history to  an entire screen
and multilingual support in English,  German, French and Spanish which can
be changed at anytime by the user.

SilverPlatter has also  released  WebSPIRS  which is an http  gateway that
provides  access  to  ERL-compliant  databases  from  any  World  Wide Web
browser.  Any institution that has ERL installed,  can load WebSPIRS along
with the web server to provide web browser access to databases. Authorized
users must have a forms-compatible browser.

GALILEO: UNIV OF GEORGIA USING OCLC SITESEARCH AND WEBZ DATABASE PRODUCTS

The University System of Georgia is offering a suite  of bibliographic and
full-text  databases  to  34  state-supported  academic  libraries through
GALILEO,  the Georgia Library Learning Online System.  GALILEO offers over
50  databases using OCLC SiteSearch Z39.50  Server System coupled with the
OCLC WebZ software which lets  users access  the system  over the Internet
using standard web browsers.

This aggressive  project was spearheaded by William Gray Potter, director,
University of  Georgia.   "We wanted full Z39.50  compatibility with a Web
browser ... We know  we wanted  to  take  a client-server approach  but we
didn't want to be in the business of attempting to distribute and maintain
a proprietary client.  And  we  wanted  to provide  ready integration with
OCLC's FirstSearch  service.  With  SiteSearch  and  WebZ,  we're  able to
perform all these functions."

Two parallel SiteSearch systems are being run at the University of Georgia
and  Georgia  State  University  to  distribute  the   load  for   the  34
participating institutions.   Some of the databases are locally loaded and
some are offered on a pass-through basis to the FirstSearch system at OCLC
in Ohio.  Databases  offered  include  a suite  of   periodical  indexing/
abstracting services, an encyclopedia and full-text to over 1,100 journals
from EBSCO.

High-use files or files of local interest are put on the  local SiteSearch
servers while other databases are offered seamlessly  through FirstSearch.
In the future,  the  Galileo project  will  offer  scanned  document image
databases including the Georgia archives and state documents. In addition,
other libraries in the state will be brought into  the project to  build a
statewide network available to all residents of the state.

For more information on OCLC's SiteSearch and WebZ  products contact: OCLC
Online Computer Library Center,  6565  Frantz Road, Dublin, OH 43017-3395.
Telephone: (614) 764-6000. Fax: (614) 764-6096.

OCLC OFFERS PASSPORT SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

In 1990,  OCLC released  a DOS-based  telecommunications  software product
called Passport which was designed to be used with the OCLC online system.
In December  1995,  OCLC released  the first Windows  version  of Passport
which takes advantage of many of the standard Windows features.   Prior to
release OCLC did a three month field test with 18 libraries.

Some of the special advantages of Passport for Windows include the ability
for users to cut and paste information from OCLC to a local library system
window; training time is reduced and it is easier for occasional users; it
offers a  macro language which  allows catalogers to  create pop-up dialog
boxes which can be used  to easily modify  information in  a local system;
and  it  offers  the scripting of  authorizations  and  passwords  to OCLC
FirstSearch and other OCLC online services.

OCLC has indicated that  they  will  continue  to make the DOS  version of
Passport available to users.

Contact:   OCLC Online Computer Library Center,  6565 Frantz Road, Dublin,
OH  43017-3395.  Telephone:  (614)  764-6000.  Fax:  (614) 764-6096. http:

STAR/WEB OFFERS WWW ACCESS TO THE CUADRA STAR SYSTEM

For  many  years Cuadra  Associates  Inc.  has produced  the  popular STAR
information retrieval system.  In December 1995, the company announced the
availability of  STAR/Web  which allows  any web  browser  to  access STAR
databases over  the Internet.  STAR/Web uses  a  common  gateway interface
(cgi)  program that connects STAR  software to any standard  or commercial
World  Wide  Web  server   (http  daemon).   With  the  product,  database
administrators  can let users of their  Web hosts use a STAR database with
any   standard  web  browser,  thus  mitigating  the  need  to  distribute
proprietary client software.

The STAR system is widely used in libraries,  museums, government agencies
and other organizations who must index print and non-print collections.

Some special features of STAR/Web include:

   *  System administrators  can design  web pages for full-text  or index
   searches that include multiple input boxes.

   *  Index displays  on  the assisted  search  screens  help users select
   applicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriate input boxes.

   *  Administrators  can pre-define  applicable  Boolean,  proximity  and
   ranging operators.

   * Ordering facilities are supported for document delivery.

   *  STAR/Web maintains their "state" in which the user views the initial
   search results.   When  users  select  a  hypertext  link, conventional
   search engines immediately forget what the user entered as search text.
   STAR/Web retains what the user has entered and selected.

   *  The product allows  the  system  administrator  to  design  the html
   screens and has tools  to present and  sort information to the  user in
   many different ways.

For more information contact:  Cuadra Associates Inc.,  11835 West Olympic
Blvd.,  Los Angeles, CA 90064.  Telephone: (800) 366-1390, (310) 478-0066.

CHANGE: THE INEVITABLE - AS ONLINE COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGY RACE AHEAD

Change: it's inevitable - as online users are keenly aware.

It's not just the technology that  jumps in quantum leaps - it's  also the
companies that make up the online  industry that are either being left  by
the wayside,  or being  gobbled up,  or merging  to make  up the new super
conglomerates worldwide.

Probably  the  biggest  impetus  has  been  the  huge growth of the online
industry over the past several years due to the beckoning online  consumer
market and the fact that even  the professional online user market is  now
end-user oriented (and not libraries as it was a decade ago).

Of recent note in the area of mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures:

Encyclopedia Britannica,  the 227  year-old company  - which  was late  in
bringing its product online and then also introducing a too-expensive  CD-
ROM -  is being  acquired by  the Swiss-based  investor Jacob  Safra. EB's
chairman and  president, Joseph  Esposito, was  quoted as  saying the sale
would "intensify  its focus  and efforts  in extending  the vast editorial
wealth of the  Britannica, as well  as in strengthening  our leadership on
the World Wide Web."

CCH Incorporated, a leading provider of tax and business law  information,
software, and  services is  being acquired  under an  agreement by Wolters
Kluwer NV, an international publisher of print and electronic  information
for  professionals  and  business  for  approximately  $1.9  billion.  The
transaction places  Wolters Kluwer  in the  position of  being one  of the
world's  largest  and  leading  professional  publishers,  with   combined
anticipated revenues of more than $2.4 billion. The move also provides the
Dutch company with strengthening its presence in North America.

Responsive  Database  Services,  Inc.  (Beachwood,  OH),  producer  of the
Business &  Industry (tm)  database (B&I),  and headed  by president  Dick
Harris (formerly the head of Predicasts), has announced its acquisition of
the News  Services Group  (NSG) of  BIS Strategic  Decisions, Inc. (Luton,
England) for an undisclosed sum.  NSG will be renamed Responsive  Database
Services,  Ltd.  (RDSL).  With  the  acquisition,  RDSI  will  extend  its
locations  at  which  it  processes  data  for its B&I database. RDSI will
invest  in  the  market  development  of  its RDSI "customized information
services"  used  by  major  companies  throughout  the  world.  RDSI  also
publishes topical newsletters in the information technology field such  as
'IT Today', and 'IT Focus'.

ISI has announced its introduction of the company's new line of  Internet-
delivered  alerting  services  called  "Research  Alert  Direct" (tm) (RAD
(tm)). Six end-user desktop product packages will be introduced:  "Journal
Tracker"  (tm),   "Personal  Alert"   (tm),  "Professional   Alert"  (tm),
"Corporate Alert" (tm), "Topics Select"  (tm), and "Focus On". All  of the
RAD products  are drawn  from ISI's  multidisciplinary database  searching
over 16,000 leading international  science, social sciences and  arts, and
humanities  journals,  books,  and  proceedings.  RAD  provides   current,
complete bibliographic information that matches a user's profile. The  new
product offering will become available in the first quarter of 1996.

Cambridge  Scientific  Abstracts  has  recently  signed  an agreement with
SilverPlatter  Information  to  license  SilverPlatter's ERL technology to
build  37  abstract  journal  databases  which  will  be  accessible using
SilverPlatter's SPIRS. The  databases will be  mounted on CSA's  server in
Bethesda, Maryland,  and will  be available  for customers  to access  via
CSA's Internet Database Service (IDS).

It was quite a few years ago that we envisioned "erasable optical  discs".
That  vision  has  eluded  many,  primarily  because  the cost of magnetic
storage (which -is- erasable) came  down dramatically in price. (The  cost
of a 1 Gigabyte  drive is now about  $300.) Then came WORM  CD-ROM drives,
CDR - and now HDCD (High Density CD). Users who bought single speed CD-ROM
drives in the late eighties soon found that double-speed (2x) drives  were
now required  for many  applications, such  as multimedia.  Now 4x  CD-ROM
drives  are  common  and  8x  drives  are just being introduced. Differing
standards  by   different  manufacturers   all  helped   to  quash  CD-ROM
development  over  the  past  years.  Now  new  light  has  shone with the
agreement on standards  by major worldwide  CD-ROM manufacturers both  for
high density CD,  and truly erasable  CD-ROMs. -- But  will we be  able to
afford it?

While Microsoft's  Windows 95  made a  splashy debut  in 1995, Microsoft's
decision to use 16-bit technology instead of 32-bit reflects the fact that
most 16-bit online and  PC users still represent  the bulk of the  market.
That  was  Gates'  hedge  on  making  sure  the  product would sell - also
recognizing the fact  that not everyone  is as eager  to hand out  dollars
just to be the "first kid on the block" with the new technology. Ditto  on
Intel's Pentium chip which  cannot significantly utilize its  higher speed
for the majority of Windows 95 users.

Development of the Internet is probably a good reflection and  measurement
of just how much technology can race ahead of users. There is currently  a
rush for virtually everyone and every company and organization  throughout
the world  to get  on the  World Wide  Web (ourselves included). Software,
browsers, databases, services,  email - and  you name it  - abound on  the
Internet. Unfortunately, for online and PC users, not all of the  products
are compatible with -your- system, and  tech support can soak up a  lot of
user time (whether it's  for free or -fee-).  -- All said however,  online
and PC users -should-  use the Internet as  an indicator of the  advancing
technology - as it is happening!

We are all looking forward to  1996 to see just what new  developments are
coming down the information superhighway - not to mention that we'd prefer
not to have our pockets picked along the way. [RSH]

PRINT SCREEN: NEW SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

One of the niceties of using MS-DOS was that users could capture and print
out  a  screen  of  data  by  simply entering Shift/Print Screen. With the
advent of Windows, that option went the route of the dinosaurs.

Now  JE  Software  has  introduced  Print  Screen  2.0  for  Windows  that
essentially does the same wonderful thing - and then some.

The program, which works with Windows.3x, Windows 95, or Windows NT,  does
it with a -single- keystroke.

The Print Screen program enables printing the active window or full screen
to any Windows  printer, fax device,  or disk. Users  can also stretch  or
shrink  the  image,  save  it  in  normal or reverse (negative) format, or
choose the printer's portrait or landscape mode.

The product enables users to be able to virtually perform the task of  "If
you can see it,  you can print it."  routine - including images  from both
online -and- CD-ROM applications.

The Print Screen Auto-Save feature  also enables users to save  the screen
to a sequentially numbered .bmp file which can be loaded into most Windows
programs. Settings can be made for automatic print, save, or none - or any
combination of these functions.

Printers required  for these  images require  a laser  printer, dot-matrix
printer capable of graphics, or a combination printer/fax machine.  ASCII-
type printers are not supported.

Print  Screen  2.0  for  Windows  costs  $29.95 for a single-user license.
Network and site licenses are available.

For  further  information  contact:  Janesway Electronics Corporation, 404
North Terrace Avenue, Mount Vernon, NY 10552. Telephone: (800) 431-1348 or

INSPEC TO COVER ELECTRONIC JOURNALS - BACKFILES LOADED ON OCLC

During 1996,  the INSPEC  database, produced  by the  IEE (Institution  of
Electrical Engineers),  will extend  its coverage  of electronic  journals
that are available in  electronic form. The type  of journal that will  be
selected  for  indexing  must  contain  peer-reviewed  articles, which are
permanently stored into an archive maintained by a publisher. Examples  of
journals that will be scanned for the INSPEC database include "The Journal
of  Artificial  Intelligence  Research"   (published  by  the  AI   Access
Foundation), and "TCAD" (Technology Computer Aided Design), a  forthcoming
publication of the IEEE.

To accommodate electronic journals, some  new fields have been created  on
the INSPEC  Tape Services.  These are  Document Number  and URLs  (Uniform
Resource  Locators).  The  Document  Numbers  will  be  used  for   wholly
electronic journals (or for  electronic journals published in  parallel to
print) that give articles a unique  number. Where they are believed to  be
stable, URLs will be  given both at the  individual article level, and  at
the level of the complete journal or electronic document collection.

IEE has also announced that  the INSPEC database available on  OCLC's EPIC
and FirstSearch  services, has  been loaded  to include  the entire INSPEC
database backfile with the addition of 2.5 million records and dating back
to 1969, bringing the total number  of INSPEC records available to over  5
million records. The database is updated weekly and has been available  on
OCLC since early 1994.

INTERNET FREE SPEECH IN TROUBLE AGAIN WITH CHURCH

INTERNET FREE SPEECH IN TROUBLE AGAIN WITH CHURCH - Although the Church of
Scientology's copyright case  was dismissed by  a Denver federal  court in
1995 (see  'Online Newsletter'  October 1995  p.11), the  church is  at it
again.   --   The   church's   "hostage"   this  time  is  Netcom  On-Line
Communications, Inc.,  an Internet  service provider,  which U.S. District
Judge Ronald M. Whyte in California, has said in an unprecedented  32-page
decision  -  may  be  liable  for  alleged  copyright  infringements  by a
subscriber who  posted the  church's "sacred  texts" on  the Internet. The
person posting the  text is a  former church minister,  now turned critic,
who has  an Internet  electronic discussion  group known  as alt.religion.
scientiology. -- The case is  a critical point for -all-  online providers
because it is  the first time  that a federal  judge has ruled  whether an
Internet  access  provider  should  be  held  responsible  for   copyright
infringements by a subscriber (rather than the subscriber being targeted).
It will also determine whether First Amendment rights apply to all  online
service providers under a different set of rules - unlike phone  companies
which are  not restricted  in any  similar manner.  -- If  encouraged, the
judge's  actions  could  have  a  devastating  effect on the online field,
freedom of communications, and the  exchange of information and ideas.  --
Clearly,  swift  U.S.  Congressional   action  is  needed  to   amend  the
Telecommunications Act to ensure that these kinds of frivolous  litigation
do not tie up online industry providers or restrict online user access  in
any way. [RSH]

ADVANCE NOTES. Quietly (very quietly), a consortium of five major 
film/camera companies have been working together to come up with a 
new type of camera and film to meet the competition from the digital 
arena. In February they'll be unveiling their product to the 
photography industry. Using new technology ranging from magnetic 
strips on film, to printed information on the back of pictures, the 
new system, called APS (Advanced Photo System), is bound to attract 
general consumers and eventually professionals. Here's our two-part 
report:

FILM FOREVER !


Film and camera manufacturers know where the big dollar is. With your 
average consumer. These companies have secretly engineered a new 
film/camera product that is aimed at holding the deep foothold they 
have dug in the consumer industry. To keep these customers, they've 
in essence invented a new picture-taking method: the Advanced Photo 
System (APS).

WHEN YA CAN'T FIGHT 'EM


Long-time foes, KODAK and FUJI, plus three other entries (Nikon, 
Canon, and Minolta) have formed a consortium over the last five years 
in an attempt to secretly counter the obvious commercial threat to 
them from digital photography. The result of their efforts is a dream 
come true for anyone who isn't interested in f-stops, lighting 
formulae, flash factors, color balances, and all the complexities 
photography instructors build their careers on. The five companies 
will introduce the Advance Photo System to the world in February, and 
the system will be in stores by early spring.

Some highlights:

FILM. It'll be 24mm wide negative film, not transparencies. Exposures 
of 14,25, and 40. You won't get it back from the processor in those 
fingerprint-prone strips anymore. The rolled film will return in its 
original cassette. And you won't get blank film back if you loaded it 
wrong.  You can't load it wrong.
CONTACT SHEETS. You'll get back postcard-size sheets with miniature, 
numbered, color pictures on them, ready to select for print-making. 
There'll be no wasteful volume printing of everything on the roll. 
Instead, you'll select customized sizes for your pictures of top 
priority.
PRINTS. By pushing a button on the camera, you'll be able to encode 
on the film what eventual print sizes you want for specific shots, 
ranging from full-frame to panoramic views.
QUALITY. Overexposure and underexposure will be no longer be a 
problem, or at least, will be negligible. A beeper on your camera 
will ask you if you are trying to be creative or if you've made a 
wrong aperture decision.
AUDIO. On the more advanced systems, you'll get "film with smarts." 
The magnetic strip on the film will store spoken instructions and 
other data.
CAPTIONS. The magnetic strip will also automatically store 
information about the exposure, location, species, genus, model names 
and releases, or historical data. Your film processor can use the 
stored data to make exposure adjustments, on a frame-by-frame basis. 
You'll also get details (if you want them) printed out on the back of 
each finished picture.
PRICE. Film will be in the normal price ranges. Cameras will cost 
from $25 for a throw-away to big bucks for the sophisticated models.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Ten years ago, who would've thought you could make the Evening News?  
Well, not you, but the footage from your camcorder. It's possible 
today. We see it all the time.
We, the people, are all becoming reporters of the world around us. As 
a stock photographer, you have an inside avenue to the markets where 
your pictures are sold. New technology, both digital and film, is 
making it easier to record, catalog, and later transmit your images. 
Not just to the local media, but worldwide. The new Advanced Photo 
System (APS) portends to expand this influence of stock photography. 
Fasten your seat belts, the ride into the next century of photo 
illustration is going to be exciting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It's expected the new APS will take a few years to become accepted by 
the public. One hurdle: everyone seems to have a 35-mm camera. The 
cassettes for APS are not adaptable to standard 35mm cameras. And 
there's always the uncomfortable echo of past attempts to rejuvenate 
the sluggish consumer photography industry. Remember the "disk 
cameras" of a decade ago?
Here at PhotoSource International we see the APS system as a 
potentially excellent transition technology for both stock 
photographers and photobuyers. New companies will licence the 
technology and offer improvements and peripherals. Although the APS 
is aimed initially at the consumer market, as it matures, 
advancements will evolve as user-friendly technology fit for 
professionals and flow well with paralleling advancements in digital 
imagery. -RE

For Stock Photographers....
THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE, IS A HOLE


The Internet last year as a whole doubled in size.  Or rather, as a 
hole.  It's a deep pit for the unwary stock photographer.  If there's 
any substantive commerce for independent stock photographers on the 
Internet, I'd like to hear about it.

What I read and hear about are Internet products, books, courses, WEB 
Sites, peripherals, consultant software, training, conferences, 
chats, and all other varieties of the Medicine Show.  Everyone's 
gearing up to learn, but where are the sales?

C'mon.  Someone please step forward and tell us they've found the 
Internet to be a more cost-effective way to make sales than through 
conventional methods.

The single action I see on the Internet is by amateur art directors 
who are on fishing trips, trying to reel in Clip Art prices from 
uninformed photographers.

Step aside, television, we have a new pencil sharpener, a new waste 
land for procrastinators.  We've gone beyond the word processing 
merry-go-round, Oprah, Rush, and headphones.  Now it's the Internet.

In Mark Twain or Walt Whitman's era, when writers wanted to 
procrastinate, they'd sharpen pencils.  The writer would get up from 
the desk and grind away at the pencil sharpener in an attempt to look 
like something of substance was getting accomplished.  Then 
television took over as aider and abetter to procrastinators.

Net potatoes today find the Internet an escape.

So far, the Internet can hardly be called a highway of productivity.  
An hour surfing the Internet is foolishly spent on time you could be 
advancing your stock photography career.  The Internet as a highway
has no stop lights, speed limits, guard rails, or accident 
prevention--just toll booths.

The Internet for stock photographers is populated by inexperienced 
people using tools that haven't reached maturity. But it is pumped up 
by professionals--marketing professionals who know how to take an 
empty thoroughfare and turn it into the glamour and glitter of Las 
Vegas.  Listen to the rhetoric.  Put a blindfold on and substitute 
the word "Used Car" for "Internet" and you'll recognize familiar 
hype.

But take heart, it's coming.  Many interesting things can be found at 
the bottom of a pit:  gold, diamonds, ancient coins, even crude oil!

However, don't fall into the pit without some tools to get yourself 
back out, as well as a plan to mine the pit.  You can join those 
ever-present pioneers who are ready to descend into any pit on the 
chance of ascending to greater heights.  I applaud them.

We talk by phone and fax with dozens of photobuyers each week in the 
course of our photo listing gathering here at PhotoSource 
International.  Photobuyers in the magazine and book world tell us 
they are not available on the Internet and don't plan to be soon.  If 
this changes, we'll be the first to let you know. -RE

Ed. Note: Be sure to read "The Internet: Thumbs Down -- Ten good 
reasons for stock photographers to stay out of the net."

A NEW KIND OF HIGHWAY BRIGAND


The scene is a court room.  The judge, with gavel in hand, has just 
heard a stock photographer plead his case.  The defendant, an art 
director at a mid-size ad agency, has been accused of "borrowing" 
part of the photographer's photo and using it in an ad campaign.

The gavel comes down.  The judge rules for the photographer and 
glares at the ad agency art director.  "You willfully stole part of 
this photographer's picture.  I'm going to fine you within the full 
extent of the law, $750, the price you would have had to pay for this 
photo if you had acquired it through appropriate business channels."

The ad agency director smiles.

"What?"  The photographer gasps.  "You mean someone can steal my 
photos and use them for free and if they get caught all they have to 
pay is the price they would have paid anyway for the photo if they 
would have gone through regular channels?"

"I'm afraid that's the way the Copyright Law presently reads," says 
the judge.

"Yet I have to pay my attorney, and court costs, and all my downtime, 
about $3500, that it took to pursue my rights in this case???"

Gavel comes down again.  "Next case!"  says the judge.

                   MODERN-DAY BRIGANDS

    The photographer in this case could be you.  Digital technology 
already makes it very easy for art directors to "borrow" images and 
portions of images from magazines, catalogs, posters, or original 
art, and use them for their own purposes.  They know that litigation 
is too costly for an individual photographer.  The information 
highway is producing a new kind of robber, the digital image thief.

As we travel down the information highway, no other profession will 
be as vulnerable to thievery as ours.  Parts of pictures can be 
stolen with little or no detection.

And even if you detect it, it doesn't matter whether you can prove 
that part of your photo was pilfered.  If by some remarkable chance a 
thief is found out, the way the law is interpreted now, unless the 
image has formal copyright registration protection, the robber gets 
away without punishment.  And he's free to continue to roam the 
highway, picking off victims at will.  Few photographers formally 
register every one of their pictures (at $20 per).

In medieval days, when vandals roamed the countryside, the populace 
depended on the Baron and his castle for protection.  In a sense, 
individuals were torn between the evils of vandals and the 
corruptions of land barons.

                        __________
              "...the ease of picking out parts of digital images is 
too irresistible to digit pickers..."
                        ----------

Not until citizens gained individual rights and legal protection, did 
real freedom become reality.

As individual stock photographers, we have been knocked back to 
medieval times.  Digital imagery has done this to us.  The ease of 
picking out parts of digital images is too irresistible to digit 
pickers at graphic houses and ad agencies.

Large stock agencies, with their financial resources, no doubt may 
set some precedents and win a few court battles against the digital 
vandals.  But the message to commercial art directors will be:  "If 
you see an image you want, make sure it doesn't belong to a large 
stock agency or a digital service bureau.  Instead prey on the 
individual photographer who will never be able to afford to fight 
us."

For photographers, the message will be:  "I'd better give up my 
individuality and go with a large stock agency (the Baron in the 
Castle) so he can protect me."

We need a Pied Piper, someone who will lead us away from the digital 
vandals, and away from the Barons who offer us protection but 
sometimes at the cost of our creative freedom.  We need someone who 
will set a precedent with the Copyright Office and establish painful 
repercussions in the graphics community for any pilfering of an image 
or parts of an image, whether the original belongs to a massive stock 
agency, a small stock agency, or Jane Doe producing individual photos 
from her cabin in Montana.

DIGITS IS MONEY


Eventually, the banking industry will be completely digitized.  
Already, here at the farm as one example, most of our revenue the 
form of credit card payments (digits). We use a Control Data program 
called TELEMONY to deposit these digits, and the digits end up in our 
bank via the Federal Reserve.

We also offer a program for "automatic checks," called Check-O-Matic, 
for persons who are not into credit cards. Our bank talks 
electronically to the bank where their have there checking account 
(digits).

Photos are getting digitized too. Eventually, the stock photo 
industry will be completely digitized.

MONEY IN THE BANK

It can be said that digitized photos and digitized money are becoming 
synonymous, and that if you have a bank of photos, then you have 
money in the bank.

Commerce is conducted when there's an exchange of money (digits).
However, the stock photo industry today, as well as the rest of the 
commercial community, face the same hurdles to achieve security 
systems that the banking industry faced 35 years ago when electronic 
transfer of money (digits) was introduced.

Over the past three decades, banks have produced an effective 
(secure) system for transferring digits.  No secure system exists yet 
for photos (or text), or finaicial transactions in the open 
marketplace.

Several commercial companies are focusing enery and dollars to solve 
their security problems, and some even do boast of having "secure" 
systems on the Internet.  One such firm is Netscape--but two 
announcements last year of "holes" in the Netscape Navigator have 
Internet merchants scurrying for an explanation. In one case, two 
Berkeley students cracked the program's security code and publicized 
their finding on the Internet.

By the way, if you are a programmer with a hacker's mentality and are 
looking for a gainful programming position, the best way to get to 
the head of the line is to crack the Internet and publicize your 
findings.  Industry will scoop you up and employ your talents. -RE

UPDATELESS


Inevitable: Death, Taxes, and Updates. There's no getting around it, 
updates of your software is now a fact of our digital lives. A visit 
to the library to look over some 1980's computer magazines and you 
wonder how we could've been so naive in those days. Now, when a new 
accounting program comes along we know better than to call it the 
program of the century (even with only four more years of the century 
left). We're talking maybe four more months and it'll be outdated. 
Don't fight it. Without updates (new versions) of your current 
software, you fall behind. Buy the updates; they'll be worth the 
investment. -RE

WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH COPYRIGHT CHANGES?

Not enough, according to copyright attorney, Stephen R. Bergerson.
ASMP and several other groups concerned with intellectual properties 
have attempted to introduce sensible changes to the Copyright Act, 
but with little success so far.  Photographers would like to see 
changes in Sections 104(a), 405, 406, 408(a) and 412(2), which 
require that an individual photograph be formally registered within 
three months after publication or before an infringement problem 
comes up in order to be eligible for full legal recourse.
Currently it's not feasible for photographers to go through the 
formal

                       - - - - - - - - - - -
registration process for each photo (and at $20 a crack), in order to 
protect themselves "just in case," so that they're eligible to 
receive statutory damages in the event infringement happens.  This 
requirement needs to be abolished in order to eliminate the loophole 
for digital thievery as presented in the theoretical case above.
"We know that copyright changes are coming.  But Congress is trying 
to find answers for questions that haven't been asked yet," says 
Bergerson.  "Electronic transmission of images is presenting a new 
playing field.  And we're wrestling with the age-old problem of 
legislation always lagging far behind technology."

SMOLAN GOES INTERNET 

On February 8th, Rick Smolan (Day In The Life series, Passages from 
Vietnam, etc.) and over 100 of the world's top photojournalists will 
take part in 24 Hours in Cyberspace. Their targets will be the most 
intriguing stories from the on-line frontier, from rural Nepal to 
Oakland's inner-city ghetto to the boardrooms of New York City. Their 
focus will be on the human stories behind the technology; the new 
ways in which we work, play, learn, conduct business and interact.
The results will be instantly visible around the world, through one 
of the largest on-line events ever produced. Images will be 
transmitted digitally back to the project's headquarters in San 
Francisco, where Smolan's team will assemble a unique "instant" World 
Wide Web site, with updates throughout the day. Simultaneously, 
millions of on-line viewers will be invited to submit their own 
stories of how the digital revolution is affecting their lives. Many 
of these stories will become part of the "instant" Web site as well.
A permanent World Wide Web site will be unveiled on March 15th, 
featuring even more in-depth stories, photo essays, and commentaries.

Getting your Federal tax refund electronically deposited into your 
bank account no longer requires that you file your return 
electronically.  Now you can attach Form 8888 to your return (even if 
filing the old-fashioned way--via paper), and the IRS will send the 
refund directly to your bank. And, you'll get it about a week earlier 
than mailed refunds, too. Last year 68% of returns filed resulted in 
a refund, so get in line for yours!

TAX TACTICS:


WHEN YOUR CAMERA IS STOLEN
The best protection for your camera equipment, of course, is 
prevention.  Relatively recent law changes drastically tightened the 
rules on deductions for casualty theft losses. It is now much more 
difficult to qualify for tax relief when you suffer property damage 
of your photography equipment. The damage must be the result of an 
auto accident, fire, flood, vandalism, storm, theft, or some other 
event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual in nature. Even in these 
circumstances there are restrictions.

Both the past and present rules allow write-offs for uninsured losses 
on property used for personal purposes only if you itemize your 
deductions.  Another restriction imposed by the old and current rules 
is that you cannot deduct the first $100 of loss from any casualty or 
theft incident.

Julian Block, a former IRS agent and tax attorney, is the author of "Julian
Block's Tax Avoidance Secrets" (560 pages) $33.95 (3 Washington Sq, Larchmont
NY 10538-2032).  He can be reached on PRODIGY (EXPT16B).

YOU AND THE LAW:


As a photographer your understanding of the law is crucial to the survival of
your business.

REVIEW OF AN AGENCY'S BOOKS AND RECORDS.  It's appropriate for you to 
have the right to review, or audit, your stock agency's books and 
records, as they relate to your images and sales, on a regular basis, 
upon reasonable notice.  An audit is at your cost, but if an error of 
5% or more is disclosed, the agency will usually agree to pay such 
cost.  Although it is rare for a photographer to actually conduct an 
official audit, it is important to reserve the right to be able to do 
so in your contract.

Attorney Joel L Hecker lectures and writes extensively on issues of concern to
the photography industry.  His office is located at Russo & Burke, 600 Third
Ave, New York NY 10016.  1 212 557-9600.

VERTICAL MARKETING
PART VI


FRAGMENTATION: The Gold Mine For the Photo Illustrator

There seems to be an immutable law of cyberspace that goes something 
like this, "The more information you have available, the less you 
have available." You've probably experienced the same thing when 
surfing the variety of TV channels you now have available to you: 
"There's nothing on TV anymore. Unless you want to watch the cat and 
dog show competition in Bulgaria." Human nature dictates that the 
more choices we have, the less satisfied we are.  (Ignorance is 
bliss.)

In the business world, the law of supply and demand takes over. A 
weekly cat and dog show from Bulgaria wouldn't last long if there 
were 1.) no viewers, and 2.) no sponsors. REALITY: If the show 
survives, it's because there's a market for it.

Where do you fit in? As a photo illustrator in the new generation of 
stock photography, the speedy delivery of text and images makes the 
global market a goldmine for you, if you specialize.

THE KEY:  FRAGMENTATION

The fragmentation of information will work in your favor. No longer 
will photobuyers be seeking a picture of a cat. They'll want a White 
Manx or an Abyssinian silver male cat. If you have a way with cats 
and love photographing them, you will become an important resource to 
a book publisher in Singapore who is producing a coffee table book on 
Black Persian cats.

To the rest of us, such photo requests will seem way out in left 
field, much the same as we feel about the arcane selection of shows 
we see listed on cable TV these days. But to you, the specialist in 
cats of the Near East, the photo request will be right down your 
alley. You'll make not only a sale, but a new contact to add to your 
cluster of buyers that you can count on for sales in the years ahead.

THERE'S HOPE

Does the trend toward specialization mean we are coming to a static 
resting place in our development as stock photographers? Bottleneck 
problems result when we acquire massive amounts of information, but 
have no speedy system to process, transmit, or filter it. But, as is 
happening in many of the medical sciences, electronics, and even 
molecular biology (using DNA as its model), our paths along 
specialized routes may all converge into one gigantic ballroom where 
we would capitalize on the quick delivery of information. Inventions 
such as molecular computers may one day be the solution. Locating and 
transmitting pictures will be as quick as turning the page in this 
newsletter. In the meantime, it's all about putting bread on the 
table, and fragmentation is the key.

HIGHWAY HEADLIGHTS

As the I-Way begins to build, keep your eye on the movers and shakers 
who are developing stock photo sites.  As electronic retrieval of 
picture information becomes easier, more and more photobuyers will 
begin to weigh the advantages of looking for their pictures on the 
I-Way.  But don't make the mistake of being a general merchant; 
you're sure to crash.  Instead, choose a specialty areas that you 
enjoy (wild horses couldn't pull you away), and begin developing 
in-depth coverage now.  Photobuyers in your niche of the marketplace 
will come first to you when they discover you have the pictures that 
they need.  -RE

CORBIS -A MONOPOLY?


I hear it over and over, 'Corbis Media is going to take over our 
industry'....at my seminars, on the Net, at conferences, meetings, 
phone calls.

No it's not.

Corbis Media is the proprietor of a large archive of images, yes. But 
a monopoly, it is not. When Corbis Media is at full capacity, it will 
represent perhaps about 1% of the images on this planet. It is no 
more going to put you out of business than your local lending library 
is going to put newspaper, magazine and book publishers out of 
business.

The impact from libraries has been the reverse:  More books are being 
bought today. 10,000 new publishers are signing up for ISBN's (the 
i.d. #'s in the book industry) each year.  Last year there were 
119,000 new titles published and over a million books printed.
There's no such thing as monopoly culture when it comes to 
communicating.

Vast libraries like Corbis, KPX\Sprint, PNI and any future ones that 
may enter the scene are essentially storehouses of generalized 
photos. These Goliaths aren't geared to collect deep files on every 
subject, every topic, every corner of the world.

For that reason, photobuyers will turn to their "specialty shops" - 
you - when they want expertise in a subject and depth of coverage for 
greater choice, to offer their readers exceptional, insightful 
photography - which after all, sells books and magazines. -RE.

TRAVEL NOTES:

Here's the travel photographer's dilemma. You're taking pictures in a 
foreign country. You come across someone whose photo you just have to 
have. You don't speak her language; she doesn't speak yours. You 
can't ask for permission to shoot, or, in case you need it, for her 
to sign a model release. And you don't want to snap away and then 
walk away. Although in the USA this might be considered normal by the 
general public, in some foreign countries it might be considered 
rude. In some cultures, worse than rude.

Here's one solution. Pull out your Polaroid camera. Take a portrait 
shot and give it to the person. Usually, they'll be delighted with 
the gift and happy to have you then photograph them with your 35mm 
camera to your heart's content.

SNAPSHOP:

DAVID BROWNELL
David Brownell was working for the Aspen Ski Corp. back in 1975 when 
he discovered he could turn his photography hobby into a profitable 
business. When ski magazines started buying his photos (and one of 
his shots on a cover) he knew he could compete with the pros.
The magazine work led to assignments (one company sent him to 
Kilimanjaro). Eventually he migrated to the East coast where his 
western style of ski shooting was in great demand. The move was a 
challenge: no more spectacular mountains, crisp blue skies, mild, and 
mild dry weather of the Rockies. "The East is wet, windy and COLD. I 
keep my EOS1N batteries always charged.  My socks and boots are 
always dry -never wet. And for dexterity, I wear Thermax Gloves with 
fingerless bunting gloves (available in hunting and fishing supply 
store) over top. Never use wool gloves; they have a tendency to get 
strands wound up into your film cartridges."

RIGHTS GRABS. The "siege" of the New York Times by freelance writers 
and their organizations (to protect writers' rights to appropriate 
payment) continues to attract attention.
Along parallel lines, a year ago, TIME Inc. announced a policy 
covering freelance photography that included electronic rights issues 
unacceptable to ASMP, PP of A and other photo groups.  The squeaky 
wheel gets the grease.  Some of TIME Inc.'s periodicals began mailing 
new freelance contracts that did not demand electronic rights, and 
promised royalties for electronic use starting in 1998; demanding, 
however, free use until then.  Multi more protests later, the 
magazines have reportedly again revised their contracts, dropping 
CD-ROM's from the electronic use clause and adding small up front 
payments to cover online use until royalties begin.

A WEB SITE "HIT" is the terminology marketing people use when they 
refer to a visitor they attract to their Web Site on the Internet. 
The numbers of 'hits' are always large (15,000, 150,000, etc.). The 
numbers are impressive until you realize these aren't sales, or even 
prospects. They're curious people, window shoppers.
Here at PhotoSource International, we've been photographed and 
featured in several major magazines--TIME Magazine (a half page 
photo), POPULAR PHOTOGRAPHY, MONEY, USA TODAY (quarter page photos), 
CHANGING TIMES (on the cover).  Each person that read these articles 
could be considered the same type of 'hit.' This adds up to several 
million 'hits' over the years. Here's where you get the difference 
between advertising and publicity. While this kind of exposure is 
beneficial for the big picture and long term--does it result in sales 
today? Were we able to covert any of the inquiries? Few. Most were 
window shoppers. We've found, for our business, that the best 
advertising is direct marketing, going straight to a qualified 
prospect through the U.S. mail or a carrier service.  -RE

AGENCY NOTES:
ON-LINE IMAGE LIBRARIES:  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?


A handful of stock agencies and stock photographers have been 
advertising on the Web.  (Transactions have been done by traditional, 
over-the-phone price negotiations followed by manual prepayment 
through credit card, invoicing or purchase orders.)  Last month, I 
mentioned West Stock's introduction of their new World Wide Web site 
called "Muse," which offers a searchable on-line database of digital 
photographs and quick loading of lower and medium resolution images.  
Earlier this year, Index Stock already pioneered on-line transactions 
on CompuServe, a commercial on-line service. Index Stock's on-line 
database, Photos To Go, offers medium-resolution images (about 2 MB) 
for personal and in-house use in the $15 to $20 price range.  
According to Index Stock's Kathy Mullins, "West Stock's Muse site 
appears to be offering high-quality, 'catalog' grade images. In 
contrast, we've kept our Photos To Go images separate from our 
premium line of catalog images."

Muse provides two on-line resolutions for previewing:  A thumbnail 
image and watermarked JPEC image that is about 3.5" x 5" at 72 dpi.  
Images for lease are offered in the 1.1 MB size and the 4.5 MB size, 
which are similar to Kodak PhotoCD's "Base" resolution and "BaseX4" 
resolutions, respectively.  Muse offers "affordable pricing" in five 
categories:  Personal ($8-$15); internal Business Printed, i.e. 
newsletters ($15-$46); external Business Printed, i.e. brochures 
($20-$70); non-resale Electronic, i.e. Web pages or presentations 
($25-$30); and resale Electronic, i.e. interactive CD-ROM software 
($40-$45).

Picture Network International (PNI) has been operating a commercial 
on-line site for about two years.  Besides offering over 350,000 
images from 40 suppliers (mostly stock agencies), their Publishers 
Depot site also offers works of art (from Christies of the UK), 
historical images, illustrations and type fonts.  PNI has been 
securing digital images and electronic-use rights (with contracts 
lasting up to seven years) from many top stock agencies over the past 
two years.  Now they are offering 5-year interactive CD-ROM licenses 
for as low as $40, for production runs under 20,000; and Publishing 
on Demand (under 5,000 copies) for as low as $30 (18 megabyte files 
are $100).  Although PNI does not offer instant transactions like 
West Stock's Muse site, they claim to provide delivery by writeable 
CD-ROM or on-line delivery within 24 hours.

COPYRIGHT:

Can you use elements of a work you do not own if what you produce 
isn't recognizable as derived from the original work?

Copyright does not protect a work's ideas, processes, or systems.  
Anyone is free to copy those elements.  Only the "expression" in a 
work is protected.

However, if protected "expression" elements of a photo are copied and 
then transformed by the copier into something that is not 
recognizable as the original work, technically, this is still 
copyright infringement (because it is an unauthorized exercise of the 
copyright owner's exclusive reproduction right - even if the copy has 
been transformed into something very different.)  In addition, 
transforming the copy to a new and different work may also be an 
infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive right to modify the 
protected work.

Practically speaking, though, it can be both costly and difficult for 
the copyright owner  to prove infringement in this type of case.  
Copyright infringement is generally established in court by proving 
that the defendant's work is "substantially similar" to the 
copyrighted work.  If the copyright owner's work and the defendant's 
work are not similar, the copyright owner will not be able to prove 
infringement unless the defendant actually admits to having copied 
the protected work.

Phd Technology
KEEP IT TO ONE FINGER


There's a marketing truism: "If you want to live with the masses, 
sell to the classes; if you want to live with the classes, sell to 
the masses."  Applying this to camera production, vendors have 
learned that indeed the megabucks are with mass products for the 
general consumer, not the showcase elite products aimed at 
professionals.

As we move into digital delivery of pictures, however, I see 
manufacturers ignoring this time-tested axiom.

In the race to capture the Digital Image Industry (and it must be an 
important one if Apple, Microsoft, Kodak, Fuji, Sony, IBM, and all 
the other brothers have jumped in), I will make a prediction that the 
technology that will win out, will be Phd Technology.  (Phd = Push 
Here Dummy).

Every bell and whistle you add to something makes it more complicated 
for the operator.  When sales dip, manufacturers put their engineers 
to work to simplify, simplify, and make equipment easier to use.  
We've seen this happen in our generation with cameras, automobiles, 
and telephones.

As photographers move onto the I-Way, computer technology will no 
doubt give way to Interactive Video technology, with all the latter's 
one finger 'touch screen' push-button ease of operation.  If you plan 
on providing a service for photobuyers on the I-Way you'll appeal to 
them and win over the competition if your buyers can reach you with 
one finger (digit). -RE

A WORKABLE SYSTEM


We all like to avoid work.  Unfortunately, few endeavors exist that 
don't entail some work.

"Stay out of my darkroom!" the photographer says.  Or, "Stay out of 
my kitchen!" the chef says.  What they are saying to us is, "I've 
developed a routine.  I, alone, understand it.  I know where 
everything is.  If you come in and disturb my routine -- you'll make 
more work for me."

Since the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of most of the activities 
we involve ourselves in -- housekeeping, driving daily to work, child 
rearing, marketing our photo illustrations -- we find ourselves 
attempting to develop a system to get through the nitty gritty tasks 
that contribute to the success of the main endeavor.  A system, once 
we perfect it, eventually becomes a habit.  As the saying goes, "You 
can get used to anything."  Once we form the habit (even the task of 
meeting the rush hour traffic) it eases the pain.  The unpleasantness 
of tasks we must accomplish in order to `get through the day' can 
always be eased by developing a system that works for you.

Some of us "develop" our `systems' by leaving ourselves to the mercy 
of chance.  We let outside pressures ("do it or else") or inside 
pressures ("I am consumed by my desires") take over.  We sometimes 
succeed despite the odds. The burn-out rate associated with this 
approach is high, however.

A system, to be good, has to be tempered.  A very dear friend of 
mine, a German photographer, who introduced me to the camera back in 
1956, was a perfectionist in his photography and his darkroom.  Not 
even his wife was allowed to be present when he was working.  He 
served up a stress-filled life for himself, and his heart attack in 
1975 was not a surprise.  Another friend, a brilliant photographer 
who coached me in photo illustration back in 1964, allowed inner 
pressures to build intolerably and he took his own life in 1981.  A 
system has to be tempered.

Unfortunately, much press is given to the artist with a cataclysmic 
lifestyle whose angst is supposedly the source of his genious. 
Successful artists who have had happy childhoods and create a 
healthful and smooth lifestyle don't make for interesting reading.  
But there are hundreds of chipper and balanced artists out there who 
can serve as role models - and examples of having hammered out their 
own systems for success in living as well as their art.

Because you have been blessed (or plagued!) with the gift of 
creativity, you have the added challenge of working out a system not 
only for your personal family situation, but your life of creativity 
as well.  Over the years, I have observed that the majority of 
artists who survive intact are not those who got there by sheer 
`talent,' or who moved forward mainly on the nervous energy of their 
"burning desire" (both elements are, of course, important) -- but 
rather those who tempered these elements into a manageable lifestyle 
and built a system that worked, for them.

FOUR CANDIDATES SIGN ON AS PBS GEARS UP FOR NATIONAL ISSUES
CONVENTION

     While PBS is gearing up with publicity and other fanfare for
start of National Issues Convention (NIC) Jan. 18-21 at U. of
Tex.-Austin, only 4 presidential candidates have accepted
invitations to appear to answer questions from NIC participants,
and 2 of them will take part via satellite.  More importantly,
staffers for key Republican candidate Sen. Dole (R-Kan.) have told
press that he won't be attending.  President Clinton, whose
scheduled revolves around completion of budget talks, hasn't made
up his mind whether to attend, and his appearance live or by
satellite likely depends on budget negotiations scheduled to
reconvene Jan. 17.

     Spokeswoman for NIC said Republican hopefuls Lamar Alexander,
Richard Lugar, Steve Forbes and Sen. Gramm (R-Tex.) all have agreed
to answer questions live before group of representatives from
across U.S. who will spend days prior taking part in deliberative
poll -- discussing and studying issues before going to candidates
with their concerns.  Alexander and Gramm will take part via
satellite, spokeswoman said.  She said Sen. Dole hasn't told NIC
that he won't attend and planners still are hopeful they can find
way for him to participate.  NIC planners said discussions also
continue with White House on securing Democratic presence at event. 
James Fishkin, chmn. of govt. dept. at U. of Tex. and NIC exec.
dir., said organizers hope "that all of the candidates  -- both
Democrat and Republican -- will realize the importance of this
opportunity."  He called poll "democracy at work," putting "entire
country in one room for an open dialogue on the subjects that
matter to many of us."

     Staffers at MacNeil-Lehrer Productions, which is producing
convention for air on PBS, have invited other "policymakers" and
"opinion makers" in case Clinton, Dole and others can't attend,
spokeswoman said.  Names of those invited weren't disclosed.  She
said even if originally-planned cast of candidates don't all show
up, NIC participants -- all 600 -- still will get to take part in
nation's first major deliberative poll, which will show what
citizens think about issues as they become more informed about them
through discussions in small groups as well as with candidates and
other opinion shapers.

     Citizen participants, making up representative sample of U.S.,
are scheduled to arrive in Austin Jan. 18 to begin their group
discussions, which will be led by trained moderators provided by
National Issues forum, non-partisan network of citizen
organizations that regularly hold deliberative forums on wide range
of issues.  Discussion guides prepared by Public Agenda and
Kettering Foundation will serve as briefing materials.  All
materials have been reviewed by bipartisan committee of former
govt. officials.

     Discussions with candidates will air live on PBS stations Jan.
20-21.  Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer will moderate
broadcasts, which will be simulcast on NPR.  Wrap-up program Jan.
26 will feature highlights and analysis of NIC.  Poll, developed by
Fishkin, will measure participants' attitudes and opinions before
and after NIC to quantify impact of deliberative process,
organizers said.  NIC will focus on 3 broad issue areas:  economy,
state of American family, U.S. role in post-Cold War world.  Final
broadcast Jan. 26 will reveal poll's results.

     NIC is major component of PBS's The Democracy Project, new
multimedia initiative for news and public affairs programming that
will extend beyond election year.  PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan said he
expects NIC will bring "much-needed perspective" to campaign dialog
as well as "launch an exciting year of presidential election
coverage on public television."

WASHINGTON DEBATE NO LONGER ABOUT ZEROING OUT PTV -- DUGGAN

     PASADENA, Cal. -- Public broadcasters are "confident about our
future," and debate in Washington no longer is about "zeroing out"
noncommercial service but how best to continue funding it,
according to PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan.  At TV critics tour, he said
debate turnaround doesn't mean industry has become "complacent or
comfortable" and that PBS is proud of "the often controversial
programming we offer."

     Speaking of PBS accomplishments during 1995, Duggan said it
was "a tumultuous year, a time more exciting than we would want it
to have been."  While commercial stations lost audience, PBS
remained steady, Duggan said, with 81.7% of American homes tuning
to PTV in Oct.  Among successes, Duggan said, were Home Video
Catalog, "a tremendous success" that went to 6 million Americans; 
PBS online, which he said has been "tremendous boost to our
mission";  partnership with Reader's Digest, which will bring PTV
$75 million over next 5 years;  "audience acclaim" received by PBS
programming in general.

     Among concerns, Duggan said, was drop in corporate
underwriting for PTV programming.  Noncommercial TV receives 86% of
its funding from private sources, only 14% from govt., he said.  As
for proposal some stations have made to Congress to let public
stations advertise products, "the objective truth" is that viewers
and large majority of stations don't want it, Duggan said:  "The
last thing the media world needs is one more commercial channel." 
There would be net loss in income if advertising is added because
of drop in corporate and member contributions, he predicted.

     As for future of govt. funding, Duggan said noncommercial
groups have submitted 11 proposals to Congress and he wouldn't pick
out any one measure as favorite.  Among them was proposed tax on
transfer of commercial stations, which Duggan said would be "just
tiny" fraction of total sales price.  National public broadcasting
organizations, including PBS, currently are pushing proposal that
would allow public stations to lease or sell excess advanced TV
spectrum to capitalize multi-billion dollar trust fund that would
replace govt. funding.  While Duggan refused to endorse proposal to
require commercial stations to air 3 hours weekly of educational
children's programming, he praised "courage and determination" of
FCC Chmn. Hundt in bringing issue before public.  In comments to
FCC, PBS had proposed credit for commercial stations that paid for
production of educational children's programming by public
broadcasters.

     On subject of enhanced underwriting for PBS programming,
Duggan said:  "I'm perfectly happy with that.  We do believe that
enhancing the underwriting message is permissible and we know from
our... research that the audience does not object to that."  He
stressed that programming isn't interrupted:  "We have no appeals
to buy [something].  We have no product pitches... It might be
playing fast and loose with reality to say that we are moving
closer to commercializing" with enhanced announcements.

     PBS said it plans more than 100 hours of primetime programming
covering 1996 presidential campaign.  Titled The Democracy Project,
effort will be headed by Ellen Hume, former Washington
correspondent for Wall St. Journal and N.Y. Times.  Among programs
planned is So You Want to Buy a President, scheduled for Jan. 20
broadcast, which PBS expects to be controversial and will
investigate high cost of national campaigns.

     PBS has been looking for programming head since Jennifer
Lawson resigned last spring in midst of management skake-up.  Major
problem in picking successor, Duggan told us, is that people PBS
has interviewed are making more than $700,000 in commercial TV --
much more than PBS is willing to pay.  Kathy Quattrone has been
filling post on acting basis and she was one of many unable to
travel to southern Cal. to meet with critics because of blizzard in
Northeast.  Also unable to get to Pasadena were Peter, Paul and
Mary, who star in PBS program and were scheduled to entertain.  At
closing PTV session last night (Tues.), several TV critics also
hadn't made it to Cal., because of weather.

     PBS announced several new programming ventures at tour,
including new shows on politics, religion, nature.  Among new
programs will be Bill Moyers series of 10 shows on stories in
Bible's Book of Genesis.  During Genesis:  A Living Conversation
with Bill Moyers, Moyers and group of people from various religious
backgrounds will discuss such topics as Adam and Eve and Redemption
and Noah and the Flood.

     PBS also announced new slate of David Attenborough specials
from BBC, led by 10-part series, World of Birds, for air in 1999. 
Third season of David Attenborough's Natural World -- made up of 10
half-hour explorations of volcanoes, piranhas, butterflies, others
-- begins in 1997.  Also that year, PBS will feature 6 new
Attenborough hour-length animal specials featuring wolves, polar
bears, chimpanzees.  Specials will be part of Nova and Nature
series.

     Also promoted at tour was new American Experience episodes,
including 3-hour biography Reagan, produced by WGBH-TV Boston, and
Great Performances presentation of Les Miserables in Concert.  Les
Miserables was recorded last year at Britain's Royal Albert Hall
and is scheduled to air during March pledge drive.

     Opening lunch on first day of TV critics tour in Pasadena Jan.
8 was hosted by PBS, featuring its 4-part miniseries "Savage
Skies," on the weather.  Unfortunately, blizzard out of East Coast
skies meant many of principals who were to appear to answer
reporters' questions were unable to get from N.Y. to Cal.  Series
is being produced by WNET N.Y.-Newark.  It premieres May 6 on PBS,
will be funded by Marsh & McLellen Cos.

     Public stations were up first at tour, and no money problems
for PTV were in evidence as many gifts and meals rivaled in quality
and quantity those given by commercial networks.  For example, each
reporter received 4 T-shirts promoting different PTV programs.

     Duggan took advantage of his appearance at tour to host Jan.
9 dinner in Bel Air for prominent figures in arts and creative
communities.  Among those attending were studio, corporate and
agency executives.  Dinner honored Beverly Sills, chmn. of N.Y.
Lincoln Center who appeared before critics earlier in day.

CPB AWARDS $8.4 MILLION FOR READY TO LEARN INITIATIVES

     CPB, in what it called "one of the most ambitious efforts to
date to harness the power of public television to teach," has
awarded $8.4 million to fund 2 new daily series for children and 2
accompanying weekly series for parents.  Programs, scheduled to
begin airing in 1997, also will include related online, print and
outreach components to get kids ready for school.  Shows, produced
by partnerships of Children's TV Workshop (CTW)-Columbia TriStar TV
Distribution and WGBH-TV Boston-Sirius Thinking, will join PBS-The
Ready to Learn Service (RTL) program lineup.

     Grants mark first time CPB has funded parent-oriented
programming under RTL and first time RTL has targeted parents with
specific shows.  Until now, RTL has included children's mainstays
Sesame St., Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, Barney & Friends, etc.  CPB
Pres. Richard Carlson called funding "a new vision for television,"
adding that it makes sense to give parents how-to TV when one
considers that each child spends average of more than 4,000 hours
in front of TV by time he or she starts kindergarten.  Carolynn
Reid-Wallace, CPB senior vp-education & programming, predicted that
new shows would become "signature shows and service" for RTL.

     CTW/CTTD partnership will use its $4.2-million grant to
jointly develop 40 episodes of Dragon Tales, animated musical show
designed for preschoolers, and 13 episodes of Show and Tell Me,
live-action series that teaches parents and caregivers how to
participate in their children's learning process.  CPB said Dragon
Tales takes place in "magical world of dragons," with characters
Max and his big sister Margarita, whose parents came to U.S. from
Latin America.  Children travel through storybook to Dragon Land
and journey with their friend Blaze and other "lovable dragons." 
CPB said Blaze will ask viewers to sing, whistle, make silly
sounds, laugh, cry, imitate musical instruments, do animal sounds. 
Show & Tell Me, which will have goal of reinforcing lessons in
Dragon Tales and other RTL shows, will feature celebrity guests,
hidden camera segments, people-on-the-street interviews.  CTW and
CTTD also will develop multimedia material to accompany series,
including on-air and radio interstitial programming, magazines,
internet applications.

     WGBH-TV/Sirius partnership also received $4.2 million for
development and production of 40 episodes of daily, half-hour
literacy series Between the Lions for 4-7-year-olds, and related
13-part weekly half-hour series, Kids & How to Grow Them, for
parents and caregivers.  Interactive Internet component also will
be developed.  CPB said Between the Lions is "first new show in
decades" to promote literacy and teach skills beginning readers
need to master.  Series covers reading, writing, listening and
speaking skills.  Main characters are lions Zazzu and Zig who guard
library doors and teach children about reading.  CPB said once
inside library, viewers are transported to "another dimension"
where books come to life.

     Funding for programs is based in part on recently-awarded
$7-million grant from Education Dept.'s National Early Childhood
Institute.  There currently are 44 stations participating in RTL,
which includes up to 9 hours per day of children's programming
daily.  Broadcast service is complemented by educational materials,
workshops, activity guides, books that reinforce programming's
messages.

QED COMMUNICATIONS HIRES FIRM TO LOBBY ON PTV STATION SALES
LEGISLATION

     QED Communications, parent of WQED Pittsburgh, has hired Dutko
& Assoc., Washington lobby firm, to lobby on legislation affecting
sale of public broadcasting station, QED Communications Pres.
George Miles confirmed.  He said public broadcaster hopes to
convince members of Congress and others that public licensees, WQED
sister station WQEX especially, should have option of using
secondary frequencies for commercial purposes.

     WQED doesn't have any specific new plans for secondary
Pittsburgh market station WQEX, and Miles said using it for
commercial purposes is just one avenue QED Communications is
exploring to raise money to escape $12-million debt.  Miles said he
was hired over year ago (PBR July 29/94 p3) to help station find
solutions to its financial difficulties.  He said QED
Communications is looking at possibility of selling its magazine
and/or other intellectual properties to work down debt.

     WQED is working alone "for the most part" to advance
legislation that would give public broadcasters more flexibility
with extra licenses, Miles said.  Other licensees, however,
including group of northern Va. stations headed by Gen. Mgr. Roger
McIntosh, have been working Capitol Hill looking to loosen
restrictions on uses of 2nd market stations.  Miles said lobby
effort is targeting "everyone... I'll even talk to you."  Rep.
Fields (R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., and Sen.
Pressler (R-S.D.), Senate Commerce Committee chmn., are expected to
draft CPB authorization legislation later this month that could
change way public broadcasters operate.

     While national organizations APTS, PBS, NPR and PRI have
lobbied for bill that would clear way for establishment of trust
fund designed to use leases and sales of excess system advanced TV
(ATV) capacity for financing, some stations have expressed
discomfort with idea of sacrificing their extra licenses for good
of system.  Some, like WQED, have said they believe they should be
free to use these licenses as they see fit to ensure their own
financial stability.  APTS, however, has said that its plan is only
one that would ensure PTV's continued universal availability and
that most stations, although uncertain at outset, have agreed to
support their plan.  Under national organizations' plan, only one
station in each market would make transition to ATV, and other
stations' frequencies would be leased or sold (yet to be
determined) to capitalize trust fund, which also would fund public
radio.

     Stations lobbying on own for legislation that would allow more
commercial enterprises, including advertising and sales/leases of
secondary stations, got boost recently when House Telecom
Subcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) told public broadcasting
representatives that he was considering "several ideas," and not
just one, to ensure continued funding for public broadcasting (PBR
Dec 29 p1).  He said he was doubtful public broadcasters would be
able to capitalize $4-billion trust fund through ATV leases/sales
alone.  Fields said if up to him, public broadcasters would have to
follow same rules as commercial counterparts, meaning they would
have to return NTSC spectrum soon after receiving ATV frequencies
and might have to participate in ATV spectrum auctions.  Fields'
staffers in recent months have indicated he is more open to
legislation that would allow stations to experiment with
revenue-raising ventures, including more commercial enterprises, as
long as funds raised are used to further public broadcasting
mission.

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said recently that staff-level
negotiations had rejected White House proposal for broadcasters'
early return of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum. 
Sources said no deal had been reached on spectrum issues as
high-level talks continued at White House.  They also said that
there would be "no giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final
budget deal.  Statement supported assertion by Senate Majority
Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who was reported by Reuters as objecting to
what he called "giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Rep. Fields
(R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., said recently that if
commercial broadcasters must bid in auctions for advanced TV (ATV)
spectrum, then so should public broadcasters.  He also said public
broadcasters wouldn't get any breaks -- if commercial TV stations
have to trade analog spectrum for digital, so should they.  Public
broadcasters have based their trust fund plan on having both analog
and digital spectrum for some time and on having flexibility on
when to switch to digital.  Most public broadcasters would have
difficulty funding equipment needed for ATV transition, and all but
largest producing stations probably would have trouble finding
money to take part in spectrum auctions.  Meanwhile, sources said
some published estimates of value of analog spectrum to be given
back after conversion of broadcasting services to digital have been
wildly exaggerated.  While some reports have put value of spectrum
as high as $70 billion, sources said figure is more in neighborhood
of $6 billion.  That amount, they said, wouldn't reflect costs to
society of having industry and consumers convert to new
technologies before either is ready.  Negotiators also rejected
White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to consumers to help
them adjust to conversion through purchase of set-top boxes. 
Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use technology that
market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit development of
ATV, Hill sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion to
determine whether ATV licenses should be awarded and what
conditions should be attached, including disposition of analog
spectrum.

     Contributions from state govts. and state universities and

     Contributions from state govts. and state universities and
colleges accounted for 23.8% of public broadcasting's FY 1994
income, CPB report said, up from 22.4% year earlier.  State govt.
contributions "varied greatly" from state to state, ranging from
zero to $23 million for PTV and zero to more than $3.6 million for
public radio.  Ga. gave more money, $30.4 million, to public
broadcasting than did any other state.  S.C. followed with $23.1
million, N.J. $14.7 million, N.Y. $14.5 million, Ky. $14 million. 
Alaska led states in support for public radio -- $3.6 million --
followed by Fla., $2.2 million;  N.Y., $1.9 million;  Wis., $1.6
million;  Ohio, $1.4 million.

Televisa, Azteca vie for viewers and ads as Mexican cable services take root

Playing host to a horde of new cable and satellite services carving out
their piece of the Latin American pie, Mexico's 12.5 million TV homes are
enjoying the fruits of competition.

TV already accounts for roughly 65% of total ad expenditure in Mexico, and
with a TV ad market forecast to grow by 15% in 1994 to $2.3 billion P as
large as Spain's P there would appear to be enough room to support the two
networks' ambitions as well as the new satellite arrivals.

Three months into its re-launch, Mexico's commercial network newcomer TV
Azteca is doing its best to give the reigning commercial giant Televisa a
run for its money.

Having secured the ailing state-owned TV network for $640 million last
summer, chairman Ricardo Salinas Pliego is out to put TV Azteca's national
networks 7 and 13 on the map.

Settling into its role as spoiler, Azteca recently re-jigged its program
lineup with a mix of U.S. imports and popular soaps. Azteca currently
produces 70% of its own material.

While Televisa commands 80% of Mexican audiences, Azteca's first major
challenge will be to attack Televisa's advertising dominance. Long
attacked for monopolistic practices, Televisa has for years attracted
major advertisers with its Plan Amigo. A variation on the
four-for-the-price-of-one French Plan, which necessitates buying a year's
worth of ads the pervious fall, Plan Amigo offers bonuses in exchange for
ad exclusivity. Televisa is under investigation by Mexico's Federal
Commission for Competition. Televisa reportedly stopped the Plan Amigo
last fall, but its agreements with major advertisers are guarded secrets.

Company boss Ricardo Salinas maintains that advertisers with TV Azteca are
reaching more people for their money. Comparing the revamped network's top
soap Marielena with Televisa's concurrent nightly newscast, 24 Horas, an
independent source showed a cost per rating point of $590 versus $1200
under Televisa's discount scheme. Launched a month ago, Marielena has
achieved a rating of 10.3% in Mexico City, compared with 16.2% for 24
Horas. Top Azteca shows thus offer 40 to 62% savings to advertisers.

Last November, Televisa subsequently pushed back the popular news show by
half an hour to 22:30. Tacitly admitting Marielena's success, Televisa
reasoned that at 22:00, viewers of the flagship Channel 2 would be less
likely to change to a Telemundo-produced soap if the popular half-hour
soap, Corazon Salvaje (formerly at 21:30) was still to come on Channel 2.

Azteca's other late evening soap, El Penon del Amaranto is not faring as
well. Early ratings after Azteca's October re-launch showed only 3.3% of
Mexico City homes watching P less than half the audience of Marielena
(8.1) and less than 10% of the rating of rival Televisa's 21:00 Valentina
(36.5). One of Azteca's top draws last year was La Cosa which airs Sunday
(22:00), attracting 13.8% of Mexico City homes, based on November figures,
compared with only 7.3% for Televisa's music show Noche de Valores on
Channel 2. And it's not just a battle among the terrestrial networks.
Conceding a lack of mass-appeal local product, an army of library-driven
channels rely on both premium and free-to-air American fare to lure
viewing in the 12.8% of homes with cable.

Against popular local shows on the terrestrial networks, the new satellite
service, Fox Latin America, is slotting its prime feature film fare as
well as drama series L.A. Law at 22:00. The satellite channel's top titles
in December included Home Alone, Come See the Paradise and Working Trash.

The new cable programmers concede that the Latin countries are very much
"developing" ones, and that subscription fees that will initially comprise
the bulk of revenues will be low. Fox, Tele-Uno and a slew of other
budding cable channels will increasingly compete for ad revenues to
support their admittedly risky ventures. Yet the pan-Latin American
advertising market remains relatively untested.

"Four years ago there were virtually no dedicated Mexican cable services;
today you can count 35 Spanish language channels available to cable
franchises...it's very competitive," says Ernesto Vargas, vice president
of MSO Multichannel and a partner in pan-Latin channels Tele-Uno and Cine
Canal. Vargas hopes to introduce a new, dedicated Mexican programming
channel by 1995. Tele-Uno, the 24-hour U.S. series channel which draws on
the big Worldvision catalog, is distributed via satellite throughout Latin
America, along with other entertainment newcomers, TNT Latin America, Cine
Canal, Gems TV, HBO Ole, and Cine Latino, which this month extends its
native Spanish service to the rest of Central America.

"Mexican product is clearly the most popular, the dominance of
[Televisa-owned] Channel 2 is proof of this," says Vargas. "Nevertheless,
Tele-Uno provides a good option. American comedy doesn't travel that well:
it's action and suspense that plays best after local shows," he says.
Vargas says Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place and The Heights are the
channel's most successful shows. According to Worldvision VP Bert Cohen,
such shows create an audience awareness which may cross over to its
back-catalog classic series.

Counterprogramming is key for the niche channels. "Multivision looks at
what we have in our catalog and tells us how to use it effectively," says
Cohen. r

Asian TV markets should continue to boom this year with China, Taiwan and
South Korea ahead, according to Zenith Media's latest forecast. In dollar
terms, Europe will see the biggest increases with Germany keeping up its
rapid post-deregulatory pace while Italy and the UK return to the robust
growth rates of the 1980s. France will continue to muddle through, despite
continued economic recession, while Spain remains European TV's sick man,
thanks to the price war waged by the major channels. Ad sales house IP
predicts that Italy should experience a severe advertising recession,
dropping 2% at current prices.

RTL-5 struggles to secure up-market niche

Dutch fledgling commercial station RTL-5 has denied that  its schedule
revamp this month, increasing prime time documentary output, is a direct
result of its failure to attract the more affluent, higher educated
viewer, although its audience is youthful, as originally planned.

Bert van der Veer, program manager for RTL-5 and RTL-4 said the current
programming schedule evolved out of a need to get the station up and
running quickly.

"We realized even before we started broadcasting with RTL-5 that there
were programs in the schedule that should be replaced as soon as possible.
We are trying to deliver an alternative and we will try to devote more
time to that aim. Don't forget, it took the UK's Channel 4 ten years to
get it right." Other innovations include an increase in news output with a
30-minute bulletin at 20:00 and sports news at 22:00.

RTL-5 has not yet reached its 10% share target. Thanks to an exceptional
football match on October 13 (which got a 31.8 rating), the channel's
share peaked during its second week at 11.8% and decrease to and
stabilized at just under 6% since (see chart).

Overall RTL-5's programming strategy looks like a half-success: though
RTL-5 has cannibalized its sister station RTL-4, the two CLT services now
take a higher combined share than the latter did alone previously. Apart
from RTL-4, the three public state channels of NOS and the cable stations
have seen a marginal erosion of their shares by RTL-5.

The mother of all quotas?

The French parliament has decided that the education channel to launch by
the end of 1994 should carry 100% French material. Although this may
contradict European treaties, it is debatable whether French producers
have enough quality programs in stock to supply the channel. For instance,
in France itself the general opinion is that the best available TV French
language courses are those of the BBC.

UK kids like TNT-Cartoon Network.

In cable and satellite homes, for the week ending November 28, the Turner
twin stations took a 5.7% share among children aged 4 to 13, ahead of The
Children's Channel (2.6%).

Nickelodeon, which was introduced at the same time as TNT-Cartoon last
September, has been slower to break through, claiming with a meager 1.5%
share. The fact that TNT-Cartoon is free-to-air rather than part of the
Sky pay package, has clearly helped its cause.

In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programs

In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programs
has been derided as "tele-basura" or television garbage byJthe critics,
but Tele 5's lowest common denominator approach has nonetheless produced
healthy ratings. Now industry insiders areJsaying that Antena 3's recent
surge in the ratings may force the stationJto re-think its strategy.

In October, Antena 3 once again bumped Tele 5 out of the number two spot.
The revamped Antena 3 invested millions in contracting big stars and
produced a number of its own situation comedies that have been huge hits
in Spain and Latin America.

Tele 5 is still feuding with Sofres, Spain's audienceJmeasuring service,
and refuses to acknowledge Sofres reports putting Antena 3 ahead, despite
an independent audit confirming Sofres' data.

A spokesman for Tele5 says there are noJmajor programming changes planned.
Drastic changes could be premature as AntenaJ3 growth has come primarily
at the expense of TVE 1 and Spain's other public stations, while Tele 5
audience share has held steady at around 21%.

But industry insiders say that Tele 5 may haveJto re-group if Antena 3
continues its surge. Following Antena 3's lead, Tele 5 will have five new
series in production during the coming year.

Italian animation rises

Thanks to data supplied by Carat, RAP produces a series of indices on
European advertising. For each of five markets, the index refers to gross
TV revenue in the latest month available compared to a year earlier. The
RAP composite index estimates European TV ad revenue during the last
twelve months compared to 1992. Together, the five countries represent
over 75% of the total European market. Spain is excluded because high
discount levels make monthly expenditure estimates unreliable.

Italy airs well over 2,000 hours of animated programming a year, but local
producers are only responsible for a fraction of the output. Children's
programming, and animation in particular, has increased steadily over the
last five years, though the domestic production sector does not look to
share in the spoils.

Speaking at a recent conference of Italian animation producers, Alfio
Bastiancich, secretary of the Associazione Italiana Film di Animazione said
Italian producers account for only 3% of animated broadcasts on the public and
commercial channels.

Still blessed with "favored growing market" status among program
prospectors, the Asia-Pacific region promises double digit growth in TV
advertising in 1994.

Aggregate TV ad spend across the 14-country region only accounted for .85%
of GDP in 1992 (.23% in China), but 1993 witnessed a 10.6% increase in
overall advertising. With per capita GDPs on the rise, and an increasing
number of channel choices, the region is hungry for product as
opportunities for barter syndication grow. Politics permitting, China may
be on the fastest growth of all, with 9% GDP growth forecast for 1994 and
1993 TV ad expenditure of $662 million, expanding by 45% in 1994.

New laws for Spanish ads

The Spanish government's adoption of the EU "Television Without Frontiers"
legislation has sent Spain's television stations scrambling to discuss
future ad rates now that advertising will be reduced.

After the Spanish government agreed to mandate a minimum of 20 minutes
between commercial breaks, senior Spanish TV officials held a preliminary
meeting to establish new rates with less discounting. Even though rates
will likely go up, many ad agencies are pleased as currently commercials
get lost in frequent, lengthy breaks.

Holland's daytime debut

Dutch public television this month begins broadcasting a daily Dutch soap.
Top Dutch independent producer, JE Entertainment, will produce On The Road
To Tomorrow -- based on U.S. soap Ryan's Hope -- for the ailing public
network Nederland 2.

The soap will mark an unprecedented collaboration between Veronica, TROS
and EO, the three broadcasters sharing airtime on Nederland 2. They will
amend their schedules so the show can be aired horizontally.

The soap will be shown ahead of satellite station RTL-4's ratings-winner
Goede Tijden Slechte Tijder. The soap is one of RTL-4's most successful
shows with ratings of up to 18%.

EU directive:  A blessing in disguise?

While French producers enjoyed their moment in the world political and
economic spotlight last month, it turns out part of their fortress was
more a Trojan Horse.

The main target of U.S. negotiators at the GATT talks on the TV front was
the EU's 1989 "Television Without Frontiers" directive which requires that
European originated programming comprise the majority of broadcasters'
schedules. But in fact the finer print of the directive may harbor a
silver lining for U.S. distributors and new channels.

To back its ban of TNT-Cartoon Network on cable last September, the French
government claimed it was only acting to uphold the directive. But,
according to an undisclosed legal opinion last summer by the European
Commission, it seems Brussels takes a radically different view of the
underlying issue. The paper, obtained by French broadcast researcher
Jean-Pierre Jezequel, is the text of the EC ruling banning TF1 from
creating a split of its service aimed at Belgian audiences. In an article
to appear in the monthly Angle Droit, Jezequel points out that the ruling
supports all the claims of Turner against the French government.
Specifically, the Commission's interpretation of European law says:

The directive forbids "all controls on broadcast services coming from
another member-state, a fortiori any kind of licensing requirements;"
however, the French have been insisting that each channel seeking
distribution in France get a CSA 'convention.'

If a broadcast service respects the regulation of its country of origin,
it need not be re-licensed elsewhere.

Furthermore, to clarify the directive, the Commission cites article 59 of
the Treaty of Rome (about the free flow of services through the EU), which
grants no special 'cultural' status to television.

If Turner decided to sue the French government and the CSA, it would have
its view supported by Brussels, concludes Mr. Jezequel. The only legal
avenue left for the French to stop Turner would be to sue the UK in the
European Court to force it to apply the directive. But here the law must
give way to politics. Thus the directive, widely criticized by U.S. rights
owners, could be a strong help to U.S. channels trying to penetrate the
European market. The 50% quota is restricted by the mention "when
practicable" and does not even apply to a whole range of programming such
as news, music and sports. Provided they find a host state, one could
argue that the new channels have a legal protection against other foreign
governments in Europe stronger than anywhere else in the world. r

Quota-resilient and economically sound, the ever-ready game show is
enjoying a renaissance on the world's airwaves. But beyond the fanfare,
glitz and prize money lurks a solid market vehicle: game shows are cheap
to produce, draw solid early evening viewing shares and can be readily
adapted to almost any culture.

Abiding by the programmers axiom that 'local plays best,' game show
formats have carved an enviable place in international TV trade. Game show
vendors are confident that their shows are the only geographically
transparent TV formats. TV bargain hunters learned early-on the value of
unlimited supply, long runs and audience loyalty. Game shows also offer an
ideal platform for sponsorship and barter.

Most frequently "co-produced" or rather "adapted," game shows are unique
among U.S. derived product in that they are rarely exported in their
original form. Beyond their ability to secure the daytime or traditional
housewife viewer, game shows' true value lies in its local adaptability.

For young, cash-strapped networks, game shows are a stalwart of the
schedule, both mornings, late afternoons and sometimes even prime time. As
much as 10% of some schedules are devoted to some form of audience
participation quiz shows and glamor games.

In the U.S., familiar game shows have been around for two generations and
remain popular. The new syndicated 30-minute version of The Price is
Right, a show originally launched three decades ago, proving that the
format is is one of TV's enduring classics. When those shows were
introduced to European audiences in the wake of 1980s TV deregulation,
pundits said such crass commercial exports could never repeat their home
grown successes and that their novel popularity would fade.

But they proved wrong. As in the U.S., game shows have established
themselves as Europe's most constant genre. In Spain, Italy, France and
Germany the Wheel of Fortune, Price is Right and Pyramid are now solid
rating busters for the dominant channels, scheduled mostly in late morning
or early evening slots.

But not just any game will play. The formula may seem simple to produce,
but getting the chemistry right is not easy, which is largely why U.S.
formats dominate long running games (5-7 episodes per week). Fremantle
International has foreign production subsidiaries in the UK, Spain,
Canada, Portugal, Greece, Australia, and Turkey and controls over 50% of
global game show distribution.

Owned 80% by The Interpublic group, Fremantle also is well-positioned to
exploit cash plus barter arrangements with international product groups
and clients such as Unilever. Thanks to barter, Fremantle has launched no
fewer than nine shows in fast-deregulating Turkey during the last two
years. Similar approaches are on tap for central and eastern European
markets.

"Nobody can re-invent the wheel," says Fremantle president and CEO Paul
Talbot who maintains that the basic types of games were invented in the
1950s in the United States. This view is shared by Michael and Roger King
of syndicator King World, which distributes only two game shows, Jeopardy
and The Wheel of Fortune, and admitted recently that they have looked in
vain for similarly strong product. King World has sold its two shows in
all major markets, often with Fremantle as a producer, since Talbot has
secured production rights for both shows across western Europe. Fremantle
International has 64 game shows running in 17 countries.

Europe's commercial networks tend to stick with proven formats, but
producers are anxious to develop their own shows. According to a program
database compiled by French consultancy INA, most shows are adaptations.
But European networks do experiment with new game concepts often based on
board games, but few survive more than a season, and almost none manages
to sell across borders. One of the few examples of a successful long
running home grown show is Des Chiffres et des Lettres, a word and
mathematics game broadcast on France 2 since the 1970s, and now
reformatted with some success by Channel 4 in the UK, VTM in Belgium and
La2 in Spain. According to France 2, the show has even recently aroused
some interest from U.S. buyers. Game shows could easily find themselves at
the forefront of new interactive TV capabilities. With Twentieth Century
Fox's upcoming multi-million dollar adventure game format Scavengers, the
game show will meet "techno-reality" drama. With a set in London,
Scavengers' European co-production partners will shoot their own versions
out of the same production facility. European producers have more success
with 'near game show' formats. These "entertainment" shows usually run on
a weekly basis, and are a mix of music, dance or even sports contests.
Such quasi-game shows are the way of the future and are a distinctly
European modification of the genre. One of the few successful purveyors of
European produced game show formats, French producer Jacques Antoine has
created 'adventure game shows,' expensive 90-minute monthly programs which
often feature sports contests in exotic places. Among his most recent
products, Fort Boyard has penetrated Scandinavia, where the show is
modified to local tastes although it is actually shot in France. But
Antoine has yet to come up with a five-days-a-week competitor to the U.S.
shows.

The economics of game shows are simple. The price broadcasters pay for a
show in the major markets depends largely on its potential audience; thus,
a show for an access slot is more expensive than one for daytime. In
France, industry sources reveal that TF1 used to pay up to $26,000 per
episode for its access shows (which it moved in 1992 to daytime) and pays
now up to $22,000. Shows on rival France 2 aired at lunch time are
estimated at up to $20,000.

Broadcasters' revenue for the same shows can vary considerably. Wheel of
Fortune, on TF1 at 11:50 a.m., carries a single break from which it
grosses about $60,000, on top of the show's two sponsorship contributions
(estimated at $20,000). The Price is Right can gross over $200,000 per
day. In Germany, according to data supplied by the advertising agency
Saatchi & Saatchi, in 1992 the Wheel of Fortune on average grossed
$600,000 per episode, in part due to its 19:20 time slot.

Game shows offer considerable financing and scheduling flexibility. In
Spain, where TV ad regulations are lax, there are few curbs on product
placement or sponsorship. Contestants' desks can be huge soap boxes with
the brand name displayed continuously, something unthinkable elsewhere in
Europe. Program duration can also be changed. Due to popularity with
advertisers, The Price is Right on Canale 5 in Italy, which started as a
half-hour program, was extended to one hour and even to two hours, before
settling back to one hour.

France Television has been running 90-minute prime time specials of its
two Grundy shows, Everybody's Equal and Going For Gold, which regularly
top the ratings of their respective channels, France 2 and 3. The latest
special on France 3 lifted the channel's share to 24%, above its average
of 15%. Fremantle typically acts as domestic producer of its shows
operating through a local production subsidiary. Last year the company
opened a game "factory" near Cologne in Germany and has subsidiaries in
seven other countries outside the U.S. Where there is no local corporate
affiliate, Fremantle acts as co-producer with a broadcaster or local
production company and takes up 40-70% of the profits, according to
outside estimates.

Most recently, Fremantle has extended its Latin American operations,
concluding a co-production deal with Brazil's TV Bandeirantes for
Supermarket Sweep and $25,000 Pyramid. Fremantle also inked deals for
local versions of Let's Make a Deal and Swap Meet, with Ecuador's
Ecuavisa. The only places where shows are sold in their original format
are very small markets. Grundy, the only would-be global rival to
Fremantle, is the producer of all its shows, though sometimes with a local
partner.

Paul Guilbert, who oversees foreign licensees' production of King World
distributed shows, insists on close control over such local versions.
Typically, major deviations from the guidelines only occur after
considerable argument with the original producers/distributors.

Despite the dominance of Fremantle and King World formats circulating in most
major markets, there remains considerable room for growth. The emerging
syndication market and new cable services are hungry for product.

Game shows are not suitable for every channel. "Second tier"
entertainment-led stations such as M6 in France and Pro 7 in Germany and
RTL 5 in Holland have avoided game shows, counterprogramming late
afternoon time slots to garner the valuable young adult or urban
demographic, often with U.S. series and sit-coms. But other relatively
small stations do carry game shows, like Sky One in the UK. In France,
TMC, a national cable and satellite service, has just introduced an
original format, Vitamime, produced by Canal+'s Ellipse.

Some mainline European networks are reluctant to overload their schedules
with "down market" stripped game shows. ITV scheduling executive David
Brenan, points out that, apart from the channel's traditional weekday game
show at 9.30 a.m., his quiz shows tend to appear once a week and to get
renewed regularly. "We look for new ideas all the time," says Brenan,
"usually, foreign formats would be proposed to the network through
independent UK producers."r

U.S. stripped formats dominate

In Germany, the vast majority of game shows are on the two leading private
stations RTL and SAT1 (although the number one, Dating Game, is on public
channel ARD) and all the daily shows within the top ten are produced by
Fremantle's German subsidiary. Strassenflirt is more of an entertainment
show than a quiz show. 5 Mal 5 is an adaptation from a Dutch word game
developed by IDTV and public broadcaster Vara where male and female teams
face each other. Few games, but prime time slots

The UK's ITV strips only one game show, Fremantle's Supermarket Sweep, in
mid morning, a traditional game show slot in which the ITV frequently
rotates game titles. This is one reason why The Price is Right (which was
doing well) and Wheel of Fortune (which did not do well) have been dropped
by ITV after a few seasons. The Channel 4 and BBC game shows tend to
emphasize knowledge contests, such as in Countdown, a France 2 format, or
Going for Gold from Grundy.

The game-variety cocktail

Italians have a penchant for long shows mixing interviews, music and game
sequences, of which Il Grande Gioco is a perfect example This genre can
easily be used either in access or in prime time. Canale 5, part of the
Fininvest group, devotes the highest proportion of its schedule to game
shows in Europe, behind Spain's Tele 5 (also part of the Fininvest group).
Canale 5 also strips most of its game shows, while public Rai channels
tend to carry weekly shows, the exception being Venti e Venti on Raidue
where viewers play a word game through the phone.

NewsrapI Viva, the first German music channel, launched on Christmas eve

NewsrapI Viva, the first German music channel, launched on Christmas eve
in 18 million homes. On top of the expected diet of pop music videos (50%
of them domestic), Viva carries reports on the environment, education,
sports and leisure activities, plus music news. Some regional regulatory
bodies have expressed concerns over the possible use of the channel by its
shareholders, four major music publishers, as a promotion tool.

The channel faces a tough battle in a market where MTV Europe is already
active. To increase its ad sales in Germany, MTV has launched a new
satellite feed allowing commercials in German to be fed to its 12 million
cable homes there.

Prices paid by the French channels for feature films can vary widely.
According to a report in Ecran Total, a French trade weekly, the rights to
La Soupe aux choux for different periods were bought for FFr1.5 million by
La Cinq, FFr180,000 by France 2, and FFr1 million by M6. The top prices
were paid by TF1 at Ffr8 million for hits such as L'Ours or Indiana Jones.
Canal+, as a pay service, can spend 50% more for top rated films.

Germany's RTL Television has ordered a third series of 230 episodes of
Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten (Bad Times, Good Times) from Grundy/Ufa TV
Productions. The soap is an adaptation of a format originally developed in
Australia as The Restless Years ten years ago, and first introduced in
Europe as a Dutch series for RTL-4. In Germany, the afternoon soap
recorded its best rating ever with 7.3 (5 million viewers) on October 18.

AsiaNet, the 20-year old American Asian programming service, is launching
a UK cable version. It competes head on with existing UK services
Asiavision and Namaste.

Loft, Argentina's Canal 13's new talk and variety show, has generated
higher press coverage than ratings. All 17 episodes were shot expensively
in Miami to get an original feel that would suit the eccentric host, Nico
Repetto, but Canal 13 was expecting Loft would get more than the 800,000
viewers it averaged last fall.

TV says ad clutter is not a problem. According to research sponsored by
the British network, the presence of program trailers in advertising
breaks has no significant consequence on viewing behavior for terrestrial
channels. Moreover, viewers seem to appreciate them. However, when they go
over five minutes, viewers tend to switch channels. Researchers also found
that viewers are twice as likely to zap away during end credits than
during trailers. As a result ITV is to ask producers to reduce credits.

No second advertising break will be allowed during fiction programs, under
the French broadcasting bill introduced last month. This hurts M6 which
relies heavily on TV movies in prime time.

Blazing its own trail in Asia, Grundy International Distribution recently
concluded its first program deal in China, selling police drama series
Bellamy to regional broadcaster Shanghai TV (STV). Grundy earlier
completed a multi million dollar deal with Hong Kong's Star TV for the
popular Australian soap, Neighbours.

launch pad

Paradise Beach the half hour teenage series was moved to prime time for
the Australian summer season on its home channel, Nine Network.
Distributed by New World International, the show launched on TRT in Turkey
in December and should be introduced in Germany by RTL in March, taking to
14 the number of countries where it is broadcast.

Grundy Worldwide and Telepictures Production (a Time Warner subsidiary)
are to produce for BBC1 a British version of the U.S. factual
entertainment series How'd They Do That, broadcast on CBS in 1993. The
show should be scheduled this winter.

TF1 introduced on December 20 Les Filles (The Girls) at 18.30, moving the
successful Helene et les Garcons to 18.00, while Premiers Baisers is
suspended, but should return later on. These daily sitcoms, plus Le Miel
et les Abeilles (weekly) are produced by AB Productions, the biggest
program supplier to TF1 with an average of 15.5 hours per week.

Canale5 premiered in December the second series of Dona d'onore (Birds of
Violence), a Berlusconi-Tribune Entertainement-Beta title. The first
episode had 6.0 million viewers and a 22.7% share.

Gaumont Television's Highlander series has been doing fairly well on TF1
and Italia Uno since introduced last fall. In France, on Wednesdays at
13.30, the show's rating for December 8 was 13.4 with a 44% share. In
Italy, Highlander was on Sunday evenings at 20.40 and raised Italia Uno's
share in the slot from 10% to 13%. On the U.S. syndication market
Highlander averages a 4.2 rating.

SeaQuest DSV is to launch on RTL on January 19. The pilot did well on ITV
on October 16 with a 15.4 rating, the highest viewing figure in the UK for
a U.S. series during the month.

Fiction programming continues to make inroads onto European prime time. It

Fiction programming continues to make inroads onto European prime time. It
is no surprise that domestic shows take top ratings. In import-wary
France, TV movie L'instit, allowed France 2 to beat its close rival TF1
for the month's top show.

Feature films occupy the upper echelons of U.S. rankings, and are by far
the most important U.S. genre in prime time in Europe. U.S. series are
typically scheduled before or after viewing peaks, except on the second
tier commercial stations like Pro7, M6 or Channel 4, which do not generate
high enough ratings to figure in those top tens.

In Germany ZDF 's Wetten Das...?, a mix of debates and contests, maintains
its position as the country's top rated show in October. A French
adaptation failed on TF1 last winter, but the format could still be
considered for other territories.

In Sydney (Australians ratings are only available on a market-by-market
basis) U.S. sitcom Home Improvement is having a strong run on the Seven
Network. Created by the same team that produced Roseanne and The Cosby
Show, two of the top rated U.S. series worldwide, it could expect an
equally strong international run.

In the UK, Coronation Street has been topping the ratings for years and it
is one of the main assets of its producer, Granada Television. In revenue
and audience share, Germany remains the most fluid market. RTL 2 has
confirmed its success against all the other "small" cable channels it is
competing with. The big loser is VOX which announced budget cuts and
redundancies in December.

On October 13 soccer matches took place around Europe for qualification to
the 1994 World Cup. The games made it into the top 10s in each European
market, but the qualifying round is now over and interest will be lower
until the finals next summer.

Channel 4: UK maverick re-writes program rules

Channel 4 occupies a unique position among Europe's and even the world's
commercial channels. By law, a "self-governing statutory corporation,"
Channel 4 programs an eclectic variety of both high-brow documentaries and
innovative drama, which are largely financed by the ratings success of
unabashedly commercial U.S. imports.

The channel has carved a niche for itself in the UK, and is confident that
its programming mix will be resilient in a fast-expanding, competitive
multichannel marketplace.

Albeit a mandated "minority broadcaster" -- it must devote its airtime to
alternative programming, a range of artistic, political or otherwise
"challenging" formats and genres -- Channel 4's annual revenues are 100%
commercial. With annual ad revenue of #306 million ($456 million, 1993
estimates) Britain's fourth terrestrial service is a strong magnet for the
upmarket viewer who would otherwise be tuned to ad-free BBC2.

Far from letting its quasi-governmental status keep its programming
strategy rooted in didactic fare, Channel 4, a primary patron of the
independent production sector, has taken the offensive, and come away with
sizable gains in numerous time periods.

On January 1 Channel 4 celebrated its first year unleashed from its foster
parents, the ITV network. The ten year old channel now sells its own ad
time and buys its own programming separate from the ITV network center:
the result is a clear ratings and advertising success.

"Basically, the audience we get with American programs allows us to
develop innovative, non-mainstream shows," says Caroline Thomson, head of
corporate affairs at Channel 4.

The channel actually airs the largest percentage of U.S. material on UK
terrestrial TV. Much of it is cult, such as off-beat theatrical films, as
well as the higher end of available U.S. drama and comedy, including NYPD
Blue, which makes its winter schedule debut and is intended to bolster
Channel 4's admittedly weak Saturday evening.

Last fall, Channel 4 scored its highest marks with the domestic soap
"Brookside," delivering a total of 6.16 million viewers (w/e Nov 28) for
its highest rated episode (each of the three episodes is screened twice a
week).

Overall, Channel 4 ran 2,037 hours of acquired programs in 1992, 48% of
which were first run. Although non-feature U.S. shows accounted for only
41% of total airtime devoted to acquisitions, their cost represented 52%
of the #14.5 million spent. On top of this figure, #8.9 million was spent
on acquired feature films (the channel also produces about ten films of
its own every year).

Although acquisitions represented 45% of the 1992 schedule, they accounted
for only 12% of the total programming expenses of #200 million. Resisting
pressure to go downmarket for the maximum share, Channel 4 remains
faithful to its remit. There is a safety net, however: a sophisticated
arrangement set up by the 1990 Broadcasting Act requires cross-subsidies
with ITV if Channel 4's share of ad revenue falls or rises too much.

Provided the channel maintains an audience share at or over 9%, its
current program orientation won't likely be questioned. Thanks to the rise
in the station's market share and an overall acceleration in UK TV
advertising expenditure growth (see page 1), Channel 4 saw a handsome
windfall in revenues which grew by an estimated 22% in 1993 to #306
million. After a drop to #184 million in 1993, the program budget should
be back to its 1992 level of #200 million in 1994.

According to Thomson, this should allow a little breathing space for
production budgets, which had been squeezed by the recession. U.S. shows
should remain relatively inexpensive, as competition with the BBC and ITV
is marginal. "A U.S. series cannot keep its slot on ITV with six million
viewers, while it's a hit on Channel 4 with four million," Thomson says.

The growth of satellite service Sky One has somewhat inflated prices, but
the two channels rarely go head-to-head in programming. Sky mainstays such
as Star Trek and Beverly Hills 90210 would not be suitable for Channel 4
according to Thomson.

Perhaps Channel 4's greatest coup has been the huge success of its
renegade, youth-oriented morning show, The Big Breakfast. Introduced in
October 1992, the show has drawn large chunks of audience away from
struggling GMTV, the new ITV morning licensee. In September 1992, Channel
4's 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. audience share was 4%, in November 1993 it had jumped
to 30% while ITV's had slipped from 53% to 43%. In the younger age groups
the show has even a bigger lead. Alone, The Big Breakfast is responsible
for 20% of the channel's ad sales. The fast-paced, irreverent show is
indicative of Channel 4's role as innovator in the UK marketplace.

ONLINE GAMBLING HITS THE WEB
Is Internet Casinos' Cyberspace Venture
A Crapshoot for Internet Commerce?

      Internet Casinos Inc. soon will be stretching
the bounds of the Internet, and in the process raising
serious questions about how federal and state gambling
and tax laws apply to cyberspace.

      From a casino based in the Dutch Caribbean
island of St. Martin, the company plans to launch an
online gambling hall, styled after traditional
casinos, on the Web in mid-May.  The site will offer
keno, blackjack, roulette, backgammon, animated horse
racing, more than 30 different slot machines and a
variety of other games of chance.

      The regulatory quandary is that the online
community will play with - and win - real money.
Internet Casinos will require players to send a
minimum of $50 to the offshore casino, and the online
gambler then will receive an account and password for
gambling.  Winnings then can be wired back to the
player within 48 hours, or can be deposited back into
the offshore account to earn interest and serve as
holdings for future gaming.

      While it may sound like a dubious proposition
that few would attempt blind, about 1,500 online users
have preregistered for the site since it first went up
a week ago, said Internet Casinos President Warren
Eugene.

      "We feel that the 'net community is capable of
looking after themselves," Eugene said.  "This is a
First Amendment issue."

      The casino's virtual doors will open May 15, but
no money will be accepted until one week before the
launch, Eugene said.  The company already has $1.2
million to bankroll the Web casino, with a $1 million
line of credit available, he said.  To keep the casino
fluid until it builds a solid cash reserve, bets are
kept to a $500 maximum, although the minimum goes as
low as 5 cents for the slot machines.

      Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard and
cashier's check, Eugene said, adding that the company
is in discussions with both DigiCash BV and CyberCash
Inc. about adding their online payment capabilities.

New Dimension Because of Location

      While issues of local control in cyberspace have
been raised before, most notably when states try to
prosecute the placement of pornography online, the
Internet Casinos venture raises questions of law and
tax liability because of its location outside this
country.

      Online gambling networks such as the systems
being marketed by subsidiaries of Interactive Network
Inc. and NTN Communications Inc. are restricted by
laws in different states that govern what types of
betting can be conducted from the home or designated
locations.  Because Internet Casinos is located
outside the United States, at-home wagering laws and
age restrictions technically may not apply to the Web
site.  "We're being very cautious about not violating
international laws," Eugene said.

      The odds of this system going online without
challenges are slim, since there is no way for the
company to monitor the age of potential gamblers and
many state governments have retained tight
restrictions on gambling.  But there may not be much
that the federal or state governments can do to
prevent the online gambling.

FBI to Make Statement on Online Gambling

      The Federal Bureau of Investigation soon will
make an announcement relating to online gambling
issues, and would not comment for this article until
after the announcement is made.

      Aside from state concerns over gambling, the
federal government also has a stake in this type of
offshore venture.  Gambling revenues are taxable
income, but if cyber-winnings from Internet Casinos
can be kept in the foreign bank, the government may
have a difficult time taxing these funds.

      Eugene insists the venture is legitimate, and he
is publishing the algorithms and codes used for the
games for users to verify the slots are not "rigged."
Interactive Casinos will spot-check the system to
ensure it is not tampered with, he said.

      Internet Casinos can be reached at (416)
444-8835.

OPEN MARKET TO RELEASE COMPETITOR TO NETSCAPE
Will Use Multiple Security Schemes

      Open Market Inc. made multiple moves to
re-establish itself in the quickly crowding market for
Internet commerce solutions, announcing a host of new
software products and services and a relationship with
First Union Corp. to bring its customers onto the
Internet.

      Among the new products is a secure World Wide
Web server aimed at supplanting Netscape
Communications Corp.'s early lead in providing the
basis tools to companies that want to sell on the Web.

Moving Into Service-Oriented Business

      The broad suite of products launches Open Market
out of its first phase, which consisted of hosting
information vendors in an online marketplace, into a
new service- and tool-oriented business.  At the
center of this business is the Open Market Secure
WebServer product that distinguishes itself from
Netscape's Netsite Commerce Server and Spry Inc.'s
forthcoming SafetyWeb by supporting the two leading
security protocols - Netscape's Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) and the secure hypertext transfer protocol
(S-HTTP) supported by most other Web developers - in
one package, giving it maximum possible exposure to
Web users.

      Netscape has taken an early lead by establishing
its Navigator Web browser as the largest in use.  But
even with a current estimated 77 percent of the
browser market, Netscape has no guarantee it will
continue to dominate.  As quickly as it took the lead,
it could be supplanted by a newer, niftier product.

      The majority of other Web browser makers are
licensees of Spyglass Inc., (the master licensor for
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
[NCSA], which developed Mosaic) and Spyglass is firmly
behind S-HTTP.

      Although Netsite will build S-HTTP into future
versions of its secure products (REC, March 7, p. 1)
the time frame for integration is uncertain.  Open
Market, by supporting both standards, suddenly looks
like the server of choice for companies that want to
do business now with the whole Web and not wait to see
what Netscape does.  Although Open Market will license
SSL from Netscape, terms of the arrangement were not
available.  Netscape has stated that it intends to
offer the technology to all comers for a one-time
licensing fee.

      The release of tools is directed at larger
companies with  established brands who don't want an
intermediary between themselves and their
audience/customers.  One of the first adopters of
Secure WebServer is Time Inc., which is migrating its
popular Pathfinder Web site to Open Market's software.
Time plans to begin charging for subscriptions to its
online magazines and services in the next few months.

      "These new products allow companies to do
business over the World Wide Web on their own terms,"
said Shikhar Ghosh, chief executive of Open Market.
"They support electronic commerce in a way that
transcends mere transactions by supporting ongoing
customer relationships and the creation of brand
identity."

      Other adopters of Open Market's server include
Lexis-Nexis and the Copyright Clearance Center.  Both
companies are using the software for Lexis-Nexis'
Information Marketplace project to sell copyrighted
material over the Internet while ensuring that holders
of intellectual property receive full compensation for
their work.

Rebuilt Server Technology From Ground Up

      Like Netscape, Open Market says it has rebuilt
the server technology from the ground up.  The company
claims both faster performance and support for as many
as 1,000 simultaneous users.

      "The Open Market WebServers are not derivatives
of freeware server implementations," Robert
Weinberger, Open Market's vice president of marketing,
said.  "They have been architected from scratch to
achieve the highest levels of performance,
functionality and interoperability."

      This is especially important as security gaps
and faults are turning up in the HTTP implementations
available as freeware from NCSA and CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics.  The Computer
Emergency Response Team, the quasi-public Internet
security patrol that tracks developing problems with
the network's integrity and keeps records of attacks
on sites, issued a warning in February that sections
of the public domain server software are inherently
insecure and could allow malevolent  hackers access to
a company's entire system through the Web server
holes.

Secure Link to Transaction System

      Unlike Netscape, however, Open Market also will
market a full system to enable transactions, including
a back office connection to a transaction network to
process credit card charges.  The separate module,
called the Commerce Connection, establishes a secure
link to Open Market's existing transaction system to
process orders in real time.  Open Market also will
provide billing services if necessary.

      In an agreement with First Union Corp., the
server software will be used to host an online mall
for as many of the bank's 35,000 merchant accounts as
choose to develop an online presence.  First Union
also will try to encourage its account holders to use
the system to access their account information and
will move quickly to get every department in the
Richmond, Va., bank to use the Internet to reach and
service customers.

      The Secure WebServer will be demonstrated
publicly at the Internet World trade show in San Jose,
Calif., April 10-13 and should be available
commercially by the end of April.

      It will sell for $4,995, but carry a mandatory
annual service charge of $1,995.  Commerce Connection
will retail for $2,495 and also carry an annual
service charge of $1,995.  Open Market is selling an
unsecure version of its WebServer for $1,495.
Security can be added to that product using a $3,995
Security Module.

CompuServe BUYS SPRY FOR $100M
Everyone Has A Browser; What Next?

By Nate Zelnick
Associate Editor

      Now that CompuServe Inc. and Spry Inc. have
agreed to tie the knot - with the online service
paying a hefty $100 million dowry for its new mate -
links between the top consumer online services and the
World Wide Web are nearing completion.  All that
remains is dealing with the hangover after the
cheerful reception and, of course, paying all the
bills.

      One particularly knotty question is how the
online services will deal with secure access to Web
sites that plan to sell goods and services through
secure connections with consumers.  CompuServe
Information Services' (CIS) customers will use Spry
technology, which supports only the secure hypertext
transfer protocol (S-HTTP), while Prodigy Services Co.
and Delphi Internet Services Inc. have licensed
Netscape Communications Corp.'s technology and - in
the short term - will use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
only.

      The number of users coming in from the consumer
online services likely will double the total number of
Web-capable users in the United States alone.  While
server and browser makers are moving quickly to expand
their secure transactions offering to all available
customers on all platforms, the consumer online
companies have had to recast themselves to match the
pace of technical innovation on the Internet.

Adding 'Access' Like Jumping on Train

      The primary problem is that Internet
applications such as the Web are not static features
that can be added to an existing system; adding
"access" to it is like trying to board a moving train.
Web software developers are struggling to upgrade the
presentation and application interfaces of servers and
browsers.  Netscape's proprietary extensions, which
add everything from the silly and annoying "blink"
feature that flashes lines of text on a page to the
long-needed image adjustments that allow developers to
wrap text around a picture or present text in columns,
are a contentious issue for other developers who
resent Netscape's moves to add to hypertext markup
language (HTML) without first consulting the standards
bodies.

      In the face of this problem, CompuServe's
decision to buy Spry - even at what seems an extremely
high premium - makes good business sense.  Compared to
America Online Inc.'s $35 million purchase of
BookLink, an untested company with only one product
(which never was tested in the market), Spry's price
was a bargain.

      CompuServe and Spry are a match made in heaven.
CompuServe is buying a fully operational company with
lots of products in the marketplace and consistent
black ink on its balance sheets.  Privately held Spry
generated $16 million in revenue last year and, based
on annualized projections of first-quarter earnings,
was expected to make more than $40 million this year.

      Even more important is the ever-elusive synergy
so often cited in mergers and acquisitions.  In this
case it may be real.  Spry and CompuServe both have
impressive credentials in the corporate arena.  Not
only is CompuServe the business favorite because of
the rich databases of CIS, but its Network Services
division provides private dial-up facilities for Visa
International Inc.'s network and other big businesses.

      Spry's AIR series of transmission control
protocols/Internet protocols (TCP/IP) connectivity
tools and the recently released Internet Office suite
of internetwork applications are corporate favorites
for building private and public Internet links.  The
company also launched an aggressive plan to market its
turnkey Internet access software packages, Internet in
a Box and Mosaic in a Box, to corporations wishing to
use the Web as a communications medium to reach their
customer base.  General Electric Co.'s plastics
division was the first big company on board (REC, Dec.
13, 1994, p. 9).

      Spry President David Pool - who personally will
pocket between $20 million and $30 million in the
purchase of the privately held company - told REC in
December that Spry planned to develop deals with all
comers.

      "We want to ship a disk with every refrigerator
so that  customers can just pop it into their
computers and reach the manufacturer's Web site," he
said.  Under the original plan, Spry would pay a
bounty for every customer a third-party company
brought onto the Internet using Spry software.  Pool
said the company plans to continue this venture using
CompuServe's network as the primary carrier.

      The use of the network will be the key
competitive change in Spry's business.  In the initial
release of Internet in a Box, Sprint Corp.'s
SprintLink network was the primary carrier and charged
an exorbitant $8 per hour to connect to Spry's wholly
owned access provider InterServ (although users could
connect to any point-to-point protocol [PPP)
provider).  Pricing for the network connections will
be announced April 11 at Internet World in San Jose,
Calif.

      Spry also brings to the table its other
"affiliated companies," Free Range Media and NovX,
both of which were brought back into the company last
month.  Free Range provides Web authoring services and
design consultation for companies developing
commercial sites.  NovX develops and sells
pre-configured server computers.

      Spry has sold more than 200,000 copies of
Internet in a Box to consumers through book and
computer stores.

CHANGE AT INTERACTIVE GIFT
MAY SIGNAL STRONG PATENT STAND

      Interactive Gift Express Inc. (IGE) named a
corporate turnaround specialist its new chairman and
president, a move that may be a precursor to the
company taking a stronger stand on its patent
affecting electronic commerce applications.

      Arnold Freilich takes the president's helm from
Robert Cosby, who came on board at IGE last December
around the same time the company acquired what is
known as the "Freeny patent."

      The patent covers "the transfer of digital
information to a material object at the point of
sale," and, if enforced, it theoretically covers the
use of debit cards in certain situations, sales
through bulletin board services, and the digital
transmission of software from a central site to remote
locations for recopying and sale.  This type of system
is being developed by IBM Corp. and Hughes Network
Systems Inc. using DirecPC satellite technology.

Resignation Only Part of the Shake-up

      Cosby's resignation was just part of the
shake-up in the company's upper echelons.  Company
founder Clarence Jolley stepped down as chairman of
the board but retains a spot as director, while his
two sons, Layne and Wayne, have resigned from the
board.  Michael Franzese, Arthur Casey Stern III and
Grant Robertson also joined the board, bringing the
number of directors to five.

      Although Freilich characterized Cosby's
resignation as amicable, the new president admitted
Cosby was not geared toward IGE's interactive business
plan.  IGE's core business has been its wire-based
gift delivery service, but the company plans to move
quickly into the multimedia market, Freilich told REC.
Part of IGE's new business will be branching into
kiosk-based touch-screen gift ordering, along with
bringing their traditional paper-based catalog online.

      IGE is looking at a variety of online service
providers, including America Online Inc., for porting
the gift catalog online, Freilich said.  The company
has not ruled out venturing onto the Web or into
Internet malls, however.  With both the kiosk and
online ordering services still in the planning stages,
IGE plans to take its first steps into the interactive
market through licensing and litigation.

      IGE has stated its intention to license the
Freeny patent, and litigate against possible
infringers.  The company recently brought in David
Fink, former senior vice president of patent
exploitation firm Refac Inc., to head its licensing
effort.  IGE also completed a private placement of
convertible notes to finance this campaign.

      While the Freeny patent has the potential to
generate millions of dollars in fees, IGE needs the
voluntary licensing from at least one large company to
legitimize its claim.  Enforcing broad interactive
patents can be a costly proposition if IGE is forced
to take all infringers to court.  Also, in the new
realm of digital commerce and communications, broadly
worded multimedia patents are finding it difficult to
stand up before the courts and the government, as
evidenced by the rejection of Compton's New Media's
patent on multimedia navigation that was shot down
last year by a patent review board.

      Although the company is keeping a tight rein on
its patent, it will be very selective in terms of
which companies it will go after, Freilich said.
"We're not afraid to go to court, but we're not going
to say this patent covers the world," he said.

      IGE reportedly was in discussions with IBM Corp.
and Bank of America, but Freilich would not comment on
any of the company's negotiations.  Aside from his
role on the board, Franzese is a full-time consultant
to Bank of America.  According to Freilich, IGE is
very close to licensing its technology to a
"noteworthy" client, and expects to announce this
arrangement within three to six months.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SET TO COVER E-MAIL
IN COMPLEX NEW FRAUD REGULATIONS
Cumbersome Rules May Well Hamper Electronic Commerce

By Michael F. Cavanagh
Contributing Editor

      On Capitol Hill there is a strong wind blowing
against onerous federal regulation, but down the
street a few blocks at the Federal Trade Commission,
sweeping new rules are evolving rapidly - rules that
would rewrite a substantial part of direct marketing
law and put cyberspace under a complex new regulatory
scheme.  (Unlike a proposed bill in Congress, which
must move through the often arduous legislative
process, federal regulations need only be approved by
the agency proposing such rules after public comment,
and thus there is a certainty of action.)

      What the FTC is doing, in a nutshell, is taking
myriad issues relating to telemarketing abuse and
squeezing them into an opportunity to regulate
electronic mail, online services and cyberspace in
general.  These rules are targeted at business
dealings with "consumers," not most
business-to-business transactions, but the nature of
the requirements could make the distinction between
consumers and business employees almost meaningless.

Acting in Response to Telemarketing Act

      To be sure, the FTC is acting in response to the
Telemarketing Act of 1994, signed into law last August
to fight deceptive (and also highly annoying)
practices employed by some telemarketers.  Congress
directed the FTC to establish a set of specific
regulations to fight the estimated $40 billion per
year that is lost by consumers as a result of
telemarketing fraud.

      The law defines telemarketing as any plan,
program or campaign conducted to induce payment for
goods or services via the telephone.  The FTC states
in its Federal Register notice announcing the proposed
rules, however, that it has made "one addition" that
"clarifies" the definition.  The FTC adds "the use of
a facsimile machine, computer modem, or any other
telephonic medium" to the definition of telemarketing.
Thus, e-mail suddenly is at the heart of a complex set
of new rules and regulations.

      Experts on the issue told REC last week that the
"addition" is remarkable in that Congress had no
intention of dealing with computer communications in
this legislation.

      According to noted analyst John Awerdick, an
attorney in Newark, N.J., who is representing several
major companies in this proceeding:  "It's clear that
the Congress was aiming the legislation at plain
vanilla telemarketing fraud."  The  problem, said
Awerdick, is that "while there shouldn't be deceptive
advertising in any medium, the time and nature of
disclosures to the consumer may need to differ" based
on what medium is used.

      Washington attorney Allan Adler, who will be
filing comments with the FTC on behalf of the Direct
Marketing Association, said that "instead of focusing
on the scam artists that led Congress to enact the
legislation, these [FTC] drafters regulate the entire
broad spectrum of telephone use, portraying  it as
inherently risky."  The telephone has been around for
a long time, Adler said, and "one can now only imagine
how the FTC plans to treat cyberspace [now that it is
to be covered under their regulations.]"

What Do Regulations Require?

      What specifically do these regulations require
from anyone who makes over 10 "sales" of anything
annually via the telephone, fax and e-mail combined?
(This is the new definition of "telemarketer.")  The
long list includes strikingly different disclosures
and practices, depending on whether or not the sale
involves office equipment, cleaning goods, a
charitable  contribution, any prizes, equity in a
business.  The list goes on and on.

      As a fairly general matter, these proposed
regulations require that "before payment is requested
for goods and services offered" the seller must list
all terms and material restrictions, cancellation
policies, exchange and refund options, etc.  Detailed
records now must be kept, listing all solicitation
activities for a 24-month period.

Complete List is Long One

      To detail the complete list of regulations with
which telemarketers must comply would take virtually
this entire issue of REC.  While many of the
provisions are quite benign and do seek to target real
fraud patterns, virtually anyone involved in
electronic commerce will need to know what they are.
More precisely, they probably will need to have a
lawyer close at hand when anything that could be
construed as marketing takes place.

      As previously noted, there is an important
exemption to these regulations, but one that is
particularly problematic for the electronic mail
industry.

      These regulations exempt most (but not all)
business-to-business solicitations.  Given that,
what's the problem?  Think about it.  In an
extraordinarily high number of situations in the
e-mail world, it's impossible to determine whether or
not the e-mail address listed is a personal or
business mailbox, or indeed whether the person uses
that mailbox for personal as well as  business use.
(Below you will find an e-mail address for this
writer.  Is it a business or personal address?  Do you
want to risk prosecution by a state attorney general
in order to find out?)  Similarly, the use of many fax
machines blurs with respect to whether it is business
or personal.

      In light of the vast array of new issues raised
by coverage of e-mail, is it possible that the FTC has
added "modem" communications inadvertently to this
proposal?

      Quite the contrary, as it turns out.  Several
times in the notice respondents (anyone who comments
on a proposal) are asked to address whether or not the
definitions are "sufficiently broad to encompass
current as well as future technology."  In  fact, it
appears clear that the FTC views this telemarketing
rulemaking as its entrance into cyberspace regulation
and that the commission wants to be sure that its
definition covers everything imaginable.

      In sum, the Federal Trade Commission is poised
to actively enter cyberspace and begin the regulation
of all electronic commerce.  Most reasonable people
would say that consumers do deserve protection from
fraudulent operators,  regardless of what mechanism
they use to perpetrate their deceptions, including
electronic mail.

Frustration at Attempts to Overreach

      On the other hand, it also might be appropriate
to suggest that the backlash against government rules
and regulations demonstrated recently at the ballot
box probably manifested an American frustration with
regulators' attempts to overreach logical bounds when
expanding rules designed for one purpose into areas
that have not been examined adequately.

      There still is time to have your organization
comment on these proposed regulations.  The full text
of the proposed regulations are found in the Federal
Register of Feb. 14, 1995, on pages 8313 through 8333.
Formal comments must be submitted to the FTC by March
31.  (Full instructions can be  found in the Federal
Register notice.)

FOLIO AND PARTNERS OFFER INFO
COMMERCE, COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
API Provides Reimbursement Scheme

      Folio Corp. and a group partners are offering a
technology package designed to meter digital
information usage over wide area networks in support
of electronic publishing on the Internet and
commercial online services.

      If this metering system becomes standard, which
is a goal of the partnership, information in private
databases may leave the privilege of the business
world and become affordable to the home user for the
first time.

      Folio, along with Novell Corp., the Copyright
Clearing Center (CCC) and several information metering
systems makers announced March 6 an application
programming interface (API), server software and
secure links to a transaction system that will provide
a reimbursement system for use of copyrighted material
sold on the Internet or other wide area networks such
as Novell and AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Netware Connect.  The
Folio metering API is the key component of a system
called the Information Marketplace proffered by the
company and its partners, which also include Wave
Systems Corp. and CD-Max Inc.

      Folio, of Provo, Utah, recently was bought by
Reed-Elsevier PLC, which also owns the Lexis-Nexis
databases for legal and news information.

      The system is designed for publishers who want
to offer electronic access to their data, but are
afraid that going digital means losing control of
their materials.  Currently, these newsletter,
newspaper and database publishers have had to use
high-priced proprietary systems such as Dialog
Information Services Inc. and Lexis-Nexis, which limit
their potential audience to institutional researchers
and tie them to clunky interfaces on proprietary
networks.

      With internetworking growing faster than any
previous communications medium in history, the
opportunities for content providers are huge, as are
the risks.

      Folio's InfoBase technology has been a popular
way to distribute material on disk or CD-ROM.  The
Information Marketplace moves that model into the
wider world of internetworks such as the Internet,
although it also can be used on proprietary or
commercial networks.

      "The Folio API is a logical extension to our
existing Rights Management technology which today
allows publishers to restrict usage of infobases on
CD-ROM by the number of users, or for a specified
period of time," said Tracy Scott, president of Folio
Corp.  "Now we can extend those capabilities to meter
information on a per-transaction basis, which will
allow users to only pay for what they use.  This will
open up new markets for publishers in cases where
their information has been prohibitively expensive or
otherwise impractical for use by small companies and
others who, for one reason or another, do not
currently buy subscription-based information
products."

A la Carte Charging Solves Problems

      The ability to charge users on an a la carte
basis over the Internet solves several problems.
First, by offering discrete segments of data,
companies can price their products lower, which allows
them to expand their markets.  A la carte also allows
information to be priced according to its intrinsic
value, instead of valued generically by subscription.
A longer feature or study printed in REC, for
instance, can be priced differently from a round of
news briefs.

      The CCC partnership will allow companies that
adopt the Folio metering API to link into the right's
database of more than 1.7 million publications.
Through that link, and with access controls provided
by companies such as Wave Systems, Infobase Systems
Inc. and CD-MAX (each of which has announced support
for the API) users can be positively identified, their
access limited to areas for which they have rights and
their use of products tracked for billing.  Connection
to the CCC enables the holders of copyrights to be
compensated based upon the specific content accessed.

      "In most cases, traditional print publishers and
authors have been unwilling to release their
copyrighted materials in digital form without adequate
protection of their copyrights," said Joseph S. Alen,
president and chief executive officer at CCC.  "By
providing both technological and contractual controls,
the Folio/CCC relationship promises to dramatically
increase the flow of digital information from rights
holders to users."

      For Web-based applications, Folio is using a
secure server technology developed with Open Market
Inc. (see story, p. 3).  The product is in beta
testing now and is expected to be commercially
available by early summer for $6,995.  The Folio Web
Server will provide links to the CCC's database and a
separate system to be developed to provide clearance
for intellectual property not handled by the CCC.
Secure links also will be provided to a third-party
billing service that will process transactions, but
not track the exact materials accessed to ensure
anonymity of research performed over the network.

Wave Systems Designed Encryption Chip

      Wave Systems already has designed an encryption
chip around the Folio metering API, and has licensed
it to VLSI Technology Inc. to manufacture the chips.
Aside from electronic commerce applications, Wave
Systems may use the technology to create rental or
pay-per-view business models with the database
material, said Amelia Burkhart, Wave Systems
spokeswoman.  Wave Systems is working on applications
that will meter data usage and cut off access after
set periods of time, she said.

      Initial metering API-compliant products will be
released this year to meter local area networks and
CD-ROM, with wide area network and Internet capability
planned for late this year and 1996.  Wave Systems
plans to have its private network chips ready by
spring, with Internet and Web versions ready by the
end of the year, according to Burkhart.

      Although prices haven't been set, Wave Systems
expects its chip to sell in the $100 range.  While
home users may not buy the chips as an add-on, Wave is
working on bundling arrangements with computer
companies, peripheral manufacturers and publishing
companies, Burkhart said.

      Folio can be reached at (801) 229-6331; CCC at
(508) 750-8400; and Wave at (413) 274-1400.

MEDIO MULTIMEDIA MOVES
INTO ONLINE MARKETPLACE

      Medio Multimedia Inc. is approaching advertisers
about electronic commerce opportunities available with
the company's forthcoming hybrid CD-ROM magazine to be
launched in June that will include links to the new
MedioNet Internet access service.

      Medio has held discussions with Dewars scotch,
which already advertises on the regular CD-ROM
magazine, and has approached retailers such as
Nordstrom, Macy's and Nike about selling products in
an online marketplace being developed by the company,
said John Rutter, Medio senior vice president of sales
and marketing.  The online mall is likely to be
available by August or September, he said.

MedioNet Will Cost $9.95 First 2 Months

      MedioNet, slated for a national launch later
this year, will be priced at $9.95 for the first two
months and $19.95 for the following months.  The price
tag includes a copy of the CD-ROM magazine to provide
the software link, and 40 hours of Internet access.
Medio launched a pilot Internet access network in
Seattle, Wash., that eventually will use the company's
CD-ROM magazine as the front-end to reach the
Internet.

      This pricing model doubles the Internet time of
online service Delphi Internet Service Corp. - $20 for
20 hours - and gives Medio a dual revenue stream.  The
company will collect its basic Internet access
charges, along with money from advertising on the
CD-ROM magazine.  Linking MedioNet with the CD-ROM
also boosts the subscriber base for the magazine,
which commonly is used to determine pricing structure
for advertising.  The magazine also is sold
individually through retail channels.

Modem Speeds Up to 28.8 Kbps

      MedioNet will support modem speeds up to 28.8
kilobits per second, and is working with U.S. Robotics
Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Cisco Systems Inc.,
Sprint Corp., NorthWestNet, Structured Communications
Systems Inc. and Teleport Communications Group to
provide the infrastructure for the Seattle system.

      Medio is well positioned to create a
multimedia-rich online market, because
memory-intensive audio and video clips can be stored
on the company's CD-ROM for immediate access, leaving
the online connection free to transmit information
updates and ordering commands quickly.

      The actual ordering component will not include
online credit card transactions in its initial
rollout, Rutter said.  Medio takes credit card orders
for its CD-ROM magazine over the phone, and these
numbers will be used by the company to collect payment
for online orders when the system is in place.
Eventually, Medio wants to move to online credit card
orders, perhaps using an in-house system for secure
payment, Rutter said.  But it is more likely the
company will license a "name brand" secure transaction
technology from another party, he added, which will
make consumers more comfortable ordering over
MedioNet.

      With the CD-ROM magazine becoming the front-end
for MedioNet, the company is working to boost the
disk's circulation before the service extends
nationally this summer.  This week, Creative Labs
ordered 100,000 copies of next month's magazine to
send to its customers that register their multimedia
upgrade kits, Rutter said.  This registration
incentive boosts Medio's circulation to 150,000.
Rutter expects Creative to order a similar amount
every quarter.   Medio can be reached at (206)
450-9965.

BAXTER IMPLEMENTING CD-ROM
WITH EDI PURCHASING CAPABILITY

      Hybrid CD-ROM catalogs with online connections
for ordering are becoming commonplace, as 2Market Inc.
and Interactive Catalog Corp. bring consumer and
business-to-business solutions into cyberspace.

      But the system that health care supply giant
Baxter International Inc. is implementing puts an even
newer spin on CD-ROM-based electronic commerce -
Baxter is using electronic data interchange (EDI)
technology over proprietary networks as the
transmission medium instead of the Internet or one of
the online services.

      This week, Baxter announced it was replacing its
old Analytical Systems Automated Purchasing (ASAP)
hospital procurement system in favor of the OnCall*EDI
system developed by TSI International Ltd.  Baxter
will phase out its ASAP support by the end of 1996.

Transition Forces Hospitals' Transition

      Baxter's transition to OnCall*EDI all but forces
most of the 6,000 hospitals using the DOS-based ASAP
to make the transition to the open x.12 standard TSI
is marketing.  Baxter's health care division provides
medical supplies to more than 4,000 of the country's
estimated 6,600 hospitals, according to Bob Bouton,
TSI vice president of marketing.

      Using a CD-ROM version of Baxter's Source 2000
catalog created by Automated Catalog Services L.P.,
hospitals can search through images and text of 80,000
hospital products and place the EDI order right from
the disk.  The TSI system is windows-based, and
hospitals can zoom in on product images along with
ordering by pointing and clicking.

      The two-way connection allows Baxter to provide
immediate price updates to the disk, and speeds up the
procurement process for the hospital.  Down the road,
an automatic payment system will be built into
OnCall*EDI, allowing hospitals to link their
purchasing with accounting systems for immediate
verification and delivery of funds, Bouton said.

      "CD-ROM catalogs in a lot of ways offer benefits
over online catalogs," said Torrey Byles, director of
electronic commerce for market research firm BIS
Strategic Decisions.  "This type of system is very
quickly going to become widely used in other areas."

      TSI already has shipped a few hundred OnCall*EDI
platforms to Baxter, which is reselling the units to
hospitals it services, and Bouton expects hundreds of
further orders to come through in the next six to nine
months.

      Moving away from the proprietary ASAP system
also will benefit Baxter's competitors, which will be
able to tap into the OnCall*EDI system with their
CD-ROM product catalogs.  Aside from manufacturing its
own brand, Baxter also distributes competing products
from other companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, and
the new ordering system will provide a more level
playing field for manufacturers that want to target
hospitals directly.

      Baxter can be reached at (708) 689-5009; TSI at
(203) 761-8600; ACS at (610) 687-7500; and BIS at
(408) 492-9823.

INDUSTRY.NET HEADS TO THE WEB
Manufacturers Enter Information Age

      After existing as a direct dial-up information
service for the manufacturing community, Industry.Net
moved to the World Wide Web to advertise its wares in
its electronic marketplace.

      The Industry.Net Online Marketplace allows
manufacturers to place product and price information
online for industry buyers to browse and collect
information.  About 3,300 companies promote products
on the service.  They pay between $450 a month and
$40,000 per year for the privilege, depending on the
size of the electronic display and how many regions of
the country the companies want to reach, Industry.Net
spokeswoman Autumn Jones said.

100,000 'Buying Members' Use Service

      About 100,000 "buying members" access the
service to examine products from "selling members"
such as IBM Corp., Rockwell, Honeywell and Alan
Bradley.  In addition to product information, the
service includes industry news briefs, discussion
groups and electronic mail to send questions to
companies displaying their products.

      Although the new Web service is strictly
informational, within three months Industry.Net will
add the capability to conduct online purchasing, Jones
said.  It still is undetermined whether ordering will
involve receiving a purchase order number for later
billing by regular mail, or will allow credit card
orders to be transmitted over the Web.  Industry.Net
uses servers from Netscape Communications Corp., which
would allow for an easy switch to Netscape's secure
commerce technology.

      After watching the information revolution taking
place throughout the corporate world, the
manufacturing community slowing is beginning to take
notice of the potential for electronic commerce to
facilitate purchasing and other business-to-business
transactions.

      At National Manufacturing Week's Design Show
last week, the spot where Industry.Net premiered the
Web service was the only booth with a connection to
the Internet, Jones said.  But the low-tech days of
manufacturing communication may be coming to an end.

      Aside from online markets such as Industry.Net,
CD-ROM catalogs also are becoming a popular method to
convey parts catalogs and price information to buyers
and other vendors (see story, p. 12).

      While CD-ROMs allow for snappier multimedia
presentations, online trading floors have the
advantage of immediate ordering and price updating.
Industry.Net's Web site has been running as a trial
for about a month and has received about 60,000
logons, Jones said.  The company projects more than 1
million logons by the end of the year.

FEUD BETWEEN IN, NTN WINDS DOWN

      While the feud may not be over yet, the battle
between the Hatfields and the McCoys of the
interactive television gaming world finally may be
winding down.  Interactive Network Inc. (IN) and NTN
Communications Inc. announced an out-of-court
settlement March 6, ending at least part of a
decadelong dispute over technology allowing home users
to play games and win prizes from set-top boxes,
personal computers and gaming systems.

      Although terms of the settlement were not
disclosed by either party, the arrangement is
basically an "I'll go one way, you go another" deal,
in which neither side will sanction the other's
products.  As representatives from both parties
stated, no licenses changed hands.

      The two companies have been locked in disputes
over IN's interactive gaming patent.  Although a 1987
settlement gave NTN a worldwide, royalty-free license
on the technology, the company wanted to introduce
evidence that the patent actually was taken from
technology developed at NTN originally.  IN denied the
claim, and a court ruled last November NTN could not
sue because of the terms of the 1987 settlement.  This
latest settlement puts to rest questions on whether
IN's "IN The Huddle" football game infringes on NTN's
proprietary "QB1" football game.

      Although the companies still are in dispute on
other areas of the patent, IN now will offer "IN The
Huddle" to its 5,500 network users in its five test
markets.  With this legal hurdle out of the way, IN is
hoping to raise money to continue its market trials,
said Dave Lockton, IN chairman and chief executive
officer.  The football dispute "put a cloud over us in
the financial community," Lockton said, expressing
hope that the remaining issues with NTN can be worked
out in a similar arrangement.

      IN can be reached at (408) 325-5016, and NTN at
(619) 438-7400.

AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANS
ELECTRONIC IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

      American Airlines Inc. will conduct a six-month
test starting this summer of an in-flight
entertainment system that gives passengers access to
movies and electronic games on flights between the
United States and Europe.

      Passengers will operate the system through a
handset at each seat.  The airline is remodeling its
fleet of 41 Boeing 767-300s and installing digital
telephones compatible with the systems.  The handset
also will operate the phone, and a phone jack at each
seat will allow a passenger to send faxes from
portable computers.

      The service will be available in all classes of
service.  However, first-class passengers will use
video units mounted on the arms of their seats while
other passengers will use monitors on the seat backs
in front of them.

NEW 2MARKET CD-ROM DUE EARLY MAY

      2Market Inc., the interactive CD-ROM shopping
service owned by America Online Inc. (AOL), will issue
its second disc in early May, according to Michael J.
Minigan, vice president for business development.

      The golden master of the disc will be delivered
to the manufacturer in the first week of May, with
shipments occurring shortly thereafter, Minigan told
REC.  For now, the service, which also is available on
AOL, is scheduled to be updated twice a year.

      The disc will contain fewer than 26 catalogs,
the number that appeared in the premiere issue, he
said, but each catalog will contain more information.
The change is due, in part, to market research
following on the release of the first disc last year.

      "People wanted fewer catalogs but more
merchandise from each," he said, declining to name the
new catalogs that will be added to the service.
Current offerings include Crutchfield, Land's End, The
Learning Company, The Nature Company, The Sharper
Image and Sony Music.

      Other improvements in 2Market's next issue will
be a simpler method of ordering merchandise over a
modem, Minigan said.  "If we make it even easier to
use, we've got a grand slam," he said.

MovieFone EXPLORING KIOSK,
ONLINE TICKET SALES

      With 67 percent growth in its 1994 revenues,
MovieFone Inc. is looking beyond its traditional
phone-based information service to kiosk and online
models this year.

      MovieFone revenues totaled $22.6 million in
1994, up from $13.5 million the year before.  At the
same time, the company's losses were cut to $1.9
million from $2.2 million in 1993.

      MovieFone is riding into profitability on the
back of a national expansion campaign.  In 1994, the
company received 33.3 million calls to its service,
which provides updated information on where movies are
playing in local areas, and also allows consumers to
purchase tickets in advance.

      While 95 percent of calls were for information
rather than transactional purposes, MovieFone expects
purchasing to increase as the company offers other
transmission methods, company spokesman Andrew Jeske
said.

      A new kiosk service called MovieLink is being
tested quietly in a few cities throughout the country,
including New York and Los Angeles.  The interactive
kiosks use video clips to preview movies, and
MovieFone is experimenting with purchasing capability.

      The company also is exploring using its existing
Web site as a foundation for online movie information
and ticket sales, but both of these projects are still
being tested, Jeske said.

      MovieFone is at (212) 504-7557.

MITSUBISHI IN DIGITAL DMV PACT

Digi-Media Vision (DMV), the former NTL Advanc-ed Products Division now
owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has formed an alliance with
the giant Mitsubishi Electric Corporation to develop digital set-top
boxes for worldwide MPEG-2/DVB markets.

Under the deal, Mitsubishi will start making digital receiver-decoders
at its Scottish factories, combining DMV's MPEG-2/DVB-compliant
technology with the Japanese giant's proven TV, video, telecoms and
semiconductor manufacturing skills.

A Mitsubishi spokesman said the aim is to make "300,000 units in the
first year" with the UK and Europe as launch markets.  Although the set-
top boxes would be built on an "open-access" basis for "various
programme providers", he added, it was clear BSkyB would have first
bite of the cherry depending on when and how it goes digital.  The new
joint-venture would be able to produce boxes for satellite, cable or
terrestrial digital markets with equal facility.

The new partnership follows NTL's 1994 alliance with Pace, which
resulted in the first generation of Pace-NTL digital receivers now
reaching markets worldwide.  Unlike Pace, however, Mitsubishi is not
forming a joint venture company with DMV.  The Pace-NTL joint venture -
to be renamed Pace-DMV - is not affected by the new venture.

DMV boss Mike Windram said alliances with other manufacturers and
broadcasters had been "key to the successful introduction of the new
digital technology - we intend to increase our investment in the
development of transmission and receiver technology and this type of
partnership is vital for DMV."

Though a late entrant into the European analogue satellite market with
integrated TV/IRDs, Mitsubishi signalled its intention of being a
mainstream digital player with the opening of its Visual Imaging
research labs in London last summer.  Its six European factories
include an advanced semiconductor fabrication plant which is likely to
be the source of decoder chips.

SKY-BRUNO PPV PLAN

BSkyB is considering the screening of the Tyson/ Bruno WBO World Heavy-
weight Championship on March 16 as the broadcaster's first pay-per-view
event.

However, Sky is adamant that "no decision has been made".  Bruno's last
fight, resulted in the highest ever UK satellite audience.  Curiously
advance listings for Sky Sports in March fail to mention Bruno's boxing
bout.

Tyson's last fight was time delayed by Sky, but shown live on TV1000 to
subscribers in Scandinavia.  TV1000 will also be showing the match
against Bruno.

ASTRA 1E BEGINS DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONS

The first digital services have been switched on to the newly-
commissioned Astra 1E as Astra 1F readies for launch.  However, the
lack of available receivers means that the services are only being
viewed by a select few.

The sixth Astra satellite will launch from Baikonur in Southern
Siberia, near the Mongolian border on March 28.  It will be the first
time that Astra-operator SES has used a launcher other than Ariane.

The first two channels to be switched on to Astra 1E were the German
national public broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Transponder 71).  Since
December 31 the clear MPEG-2 transmissions have been broadcast direct
from SES in Luxem-bourg after conversion from the analogue format.

The French Canal satellite package is using transponders 66 and 70; the
transmissions had previously been made from Astra 1D, which also
operates in the Astra 1D band.  The number of channels included in the
multiplex package continues to vary.

Nethold is using Tps 77 and 80 for its test transmissions from its
digital centre in Hilversum.  Again the number of programmes included
is regularly varied, but will include channels in MultiChoice's
Scandinavian package.

DIGITAL DEATH-BLOW FOR EUROSAT SA

Satellite Communications Pty, the Johannesburg-based distributor and
dish-manufacturer which traded as Eurosat South Africa has collapsed
after what founder and MD Sid Trickett describes as the "natural death"
of analogue and C-Band products at the hands of digital DTH.

Provisional liquidator Colin Fisher of Deloitte & Touche Pty said the
company's liabilities amounted to around Rand 3.5 million, against
assets of R250,000.  South Africa's Customs and Excise has a R330,000
claim to certain assets as security for their claims.  In short, Fisher
reckoned that ordinary creditors "don't have any chance" of recovering
anything from the ruins, unless a buyer comes forward before the
liquidation hearing on January 31.

Eurosat - itself "a substantial creditor" - has transferred its
franchise to Grundig International Pty.  Sid Trickett, who said he had
"personally lost R5.5 million" in the collapse, has been contracted by
Grundig to develop the satellite business.

Prior to the collapse, Trickett had signed a deal to handle Grundig's
digital IRD distribution.  Grundig planned to use badged Panasonic IRDs
- but on December 15 "the factory had burnt down".

Satellite Communications' original dish-making business "died a natural
death with the arrival of PAS-4", especially as the onset of Ku-Band
coincided with a steep rise in world prices of aluminium.

"For a while analogue Ku-Band kept us going, but when the ASEC services
from Intelsat 704 shut down, that side came to a screeching halt as
well."

COMPACT DISH HITS THE STREETS

Sky's Compact Dish campaign - the drive to promote a 48cm alternative
to the 60cm Astra dish across southern England first reported in
October's ST - goes live this month after technical and market trials.

The 48-cm `charcoal grey' mesh dish-pack, made by Lenson Heath, is
being stocked by distributors including Longreach, Eurosat and Michael
Black, but will be marketed only in the safe 48cm reception area -
which Sky defines as south of an arc from Hull to Southampton.

Sky's campaign opens on February 3 with ads in regional editions of the
national press and selected local newspapers, and a new pack of in-
store material.  Lenson Heath has geared up to produce "around 25,000
over the next month to six weeks," confirmed sales and marketing
director David Griffin: "We've already shipped 8-9,000 pieces." Griffin
added that it was "near impossible" to predict uptake, though Sky is
clearly hoping the smaller dish will bring a whole new wave of
subscribers into the fold.

UAP VERSIONS TCC AND DISCOVERY

TCC has introduced a new version for the Nordic market while sister
channel Discovery has added a Dutch soundtrack.  A backhaul was
introduced on January 1 for TCC Nordic to feed the Thor satellite which
has previously taken the Astra version.  The backhaul is at present
transmitted in clear analogue Pal from Intelsat 601, though the
intention is to switch to an encrypted feed in the near future.

General manager Franklin Getchell said TCC Nordic had been created as a
totally separate service running for 12 hours a day as opposed to the
11 hours of the Astra service.  TCC is on-air between 06.00 and
18.00CET.  "The 12 hours will be a mix of programming.  All of the live
action programming will be regionalised, the pre-school will be added
by the end of the year." Programming for older children, including some
of the high-profile animation will be subtitled.  For younger children
dubbing will be used where the rights allow it.

Discovery, which has been available in Holland since 1989 and is
available in 4.3 million homes, will carry Dutch continuity on a
separate Astra audio subcarrier.  Teletext subtitling in the Dutch
language will also be expanded.

DIGITAL PIRATES STRIKE DIRECTV

Leading experts believe that American DBS service DirecTv is under
attack by digital satellite pirates and that the underground trade in
pirate decoders may soon be draining off subscription revenues from one
of every two DBS receiving sets sold.

Bob Sherman of Satellite Business News claimed, "Piracy could become a
huge potential problem here.  It could become the biggest problem
facing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because there
is a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding down
distribution."

Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consulting
firm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespread
at this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of these
chips require a 26 week lead time." Sherman previously worked at
General Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where he
helped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.

At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to
10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Shelton
believes it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "It
could become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will see
advertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If it
continues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing
100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legally
authorised." The black market access cards are being sold for between
$500-700.

DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two steps
ahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electronic
countermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton and
Sherman believe the problem will continue to grow.

"CURE" FOR 010 CARD TROUBLES

Difficulties with certain pre-1995 IRDs, caused by the latest Period 10
VideoCrypt smart card have been traced to a mysterious black dot on the
chip.  A number of receivers, including Pace IRDs have been affected by
problems ranging from an annoying audible tone and an unwarranted "Card
Invalid" on-screen message.

Technical author Martin Pickering says the problem clearly lies with
the card rather than individual receivers.

When tape is placed over the black dot "Card Invalid" appears on every
receiver.  The contact carries the 3.5

MHz clock pulses and acts as a resistor.  Pickering estimates it to
have a value between 1 and 2k Ohms.  As the black spot is worn away the
problem becomes worse.

By cutting the circuit track which leads to the relevant "black dot"
card holder contact, and soldering a 2k2 resistor across the cut track
the problem is apparently cured.

The same modification has been carried out on other PRD receivers, all
of which have been cured.  It is not known whether or not the cure will
work on other receivers.

SPORTS PROMO BACK FOR WORLD CUP CRICKET

Sky has reintroduced its free sports promotion ahead of the Cricket
World Cup.  Sky Sports will be screening exclusive coverage of the
tournament.  The 1992 event led to a 40 per cent surge in dish sales
and is widely believed to be responsible for that summer's shortage in
receiving equipment.

New subscribers signing up to the total Sky package will not be charged
for the sports element of the package for the first six months of their
subscription.

GRUNDIG'S HALF MILLION

The 500,000th satellite receiver recently rolled off the production
line of Grundig's South Wales factory, 20 months after its opening
straight into the hands of VP Johan van Splunter (pictured below).
Initially a joint venture be-tween Grundig and Welsh in-dustrialist Alf
Gooding, the factory is now wholly owned by Grundig and has become the
German manufacturer's sole source of receivers.

NEWS BYTES

Kinnevik is finally ready to sell TV1000 to FilmNet's owners NetHold,
according to a report in Swedish business daily Finanstidningen.  BET
International is launching BET on Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel as part
of the MultiChoice packet for Southern Africa.  Orion 1 is to
distribute Performance: The Arts Channel to cable operators from
February 1.  It joins Channel One, which will also use the NTL/Orion
digital transmission system.  Compression will be using the DVB-
compliant System 3000.  The Racing Channel has reached 10,000
subscribers - a third of its first year's target - within seven weeks
on air.  Anthony Sethill - late of Amstrad - has quit the German
company to take up a similar role for Samsung Electronics (UK)'s
telecoms division.  Philips has given a fillip to the proposed
Electrical Retailing Show (Birmingham NEC, March 24-26) by deciding to
unveil its '96 UK consumer electronics range at the new trade-only
event.  So far some 70 firms have signed up, including Astra, Nokia,
Toshiba and Samsung.  Following the review of the new Philips BDE353
Mac decoder in your Dec/Jan ST we received many calls about its
availability.  So too Eurosat which has now obtained an initial batch,
which is now available for shipment.

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES DBS COMPETITION BEGINS

EchoStar successfully launched its high powered DBS satellite EchoStar
1 from China on December 28 and now hopes to be in the marketplace by
late February or early March.

EchoStar plans to launch EchoStar 2 from China during the summer.  The
service will provide over 200 channels of digital video, audio and data
services and become America's second true DBS provider, after DirecTv.
While PrimeStar offers DTH services, it transmits from a medium powered
satellite restricting its receiving dishes to a now ungainly 30 inches.
 Alpha-Star, slated to start service during the first quarter of 1996
will also transmit from a medium powered satellite.

EchoStar believes that it is in a strong position to compete with the
established American DTH and DBS providers.  To begin with it has been
in the TVRO business as a hardware supplier since 1980 and has
operations in Holland, Spain, Singapore China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and
India.

While not yet ready to release its marketing or launch plans EchoStar
plans to come into the market at prices below other DBS/DTH providers.
Its prospectus states that the retail cost or an EchoStar receiving
system will be in the $500 (#325) range, well below the cost entry
level costs of $700 (#455) for a DirecTv system.

TMS INSTALLS MULTI-SATELLITE SMATV

A multiple satellite smatv system delivering signals from Astra and two
Eutelsat craft has been installed by London-based TMS Satellite &
Aerial Systems.  The complex IF communal system was installed for the
Ladybur Housing Co-operative in Tottenham, North London to deliver
signals into 156 self contained flats.

TMS, which also has a branch in Alicante, Spain was commissioned to
design and build a system for Ladybur in March 1995, when no other
company was capable of offering a similar set-up.

The system comprised of four headends using a Televes amplifier,
splitters and five in four out tone switch controlled multi-switches.
This gave each flat the two polarities from the Astra system plus one
polarity each from the Eutelsats at 13 degrees and 10 degrees East.  It
is believed to be one of the first installations to use this method to
control four polarities from satellite together with the four UHF
terrestrial channels and FM radio through a single cable.

The configuration allows the reception of English, German, Spanish,
Dutch, Asian and Japanese channels from Astra with Eutelsat providing
programming in Arabic, Turkish, French and Polish.

SATELLITE VIEWER SERVICES WOUND UP

Satellite Viewer Services, based in Old Burlington Street, London W1,
has been compulsorily wound up in the High Court.

The petition to wind-up the company was presented to the court last
November by the Home Video Channel Limited, owners of The Adult
Channel, who said in its petition that despite demands for payment the
company remained indebted to them, was insolvent and unable to pay its
debts.

At the hearing Counsel representing HVC told the court that his client
was a trade creditor who was owed a petition debt of #31,000, and
applied to the court to wind up the company's affairs.  On his
application Mr Registrar Pimm made the order to wind-up the company.

HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU

International news channel BBC World has been on-air for 12 months, but
its presence in the UK is deliberately hidden, writes Julian Clover

Sometimes it feels as if everyone wants to run a news channel; CNN
International has been on-air for ten years and satellite viewers can
tune into news broadcasts from Berlin, Paris, London and Lyon.

1995 saw a new crop with the launch of European Business News, CNBC
Europe and BBC World, the latter formed out of BBC World Service
Television, which had broadcast to Asia as part of Star TV.  In Europe
the news channel had been carried overnight on the old entertainment
service.

The BBC Europe channel from the Intelsat 27.5oW location had evolved
out of a rough mix of BBC1 and BBC2, the result of a demand for English
language programmes from Scandinavian cable companies.  This in turn
picked up more than a passing interest from DTH viewers who tuned into
the easily hacked Save transmissions before a switch to D2 Mac was
made.  DTH subscriptions for BBC Prime, again for outside the UK, are
handled by the Swedish subscriber management service TV Extra.

Listeners to short wave will be more than familiar with some of the
titles given to BBC World's extended news programmes; BBC Newsdesk,
Newshour and Newsroom would not look out of place coming from Bush
House instead of Television Centre.  The feature programmes also have a
familiar ring about them; Breakfast with Frost, Film '96,
Correspondent, and Panorama, including that royal interview.

The European feed from Eutelsat II F1 is transmitted from the Maxat
uplink at Teddington, where advertisements sold by the BBC
Worldwide/Pearson/Cox Communications joint venture company European
Channel Management are also added.  The spaces are filled by the
"Highlights In.  .  ." trailers while the rest of the world catches up.
 "We're selling enough airtime now that at the Teddington uplink more
and more of the ads go over the previews," explains ECM managing
director Marcus Bicknell.  "If it's a four minute break which we've
sold two minutes of, then the other two minutes are on-air promotions,
promotion of teletext and promotion of specific European stuff without
the Bangkok and Tokyo times."

After working as a consultant during the start up of BBC World and the
now rebranded entertainment channel BBC Prime Bicknell, the founder
commercial director of SES and previously marketing director at The
Children's Channel and the old UK film channel Premiere, joined ECM in
June last year.  His style is anything other than what is expected from
a BBC executive, but there again ECM is run as a private company from
private capital not encroaching on the domestic licence fee.

The past 12 months since the launch have concentrated more or less on
BBC Prime.  Fine tuning the mix of current and classic BBC and Thames
programmes into a selection more suitable for the European palate.

Prime is not a channel for ex-pats: EastEnders gets a regular showing
in line with BBC1, while other popular dramas such as Casualty as shown
often within a few weeks of their domestic screening.  Purchased films
are missing from the schedule as are sports programmes Grandstand and
Match of the Day.  Over the past few months Prime has introduced a
stripped schedule with regular slots for specific programme genres.

This year BBC World will receive the treatment starting on January 1
with the introduction of the long awaited teletext service.  "What we
had previously was an anachronism which was basically a feed from
Ceefax which went on the BBC World Service Television European service.
 It continued on Prime because the server just happened to be there."
Difficulties arose from bought in information which the BBC did not
have the rights to with the providers demanding payment.  The new
service, provided by the private company Intelfax, rather than Ceefax,
will eventually feature news, business, travel and of course a detailed
programme guide for the two services.  Both Prime and World will be the
subject of a major advertising campaign this year.

Across on Intelsat 601 BBC Prime continues to broadcast in D2 Mac.  Its
movement to Eutelsat 13 degrees being unlikely while there is no single
encryption system capable of reaching the whole of Europe.

The digital horizon however paints a more attractive option.  Already
BBC World is part of the MultiChoice package in South Africa and it is
reasonable to expect that BBC World, and probably Prime, would find
itself as part of the MultiChoice packages in Europe.  Britain will
remain firmly off the agenda; there are no rights held for the UK
market and in any case the BBC's news and current affairs directorate
has ambitions for a domestic news channel as part of a terrestrial
digital multiplex.

"We get hundreds of calls a week from people interested in Prime, we
get very low conversion because when they find it's on Intelsat with a
1.2 metre dish and in D2 Mac Eurocrypt M.  .  .I haven't inherited the
most glamorous distribution policy in the world," pines Bicknell.

Distribution difficulties are coupled with a pricing policy which
requires DTH subscribers to pay the equivalent to #70 per month while
cable viewers enjoy the channel as part of a wider extended basic
package.  "It's an unfair accident of technology, satellites and
encryption and we're trying to correct it.  What you'll see when the
digital packages roll out is World moving off and getting maximum
penetration and by the end of 1996 it would be very attractive for
somebody to get both channels from the same dish."

 Digital will allow further expansion; opt-outs in programming whereby
Asia would get its own dedicated programming while the rest of the
world continues with the standard service.  Such opt outs would be
extended to allow the programme packagers to take their own individual
slots.  "Part of being relevant to a non-Anglo Saxon target audience is
to know what individual programmes have got to say." This manifests
itself in the new Window on the World programme produced in Germany by
S-Zett-Magazin which currently contributes to Vox.  Initially the
programme will be transmitted with an English soundtrack only, but
already there are plans to introduce a separate German audio channel.
7.02 MHz will be used for English and 7.20MHz for German, there are no
plans to introduce any further languages in Europe.

With the European audience in mind other new programmes have recently
been added to the World schedule; Europe Today appears as a six to
eight minute segment in the three principal news magazines BBC
Newsdesk, BBC Newsday and The World Today.  The Asian Continent also
gets its own breakfast news briefing, BBC although the transmission
time of 01.00 to 04.00GMT means BBC Newsroom will be viewed only by the
most hardy European viewer.

By the end of 1996 14 million homes had access to BBC World, a mix of
DTH from Eutelsat and cable operators in Europe, the latter bolstered
by interest from the Netherlands and Germany where a terrestrial
frequency in Berlin is also a possibility.  "The channel is good, it is
in depth and it goes that bit further," boasts Bicknell.  Typically a
news channel will be viewed for between 12 and 18 minutes, whereas BBC
World is between 24 and 35.  "This means that somebody will watch the
25 minutes news, they'll stay for an ad break, or they're watching Time
Out; Tomorrow's World, Film '96 plus the headlines." This has been a
delight for the advertisers, who are also tumbling to the fact that BBC
World is the first BBC branded channel to carry advertising in the
first place.

Despite all the success in Europe BBC World will remain forever closed
to the UK viewer despite presently being in-the-clear from Eutelsat;
"Certainly if I was talking to a CAI conference I would warn them that
it would start decaying in time because it would never be in a UK
digital package." The Eutelsat feed will remain `for the foreseeable
future' and the implication is that BBC Prime would be first to vanish
from the analogue environment within a few years.

to market conditions.

The ESR800XT has 800 programmable channel memory, each with individual
video/audio and antenna setting, plus 400 favourite channels.  Its big
brother offers a useful 2,000 programmable channels, 400 favourites,
and can be programmed to track inclined orbit satellites using an
optional IOA600 module.

Both models offer six-language on-screen display option, including
Portuguese and Arabic, which as product manager Dan Albrecht notes,
"greatly increases the usability of our products in many regions of the
world."

Dealers should enjoy the PC-linked programme parameter system (using
the optional Drake Data Transfer Unit) as well as a programmable
`dealer screen' for their own in-store promotional messages.

LABGEAR UPS THE MAST

Teleste Cablevision is launching a new range of Labgear masthead
amplifiers.  The rugged housing of the amplifiers is designed to meet,
and exceed, the immunity and radiation requirements of the EMC
directive and the relevant EU standards.  The zinc diecast housing is
designed to ensure easy installation together with a repeatedly
consistent amplifier and shielding performance.  The amplifiers are
designed for optimum performance in poor reception areas while still
retaining good signal handling performance.

Teleste has improved the signal handling by 2dB (typical) this is
coupled with marginally lower gain, giving an enhanced overall
performance.

VIDEOCRYPT 2 INTO 1 WILL GO

Quantum Trading has produced a conversion kit which allows VideoCrypt
II cards to be used in standard VideoCrypt IRDs.  The conversion is
proving particularly popular with the Asian community in Europe where
new subscribers to Zee TV are being issued with the VC2 card.  It works
with all receivers with the exception of the Echostar 8700 where the
conversion does not fit.

The conversion is made by removing the IW03 and IW05 chips inserting
the kit, then replacing the two chips into new positions.  Quantum has
been supplied with its chips by the VideoCrypt proprietary rights
holder Thomson.  Once fitted it remains possible to continue viewing
channels using both VideoCrypt I and VideoCrypt II codes.  Where a
channel is transmitting two codes the conversion will always opt for
the VideoCrypt I code.

NEW SOUND FROM PACE

Pace's latest analogue IRD - the MSS 290, due for launch at April's
Cable & Satellite Show in London - will be the first to incorporate its
new `Stereo 3D' audio circuitry to provide a near-surround-sound
experience via a normal stereo TV set.

The Stereo 3D effect - greatly enhanced spatial sound which is a big
step up from normal Nicam stereo, and one step down from full-blown
Dolby Pro-Logic active surround sound - is produced by a sound
processing chip designed by Pace engineers.  The effects are selectable
from an additional on-screen menu, and the IRD can be connected up to a
hi-fi system to maximise the three-dimensional sound impact.  The unit
can also be used for stereo VCR playback to add pseudo-surround
effrects to videos.

The MSS 290 is set to retail at #229, with the enhanced audio system
likely to be heavily promoted as an added-value feature to persuade
punters to trade up from the all-pervasive under-#100 Astra system.
Pace also intends to incorporate Stereo 3D into certain export models,
but will retain Dolby Pro Logic for its top-of-the-range MSS1000
series.

INCLINED TO A DEGREE

Inclined orbit satellites are there one minute and gone the next.  Asim
Hussein explains how to track them down

Satellite system installers, broadcasters and viewers are fortunate
because a large proportion of the satellites that beam TV back to Earth
are in stable geostationary orbits.  However, what about receiving
signals from that increasing number of satellites that seem to fade in
and out every day or which simply can't be located at times?

The reason may be that the required satellite has an inclined orbit.
Inclined that is, to the plane of the usual geostationary arc.  In the
satellite operating industry the concept of allowing satellites to move
is not new.  In the '80s the Intelsat 5 craft were all in such orbits,
and at the same time USA operator Comsat began regular inclined-orbit
operations and coined the other name for such heavenly wandering - the
Comsat Manoeuvre.

Why is this done ? It lengthens the life of satellites by saving
hydrazine fuel.  Most satellites are maintained in position by the
firing of the propulsion engines for North-South and East-West station-
keeping, leaving the bird within about 100km of the nominal position.
If this is not done every few weeks the natural gravitational forces of
the sun and moon gradually, though imperceptibly at first, force the
satellite into an inclined plane orbit by about 0.8 degrees each year.
The rocket propellant saved can be used to maintain East-West station-
keeping within 0.1 degree but not for North-South, allowing the
satellite to move up and down.

When viewed from the earth or received with a satellite dish, an
inclined-orbit satellite no longer hangs in the sky as an apparently
stationary object.  It's pattern of movement is a definite `figure 8'
pattern that repeats every 24 hours unless a motor is fired to correct
it.  (Satellites at the edge of the arc that are inclined still execute
an `8' pattern, but in the higher latitudes this is skewed).  The
benefits of fuel conservation and a longer operational life have a down
side, because inclined orbits mean tracking problems for satellite
installations on Earth.

Other effects are that the footprint illuminated by an inclined orbit
satellite varies too, this can cause signal fluctuation.  SCPC, a
narrow band signal type, is even affected by Doppler shift, as the
velocity of the satellite changes so does the received frequency eg A
satellite inclined by 2 degrees changes frequency by a maximum of
1.5kHz.

Polar capped

One dealer has kept his eye on the ball and on these moving satellites.
 Smallworld Satellite of Birmingham has put together a winning
combination of the TSS Inclined Orbit Polar-mount, for which it has
sole UK distribution and the very latest 1500 channel Chaparral
Monterey 140 receiver-positioner.  Ordinary polar-mounts allow tracking
across the East-West arc but the TSS mount can be moved in elevation
too (up and down to you and me).  This is achieved through some rugged
galvanised steel metalwork and roller bearings which allow two
actuators to be attached, one for each plane of movement.  Control of
each actuator could be achieved by the use of a receiver positioner and
an additional positioner.  However, the smart consumer will opt for the
easy option, which is to use the Monterey 140.  The flagship receiver
has an inclined interface unit built-in and the effects were most
impressive.

ST was shown how a satellite position can be stored within the
receiver's memory.  On returning to that nominal position from another
satellite, the receiver stops.  It tracks East and West slightly to
peak the signal, but if the satellite has moved it will track the dish
up and then down, until a signal is traced.  It will then peak again,
side to side for optimum signal and repeat the process until a peak is
obtained.

Once locked onto a satellite, the receiver can be programmed to check
that maximum signal is being achieved by tracking imperceptibly in each
direction, without disrupting the signal.  This check can occur at
regular intervals with a time delay of one to 60 minutes.

When we used the system it was hooked up to a 2.5 metre prime focus
dish situated at Smallworld's showroom and roof-top dish site in
Birmingham, just off the M6 motorway.  We observed the Russian C-Band
TV signals from the wobbly 11 degrees West and 40 degrees East
satellites - they were tracked accurately and without a break.  When
the feed-horn was covered and tracking lost, the receiver caused the
two motors to track and signal was restored within a few seconds.

At the more usual Ku-Band, the higher frequency means that the
beamwidth, the tiny angle over which any satellite can be received
before it fades, is much reduced.  The test dish had a beamwidth of 0.8
between the 6dB signal points (see table 2).  A 6dB decrease in signal
strength is enough of a loss for signal near threshold to become
unwatchable.  However, even dishes of one metre diameter, with a beam-
width of nearer 1.5, suffer when Ku-Band satellites are inclined.  Just
try following a feed on the Eutelsat I F4 at 25.5 degrees, which moves
through a massive 4.2 degrees each day.  This system is a boon to
anyone wishing to track the satellites listed in our table 1 or for the
low elevation satellites that most polar mounts miss.

The TSS Inclined Polarmount can be used with a variety of dishes like
Trac, Triax, Precision, Channel Master suitable for adaptation.
Smallworld recommends an optical actuator arm for accurate North-South
tracking without backlash (hysteresis).  Besides the Monterey 140, some
other receivers such as Drake and Echostar can use the TSS mount.
Malcolm Titmus, Smallworld's proprietor can supply and install systems
for inclined orbit operation, normal multi-satellite systems and fixed
dish installations.  An inclined system has been installed at a
professional TV broadcaster's site; they no longer have to worry about
losing signal at a critical moment.  This was all achieved at the
fraction of the cost of previous tracking systems.  The TSS Inclined
Tracking Polarmount starts at #299.

MONTEREY'S LITTLE BROTHER

With its latest receiver, the m60e, chaparral has again proved it knows
how to manufacture a top class receiver.  Rob Ulrich took the new baby
home to play.

Currently there's a great demand for low cost receivers to be used as
fixed systems.  However, low cost usually means back to basics: poor
audio and video quality and no extra features like an on-screen
display, VCR timers, low threshold, etc.  What about the M60e? is the
Chaparral M60e a real basic product? Chaparral usually stands for high
tech and top quality, so has San Jose's finest sold out?

Chaparral is one of the leading manufacturers of LNBs, polarisers and
high-end satellite receivers.  At last year's Cable & Satellite show
Chaparral introduced the e-series providing low cost receivers for both
fixed and steerable systems.  Amsterdam's The Satellite Shop (TSS)
recently introduced the first model in the series, the M60e.  TSS is
the sole distributor for Europe for this receiver.

Design-wise M60e is very familiar.  The designers chose the same
styling as their previous creation, the Monterey 140.  The M60e is a
mid-sized satellite receiver, especially designed for fixed dishes.  A
four-digit LED-display is located on the front panel, as well as some
small buttons for channel up/down, volume and standby.  The back panel
is a surprise - Chaparral has introduced Scart sockets for connecting a
decoder and a VCR.  There are also phono outputs for audio, video and
baseband plus quick-fit connectors for an external 12 Volt device and a
mechanical polariser.  On both LNB inputs several LNB types can be
connected.  Not only LNBFs, such as a quatroband or an Astra Universal
LNBF, but also standard C and Ku-Band LNBs.  The M60e can also be used
in any multifeed or C/Ku-Band system.

The frequency range of the M60e runs from 950 to 2050MHz while the IF
bandwidth can be adjusted to 27, 18, 15 or 13MHz.  When choosing 13 or
15MHz the internal threshold extender is also activated.  Another
surprise on the M60e is the absence of an original Wegener audio
compander, a feature which always has been part of Chaparral receivers.
 The M60e is equipped with the Philips TDA 8741 chip - effectively the
next best thing to Wegener.  The audio channels are tuneable between
five and nine MHz and there are two audio IF bandwidths (150/330kHz).

The M60e has an easy to use on-screen display for (re-) programming the
200 channels.  The distributor has already programmed the channels with
the most popular stations on Astra and Eutelsat, but if you want to
change them all are freely programmable.

Pressing the Menu key on the remote control brings up the first on-
screen display menu page on the screen.  This menu page includes the
event timer, parental lock, copy mode, channel erase, frequency offset
and data transfer.  The event timer allows nine events to be recorded
over a period of four weeks.  Nine of the 200 channels can be stored as
favourites.  With the data transfer option the memory of one M60e can
be transferred to another M60e.  When menu key is pressed again, the
second menu page appears.  With this menu we can change the frequency,
LNB input, polarity (when a LNBF is connected) or skew (when using a
mechanical polariser), deviation and activate the internal 22kHz
generator for band switching with a quatroband LNBF.  The frequency
displayed on the menu is the IF frequency, in Normal (Ku-Band) mode
between 950 and 2050MHz, in Invert (C-Band) mode between 3100 and
4200MHz.  The third menu page (yes, after pressing on Menu again) is
the audio menu.  With this menu the audio frequency, de-emphasis and
bandwidth can all be adjusted.

In our testlab, we connected the M60e to an 80cm and a 1.40m dish to
get an impression of the video quality.  A Videotek video monitor was
used to provide information about the video.  The chroma delay of the
M60e is good compared to many other quality receivers.  Looking at the
picture more closely, we discovered less video noise than found on
other receivers.  Our overall impression of the video quality was very
good.

But what about the sound quality? As we said, the M60e is the first
Chaparral receiver without an original Wegener compander.  Comparing it
to, for instance, the Monterey 140 is not fair.  The M60e produces a
nice sound, but of course not as transparent as the Monterey 140.
That's why the price is low.  Besides that, only real Wegener
companders can reproduce the best Wegener sound.  The threshold
extender of the M60e expands the amount of weak signals which can be
received.  We did some experiments on Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.
Without using the threshold extender, we could only see a picture
covered with sparklies.  But when the bandwidth was switched to 13MHz,
Nile TV appeared on the screen minus the sparklies! We had the same
experience with the CMT signal on Intelsat 601 and some C-Band signals
on both Intelsat 702 and Arabsat 1C.  The quality of the picture is
surprisingly good.  Imagine what can happen with these signals when
using a 3m dish! Without any doubt the M60e is a very interesting
receiver for the Middle East and African countries, where the signal
strength is lower than in Europe.

In Europe the M60e can be used for receiving almost every satellite
signal.  After connecting several decoders (Pace VC100, Philips BDE 353
and Luxcrypt) the picture was as good as that on unencrypted signals.
It took only a few seconds until the decoders were activated.

The Chaparral M60e is an interesting and easy to use receiver with some
unique features.  We tried this impressive receiver on both C and Ku-
Band systems.  The threshold extender impressed and gave a big
advantage on weak signals, such as Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.  The
quality of both video and audio was good, exactly what we might expect
from Chaparral.  Most surprising is the price.  The new small Chaparral
receiver will retail for only #199.

FASTER, HIGHER, FURTHER

Satellite offers the whole gamut of sporting action.  Touchline
reporter Julian Clover looks at who has the top events and finds Sky is
not the only place to watch the premiership.

Each year there are key events which stand out in the sporting calendar
and every year satellite television, or should that read Sky, helps
itself to more of them.  There is no doubting the pulling power of
Premiership Football, World Cup Cricket or Formula 1 motor racing to
encourage that purchasing decision.

Sky continues to add to its sports roster to the frustration of the
terrestrial channels, and assorted backbench MPs, while Eurosport is
often able to supplement network television with extended coverage of
events such as Formula 1 alongside its own exclusives.  FilmNet has now
spun off Supersport as a standalone channel in both the Benelux and
Nordic countries, though this will only be available to the few able to
access digital transmissions.  Sportkanalen, in D2 Mac, will join the
virtually free-to-air package at five degrees East in March.

Super Sunday and Monday Night Football have become key fixtures in
themselves throughout the football season and will be joined in the
autumn by fixtures from the Endsleigh League.  Sky claims that this
will cover all three divisions and not just the clubs in Division One.
Full Saturday afternoon coverage of every game on the Premiership
programme may have to wait until digital makes its UK debut, but
Scandinavian viewers can already tune in.  Saturday afternoons on NRK
(in clear D Mac from Intelsat 702) or TV2 (encrypted in D2 Mac).  These
are typically the matches being taped for BBC1's Match of the Day later
that evening.  TV Pluss also shows delayed matches from around
18.00CET.  Sweden's TV4 from Sirius also has the rights to screen
Saturday afternoon matches.

FilmNet and SuperSport subscribers can also view English Premiership
matches, normally screened simultaneously with Sky, although Monday
night matches on FilmNet 1 (formerly FilmNet Plus) are normally time
delayed by about an hour.  FilmNet/SuperSport's commitment to football
also takes in coverage of the Dutch, Italian and German leagues,
according to which version you watch.  FilmNet (Central Europe) from
Astra in VideoCrypt II continues to screen occasional local matches
from Poland.

SuperSport is currently available as a standalone channel on cable to
Belgium, Holland and Scandinavia.  It's distributed by satellite in
digital format from Astra and Intelsat 601.  Availability will increase
in line with the roll-out of digital reception equipment.

Naturally the German broadcasters have extensive coverage of the
Bundesliga; Sat1 follows the fortunes in its programme Ran.  German
Internation-als are typically live on ARD or ZDF.  Channel 4's Italian
football feed can be found on Eutelsat II F3 while the sole purpose of
Rai Tre's Sunday only broadcasts are for the late night round up of the
weekend's matches.

Rugby Super League coverage begins on March 29 as the Sheffield Eagles
travel to France to play the newly formed Paris team.  Sky is promising
to screen every Super League club at least twice in the first two
months of the season.

Eurosport's great strength lies in its ability to stay with an event
and nothing will be more true this summer when it provides 24 hour
coverage of the Olympic Games in Atlanta.  In addition to continuing
Formula One coverage Eurosport will screen live each round of the
Indycar World Series.  British drivers Mark Blundell and Johnny Herbert
have both been offered drives.  The Motorcycle Grand Prix season will
also be shown in full, live and exclusive.

Slightly slower bicycles, though not by far, will be on display in the
Tour de France.  Eurosport will also be screening European PGA Golf,
Equestrian World Cup and the Ice Hockey World Cup.

The Racing Channel continues to cover typically two, sometimes three
race meetings daily.  This is supplemented by the return of evening
racing in Sky Sports The Winning Post, produced by The Racing Channel
alongside the early morning Racing News.

DOING IT BY THE BOOK

Installation practices need tightening up now that digital is on the
way, writes Bill Collins

It is no secret that the world of television and radio is heading
towards digital, raising new issues in respect of installation
practice.  To help installers, Astra will soon be publishing a new
Guide to Professional Dish Installation which is specifically designed
to address these issues.  The original brochure, which has proved very
popular since its original publication in 1993, contains tips and
reminders on how to avoid problems when installing analogue satellite
systems.  The new guide is concerned not only with the practicalities
of satellite dish installation but also understanding the differences
that digital will make and helping installers to avoid the pitfalls.

Digital transmission relies on a different modulation technique to the
earlier analogue satellite signals whose modulation was different to
terrestrial broadcasts.  These differences are important for installers
in that they create different reactions to similar problems in
installation.  A small error in cabling which can cause teletext drop-
out on a terrestrial installation can cause sparklies on an analogue
satellite system.  The same error on a digital installation can
completely obliterate the signal.

Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) is the modulation technique used for
transmission of digital signals via satellite.  The reception of QPSK
signals depends fundamentally on the receiver recognising the phase of
the incoming signal.  It follows that any defect in the reception
system that interferes with the signal phase will substantially degrade
the reception.  A dictionary definition of phase is given as `That
fraction of the period which has elapsed in a periodic function or wave
measured from some fixed origin' Another way of looking at it is the
position along the peaks and troughs of a waveform.

If the time for one period is represented as 360 degrees along a time
axis, the phase position, at any particular moment, is called the phase
angle.  For example the phase angle at the position marked `X' in
Figure 1 is 225 degrees.  Recognition of the phase angle is simple
where the signal is clearly defined but any interference effects that
disturb, or otherwise disguise, the phase can be the source of serious
problems for digital reception.

By far the most common cause of phase disturbance is mismatching in the
system.  Impedance changes generate reflections of the main signal that
can bounce backwards and forwards within a network.  These impedance
changes are known as mismatches.  The reflections show as standing
waves on the cable which, because they are of the same
frequency/wavelength as the original signal, will be combined by the
receiver and seen as a single waveform which may have completely
different characteristics to the original.

A mismatch can be caused by a number of factors.  Physical damage to
the cable, poorly made connections, water ingress, or even just kinking
of the cable by making a bend too tight are all common causes of
mismatching.  Poor quality cable can show `ripple,' a kind of built in
mismatch caused by low grade production machinery and methods, even
with no induced faults caused during installation

Figure 2 illustrates some of the effects of a mismatch.  When the
original signal reaches the mismatch point some of it is reflected back
along the cable.  One effect of this is to lower the signal level
initially passing through the mismatch point to the receiver.  Secondly
the reflected signal passing back along the cable will generate further
reflections at previous mismatches or even the connection at the signal
origin.  The phase, or peaks and troughs, of each of these reflections
will have different positions to the original waveform.

The resulting signal arriving at the receiver is a combination of both
the waveforms (a) and (b) at the right-hand side of the mismatch point.
 The amplitude, shape and phase of the signal seen by the receiver, as
shown in Figure 3, can be radically different to the original.  By its
very nature this article can only offer a simple illustration of what
is a very complex problem.  Within a satellite system the reflections
and their standing waves are infinitely more complex than that shown
here.

The effect on phase of even a single standing wave can be sufficient to
prevent reception of a digital TV channel, but in a real installation
there may be a very large number of mismatch reflections combining at
the receiver.  Care and attention to detail and use of good quality
materials has always been the mark of the true professional.  This will
be even more applicable in the digital future than it is today.
Whereas earlier modulation techniques were more forgiving in terms of
installation quality, digital allows little room for error.

OPEN UP THE BOX

It's time to grab a screwdriver, and to prise the lid off the box to
see what's inside.  How are digital decoders organised and why do they
cost as much as they do? Gwyn Morgan explains.

In the last two articles we have taken a look at the theoretical side
of digital television, how vision and sound compression works and how
the `packets' of data are numbered and labelled in tables so that the
decoders know how to sort them out and put them into television
services.  Now it's time to open up the box and look inside.

If we are talking about DTH digital satellite television then we really
need to start outside the house at the LNB attached to the dish which
in most cases will need to be changed for digital reception.  You can
broadcast digital services on almost any satellite using almost any
frequency and all sorts of bandwidths from very narrow to very wide.
But for Direct-to-Home consumer services virtually all the digital
channels will be broadcast in the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services)
frequency bands.  So far we have been used to Astra and Eutelsat
services broadcast in the FSS range from 10.7 to 11.7 Gigahertz (GHz).
Virtually all the LNBs installed until recent months will only work
between this range of FSS frequencies.  The digital services will
operate at a higher frequency range from 11.7 to 12.75GHz.

The extra frequencies are not the only reason that new LNBs are needed
for digital satellite reception.  Digital signals are rugged and can
resist interference and noise very effectively but digital equipment is
much more susceptible to "jitter" than analogue equipment.  Jitter, or
"Phase Noise" is the equivalent of a continual small change in
frequency caused by noise or lack of stability of the oscillator in the
LNB.  Lack of stability might itself be caused by poor regulation of
the low voltage power supply from the cable.

The new Universal LNBs are now recommended for all satellite
installations.  They will receive all the analogue services that are
available today but they will also tune to the BSS frequencies for
digital services when they arrive.  Universal LNBs will also provide
the high stability, or low "phase noise" that is essential to feed
digital receivers.

Once the signal lands inside the receiver the first thing it meets is
the tuner-demodulator.  A digital tuner/demodulator is rather different
from the analogue version.  It will probably look the same - a small
shiny tin box on the PCB - and in essence it will do much the same
task.  First it tunes to the correct carrier frequency for the service
you need and filters out one group or "multiplex" of digital services
from a particular transponder on the satellite.  The digital data is
carried on the satellite signal using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
(QPSK) which is very loosely a digital equivalent of the FM (frequency
modulation) used for analogue services.  An analogue tuner/demodulator
will not work for digital signals.  The digital QPSK demodulator
extracts the original Os and 1s that were inserted at the transmission
point.

The next task for the tuner/demodulator is to remove the "Forward Error
Correction" a sort of digital equivalent of a postal jiffy bag.

In the last article we saw how all the digital packets are sorted and
labelled and assembled into a "Transport Stream".  The transmission
path from broadcaster to receiver can get very nasty with noise,
interfering frequencies, fading and all the many disasters that the
signals encounter on the way.  So to keep the transport stream from
being damaged beyond recognition it needs to be neatly packaged in its
digital jiffy bag which naturally needs a suitably technical title.  It
is called Forward Error Correction because you add the correction data
before you transmit the signal, fully expecting that the signal is
going to get pushed, punched and stamped on as it makes its way to
through the airwaves.

Forward error correction works in several different ways.  First it
mixes up the order that the data is transmitted.  The chances are that
interference will come as a burst of noise that comes and goes - just
like a noisy motorbike driving past your house.  If you mix up the bits
so that some of the early parts of the transmission are transmitted
next to some of the later parts then the effect of the burst of noise
will be less noticeable because it will be spread out and will affect
isolated parts of the transmission.  This technique is called
convolutional coding.

On its own mixing up the bits and changing their sequence is not
enough.  You have to add extra data bits as well as mix up the data.
The extra data lets the decoder do some simple arithmetic to check that
the digital bits have been received correctly.  For example if I said
that all the words I wrote would have a number after them (4) to (2)
say (3) how (3) many (4) letters (7) there should be in each word you
would soon tell if something was incorrect (5) (= wrong).  The larger
the number of extra bits you add so the more errors you can correct but
of course the transmission then becomes less efficient overall so there
is always a trade-off to make.

When the decoder finds that some of the data has been corrupted on the
way it does not have to give up and throw it away.  When it discovers
there are errors the arithmetic will not only let it correct some of
the errors, but if things get really bad the decoder will make a best
guess at what the data should have been, using a technique called
Viterbi.

When the digital bits are flying in at a rate of tens of millions bits
per second then the forward error correction circuits in the decoder do
not have much time to hang around.  This technology alone is a high
tech function that needs specially dedicated, fast integrated circuits.

But the fact that a digital receiver can correct lots of errors does
not provide any leeway for poor installations.  In analogue FM
transmission you get some warning that reception might be poor because
there is a relatively smooth slope as the signal becomes worse and the
sparklies appear on the screen.  With digital technology it is more
like a cliff-edge than a slope.  Once you reach the point where the
receiver cannot cope with the errors the whole process suddenly comes
to a halt without any real warning and that is much more disturbing
than a smooth onset of sparklies.  For that reason a good installation
has to provide a large margin above the point of failure so that signal
failure becomes a very rare event.

So far we have barely got past the first part of the decoder and we
have already encountered some exotic technology.

One transponder could be carrying eight or more programme services in
the "multiplex" or "transport stream" of data.  The next stage of the
decoder is called the de-multiplexer which picks out the particular
items that the viewer has chosen.  Assume the viewer chooses a
particular programme which will have a picture and stereo sound.  The
tables that are transmitted with the transport stream explain which
packet numbers belong to which programme so when the viewer selects say
Discovery then the demultiplexer might be told to find all the packets
labelled 72 for the vision and the packets labelled 24 for the sound.
The demultiplexer is like the signal box in a railway shunting yard
which sets the points to send some packets off to the vision circuits
and others off to the sound circuits but unlike a railway shunting yard
it can throw away all the packets it does not need.

Now things are much clearer because we have a stream of digital vision
signals and a stream of digital sound signals which belong to one
television service.

The vision packets go to the vision decompression chip and the next
article will look at all this and all the other components that go to
create a digital decoder.

HEAVENS ABOVE

37.5oW: Orion 1

Following last month's Channel One (UK) deal, Orion and NTL have bagged
another UK cable channel.  Perfor-mance - The Arts Channel is to
deliver to cable via this satellite too, using the NTL London uplink.
Black Entertainment Television starts digital transmission here for
cable distribution this year.

27.5oW: Intelsat 601

Temporary access to TCC and Discovery is now possible with a 1.2 metre
dish through much of Europe, the channels share 11055MHz horizontal,
Tp.  72A.  This is a feed into Thor, besides main Swedish at 6.65MHz
there are four soundtracks for Scandinavia, 7.02MHz Norwegian, 7.20MHz
Danish and 7.38MHz Finnish.  Transmissions are in clear Pal.  CMT
Europe's signal looks like it has improved.

3oE: Telecom 1C & 2C

Ariane Flight 81 did its job and Telecom 2C is already on station.
Transfer of Ku-Band services is imminent and the use of the new
horizontal Ku-Band transponders at this location.  The disappearance of
that old familiar Mulhouse Telecom 1 test-card, which has been with
Telecom viewers for at least the last six years, will herald the
operational use of the new generation Telecom satellite.  Telecom 2C is
also a military communications spacecraft as it has the Syracuse 2
system operating at 7/8GHz.  The actual launch from Kourou, French
Guiana, was at 2323GMT December 6.  Expect some digital transmissions
here.

5oE Tele-X & Sirius

Confirmation of the number of digital channels on Tele-X; Telenor has
two Danish channels, two Swedish channels and one Norwegian channel all
around 12322MHz.  Kinnevik has encoded the TV6 signal in D2 Mac.  TV3
and ZTV have just scrambled too.

10oE: Eutelsat II F2

Med TV had an off-day recently when the Smartcrypt from the feed
channel ended up on the main output.  Med TV has claimed that attempts
to disrupt its signal were made recently.  It is not clear if the
uplink to this satellite or the feeds between sites were the target.
Nor is it clear if there really was a deliberate attempt to jam a
satellite transponder, which would be a first in Europe, although there
have been many accidental instances.  London, that unlikely haven of
clandestine TV, has a new potential visitor; Serb TV is the next
station to try to gain a UK uplink licence, much to the probable
embarrassment of the UK Government.  The studios will be in Paris.  A
feed into TV2 Denmark used 11163MHz horizontal.

13oE: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1

Latest arrival, in clear Pal with stereo at 7.02/7.2 and slightly low
level audio is Onyx, a long expected fifth German music channel.  It
airs 18 hours a day with a mix of music to appeal to a more mature
audience.  11146MHz is the frequency, trans-ponder 22A.  Auto-noumus
Televisao de Catalunya has appeared again, last seen at 11492MHz
vertical, transponder 14.  The audio feed of BBC World Service on NBC
Super Channel 7.38 MHz is now WRN2 with Vatican Radio.  A rather small
media player, the sole 12GHz broadcaster on this satellite, AB1 Channel
of France, is the beginning of yet another, French digital channel
package, this is the seventh to be announced.  The transponder may
still be able to preempted by other users, as a feed for Reuters was
noted.  Polonia 1, which retreated to the upper half of Tp.34 on this
satellite when legal pressure forced it off terrestrial transmitters,
is re-launched in the market with more sports and music.  TRT on
11818MHz is now accompanied by an FM Turkish radio on 7.02/7.2 MHz.
Tp.45, 11542 MHz is earmarked for Italy's Telepiu to compress six TV
channels.

16oE: Eutelsat II F3

Telepace, the channel from Vatican TV has had some extended programming
lately and may be expanding.  This is a good satellite for feeds;
11163MHz can be quiet but saw a TF1 feed from the Russian capital.
After 1800GMT that channel is used by Thaiwave, the DM56 per month
channel.  It feeds into BT London from Bangkok via an Intelsat feed.
Its future scrambling system is not settled.  The schedule is planned
to be 1800-2300 GMT, starting at 1400 at weekends but has yet to
materialise.  It is presently Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat & Sun from 1800-
2000GMT.  11638MHz is used for feeds sometimes and 12542MHz is active
too.  Apna TV has not been seen again on this satellite, nor Ku-Band
Gorizont.

19.2oE: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1E

More MPEG-2 tests are being seen above 11700MHz from Astra 1E and some
digital tests used Astra 1D as well.  Actual broadcasts from ARD and
ZDF have started being up-linked from Betzdorf to 11836MHz horizontal.
Canalsatellite of France has left Astra 1D tests behind and settled on
Astra 1E transponders 66, 11739MHz vertical and Tp.70, 11817MHz
vertical.  On 11953.5 and 11993MHz, transponders 77 and 80 are being
used by Nethold.  Beacon frequency for the satellite is 11202 vertical
and 10948.5MHz horizontal and it is actually at 19.15 degrees East.
The channels and video being shown on most of the above frequencies
change frequently, while there is no audience.  Although Astra 1E is
going to have a slow start, Astra 1F is due to launch next month.
Rival Hot Bird 2 does not fly until October.  A new name for Tp.  11
FilmNet Plus on Astra, it is now FilmNet 1.  Daytime Tp.  49 110714 MHz
horizontal is filled by 11 hours of Nickelodeon Germany, Arte uses the
evening slot.  Arte also shares with La Cinquieme on 13 degrees East
and five degrees West.  New to Astra 1D is Tp.  61 Home Order
Television, German tele-shopping with an uncluttered screen.  The
channel is due to move to Astra 1E this year.  America One radio
launched as expected on 11538MHz at 7.74MHz with some shared
programming with WRN1 on 7.38MHz.  On Pro 7, Star*Sat Radio and Radio
Ropa have ceased analogue transmission and gone ADR, where Germany
leads the way.  The ADR versus analogue score is 53 analogue against 40
digital, not counting the DMX channels.

48oE: DFS1 Kopernikus

This satellite has gone walkabout twice in recent months.  The first
amble was in late November, the second in mid-December.  The satellite
formerly known as Kopernikus 1, once a full TV satellite, seems to be
potential space junk.  Using the beacons to track it, it was last
tracked moving East, a long way from the supposed 33.5 degrees East
home.  The satellite may never now return to anything near operational
use.

CRICKET VICTORY IS OPENING BOUNCER AS CABLE DECLARES WAR ON MURDOCH

UK cable operators led by the US regional telephone companies are
willing to invest large sums in cable-only programming to mount a major
challenge to British Sky Broadcasting's dominance of new-media
channels.  They say that their surprise #7.5 million purchase of all UK
rights to the 1996 Cricket World Cup will be the first of many
programme ventures in the near future.

The operators will bid for further sports rights, films and events and
look to launch new niche channels, including local and ethnic services.
 They will commission original British programming to compete against
``the more American'' Rupert Murdoch, 50-per-cent owner of BSkyB.  This
is likely to involve co-operative deals with independent television
companies and possibly investments in, as well as commissions for,
independent production companies.

The cable operators and telephone companies plan to launch an Asian
channel later this year, produced by Yorkshire Television.  A sports
channel is also likely to be launched, a spin-off from Wire TV, the
lifestyle and sports channel owned by the group which bought the
cricket rights.

The telephone companies, like the biggest of the cable operators,
TeleCommunications Inc, are rich enough to fund the drive towards more
and better programming.  As one telephone-company executive put it,
``the #7.5 million for cricket rights is small change if you look at
the millions we're putting into building cable.''

But what about the less rich, middle-sized cable companies?  Can
they afford programming investment?  According to the same executive,
``they recognise, as much as we do, that there is a ``need to create
cable-controlled production so Murdoch cannot go on telling us what to
do.''

Only the cable operators were prepared to offer the money being asked
for the World Cricket Cup rights asked by rights owner WorldTel.  There
was no bidding.

BSkyB, the BBC and Channel Four were interested -- but unwilling to talk
the same language (see separate story).

The cable operators argue that, although BSkyB's channels are the
programming powerhouse in UK new media, the situation must not be
allowed to continue ad infinitum.  They respect the pioneering work
done by Murdoch in developing satellite programming, but they are
determined that he should not be allowed to control the destiny of
cable because of his dominance in programming.

The cable operators have always regarded cable-only programming as
important, but the only operator with the cash and will to get into
programming in a major way has been TeleCommunications Inc.  TCI, which
transmits some of its channels on the Astra direct-to-home satellite,
spent many months persuading the operators to get together to form
Cable Programme Partners 1 to launch Wire TV last May.

CPP1, comprising three telephone companies (US West, Nynex and
Southwestern Bell) and two US cable operators (Comcast and TCI), has
gradually become a forum for strategic thinking on cable programming,
``no longer worrying about what's going to be on Wire at 7.30pm,'' as
one member put it (though by no means all the group is happy with the
channel).  The purchase of the Cricket World Cup rights has accelerated
this movement, galvanising the operators to consider: What next?

The CCP 1 operators will be joined by two others -- General Cable, which
has several franchises in Yorkshire, and Jones Cable, which runs the
Leeds franchise -- to launch a new Asian channel, Hum.  The operators,
which will form a new partnership (CPP 2), will provide some upfront
funding for production and start-up, but talks are continuing with
Yorkshire TV, which will produce the channel, over whether it will also
take a stake and over what kind of access it will have to advertising
time.

The operators do not believe that the existing channels, TV Asia,
AsiaNet (formerly Asiavision) and Namaste Asia Television, are good
enough and that a much better service could be provided.  Yorkshire
suggested a range of possible schedules to the operators, with varying
quantities of original, UK-produced and bought-in programmes.  Hum
(Hindi for ``all of us'' or ``mine'') would show films, factual
programmes, soaps, children's programmes and music.

The channel is a good example of local or ethnic programming which
cable is well-suited to provide.  Narrowcasting and regionalism will be
important weapons in cable's battle against BSkyB, according to Robin
Williamson, executive director of US West.  As part of this, the
operators will have to build links with the UK independent production
community, which at the moment relies on ITV and Channel Four for most
of its business.

However, the new economics of the ITV sector are changing.  Independent
companies are having to find new markets for their product as the ITV
market consolidates, and Williamson suggests that cable operators may
invest directly in the companies and their facilities.  Direct co-
operation with the production arms of the ITV companies themselves is
also a possibility.

Senior ITV executives such as Ted Childs, head of drama at Central
Television, and Jonathan Powell, heads of drama at Carlton, point out
that the trend in ITV is towards a separation of production from the
business of running a channel.  Stand-alone production subsidiaries
have been created at all the ITV companies, and these subsidiaries are
being encouraged to mould themselves as separate profit centres.

This pushes them towards taking in partners, such as international
partners, BSkyB or the cable companies.  Programmes, Childs and Powell
say, could be produced by the production ``arms'' and never get shown
on the ITV network.

One of the toughest areas facing the cable operators is the provision
of feature films, given BSkyB's virtual monopoly of pay-television
rights to Hollywood films for the foreseeable future.

That has left the pay-per-view rights to go for, with the operators
leaving the job to the London Interconnect group of operators, which
wants to launch a film ppv service this spring over the system linking
their networks.  Most of the operators own systems across the country,
so a national roll-out would start, hopefully, towards the end of the
year, using digital compression on a satellite transponder provided by
TCI.

The Interconnect group consists of TeleWest (comprising TCI and US
West, both members of CCP1), Nynex and Comcast (also members of CCP1),
General Cable (CPP2), Videotron and Encom (run by Bell Canada).

Hollywood has stymied a spring launch, the operators' second attempt to
get a film service going.  According to one Interconnect executive, the
film studios are uncertain of the merits of pay-per-view, given its
disappointing performance in the USA.

The London operators say that talks are ``ongoing'' and they still hope
to reach agreement.  Some cable executives believe, however, that the
studios have not seriously put the ppv rights ``in play''.  According
to Williamson, US West, the largest single shareholder in Time Warner,
will be given the opportunity to join any bidding for Warner Bros ppv
rights.

Williamson believes that the UK could ``probably sustain a number of
movie channels''.  The top films will be hard to get.  But there are
alternatives.  Film distribution company, Odyssey Film Distributors,
for instance, is planning its own cable-exclusive channel, drawing on a
library of mini-series, US made-for-television product and B movies.
CPP could also conceivably strike deals with other independent
distributors.

ONLY CABLE ACCEPTS SOARING VALUE OF CRICKET CUP

The cable operators' #7.5 million acquisition of rights to the 1996
Cricket World Cup took the terrestrial broadcasters and British Sky
Broadcasting by surprise.  The cable operators were for the first time
bidding for major sports rights -- and were prepared to go far higher
than the rest of the players.

The players -- the cable operators' Cable Programme Partners 1, British
Sky Broadcasting, Channel Four and the BBC -- did not formally bid.
Instead, WorldTel, which owned the rights, told them that it valued the
rights at #7.5 million.  Only the cable operators said they were
willing to pay that price.

BSkyB had paid #1 million for the 1992 cup.  Four years earlier the BBC
had paid #150,000.  So did the operators pay too much?  That will not
be clear for some time, though they did buy more rights than BSkyB and
BBC had bought for the earlier competitions.

The operators are taking all UK rights, including those for all forms
of live and delayed terrestrial, microwave, DTH and cable transmission
and for all video, radio and advertising.  They could sell many of
these on to terrestrial broadcasters, particularly those for delayed
television transmission and radio.

Mark Mascarenhas, president of WorldTel, says that his valuation was in
line with the growing cost of sports events worldwide.  A one-day
cricket international, he argues, has 71 minutes of advertising slots
within it and should be priced accordingly.

BSkyB was surprised by the valuation, even though it has been as
responsible as anybody for lifting the price of rights in recent years,
accepting that they had been undervalued.  The low values were to a
large extent the result of the main customer being the BBC, which does
not carry advertising.

ITV then started competing more fiercely and BSkyB came on to the
scene, with Murdoch showing ``genius'' in understanding the need for a
higher valuation and winning several high-profile events.  At the same
time, sports governing bodies grew more adept at valuing their own
product and television revenues became more important to the sports
themselves.

No one is suggesting that Murdoch is taking a more cautious line.
Recently, he paid #1 billion for the rights to North American football
games for his Fox television network, taking them away from CBS.

MEDIA BODIES COULD FORCE KIRCH TO CUT PRO 7 STAKE

A group of German state media authorities is threatening to force the
Kirch family to sell part of its stake in film-based television channel
Pro 7, on the grounds that the holding may be in breach of German rules
on the concentration of ownership in the new-media sector.

Fourteen out of the 15 authorities have told Pro 7 -- which is 47.5-per-
cent owned by Thomas Kirch, son of media magnate Leo Kirch -- that it
must provide details of its finances to prove that it is independent.
They say that the information must be supplied by the end of this
month.  Pro 7 has so far refused to comply.

The group of authorities -- which includes all except the media
authority of Schleswig-Holstein, the authority which actually granted
Pro 7 its licence to broadcast -- dispute the channel's claim that the
Thomas Kirch shareholding is entirely independent of Leo Kirch's
control.  They argue that it should be treated as part of the Leo Kirch
empire which includes stakes in the general-entertainment channel Sat
1, the pay-television channel Premiere and the sports channel DSF.

They say that the Kirch holding in Pro 7 should thus be no more than 25
per cent -- the maximum level that would be allowed if the stake were
held by Leo Kirch directly.

The group of authorities say that if the channel refuses to co-operate
they will put pressure on Schleswig-Holstein to strip the channel of
its licence.  Schleswig-Holstein has up to now supported the channel,
but could find it difficult to maintain this position if it is opposed
by everybody else.

The 14 authorities have told Pro 7 to submit financial information on
three specific points which they believe will resolve the question of
Pro 7's independence.  But Pro 7 says that it will not supply the
information on the grounds that it is ``commercially sensitive.''

First, the authorities want Pro 7 to supply details of the financial
circumstances surrounding Thomas Kirch's original 1988 investment in
the channel's predecessor, Eureka TV.  The authorities say that there
is no indication as to where Thomas Kirch could have raised the money
other than from his father.

Second, the authorities require information about the arrangements that
the channel made with its banks to cover its debt in the years
following its relaunch as Pro 7 in January 1989.  They suspect that Pro
7's bank loans were guaranteed by Leo Kirch.

Third, the authorities want details of the film-supply deals which Pro
7 has with companies owned by Leo Kirch.  The authorities believe that
Pro 7 has been given preferential terms which involve it being allowed
to delay payment for films, and also to pay for films on an individual
basis.

They say that if the required information is not supplied by the
beginning of April, they will seek to persuade Schleswig-Holstein to
rescind Pro 7's licence immediately.

If Pro 7 does comply with the request, but the information does not
demonstrate that the channel is independent, the authorities will
demand that Thomas Kirch should reduce his share in the channel below
25 per cent within one year -- with the threat of licence removal if he
does not comply.

George Kofler, chief executive of Pro 7 and a minority shareholder,
says that the channel will not comply with the authorities' requests,
which he claims are part of a political campaign against the channel,
resulting from the Kirch family's affiliation with the right-wing CSU
party.

Kofler says that he has shown all the cited documents to the media
authority of Schleswig-Holstein and that circulating the documents to
the other 14 authorities could lead to leakage of sensitive commercial
information on issues such as programme-supply contracts.

He says that the director of the Schleswig-Holstein media authority,
Gernot Schumann, was satisfied with the information, and so the o0her
authorities should allow Pro 7 to continue without further
interference.  He does not believe that Schumann will order any action
against Pro 7.

Kofler argues that Thomas Kirch's original acquisition of a stake in
the channel did not cost that much because it was made at a time when
Eureka TV was effectively a ``bankrupt station.''  He adds that the
channel's backers have not had to put in any more money since then
because investment has been financed by bank loans and by ploughing
back into the company any surplus from advertising, which has grown
steadily as Pro 7 has grown into the third most popular private channel
in Germany after RTL-tv and Sat 1.

A total of DM150 million was invested for the relaunch, since when
advertising revenues have climbed steadily, growing from DM11 million
in 1989 to DM45 million in 1990, DM165 million in 1991 and DM400
million in 1992.  The channel is thought to have taken DM600 million in
1993 and is projected to take DM650 million in 1994.

Kofler adds that Pro 7's banking arrangements have satisfied Schleswig-
Holstein's financial experts -- despite the suspicions of the other
authorities about the involvement of Leo Kirch.

On the specific question of programme acquisition, he says that Pro 7
buys its material on the same terms as every other channel.

The media authorities deny that their action has a political nature.
They say that Pro 7 must convince them all of its independence -- not
just Schleswig-Holstein.  They say that the burden of proof rests with
Pro 7, and that if the channel cannot prove its independence, then it
will be treated on the same basis as it would be if it were 47.5-per-
cent-owned by Leo Kirch himself.

Schumann argues that this is the wrong approach.  He believes that the
burden of proof on disputed questions of media ownership rests with the
media authorities.  Since they cannot prove Pro 7's connection with Leo
Kirch, he says, they should leave the channel alone.

Leo Kirch's shareholdings in German television comprise: 43 per cent in
the full-service general-entertainment channel, Sat 1; 25 per cent in
the thematic pay channel Premiere; and 24.5 per cent in the thematic
sports channel DSF.

Other cases: The media authorities have been considering several cases
where there have been worries about concentration of ownership, but
have decided to take no further action beyond that which is in process
already.

RTL2, which has in the past been a source of concern to the authorities
on the grounds that the coupling of CLT and Bertelsmann amongst the
shareholders matched the position in RTL-tv, is no longer seen as a
problem because the authorities accept that the two companies are not
working in concert in either case.

Other ownership questions, such as that of Bertelsmann's share of Vox
(Satellite TV Finance 4:13), are already being addressed separately.

CHANNELS WANT CHANGES TO OWNERSHIP RULES

Private television companies in Germany are calling for changes in the
law on the ownership of cable and satellite channels to ease the
introduction of new channels based on digital compression.  They say
that the number of new channels will be greatly reduced unless the
regulations are changed.

The programme-providers want changes to the rules limiting the number
of themed channels they are allowed to own.  They say that the present
rules, which impose severe limits, will result in too many new channels
being owned by smaller or new-to-television companies, which are less
likely to have the expertise to operate successful themed channels.

The existing rules, they say, will also encourage foreign companies to
beam channels into Germany, for instance from the UK or Luxembourg, to
take advantage of unfulfilled opportunities.  Digital compression is
likely to be introduced in two to three years.

Dr Peter Luke, head of the legal department at Sat 1, which is keen on
the changes, said that the company does not have specific plans for
themed channels but wants the law changed for the good of the German
television industry.

The Verband Privater Rundfunk Telekommunikation, which represents the
private channels, is also worried about the existing rules on political
balance in themed channels.  It accepts that ``full-service'' channels
should have to provide balanced coverage of news and current affairs,
but that it should be unnecessary for themed channels: there will be
many, perhaps hundreds of themed channels and political balance will be
achieved across the whole range, taken together.

The programme providers say that themed channels should be exempted
from some of the regulations because they will be so numerous and get
such small audiences -- even now the channels attract less than a two-
per-cent viewing share each compared with more than 10 per cent for the
most popular ``full-service'' channels, and because they cover single
issues, such as particular sports or types of music or hobbies, where
it could be unreasonable to expect strict impartiality.

The media authorities are sceptical about changing the regulations.
Lothar Jene, deputy director of the Hamburg media authority, said that
relaxing or removing the regulations could lead to channels defining
themselves as themed channels but still broadcasting general-
entertainment programming.  He thought that the media authorities would
be unlikely to deregulate the channels.  Joachim Becker, deputy
director of the Hessen media authority, also thought that a change in
the law was unlikely.

Ingebord Ludwig, a legal adviser at the Berlin-Brandenburg authority,
was more encouraging.  She said that the likely proliferation of
channels could lead to a relaxation because it would not be sensible to
restrict very small channels.

The present law lays down that a company may own more than 25 per cent
of only one full-service channel (that is, one which shows a range of
programming) and up to 25 per cent of as many as it likes.  It can also
own more than 25 per cent of one themed channel and, again, up to 25
per cent of as many as it likes.

A company which does not own a full-service channel can own more than
25 per cent of two themed channels and up to 25 per cent of as many
others as it likes.  Themed news channels are restricted as if they
were full-service channels.

MTV MAY BE ONLY MEMBER OF SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGE

MTV Europe, the satellite pop-music channel, may be the only member of
an encrypted subscription package to Astra dish homes launched in
Germany this autumn.  Other UK channels which have been hoping to join
the Selco marketing package, set up by the Kirch family's Pro 7 and
Rupert Murdoch's News Datacom, are unlikely to have sorted out rights
problems in time to join the package at launch.

Selco believes that MTV, encrypted in News Datacom's Videocrypt system,
will attract between 200,000 and 300,000 subscribers over two years --
compared with the present Astra dish market in Germany of 4.5 million.
So MTV would lose the bulk of its German dish market -- and possibly
some advertising revenue -- for the sake of a relatively small amount of
subscription revenue.

The move, part of a German-wide and European-wide switch to encryption
for the channel, is an ambitious one, given its present German market,
and flies in the face of the accepted wisdom for pay-channels to stick
together in numbers.  MTV refused to comment.  However, German
television executives believe that MTV's strength in the German market
gives the channel a better chance than most of making a stand-alone
subscription offer work.

Astra dish owners in Germany will initially have to pay a monthly
subscription of between DM5 and DM10 to receive MTV -- on top of buying
a videocrypt decoder costing between DM200 (#79) and DM300.  When other
channels join Selco, MTV could be sold as part of the package, which is
what Selco would prefer, or as a stand-alone service attached to the
main package.

The channel has already reached an agreement with Deutsche Telekom in
which it will receive a fee for distribution to the company's near-14
million cable subscribers -- in return for the channel continuing to be
distributed in the clear.  MTV will continue to pay Deutsche Telekom
about DM1 million a year for the downlinking of the channel signal, but
will now end up slightly in the black.  The channel is seeking a
similar deal with the private cable operators.

In the UK, the channel is set to encrypt and join the Sky Multi-
Channels package this autumn.  It is also talking to Filmnet about
inclusion in its MultiChoice Kaleidoscope mini-pay package sold in
Benelux and Scandinavia and due to be extended to Hungary, the Czech
Republic and Portugal.  Further talks are taking place with cable
operators in several European countries.

Selco was due to launch a package of four to six encrypted English-
language Astra channels to DTH homes in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland this April, but put back the launch because of their
difficulty in clearing German-market rights.  It will provide
subscription-management services such as billing, smartcard
distribution, and customer support.

MTV will retain control over the subscription fee, at least while it is
the only channel in the package.  It is unlikely to have little left
after paying Selco's costs, but the terms of the deal are still being
negotiated.

The channel is calling for what amounts to a larger fee-per-subscriber
from Germany's private cable systems than it got from Deutsche Telekom:
30 pfennigs a month against a likely 0.7 pfennigs.  It has told the
private operators association Anga that, if it is unable to reach
agreement with the association and individual operators seek a deal
after encryption, the charge will double.  An Anga source said that,
despite MTV's huge popularity in Germany, some operators may be
prepared to make do with Viva, the rival music channel launched in
December.

CAN CANAL PLUS AFFORD TO KEEP OUT OF PPV?

The approaching launch of a pay-per-view service on Paris cable
networks has raised the question of whether Canal Plus will seek to
retain its dominance in French pay-television by launching its own pay-
per-view service.

The channel says that it will not, that the market and the technology
is not ready for it.  It will, instead, wait for digital compression
and launch a near-video-on-demand service in two or three years time.
But observers question whether (1) the company can afford to let a
rival service develop and (2) whether political factors, once again at
the centre of French media, will dictate a change in policy.

The cable ppv service, founded by Lyonnaise Communications and France
Telecom, was always seen as a commercial rival to Canal Plus and as an
attempt to pre-empt Canal Plus from introducing its own ppv service.
Now that Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and TF1 have jumped
on board, the service looks to be an even stronger threat to Canal
Plus.

CLT has made no secret of its wish to break Canal Plus' monopoly of pay-
television.  But what if, as some observers suggest, in the wake of the
shareholding and personnel changes at Canal Plus, CLT were to become
more closely allied with the pay-television operator?  Would the two
groups want to come together?  If not, would it make commercial sense
for Canal Plus to carry on waiting for the market to mature?

Even within the present media environment, without any further major
changes, Canal Plus and its shareholders will face a dilemma when,
later this year, the Paris ppv service begins to be rolled out across
the country.  Compagnie Generale des Eaux, thought now to be a very
powerful force within Canal Plus, will have to decide whether to take
the ppv service on its cable networks, the most extensive in the
country.

Several analysts believe that it will not; that, whatever technical or
programming reasons CGE gives, it will not be prepared, as a major
Canal Plus shareholder, to take a service from a rival group of
companies.  But it may have difficulty simply watching from the
sidelines.  As one senior CGE executive put it, ``although politically
the company might not wish to get into bed with [the Paris group], it
has to run its systems profitably.  It will obviously be under pressure
to take it.''  The service, he said, would be taken if it were likely
to be popular.

Some analysts believe that CGE and Canal Plus, which is being forced by
the government to get more involved in cable, could launch its own
joint service.  If the rival service were popular, Canal Plus and CGE
would find it difficult to wait.

For the moment, Canal Plus argues that the French market is not well-
enough developed for ppv to be successful.  The cable service will not
be profitable, it says, because the US studios are unlikely to be
interested until there are one million subscribers -- French cable as a
whole has only 870,000 broadband subscribers -- and the cable group has
enough power to negotiate good film rights.

It says that US experience suggests that a wide choice of programmes
needs to be offered at frequent intervals.  So, it says, it is much
better to wait two or three years until digital compression creates the
capacity to provide a near-video-on-demand service.  Viewers need to be
offered a choice of films -- between four and 10 -- with the possibility
of choosing any of the films every 15 to 30 minutes.

STAR RETHINKS PAY-TV AFTER WHARF BREAKDOWN

Star TV, the pan-Asian satellite broadcaster controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, is to suspend its four premium pay-television services,
following this week's breakdown of negotiations with Wharf Cable in
Hong Kong over carriage terms.

Star says that it is to re-examine the channels -- all of which were
devised initially for relay on Wharf, but were also intended for
subsequent broadcast across Asia via satellite -- and that it could
amend some of them or abandon them altogether.  But it adds that it
still wants to launch pay channels in some form.

The Star move has come as a shock to the Asian News and Business
Channel, the pay channel specially commissioned by Star from NBC, FTTV
and Reuters TV.  The partners in ANBC, which had been hoping to use
Wharf as a base from which to launch the service in other Asian
markets, will meet in the next two weeks to discuss whether the channel
should continue, and if so how.

The other three pay services -- two film channels and a children's
channel -- were all produced by Star itself.

This week's breakdown of discussions between Wharf and Star followed a
long-running dispute between the two, part of which concerned Wharf's
carriage of the four pay channels.  Star has been sending these to
Wharf by landline since the launch of the latter's cable service last
October.

Under the terms of its Hong Kong government licence, Wharf is obliged
to carry ``regional'' premium pay channels from Star.  But it had been
refusing to distribute the four existing channels on the grounds that
they did not qualify as regional until they were transmitted by
satellite (NMM 11:22).

Star and Wharf had reached an outline arrangement for the carriage of
the pay channels -- and for three of the five clear channels that Star
is transmitting via Asiasat 1 -- as part of a wide-ranging contract that
was agreed in June 1993.  However, reaching a final and detailed
agreement became difficult after Murdoch's News Corporation purchased a
controlling stake in Star in July.

The discussions on the outline agreement broke down in January this
year when Wharf Cable began legal action to prove that the agreement
was not legally binding.  In advance of this case being heard in the
high court in Hong Kong, the two sides had begun discussions on a
completely new agreement.

However, Star now says that it cannot reach a ``workable arrangement''
with Wharf and has withdrawn from discussions, at least temporarily.
Wharf says that Star's move reflects its recognition that last June's
outline agreement is not legally binding.

But if Star is to launch new premium pay-television channels from
Asiasat 1 satellite -- as it says it will -- the two sides will have to
negotiate carriage terms or seek involvement of the Hong Kong
government in brokering a carriage deal.  Star's right to have Wharf
carry the premium pay-channels lasts three years and expires in June
1996.

Wharf believes that it can still reach an agreement with Star for the
carriage of premium and clear services.  A well-placed source said:
``We were talking until last week, we have no idea why they have
stopped talking, or what they want to do''.

Meanwhile, Wharf is seeking other arrangements for the supply of
channels to compensate for the loss of Star's clear services (Satellite
TV Finance 5:2).

Star has yet to decide a distribution strategy for the launch of its
premium pay services.  Its original plan was to use its spare
transponder on Asiasat 1 to broadcast the four channels using digital
compression.  It is understood that the plan was blocked by Murdoch,
who has bought a house in Hong Kong to spend time working directly on
Star TV.

BBC PREPARES FOR LAUNCH OF OVERSEAS THEME CHANNELS

The BBC's World Service Television this week put a little bit more
flesh on its plans to launch satellite channels around the world.  It
said that it is ``very seriously'' examining the idea of launching
themed channels of BBC product as well as news and information channels
in the near future.

The themed channels, consisting primarily of BBC product, would be
entire channels dedicated to a certain area, such as documentary or
comedy, or a group of ``strands'' branded as a single channel,
covering, for instance, wildlife, drama and music.

The channels, suggested by Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy director
general, at a Financial Times conference last month, would be clustered
around WSTV's News and Information Channel, versions of which the BBC
hopes to launch in Europe and the USA this year.

Chris Irwin, WSTV chief executive, said this week that quality will be
of prime importance in the development of new channels because of the
importance of maintaining the BBC's reputation and brand worldwide.

The BBC increasingly sees its reputation as a marketable commodity,
since it gives both the BBC and its partners a head-start in new
markets.  Irwin argues that the BBC is more attractive to potential
distribution partners because of this head-start; the power of the
BBC's reputation is such that it can be expressed as a form of
investment in itself.

The reputation will be even more important in the multi-channel future.
 Irwin sees it developing as a kind of ``publisher's imprint'' -- a
recognisable name in what is likely to be a confusingly varied myriad
of channels.

Increasingly, it is the policy of the BBC to ``manage'' its brand-name,
to nurture it as a market commodity.  This lies behind much of the
BBC's strategy at home and abroad, and has distinct implications for
WSTV's new services.

For instance, the brand-name of the BBC is one factor in the type of
News and Information Channel it will launch in Europe and the USA; the
other factor is that the market for new channels in both territories is
limited.

In both the USA and Europe, the BBC will aim for a very defined (and
closely researched) market.  It is not seeking to compete directly with
what is already available, both for reasons of market share and because
the perceived quality and tone of BBC news provision would not be
appropriate for this kind of head-on competition with the likes of CNN;
it would require a major change in emphasis, and a consequent major
shift of how the BBC's brand is perceived in those territories.
Likewise, the BBC will not seek to compete with the domestic news
services of Europe.

Irwin says that WSTV has identified a significant minority in Europe
and the USA, primarily among AB social groups, with an international
outlook and an interest in an alternative news source.  The minority is
mainly to be found among the academic, media and business sectors.  The
new services will be adapted from the existing News and Information
Channel specifically for this audience.

Irwin uses the analogy of The Economist to explain BBC strategy in the
two markets: to develop and consolidate a niche among the most
influential and powerful social strata, without competing directly with
existing media.

WSTV is also pouring more money into developing its own news-gathering
service, distinct from the domestic service.  Most of its news is still
either commissioned from news agencies or adapted from domestic service
bulletins, but the proportion of news produced directly by WSTV is
increasing and Irwin would like to see this continue.

WSTV is now in the middle of a training programme designed to provide
BBC World Service Radio's reporters with TV experience; in addition,
the imminent launch of WSTV's Arabia service, to be transmitted in
Arabic, is forcing WSTV to create its own Arabic news-gathering service
which, Irwin maintains, ``will be the best in the world.''

WSTV, which is embroiled in a legal dispute over carriage of its News
and Information Channel on Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, is ``re-gaugeing
the competitive environment'' in Asia.

WSTV said recently that it wanted to maintain the Star relationship as
long as possible, and that constructive talks were taking place between
the two parties.  Two weeks ago, Phillis said that either party could
drop out at the end of 1994, but that he hoped the relationship would
continue.

Irwin now says that ``Star is not the only player in Asia,'' adding
that ``there is a deep and growing concern about any one individual
controlling the global gateways, in other words subscriber management
and services.  Rupert Murdoch is a very strong partner to have, because
of his knowledge of the market, but there are other partners.''

There are a number of options, which could include joining the group of
channels which is setting up in opposition to Star on the Apstar
satellites.  Alternatively, the BBC could go it alone and start
broadcasting from one of the new satellites, Apstar 1 and 2 and Asiasat
2.

HOW BIG IS BSKYB'S BILL FOR BRITISH SCREEN FILMS?

BSkyB would have paid between #262,966 and #279,113 for UK pay-
television rights to the highly successful UK feature The Crying Game,
had its new output agreement with British Screen Finance, the
government-backed film subsidy body, been up and running in 1991/92.
It would also have paid at least #385,687 for Orlando and at least
#413,750 for Damage.

These prices have been calculated on the basis of the payment terms set
out in the deal, signed two weeks ago, which will give BSkyB the UK pay-
television rights to at least 30 British Screen-supported features over
three years.  These terms set out formulae under which the prices of
the rights to each film are calculated according to its production
budget and its cinema box-office takings.

There is a basic price for the main pay-television window, which will
open between 15 months and 18  months after the film's theatrical
release, last for between 11 and 12 months, and provide for 12
screenings.  This price includes two elements: an initial licence fee
equivalent to eight per cent of the production budget up to #2.5
million, and three per cent of the sum by which the budget exceeds #2.5
million; and an additional licence fee, equivalent to five per cent of
total box-office receipts (excluding VAT) in the UK and the Irish
Republic up to the point where the film passes to BSkyB.

There is an additional price for an optional second pay-television
window, which will open three years after a film's first broadcast on
free television.  This price is equivalent to five per cent of the
initial licence fee plus 10 per cent of the additional licence fee.

The Crying Game, which in world market terms is the most successful
film ever backed by British Screen, was made on a budget of #2.6
million.  So the initial licence fee would have been #203,000.  The
film has so far taken #1,453,726 at UK and Irish cinemas, according to
its distributors Mayfair, yielding a VAT-exclusive figure of
#1,199,324.  So the additional licence fee would have been #59,966.

Had BSkyB opted to buy a second pay-television window -- highly likely
given the international success of the feature, which earned director
Neil Jordan an Oscar for best original screenplay, and picked up three
other Oscar nominations -- it would have paid an additional #16,147.

The terms of the deal set a cap of #325,000 on the initial licence fee
that BSkyB will have to pay for any individual film in the first year
of the deal's operation.

It would not have had to pay this for any of the films shown here --
although it would have come close with both Orlando and Damage (each of
which had a budget of #6.6 million), where the initial fee would have
been #323,000 in each case.

In each case BSkyB's investment is substantially lower than the price
it was asked to pay in an earlier attempt to open up a pay-television
window for UK features.

Just over a year ago David Elstein, BSkyB's head of programming,
approached Channel Four with a bid to buy UK pay-television rights to a
package of features -- including The Crying Game -- in which the
terrestrial broadcaster had invested in return for equity and all
television rights in line with its normal practice.

But the terrestrial broadcaster effectively rejected the offer, saying
that BSkyB that would have to offer at least twice Channel Four's
initial licence fee -- believed to have been between #300,000 and
#500,000 in each case -- before such a bid would even be considered
(Satellite TV Finance 4:3).

Of the other examples shown, both No Worries and Blue Black Permanent
would have been excluded from the deal as currently constituted.  The
first because it has no theatrical distribution deal and the second
because its budget is below the #750,000 minimum stipulated in the
agreement.

ITC SUGGESTS CHANGES TO RULES ON CROSS-OWNERSHIP OF TV CHANNELS

The Independent Television Commission told Peter Brooke, National
Heritage secretary, who is reviewing cross-media ownership regulations,
that the restriction on a company owning more than two ITV franchise
licences should be replaced by a market-share limit of 25 per cent of
total television advertising revenue, including that of satellite and
cable television.  It also said that cross-media ownership rules could
be applied to satellite channels as satellite viewing increases.

The ITC said that newspaper groups should be able to have 30-per-cent
stakes in ITV companies, instead of the present 20-per-cent limit, and
that ITV companies should be able to have a 30-per-cent stake in the
planned Channel 5 instead of 20 per cent.  It criticised a rule which
limits ITV companies to a holding of less than 50 per cent of
Independent Television News.

DIVORCED TCI LOOKS TO BLOCKBUSTER

TeleCommunications Inc, fresh from the collapse of its merger with Bell
Atlantic, approached the Blockbuster video-rental company about
investing in it or becoming a partner if the company is not merged with
Viacom, as agreed during Viacom's bid for Paramount Communications.

TCI and Bell Atlantic blamed the collapse of their merger on the
Federal Communication Commission's cut of seven per cent in cable
rates.  However, both companies had already been arguing about the
price: this was aggravated by the decline in Bell Atlantic's share
price, which lowered the value of its offer.

UK FEATURE-FILM INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO RISE, DESPITE FOREIGN FALL OFF

Investment in films with UK production company involvement rose
significantly in 1995, despite a slight drop in the overall amount of
money put into UK-linked features.

A total of #309.54 million was invested in 76 UK-producer films -- that
is, wholly UK productions and international co-productions involving UK
companies -- that went into production between January 1 and December 31
last year.  Both figures were the highest for at least 15 years (using
current price comparisons).  The average budget was #4.07 million, the
best figure for at least four years.

The investment total represents a rise of 19.4 per cent on the #259.26
million spent on the 70 UK-producer films that went before the cameras
in 1994 (Screen Finance 8:1), and is 133.8 per cent higher than the
#132.4 million spent on 60 such films in 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).

However, the amount of money invested in the five films shot by foreign
producers in the UK was only #111.25 million, 37 per cent less than the
#176.50 million put into eight such films in 1994 (although it was 38
per cent higher than the #81.3 million put into seven such films in
1993).

As a result, total investment in all UK-linked productions fell
slightly to #420.79 million.  This was 3.4 per cent lower than the
#435.76 million figure recorded in 1994, but still 97 per cent above
the #213.7 million invested in 1993.

The drop in overall investment came despite the fact that the total
number of 81 film starts was three more than in 1994 (Screen Finance
8:1), and 14 up on 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).

But the relative lack of foreign films is likely to be a short-term
phenomenon, given the number of big-budget features that have
provisionally booked space in UK studios for this year.  These include
the $65 million Fifth Element, Cinergi/Really Useful Group's Evita and
Warner Bros' The Avengers (Screen Finance 8:17).

A total of 40 features were wholly UK in origin -- that is, they were
made solely by British production companies -- with a combined budget of
#169.59 and an average budget of #4.24 million.  Of these films, 35
were shot mainly or wholly in the UK and had a combined value of
#135.67 million.  The other five were shot mainly or wholly abroad and
represented a further investment of #33.92 million.

The level of investment in wholly British features is noticeably higher
than in 1994, when 38 such films were made (33 of them mainly or
entirely in the UK) with a combined budget of #110.96 million and an
average budget of #2.92 million.  In 1993 there were 31 films in this
category with a total value of #62.39 million (average #2.01 million).

There was also an increase in the number of international co-
productions involving UK producers.  There were 36 films in this
category last year, with a combined investment of #139.95 million
(average #3.89 million).  This compares with 32 co-productions in 1994
(total investment #148.30 million, average #4.63 million) and 29 in
1993 (total investment #68.01 million, average #2.35 million).

However, UK producers played the leading or equal role in only 11 of
last year's co-productions (of which only four were shot mainly or
wholly in Britain) with a combined value of #52.14 million (average
#4.74 million).  The remaining 25 co-productions, with a combined
budget of #87.81 million (average #3.51 million), had only a minority
UK involvement.  Given that 22 of these were shot mainly or wholly
abroad, it is likely that only a small proportion of this money will
have accrued to the UK production sector.

The generally positive picture for UK production is reflected in the
number of medium-to-large-budget UK films.  Last year 15 of the 76
films with UK-producer involvement (19.7 per cent) had budgets of #6
million or more.  While this is slightly down on the 1994 figure of 17
out of 70 (24.3 per cent) it is well up on the 1993 total of three out
of 60 (five per cent).

And last year's total includes four features with budgets of more than
#15 million -- the #20 million Fierce Creatures from Fish Productions
and Jersey Films, the #17 million Goldeneye from Eon Productions, the
#18 million Blood and Wine from Recorded Pictures (see below) and the
#15.5 million Pinocchio from Allied Pinocchio in collaboration with
Davis Films of France and Etamp Film Productions of the Czech Republic.
 Only the fourth of these was not a wholly British production.

This figure compares with two films in this category in 1994, one in
1993, and none in 1992.

Main investors

Polygram Filmed Entertainment was again one of the heaviest investors,
backing eight of the 76 films with UK-producer involvement -- Jude the
Obscure, Trainspotting, Walking and Talking, Dead Man Walking,
Pinocchio, The Eighth Day, The Pillow Book and This the Sea.  It also
backed one of the five foreign films shooting in Britain -- Portrait of
a Lady

Miramax, as usual, was the most active US backer, with money in five UK-
producer projects -- Brassed Off, Emma, I Love You -- I Love You Not, The
Last of the High Kings, and Snakes and Ladders.

Twentieth Century Fox had three UK-producer projects -- The Secret
Agent, Blood and Wine and Stealing Beauty.  Walt Disney also had three
in this category -- The Wind in the Willows, Firelight and La
propietaire (The Proprietor) -- plus two US projects shooting in the UK
-- The Muppet Treasure Island and 101 Dalmatians.

Three US investors backed two UK-producer projects each: United Artists
(Goldeneye and Richard III); Trimark (Proteus and Crimetime); and New
Line/Fine Line (Twelfth Night and Total Eclipse).

Single project investors included Universal (Fierce Creatures), Unapix
(The Proposition), Warner Bros (Surviving Picasso), Summit (Twelfth
Night), Visionary Communications (Two Blind Mice), Columbia Tristar
(The Wind in the Willows), Castle Rock (Othello), Kushner Locke
(Pinocchio), HBO Showcase (Deadly Voyage) and the Overseas Film Group
(This is the Sea).

Two other US companies backed foreign productions shooting in Britain --
Paramount (Mission Impossible) and October Films (Breaking the Waves).

As in other years there was an almost total lack of commercial UK
investors, other than the usual ones such as J&M Entertainment,
Majestic Films and Television and Capitol Films, with the occasional
distributor pre-buy from distributors such as Entertainment, First
Independent, Guild and Electric/Polygram.

Private investors are evident in a handful of films.  But only one of
these, the #4.5 million Grotesque, had a budget of more than #2
million.

One noticeable continuing trend is the decline of low-budget films
(those with budgets of less than #2 million).  This year 23 of the 76
UK-producer films (30.3 per cent per cent) fell into this category, and
16 of the 40 wholly-UK films (40 per cent).  This compares with the
1994 figures of 28 out of 70 UK-producer films (40 per cent) and 20 out
of 38 wholly-UK films (52.6 per cent).  In 1993 the figures were 34 out
of 60 (56.7 per cent) and 20 out of 31 (64.5 per cent per cent).

Last year also saw the first decline for some time in the number and
proportion of films depending on some members of the cast and crew
deferring their fees -- a practice which applies almost entirely to
wholly-UK films.

In 1995 only four of the 40 wholly UK films (10 per cent) relied to a
greater or lesser extent on this approach -- Bob's Weekend, Driven,
Respect and Two Blind Mice.  This compares with 14 out of 33 in 1994
(42 per cent) and 10 out of 28 in 1993 (36 per cent).

There was also one minority-UK co-production using deferrals last year
-- This is the Sea.

Subsidy money

Of the 76 features involving UK producers, 35 received some form of
public subsidy.  Thirty of these were international co-productions.

Far and away the most active body was Eurimages, the Council of
Europe's co-production fund, which backed 21 UK-producer projects
(including five in which the UK company was the lead producer).
Unfortunately, this line of finance is now being closed following the
UK government's decision last November to withdraw from the fund (see
separate story on page 12).

Of the UK sources, British Screen Finance provided backing from its
main fund for four films -- The Near Room, Nothing Personal (formerly
All Our Fault), Richard III and Sweet Angel Mine (Screen Finance 8:23).

The European Co-production Fund, which is administered by British
Screen, has supported five films -- Total Eclipse, This is the Sea, The
Killer Tongue, Portraits Chinois and The Castle of the Monkeys.

A key emerging UK source is the Arts Council of England (ACE), which
provides National Lottery money for film production and backed three of
the films that went into production last year -- A Midsummer Night's
Dream, The Woodlanders and Crimetime.  The ACE, and the parallel Arts
Councils of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have also provided
Lottery money for a number of forthcoming productions (Screen Finance
8:22).

Other bodies providing funds included the Glasgow Film Fund, which
backed The Near Room, Small Faces (aka Easterhouse) and Carla's Song.

Television finance

As usual, there was also a major contribution from television companies
both from the UK and other European countries.  At least 43 of the 76
UK-producer films received support from one of these sources.

Channel Four, as in previous years, was by far the most active.  It
backed 19 films that went into production in 1995, compared with 12 in
1994 and eight in 1993.  These were Beautiful Thing, Brassed Off,
Guardians, Indian Summer, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Trainspotting, The
Woodlanders, Walking and Talking, Carla's Song, Crimetime, The Hollow
Reed, A Further Gesture, The Disappearance of Finbar, Trojan Eddie,
Truth (aka Mike Leigh's Untitled '95), Nothing Personal, Portraits
Chinois, La proprietaire and The Pillow Book.  The Welsh Channel Four,
S4C, backed one film, The Proposition.

The BBC backed six films compared with four in 1994 and two in 1993.
Last year's films were Different for Girls (aka Crossing the Border),
Jude the Obscure, Small Faces, Twelfth Night, Deadly Voyage and Swann.

BSkyB backed six films -- The Bruce, Richard III, The Near Room, Sweet
Angel Mine (aka Love's Executioner), The Castle of the Monkeys, This is
the Sea -- mostly through its output deal with British Screen.

However, no films received investment from any of the ITV companies.

Canal Plus, the French pay-television channel, backed three co-
productions involving UK companies -- I Love You -- I Love You Not, The
Butterfly Effect, and The Castle of the Monkeys.  It also backed the
foreign-produced Breaking the Waves.

Two other European broadcasters, RTE of Ireland and TVE of Spain, also
backed three co-productions each.

EC FINALLY ISSUES CALLS FOR IO TENDERS

The European Commission last week finally published its long-awaited
calls to tender for the contracts to run the four Intermediary
Organisations (IOs) that are to be set up under the Media II
initiative, successor to the Media Programme which officially came to
an end last month.

Final discussion of the IO tenders took place at the December 15
meeting of the Media Committee and the documents were made public on
January 5.  These call for applications to be submitted by February 23.
 The EC is hoping that the winners will be selected by mid-April (ahead
of the start of the Mip-TV programme market on April 19), and that the
IOs will begin operation by May or June.

However, the documents say that tenderers must keep their proposals
open until November 23, suggesting that there are fears that the
selection process could be considerably extended.

The EC is now hoping to issue the invitations for bids from potential
beneficiaries -- that is, the call for potential end users to apply for
Media II funds -- by the end of this month.  Various draft proposals
were discussed at the December 15 of the old Media Committee, and will
be considered further at the January 22 meeting of the new Media II
Committee which is to replace it (but which is likely to have
essentially the same membership).

The delayed date for issuing the call for bids for the first round of
funds will almost inevitably put back the timetable for submissions.
For instance, it will be very difficult to maintain the timetable of
submitting bids for training projects in February, to be followed by
decisions in March (Screen Finance 8:23).

The January 22 meeting is also due to discuss the rules and regulations
for the governing of the Committee itself.

The Committee has been strengthened according to EC ``commitology''
lore, improving its role from a purely advisory one to something with a
few more teeth.  The result is that the Committee can advise on more
decisions, and has to be consulted each time that a project is in
excess of the budgetary ceilings laid down by the Council of Ministers
-- Ecu200,000 for training, Ecu300,000 for development, and Ecu500,000
for distribution (Screen Finance 8:22).

If the Committee and the Commission disagree on a matter of policy, the
Council of Ministers will be informed.  In such an event, the
Commission must defer taking action on the point for two months.  The
Council can then decide on a different course, should it disagree with
the Commission's position.

IO tenders

The EC documents say that contracts for the four IOs -- covering the
areas of training, development, distribution and management/finance --
will be awarded for an initial year, which will then be extendable on
an annual basis to take the total to a maximum of five years.  At the
beginning of each contract, the IOs will be paid 30 per cent of the
year's forecast expenditure.  Actual costs will be reimbursed on a
quarterly basis.

Tender proposals will have to address every aspect of the Commission's
desires for each specific IO.  Any proposal that does not will be
rejected.

In addition, the Commission published the implementation decisions of
the Council of Ministers which describe the events which led to the
establishment of each programme, the aims of the programmes, the
percentage of funding they can contribute to projects they support, and
the role of the Media II Committee in each initiative.  The plans cover
a five-year span from January 1 1996 to December 31 2000.

Distribution and development

The distribution and development programme will have a combined five-
year budget of Ecu265 million.  It will have two separate IOs.  Tenders
for these IO contracts will be judged on the quality of the work
schedule put forward, the tenderer's specific expertise in the areas of
audiovisual development and distribution, the ability to respond
quickly to the Commission, and financial conditions.

Beneficiaries under this scheme must supply 50 per cent of their
project funding themselves.

The Commission estimates that the distribution and development IOs will
generate the following number of contracts per year:

Theatrical distribution      225
Video publishing              50
Television broadcasting       50
Promotion/market access       20

Total contracts              345

The distribution and development IOs will have two calls for proposals
each year, and two selection jury meetings.

The distribution IO should be designed to strengthen European cinema
and video distribution by improving networking, encouraging the
transnational distribution of European film product, and promoting the
worldwide circulation of European television programming.  It should
focus on video publishing, television broadcasting and supporting
networks of cinema theatres programming European films.  In addition
the distribution programme is geared toward active support of
linguistic diversity in the audiovisual sector as well as the promotion
of independent European production.

In the development area, the aim is to offer financial and technical
assistance to the development of production projects.  The development
mandate specifically mentions the promotion of animation via new
technology.  The development IO is intended to provide support for
production projects, the development of European production companies,
and the creation of industrial platforms in new technologies, animation
and the enhancement of the audiovisual heritage.

Media training programme

The training programme will have a five-year budget of Ecu45 million.
Its mandate is to give audiovisual industry professionals the skills
they need to ``manage projects and businesses that make a real impact
on the market.''  The idea is for the training part of the programme to
support professional training in the areas of economic and commercial
management and new technologies in two ways.  The first involves long-
term post-graduate courses as well as training courses for trainers.
The second involves shorter-term training modules for the continuing
education of industry professionals.

The Commission hopes that the training network fostered by this
initiative will create a forum for the exchange of all kinds of ideas
that will help the European audiovisual sector to stay competitive in
the global marketplace. Recipients of funding under the training scheme
will have to put up 50 per cent of their budget themselves, or 25 per
cent in very special (and as yet unspecified) cases.

The Commission estimates that the training IO will make two calls for
proposals each year and have two selection jury meetings.  It is
anticipated that the training IO will generate 80 contracts per year.

Management IO

The management IO will be a Brussels-based organisation which will
assist in the management and financial planning for Media II as a
whole.

It is still a somewhat controversial topic, as it is not clear what
sort of jurisdiction, if any, the management IO will have over the
other IOs.

Overall IO duties

The following is a general list of how the Commission views the duties
of the various IOs:

General tasks:

1. Advice on measures to be taken

2. Processing of project submissions

3. Setting up and operation of a database

4. Setting up an information, publication and distribution system

UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TELEVISION DIRECTIVE

The UK's Department of National Heritage has reacted angrily to several
amendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directive
which were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culture
committee.

The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which would
give broadcasting jurisdiction to the countries receiving a particular
channel instead of to the country in which the broadcaster is
established.

The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principle
of the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcasts
which are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.

The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts to
tighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have at
least 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said that
amendments passed by the committee went against a ``political
agreement'' between the member states to stick with the existing
wording.

However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible for
the wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, will
get a further chance to quash the changes.

The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw out
the controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively on
the basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other states
have used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement.
 They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.

Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainment
programming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.

However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several other
controversial amendments, including one which would have banned
advertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and another
which would have required a health warning before advertisements for
alcoholic drinks on television.

The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament on
February 12.  But the committee has still not finished going through
the 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be considered
at a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51
amendments.

The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments before
sending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  The
council will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' on
the amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval by
the parliament.

The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has been
the one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After many
arguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should be
scrapped completely, and France, which believes they should be
tightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of last
year, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).

The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendment
under which certain light-entertainment programmes would not count
towards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would not
be eligible.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove
``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by these
shows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and films
to contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainment
channels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talk
shows.

A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soap
operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears of
some UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these would
still count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council and
the parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that there
would ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.

Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment which
switches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving the
broadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving country
jurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries with
jurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''

A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken for
granted that the parliament will accept what the committee has
proposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,
either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the council
of ministers.

The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope of
the directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-
demand.  It said that these services should properly be considered
separately under telecoms legislation.

NOVEMBER ADMISSIONS FALL BY 5.2 PER CENT

UK cinema admissions for the whole of 1995 now seem set to reach a
total about nine per cent below the record figure returned in 1994,
which saw admissions rise by 9.7 per cent in comparison with 1993.

According to figures from the Cinema Advertising Association (CAA),
November admissions to cinemas taking advertising totalled 8,498,275, a
fall of 5.2 per cent on the record figure of 8,960,554 admissions
recorded for November a year ago (Screen Finance 8:1), but ahead of the
November 1993 figure of 7,619,875 (Screen Finance 7:1).

Admissions to cinemas not taking advertising -- the National Film
Theatre and about half the British Film Institute-supported Regional
Film Theatres -- added about another 85,000 to take the all-cinemas
total for November to around 8.6 million admissions.

Average weekly admissions for November were 1.98 million, among the
lowest figures for 1995, but a strong performance for the month when
compared to other November results, coming in second only to last
year's November weekly average of 2.09 million.

The total number of visitors to CAA-monitored advertising cinemas in
the first 11 months of the year was 104,244,582, down 9.8 per cent on
the comparable figure of 115,540,746 for November 1994 (Screen Finance
8:1), and only 352,637 admissions ahead of the corresponding 1993
figure of 103,891,945.

According to Screen Finance estimates, admissions to non-advertising
cinemas add another 1.08 million to take the end-November total for
1995 to approximately 106 million.

The top-grossing film of November was Goldeneye, the first Bond film in
six years, which opened on November 24, and took #5,554,527 in its
first week.  It was followed by Crimson Tide, which opened on November
3 and took #4,221,056 for the month.  Other strong performers in
November were Disney's Pocahontas (with #2.3 million), the UK/USA co-
production French Kiss (with #1.8 million) and To Die For (with #1.5
million).

End-1995 results

According to Catherine Booth-Clibborn of the CAA, December 1995
admissions are expected to top the 1994 result for the month, thanks to
several strong performers at the box office.

UIP's Goldeneye has continued to perform well at the box office, taking
over #9.2 million during December, and taking third place in the list
of top box office performers for the year with #14,785,676, just behind
Batman Forever and Casper.

Other strong box offices performers were Babe, The Santa Clause, and
Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, which took #3.2 million in its first
week.

If the December 1995 admissions figure does indeed exceed that for the
same month in 1994, this would imply a total of about 8 million,
bringing the end-of-year total to about 112.3 million for advertising
cinemas.  Given the Screen Finance estimate of approximately 1.2
million admission for 1995 for non-advertising cinemas, this would take
the end-of-year total to about 113.5 million, only 8.6-per-cent lower
than the total admissions figure for 1994.

UK FILM PRODUCTION

There was only one production start last month -- one more than last
year.  This was the #3.1 million A Further Gesture, a UK-led co-
production by CSL Films in partnership with with Samson Films of
Ireland and Road Movies of Germany.

This film, which went before the cameras in Dublin on December 3, is
backed by Channel Four, Pandora of Germany and Nippon Film and
Development (NDF) of Japan.  It is also receiving subsidies from
Eurimages, the Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen and the Irish Film
Board, and has some investment raised through Ireland's section 35 tax-
incentive scheme.

A Further Gesture is directed by Robert Dornhelm from a Ronan Bennett
script, and produced by Chris Curling.  It stars Stephen Rea as an
escaped IRA prisoner on the run in New York, who finds himself caught
up in a plot to carry out a political assassination.  After its initial
three weeks in Dublin, the film is scheduled to continue shooting in
New York for five weeks from mid-January.

Two other films started in November but were omitted from the Screen
Finance list for the month (Screen Finance 8:22).

One is the latest Recorded Pictures production Blood and Wine, which is
being directed by Bob Rafelson from a script he wrote in collaboration
with Nick Villiers, and produced by Jeremy Thomas.  It went into
production on November 27 in Miami, Florida.  The #18 million film is
backed by Twentieth Century Fox, which has taken English-speaking
rights, and by Majestic Film and Television, which is handling sales in
the rest of the world.

Blood and Wine stars Jack Nicholson, Judy Davis, Michael Caine, Stephen
Dorff and Jennifer Lopez.  Nicholson plays a womanising wine dealer
whose weaknesses have brought him to desperate straits.  He devises the
perfect crime to solve his financial problems at a stroke.

The other film was Firelight, a majority UK-co-production between
Carnival Films and Wind Dancer Productions of the USA, which began
shooting from November 27 at Pinewood, and from January 3 to mid-
February in Sussex and Normandy.

The #5.15 million feature is directed by William Nicholson, produced by
Brian Eastman of Carnival and executive-produced by a five-person team
from Wind Dancer, led by Matt Williams.  It is backed by Hollywood
Pictures.  The film stars Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and Kevin
Anderson.  It tells the story of a beautiful Swiss governess and an
English landowner who meet in secret to fulfil the terms of a business
agreement; the encounter lasts three days, and awakens a desire that
changes their lives for ever.

DNH PONDERS DECISION ON EURIMAGES FUNDING ROUND

The UK's Department of National Heritage will have to decide in the
next month whether it is prepared to amend its stance on Eurimages, the
Council of Europe co-production fund from which it controversially
decided to withdraw last November.

The DNH, which has seen its decision come under strong criticism from
UK film-makers and other Eurimages members, has been told that it will
have to provide more money if it wants UK-linked projects to be
considered for backing at the next funding meeting of the Eurimages
board of management, which is scheduled for February 6 and 7.

Twelve of the projects on the agenda have UK producers.  Many of them
had already submitted their applications when the DNH make its shock
withdrawal announcement on November 29 (Screen Finance 8:22).  While
some of these applications will be withdrawn for various reasons in the
next few weeks, half can be expected to remain on the list by the time
the meeting convenes.

Eurimages has told the DNH that if it wants UK-linked projects to be
eligible for this funding round, the first of five in 1996, then it
will have to provide at least one fifth of its projected subscription
for the year.  This would be about #450,000 at current exchange rates.
Under this arrangement, the UK's active membership would end after the
February meeting, although according to the rules of Eurimages, its
actual membership would continue until the end of the year.

But the DNH is proposing to pay only #300,000 -- representing the
remainder of the money that it had allocated for Eurimages out of its
budget for 1995-96 (the UK government operates on the year to the end
of March, whereas Eurimages operates on the calendar year).

So the DNH appears to be faced with a choice between finding another
#150,000 to satisfy the Eurimages requirement for the February meeting,
or taking back its #300,000 and leaving the UK producers high and dry.
But it may be able to negotiate a compromise.

The other 23 members of Eurimages say that the UK should pay the whole
of its subscription for 1996, because it has not followed the correct
procedure for withdrawing from the organisation (Screen Finance 8:23).
These countries concede that they cannot actually force the UK to
comply, but say that it is likely to come under considerable diplomatic
pressure if it does not do so.

UK film-makers argue that the withdrawal decision should be reversed
altogether.  This view was strongly put to the national heritage
secretary Virginia Bottomley at a meeting with leading film-makers
organised by the Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact)
on December 21.

The meeting was attended by Lord Attenborough, chairman of the British
Screen Advisory Council (BSAC), Simon Perry, chief executive of British
Screen Finance, Andrew Quinn, chairman of the British Film Commission,
Sir Sydney Samuelson, the British Film Commissioner, Wilf Stevenson,
director of the British Film Institute, John Woodward, chief executive
of Pact, Fiona Clarke-Hackston, director of BSAC, David Norris of law
firm Marriott Harrison, who is vice-chairman of film at Pact, Simon
Relph of Skreba and Greenpoint, who is vice-chairman of film at the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta), Steve Woolley of
Scala Productions, who is a council member of Bafta, and Richard Holmes
of Gruber Brothers, representing the New Producers' Alliance.

The purpose of the meeting was for these UK film industry
representatives to express their frustration and disappointment with
the policy decision.  Having ``expressed their views forcefully'',
according to one participant, the group is now awaiting Bottomley's
response, promised for the New Year.

If Bottomley refuses to budge, the consequences for UK producers could
be fairly dire.  Already, 11 projects have dropped a UK co-producer
from their roster because non-members are not eligible for Eurimages
funds, according to Barrie Ellis-Jones, the British executive secretary
of Eurimages, who has himself felt obliged to resign as a result of the
DNH decision.

UK executives believe that there may be some room for negotiation on
the point of how much the UK should pay for its annual subscription.
``It's likely it is not just a matter of money, but a matter of the
handling of the event,''  according to Clarke-Hackston.  ``I still
believe DNH could go to Eurimages and say they've got a budgetary
problem.  They would have to make it clear that the UK would stay in
for a specified number of years, but I don't think the situation cannot
be resolved.''

But Eurimages president Gaetano Adinolfi says that it would be
impossible to reduce the UK's annual subscription.  He says that every
year the total Eurimages budget has grown according to the voluntary
increases agreed to by all of its members.  Last year the UK
contributed FFr19.5 million to the total Eurimages budget of FFr160
million.  Even without the UK's presence, the 1996 budget should run to
about FFr140 million, representing an increase for the remaining
members.

Adinolfi made clear his opinion of the UK move shortly after it was
announced six weeks ago: ``Every member of the Council of Europe has a
free choice of whether to be a member of the Fund or not.  However, I
have been working in the Council for over 40 years and I do not
remember anything of this kind happening before.''

EURO AIM TALKS DRAG ON, WITH AUDIT AND LEGAL ACTION

Euro Aim, the Media 95-backed initiative to support independent
European production, is still negotiating with the European Commission
in an attempt to resolve the long-running dispute over the EC's refusal
to hand over the money the agency says it is owed.

Euro Aim says that the EC owes it Ecu3.7 million, representing the
remainder of the Commission's contribution to the agency's 1994 budget
and the whole of its contribution to the 1995 budget.

Although Euro Aim reopened after Christmas on January 8 with its staff
still essentially intact, except for a few who had been employed under
limited term contracts, the organisation is weeks away from bankruptcy,
according to executives.  The Commission supplies 42 per cent of Euro
Aim's total budget, and without its contribution, the agency has had to
suspend its attendance at any of the important television and film
markets where it had functioned as an umbrella organisation for
independent European producers.

Euro Aim, which initiated legal action against the Commission on
December 4, had a court hearing scheduled for December 15 (Screen
Finance 8:23).  But neither side was willing this week to comment on
the status of the court action, which is bound up in the settlement
negotiations.

The talks are also linked to the outcome of the audit of Euro Aim's
books which the EC had demanded as a prerequisite before handing over
any funds.  This audit, which was carried out by the Commission's
accountants in collaboration with an outside firm of auditors, was
completed in the week before Christmas (Screen Finance 8:22).  But
neither side is willing to discuss the results.

Although Euro Aim has not been able to attend any markets without EC
funding, it is continuing talks on a proposed joint venture to create
an electronic trading system which could very well lessen the
importance of such events.  The online system would allow producers and
distributors to access real-time information concerning film and
television productions in development.

Euro Aim is partnered in the venture by the Dutch electronics giant
Philips.  The two are seeking other collaborators after losing their
third partner last month as a result of the EC row (Screen Finance
8:22).  Executives expect within the next month to compete the business
plan for the scheme -- which envisages a three-year start up phase
during which a commercial network of users will be brought together.

BRITISH SCREEN PLANS NORTH-WEST SHORTS STRAND

British Screen Finance (BSF) is furthering its commitment to a regional
focus for its short film funding scheme with the initiation of Short
Wave, a northwest-oriented strand modelled on the Prime Cuts programme
which is already under way in Scotland.

British Screen is setting up the north-west strand in partnership with
Granada Television and the Merseyside-based Moving Image Development
Agency (Mida).  It is intended to fund the production of six short
films, each of which will last twelve-and-a-half minutes and will have
a budget of #30,000.

The Short Wave strand, like the Scottish one, is being set up on a one-
off basis, but is likely to be repeated next year.  Other regional
strands are likely to be set up in the near future, possibly including
strands in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south-east.

The various strands are being set up to replace the Short and Curlies
programme which BSF used to fund in partnership with Channel Four.  BSF
withdrew from this programme last year, partly because it wanted to
develop projects with a more regional edge (Screen Finance 8:4).  It
also wanted to spread its annual shorts budget -- currently running at
about #150,000 -- over more projects.  The four or five projects backed
each year under Short and Curlies had budgets of about #90,000 each.
The projects backed under the new strands will have budgets of no more
than a third of this.

The three partners in Short Wave are still hammering out the final
details of their agreement.  But Granada has pledged #60,000 to the
programme, according to Mike Spencer, the executive in charge of the
company's participation, leaving the remaining #120,000 or so to be
divided between the other two.  Mida will contribute money from its
``Objective I'' fund, which is part-backed by the European Regional
Development Fund (Screen Finance 8:15).  It will also be running the
strand's publicity programme it expects to launch later this year.

Writers will be invited to submit scripts from the beginning of next
month, with a deadline in April.  The partners expect to start filming
over the summer.  The films will air on Granada in the autumn, most
likely on a weekly transmission after the News at Ten,
although a one-hour compilation would be another possibility.

The partners will be looking for fictional scripts (comedy or drama) of
which some may be animations.  The films will also have a ``northwest
feel'' to them.  ``There will probably be no restrictions as to age,
background or experience, says Spencer.  ``But the films will have to
be about the northwest. It would help particularly if the talent was
from the northwest.''  Roger Shannon, the head of Mida, says that
projects are expected to come from northwest-based writers and
directors.

The Scottish Prime Cuts initiative, which was BSF's first regional
short film project, also involves three partners -- BSF, Scottish
Television and the Scottish Film Production Fund.  This scheme, which
was set up last April,  involves six projects, each of which will last
five minutes and will have a budget of #23,000.  These projects, which
were chosen in October, will be shot in February and March and will
subsequently be shown on Scottish Television.

The total funding for the programme is #160,000, including #140,000 for
production and #20,000 for administration, publicity and promotion.  Of
this total, about #60,000 was provided by the Scottish Film Production
Fund, using some of the National Lottery money it has been allocated by
the Scottish Arts Council.  The other #100,000 was divided evenly
between BSF and Scottish Television.

One of the benefits of the programme for Scotland, according to
Catherine Aitken, project developer at the Scottish Film Production
Fund, is that it has brought British Screen's head of development
Steven Cleary into the region with more frequency, thus drawing to his
attention the wealth of burgeoning Scottish talent.  ``It is a good
thing for Scotland,'' says Aitken.  ``The response to Prime Cuts and
the quality of the applications reflect what is happening in the
Scottish film industry.''

The six projects for this year's strand were chosen from a short-list
of 18 which was itself whittled down from an original list of 175
applications.

All of the projects had to be based in Scotland, using Scottish crews.
But the themes could be universal.  Although there were no specific
criteria on gender, it has turned out that three of the six films are
to be directed by women.  All of the films are dramas, and none are
animated.

UK MULTIPLEX MARKET SET FOR NEW SURGE OF GROWTH

The UK multiplex market, which has been experiencing fairly steady
expansion for the past three or four years, with about six new
multiplexes being opened every 12 months, could be set for a new spurt
of growth if operators' current plans come to fruition.

UK operators say that they are planning to open 22 new sites in 1996,
with a total of 201 screens, to take the installed base to 101 sites
with 907 screens.  A further 16 sites are already planned for 1997.

This would represent a growth rate that would be considerably higher
than the one enjoyed in the boom period of 1989-91, when operators were
launching an average of 14 sites a year.

The current expansion plans involve a mixture of larger multiplexes,
with up to 14 screens, together with smaller multiplexes of between
five and eight screens, representing two distinct operator approaches.

The large operators, which have plans for 15 multiplexes in 1996, with
a further 11 already on the books for 1997, are concentrating on large
sites.  They are attempting to reach an audience which traditionally
does not visit cinemas regularly by including several leisure
activities in one place, so that a visit to the multiplex can be
combined with a meal or even some shopping.  They also aim to expand
their audience by covering the market more thoroughly, building in
areas which do not have easy access to traditional cinemas and offering
more variety in mainstream movies.

The smaller operators are looking at smaller sites with a view to
expanding in the art market, which they see as under-exploited.  Peter
Buckingham, managing director of Oasis Cinemas, thinks that the art
market could benefit from some form of expansion, whether through the
opening of smaller multiplexes or through more traditional cinemas,
which would give more people access to art films.

Six in 1995

For the third year running, there were six multiplexes opened in the UK
in 1995, four by large chains and two by smaller independents.  These
sites represent an increase of 44 screens, to which two further screens
were added by a National Amusements expansion to an existing site.

Among the large operators, Odeon Cinemas and Warner Bros Theatres each
opened two new multiplexes in 1995.  Warner Bros launched an eight-
screen 1,900-seater in Cambridge in June and a nine-screen 2,500-seat
multiplex in Leicester in July.  The Odeon chain opened one in Hemel
Hempstead in August, with nine screens and 1,600 seats, and one in
Lincoln in November, with six screens and 1,000 seats.

Among the smaller operators, Apollo Leisure opened its first multiplex
in Rhyl, with five screens and 750 seats, and now has plans for at
least four more multiplexes over the next two years.  And Oasis Cinemas
opened the five-screen Ritzy in Brixton, which has 830 seats and is
aimed mainly at filling a gap in the art market.

The other change in the multiplex landscape in 1995 was the addition of
two screens to the National Amusements' multiplex in Coventry, taking
the number of screens to 14 and the number of seats to 4,440.  This
type of conversion seems to be one of the main trends for the future.

One further multiplex which had been planned for the end of 1995
(Screen Finance 8:12), the Film Network six-screener planned as part of
the new Nynex Arena in Manchester, has been put back to 1996.

These openings take the total number of multiplexes to 79 with 706
screens.  Multiplexes thus account for 10.4 per cent per cent of the
762 sites in the UK and 34.3 per cent of the 2,057 screens.

Future developments

One of the most active developers is Odeon, with seven projects on its
books for 1996: a five-screen project in Camden, a six-screen complex
in Wrexham, an eight-screen complex in Southend, two nine-screen 2,000-
seaters in Guildford and in Sunderland and a 12-screen complex planned
for Glasgow.  These new sites will, if they all go ahead, take the
number of Odeon multiplexes to 17 sites with 127 screens.

Another interesting operator to follow in 1996 and 1997 is Warner Bros,
which announced in August that it plans to build about 20 new
multiplexes in the UK, all with at least eight screens and 2,000 seats.
 This will involve investment of about #75 million in the London area,
and a further #65 million in the rest of the UK.

Sheffield (Meadowhall), 9 scrs, c2,000 seats (1997)
Bristol, 9 scrs, c2,000 seats (1997/98)

*these multiplexes are conversions, as opposed to new builds.

Two Warner sites are opening on January 17 -- one in Croydon, part of
the Valley Park Leisure Complex, and one in Watford.  They will be
followed by a nine-screen 2,200-seater in Harrow on April 26, an eight-
screen 2,000-seater in Finchley in July and a nine-screen 2,500-seater
in Dagenham in December.  If all of these go ahead on time, Warner will
have 17 multiplexes by the end of this year, with 152 screens.

In addition to these, Warner has plans for four further builds in 1997,
in Leeds, Glasgow, Meadowhall in Sheffield and in Bristol, which will
take the total to 21 sites with 188 screens.

Another strong investor in the multiplex market in 1996 will be the
start-up company Cine-UK, which has announced that it is planning to
invest #40 million into the UK market over the next few years on at
least 14 multiplex developments (Screen Finance 8:12).  In accordance
with their policy to invest in smaller catchment areas, a sector which
has not been the chosen target of other major operators, Cine-UK has
plans for four multiplexes in Ashford, Stevenage, Wakefield and
Wandsworth, each with between 10 and 14 screens and 1,900 and 3,000
seats.  All are scheduled to open in the last quarter of 1996.

United Cinemas International (UCI) has plans for two multiplexes in
1996, at Surrey Quays in London and in Leeds.  Both will have nine
screens with about 2,000 seats.  These would take the UCI total at end-
1996 to 26 sites and 243 screens, with an additional site planned at
Crystal Palace for a long delayed nine-screen multiplex to open in 1997
(Screen Finance 7:19).  UCI has also said that it is looking for
suitable sites for up to four additional projects.

Another large operator with plans for 1996 is National Amusements,
which is expecting to open a 14-screen development in Coatesbridge at
the end of the year, which would take its total to 12 sites and 157
screens.  In addition, according to Ed Knudsen, general manager of
advertising and publicity, the company is still developing a 14-screen
development in Reading and another in Newham, both scheduled for 1997.

The MGM chain, which was bought last year by the Virgin Group from
Credit Lyonnais for #195 million, is also planning to expand, initially
under its own name, although there are suggestions that it may take on
the Virgin banner in the long run.  Virgin/MGM has announced one build
for 1996, a nine-screen project in Rochester which will seat 2,256.
This will take the number of Virgin/MGM multiplexes to 19 with 143
screens.  In 1997, Virgin/MGM has plans for four nine-screen
multiplexes, in Oxford, Wigan, Aberdeen and Newport.

Of the smaller independent operators, in addition to the Film Network
development in Manchester, there are plans for four Apollo Leisure
multiplexes -- one 10-screen build in Huddersfield with 2,100 seats to
open in the autumn of 1996, two five-screens in Barrow and Gately, and
a six-screen conversion from a four-screen in Barrow, all expected for
some time in 1996/97.

Robins Cinemas is also planning three conversions, a five-screen at
Mile End for 1996, and two five-screens (from three) in 1997, one in
Camberley and the other in Basildon.  According to Ben Friedman,
managing director, this is part of a new ``policy of rationalisation in
the sites, investing in larger sites with more screens in larger towns,
rather than investing in smaller towns.''

This means that by the end of 1997, independent multiplex operators
will be running about 15 sites with 111 screens.

In addition to all these projects, one other operator, American Multi-
Cinemas (AMC) is expected to re-enter the UK market in the near future,
having announced plans to invest in up to 20 sites with 24 screens each
(Screen Finance 8:12).  AMC says that it is currently searching for
suitable sites in the UK but has not yet made any decisions on specific
projects.

LEADING FILM COMPANIES WANT COPYRIGHT CHANGES

European film companies are in danger of missing out on the
opportunities of the future unless copyright laws are amended to take
account of the digital age, according to the European Film Companies
Alliance (Efca), a group of seven leading European media conglomerates.

The group has this week been asking the European Commission -- which was
holding discussions on copyright with interested parties on January 8
and 9 -- to ensure the creation of a suitable legislative framework to
protect copyright, and the implementation of global rules to enforce
the rights of copyright owners.

Efca argues that Europe's position in the entertainment and cultural
sector will be determined by the level of copyright it grants to its
film companies.  It says that the USA has always had strong copyright
laws, and that this has been a significant factor in the strength of
the USA in the global entertainment market.

The members of the group -- Bertelsmann, Chargeurs, Ciby 2000, Polygram,
Rank, RCS and Sogepaq -- are concerned that the emergence of digital
transmission methods for films and music will soon make it impossible
for copyright owners to enforce their rights to payment for the user of
their works.  They say that if owners' investment is to be maintained,
it will be necessary to update the current legal definitions regarding
broadcasting, rental, distribution and reproduction in order to take
account of new digital technologies and consumer habits.

Efca argues that copyright protects the expression of intellectual
creation.  ``If the creative industries are prevented from realising a
commercial gain from the use of their products, they will have little
incentive to associate themselves with the information society.''  It
says that this could cost Europe dearly in terms of jobs and
investment.

The seven members say that there are three main issues that need to be
addressed regarding the electronic transmission of music and films:

* They argue that film companies should be granted the exclusive rights
to authorise or prohibit the distribution and copying of their material
on electronic networks such as the Internet.  This will enable them to
control the commercial usage of their productions.

* They maintain that these exclusive rights are essential if the
industry is to avoid the ``damaging'' principle of compulsory licensing
whereby companies are ``forced to sell their output at pre-determined
rates''.  They believe that it is much better to leave such matters to
the market.

* They say that copyright legislation can be effective only if it is
properly enforced, and that co-operation between the hardware and
creative industries will be essential in order to devise technological
standards for systems of protection.  Efca is calling on the Commission
to take a leading role in ensuring that this takes place, arguing that
legislation will be required in order for any such technical protection
to be effective.

NEW BODY CREATED TO AID MEDIA II TRAINING BIDS

A new trade association has been set up by a group of European
audiovisual industry professionals who share a common interest in the
possibility of proposing new independent training initiatives in
response to calls for tender under Media II.

The new body, which is known as the Trade Association for New Training
Initiatives (Tanti), is intended to provide a method of communicating
with the European Commission and national ministries on points of
interest and concern regarding the aims, target groups, content and
techniques of training as well as the procedure for the award of funds
under Media II (see separate story on page one).

The association, which is a loose grouping of individuals without any
officers, is also designed to provide a means of exchanging information
between members on the timing and procedures of calls for tenders,
expressions of interest, bids and the evaluation and results of bids.

The members of Tanti (which means numerous in Italian) are all people
who have taken part in training initiatives under the old Media
Programme and are considering participating in the new one as well.
They see the creation of the new body as a means of reminding the EC
that there are other people interested in offering training under Media
II apart from those involved in the existing structures.

The association contains a number of members in London, including
Michael Ryan and Matthew Payne of J&M Entertainment, Katrina Wood of
MediaXChange, John Durie of Strategic Film Marketing, Julian Friedmann
of Blake Friedmann, Sandy Lieberson of the National Film and Television
School and Angela Jackson of Angela Jackson Solicitor.

Others include Philippe Kern of Polygram and Geoffroy de Foestraets of
Coppens van Ommeslaghe Hormans & Fauras (both in Brussels), Luigi
Ferrara of Studio Legale Ferrara Santamaria (Rome), Jose Antonio Suarez
Lozano of Suarez de la Dehesa Abogados (Madrid), Margaret O'Connor of
Northern Arts (Newcastle), Kriton Metaxopoulos and Christine Pigaki of
A. Metaxopoulos Law Office (Athens) and Mathias Schwarz of Schwarz
Kurtze Schniewind Kelwing Wicke (Munich).

POLYGRAM TAKES FULL CONTROL OF GRAMERCY

Polygram Filmed Entertainment said this week it was taking full control
of Gramercy Pictures by buying Universal Pictures' 50-per-cent interest
in the company.

The deal, which involves an undisclosed sum, follows the expiry of the
initial three-year term of the joint venture between PFE and Universal.

Gramercy was set up by the two companies in May 1992 to handle the
North American marketing of distribution of theatrical films, and has
released such films as Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Usual Suspects
and Pricilla, Queen of the Desert.  The 14 or so films planned for this
year include Dead Man Walking, Farga and Portrait of a Lady.

Universal will continue to release a select number of films through
Gramercy including Grace of My Heart and Cold Comfort Farm.

UK BOX-OFFICE HOLDS STEADY AT #381 MILLION

The total amount taken at the UK box-office in 1995 was #381,361,499,
from 305 films on release.  The result is almost exactly the same as it
was the year before, when 299 films generated revenues of #381,871,307.

Given that admissions figures for the year are expected to be down by
about nine per cent (see separate story on page 5), this implies a
significant rise in average revenues per ticket.  This appears to be
due partly to an increase in prices, and partly to a relative absence
in 1995 of attractive children's films.

The statistics show that 186 US films were on release in the year,
grossing #319,157, 478 (83.69 per cent of the total) and averaging
#1,715,900 each.  Thirty two wholly-UK films were shown, earning
#32,954,094 (864 per cent) at an average of #1,029,815.  Seventeen UK
co-productions were on release, taking #6,881,635 (1.8 percent) at an
average of #404,802.

The figures thus continue to exhibit the distortion caused in 1994 by
the phenomenal success of the Rank/Polygram-distributed Four Weddings
and a Funeral, the most successful British film ever, which grossed #27
million, helping to push the UK share up to 10.53 per cent and US share
down to 85.63 per cent, compared with a usual level of more than 90 per
cent (Screen Finance 8:1).

The 1995 UK figures have also been skewed by the performance of a
single film - the UIP-distributed Goldeneye, which was released on
November 24 and had taken #14,785,676 by the end of December, or 3.88
per cent of the total box-office for the year.  This made it the third
most popular film of 1995 after Warner Bros' Batman Forever
(#20,013,560) and UIP's Caspar (#16,011,194).

The rest of the figures have been affected by the surprisingly strong
performance of the two Australian films which made in into the top 40 -
Muriels's Wedding (number 12 with #7,919,101) and Babe (number 18 with
#6,717,643).  The overall Australian total for the year was #14,720,199
(3.86 per cent).  The strong UK and Australian showings have combined
to keep the US share down.

But if Goldeneye is excluded, the remaining 31 wholly UK features
grossed only #18,168,418, for an average of #586,078.  This reflects
the fact that only three other UK films made it into the top 40 for the
year -- Shallow Grave (#5,078,079 and 23rd), The Madness of King George
(#4,258,079 and 28th), and Jack and Sarah (#3,195,793 and 40th).

No other non-US films made it into the chart.

Forty other European productions were on release over the year -- 28
national productions (15 from France) and 12 international co-
productions (with no UK participation).  The 40 films grossed
#5,196,465 (average #129,912), with the 12 co-productions taking
#2,392,725 (average #199,394).

The 30 releases from countries outside the USA and Europe earned
#17,171,826 (average #572,394).  But without the two top-rating
Australian films the figure would have been only #2,535,082 (average
#90,539).

The top distributor, as in previous years, was UIP.  Its 25 films
grossed #94,281,817 -- boosted by Caspar, Goldeneye and the fourth-
placed Apollo 13 -- to take 25.35 per cent of the market.

Next was Buena Vista, which released 32 films, more than anyone else,
helping to counter the fact that its top films Pocahontas and Die Hard
With a Vengeance came no higher than seventh and eighth in the chart.
It took a total of #77,759,690 (20.91 per cent).

In third place was Warner Bros with 24 releases and #68,047,766 (18.30
per cent).  Nearly half of this came from two films -- Batman Forever
and the sixth-placed Interview With the Vampire.

Fox was well behind with 17 releases and #24,654,826 (6.63 per cent).
This reflected the fact that after the fifth-placed Braveheart its next
best film was The Usual Suspects in 24th place.  Columbia Tristar
similarly had 18 releases and #23,483,992 (6.31 per cent).  Its best
film was Bad Boys in 22nd place.

No European company came anywhere near the top US-owned distributors.
None achieved more than six per cent of the market, and much of the
revenue they did get was due to a handful of films.

For instance, Guild was ranked sixth, with 13 releases taking
#19,394,278 (5.22 per cent).  But more than half of this was due to the
ninth-placed Stargate.  Similarly, Polygram (4.06 per cent) depended
heavily on Shallow Grave and Jack and Sarah, and First Independent's
2.97 per cent was almost entirely reliant on the performance of Dumb
and Dumber.

* The top film for the weekend of January 5-7 was Entertainment's
Seven, which took #2,628,821 from 300 screens over its first three
days.  This was the best opening since Goldeneye on November 24, and
contributed to a record-breaking aggregate of #7,408,828 over the
period (more than twice the figure recorded over the pre-Christmas
weekend).

This result put the Brad Pitt-Morgan Freeman thriller well ahead of
Warner Bros' Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, the new Jim Carrey
vehicle, which took #1,477,912 from 339 screens over its second
weekend, to take its total gross to #6,272,986.

Both films overtook the surprise Christmas hit Babe, distributed by
UIP, which had been at the top of the chart for the previous three
weeks.  Its most recent weekend take of #1,451,553 from 360 screens
took its total gross so far to #10,057,900.

Only one UK-linked film was released in the last four weeks -- Ate de
Jong's All Men are Mortal, a co-production led by Sigma Picture
Productions of the Netherlands in partnership with Nova Film of the UK
and Rio of France.  This film stars Stephen Rea and Irene Jacob, was
released by Warner on January 5 and took #2,490 from three screens over
its first weekend.

Apart from Babe, only four other non-US films were released over the
period.  Jean Cocteau's 1946 classic La Belle et la Bete was re-
released by the BFI on December 15 and took #14,141 before ending its
run two weeks later.  The White Balloon, the festival hit from Iranian
director Jafar Panahi, was released by Electric on December 29 and has
so far taken #37,241.

Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 1830s swashbuckler The Horseman on the Roof was
released by Artificial Eye on January 5 and took #49,920 from 14
screens over its first three days.  Lars von Trier's The Kingdom was
released by the ICA on the same day and gained a weekend take of #3,717
from once screen.

MASS APPEAL

Russia's reputation as a tricky place to do business has obscured the
success of its public and privately-owned broadcasters in serving an
increasingly demanding - and massive - audience. Chris Dziadul reports

Russia's embrace of free-market principles since the end of one-party
rule and the thawing of the cold war has not been without
complications. But the well-documented political and economic crises
afflicting the country have tended to overshadow the continued growth
of its tv industry.

Television services in Russia, especially at a local level, are
flourishing, and revenues from tv advertising - which only came into
existence in 1990 - now exceed $500 million a year.

In Moscow, viewers have a choice of 11 terrestrial channels including
ORT (formerly the national broadcaster Ostankino), RTR (Russian public
television), 2x2 (a music and entertainment station) and NTV (the
largest independent commercial network in the country), along with the
U.S.-backed microwave operator Kosmos TV. In St Petersburg the choice
is the same if not even greater thanks to the city's proximity to the
Nordic countries. Even some of Russia's remotest cities are now served
by local stations, and one (Nika TV in Petrozavorsk) boasts one of the
most sophisticated cable networks in the country.

Russia's two national publicly-owned broadcasters, ORT (Channel 1) and
RTR (Channel 2), are both having to adjust to the needs of an
increasingly selective tv audience. RTR, which can be received by 92.2%
of the population and almost four-fifths of the inhabitants of the
former Soviet Union - effectively 300 million people - was launched in
May 1991.

RTR shows a variety of programming ranging from the highly popular
Vesti news bulletin (regularly watched by two-thirds of all Russian
viewers) to Santa Barbara. Partly-privatized ORT, on the other hand,
took over the functions of Ostankino when it was declared bankrupt in
early 1995 and covers the entire area of the former Soviet Union.

While ORT is still in a transitional phase, RTR has decided to embark
on an ambitious plan to launch the country's first digital satellite-
delivered tv package. A joint venture with an undisclosed UK company -
Network, it will, according to deputy chairman and director of this
March or April. Beaming from a transponder on Intelsat 604, the
channels will reach a potential audience of 40 million "collective
customers" served by cable systems throughout the former Soviet Union.
The start up costs for equipment alone are likely to be between $10-15
be added to the package in the near future.

Bunevich feels the service will introduce viewers to the idea of paying
for their programming and alleviate RTR's financial problems. Although
the broadcaster currently earns around 15% of its income from
advertising, the remainder is obtained from the government, and up to
75% of its total revenue is paid directly to the ministry of
telecommunications for the use of its transmission facilities. While
RTR is likely to remain a state holding company, it will in the future
probably undertake all of its entrepreneurial activities through a
group of daughter companies.

The most successful of the privately-owned broadcasting ventures has
been the NTV television company. Backed by three major Moscow banks
(Most-bank, Stolichny and Natsionalny Kredit), it was given official
approval by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1993, became fully self-
supporting in mid-1995 and currently - through having airtime on the
near-national Channel 4 (which it shares with 2x2) and affiliates in
seven locations including St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-
Don - reaches an estimated 102 million viewers in 168 towns and cities
in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.

NTV has built up a reputation for strong and independent news
reporting, with two of its three daily newscasts (Segodnya at 7pm and
10pm) regularly achieving a 34% audience share and the midnight news
(Segodnya v polnoch) peaking at 45%. Itogi, a weekly news and current
affairs program, also scores consistently high ratings.

The station in addition allocates 53% of its airtime to high-quality
films and each week carries eight foreign and three Russian movies,
along with six hours of serial telefilms. According to Andrei
Golovanov, its head of international relations and acquisitions, it has
agreements with over 30 distributors including Warner Bros, MCA, MGM
and 20th Century Fox and has been the first channel in the country to
air such movies as Jaws, The Deer Hunter and Silence of the Lambs.

Although NTV currently acquires almost all of its programming, it has
started to co-produce a 30 x half-hour series of documentaries named
Criminal Russia with a U.S. company and is "also considering some other
offers." In Golovanov's view, its success has been built on independent
news, a good selection of movies and working efficiently "without too
much bureaucracy." For this to continue, however, it may have to
increase its Russian output as "people are becoming tired of western
programs."

It is at a regional and local level, however, that the greatest
activity in Russian broadcasting is currently taking place. There are
currently several dozen stations (out of some 3,000 non-governmental
independent services around the country) operating on this basis which
started out three to four years ago as little more than pirates but
have since matured into highly professional organisations. Their
numbers include Skat TV (in Samara), Tomsk TV (Tomsk) and Afontovo,
which operates two TV channels and a radio station in the far eastern
city of Krasnoyarsk.

Several of these broadcasters have teamed up to create associations,
which have in turn developed into loose horizontal networks. One of
these (the 126-member Nezavisimaya Veschatelnaya Sistema - NVS) started
off in mid-1994 exchanging 26 minutes a week of programming including
news, tv movies, series and soaps and has since increased this to four
hours daily. Run on a co-operative basis, it has a potential audience
of 80 million and is seen by many as a potential rival to NTV.

The driving force behind such projects is Internews, an international
non-profit organization founded in the U.S. in 1981 which supports
independent television in newly-emerging democracies. Its activities in
the former Soviet Union, which date back to U.S.-Soviet "space bridges"
in the 1980s which brought people together face-to-face by satellite,
now include the Russian-American Media Partnerships Program (RAMP) and
Open Skies.

According to Grigory Libergal, Internews' programming director, Open
Skies was launched in January 1995 with aid from the Soros Foundation
and provides one hour of documentaries a day free of charge to all
stations willing to take part on condition that they respect copyright.
Some of the programming is produced by Internews itself and the number
of stations participating in the scheme throughout the former Soviet
Union has grown from 45 to over 180. During 1996 the service will be
restructured to offer more specials, series and retrospectives, with
airtime at weekends being increased to two 90-minute slots.

Internews has also operated a news exchange scheme called Local Time
since 1993. While at first also involving broadcasters in the Ukraine,
Belarus and Central Asia who have since gone on to run their own
versions, this is now a wholly Russian service which brings together
some 60 independent stations from around the country. Most file news
reports to Internews' head office in Moscow which are then compiled
into a weekly 30-minute show including some foreign items and sent back
to the stations for rebroadcasting.

While some observers may be surprised at the popularity of news
programming in Russia, Bruce Macdonald, the chairman of Moscow-based ad
agency BBDO Marketing, feels the country is "in the middle of a
pendulum swing" and that news will "always be popular and remain so in
a society that moves this fast." In his view, although it has gone
through its "romance" with soaps (Baywatch and Dynasty have both been
hugely successful and Dallas is expected to arrive shortly), the
Russian audience is still enjoying such programs as audience
participation shows purely for their novelty value and at the same time
"yearning for something that is Russian-produced."

Macdonald feels that one of the keys to the future of broadcasting in
Russia is the country's newly-emerging middle class, which although
still small is growing rapidly. The microwave service Kosmos TV, which
offers some 16 foreign satellite channels to 1,500 individual and
institutional subscribers in the capital, was initially aimed at
expatriates but has recently begun to introduce more local programming
including a film channel in recognition of these "new Russians."

Macdonald sees the launch of more national or near-national channels as
a distinct possibility and expects Murdoch to eventually establish a
presence in Russia - which could happen sooner rather than later if
BSkyB links up with the RTR Network. He also predicts tv ad spend -
which in 1995 BBDO estimates will total $486-594 million - should rise
by between 25-40% per year compared to the levels of 4-5% more common
in western Europe.

However, there are some worrying trends in an industry that was rocked
to the core by the murder of Vladislav Listyev, the general manager of
Ostankino, a year ago. Whereas in 1994 Russian advertisers accounted
for 55% of the total, the figure fell to 30% in 1995 as restrictions on
tobacco and alcohol advertising began to bite and two types of
commercials - financial categories and pyramid schemes - completely
disappeared. "The problems lie in the belief and understanding in
advertising and investment marketing per se," Macdonald said. "While
Russia is a very production-oriented country, consumers have until now
not been a consequence in a market which offered little if any choice."

The Russian advertising industry is currently dominated by two groups
which wholesale ad airtime (Premier SV and Video International) and
several smaller ones including Maxima, InterVID and Ekran-TV who have
to go through them in order to serve broadcasters. While Video
International handles RTR, NTV and 2x2 exclusively, Premier SV jointly
takes care of the accounts of ORT, Channel 5, TV6 (a Moscow station
once part-owned by Turner Broadcasting) and MTK with other wholesalers.

Dina Kalugina, the media director of Young & Rubicam Europe, is upbeat
about the future of television advertising in the country. In her
opinion 1994 was a significant year for the industry as media inflation
stood at an unacceptably high level of 5-7% a month. This has since
stabilized and after the upcoming summer's presidential elections the
market is likely to be boosted by new advertisers. It will also be
helped by a new advertising law which was adopted in July 1995 and
specifies, among other things, the percentage of broadcast time allowed
for commercials.

Kalugina added that current primetime rates range from $12-30,000 and
$19-30,000 per minute on ORT and RTR respectively, while those on such
local channels as 2x2 ($2,500 plus) and TV6 (up to $5,600) are
considerably cheaper. NTV is an exception, however, for although its
rates start as low as $8,000 they shoot up to $28,000 for its weekly
news program.

Kalugina also identifies a problem with programs or advertising blocks
which are pre-empted and replaced either officially or illegally by
local stations' programming. There is lack of information specifying
when these cutoff points occur and advertising blocks placed in between
programs appear to be most at risk.

Furthermore, she believes present programming trends will continue,
with news still drawing large audiences and soaps such as Santa Barbara
(RTR) and Marie Yelena Cassandra (2x2) being popular for a long time.
Sport, on the other hand, will continue to decline in popularity with
Russian viewers.

NEW NET IS WIRED TO THE MAX (AND MACS)

Bang up-to-date technology and its parent group's array of content
could give CNNfn a head start up the I-way...

Once upon a time, about two years ago, broadcasting meant merely
sending program information to those archaic television and radio
devices.

That's not enough anymore. Today a new network ain't a network unless
it's on the network, the Internet. It probably has to be on multiple
computer networks.

At least that's how you might feel after you read about CNN's new
financial network, CNNfn. In what will probably be a model for
broadcast networks of the future, not only will CNNfn be available via
the Galaxy 1R C-Band satellite, DirecTV, Prime Star, Netlink,
Superstar, Time-Warner and others, it will be wired to the max.

Not content with a mere broadcast presence, CNN is bringing out
"distinct but complementary content" on a number of digital networks as
well as the traditional cable and satellite venues. From launch on
December 29, CNNfn has had its own website on the Internet.
Additionally, the CNN and CNNfn website will be accessible from AT&T's
new online service, the AT&T Business Network. Last but not least,
CNNfn will be part of the CNN at Work service developed by CNN and
Intel.

CNNfn is promising initial programming daily from 7 am to 7 pm ET. Its
program offerings will include coverage of the financial markets,
technology and business, personal finance, Washington's impact on
finance, profiles of corporate managers and even tips on handling
stress. Interaction with the online audience (questions and answers
from the web site) call-ins and live remotes will be a big part of
CNNfn's overall modus operandi.

CNNfn has established "inter.face," a computer networked solution that
will allow CNNfn to set up "mini studios" in the offices of financial
managers and advisors, economists, consultants and other players in the
financial world around the country. These camera, monitor and Compaq
computer based teleconferencing set-ups use a proprietary modification
of Intel's Pro-share product to link sites around the country with
CNNfn's New York studio.

Inter.face studios in the offices of companies like Goldman-Sachs,
Merrill Lynch, Ernst and Young and Lehman Brothers will allow CNNfn to
respond immediately to changes in the market and get perspectives from
experts who can be interviewed on the job.

This saves them the trip to a studio for the interview and gets CNNfn
the interview faster than if they had to send out a remote truck. The
teleconferencing data, transferred over MFS Datanet's ATM network, will
be converted and broadcast out of the CNNfn studio.

The CNNfn website, CNNfn.com, will be grabbing content from CNNfn's
broadcast, plus creating additional content for the site, right in the
newsroom. The website will provide multimedia coverage of business
news, follow the U.S. and international markets, provide personal and
corporate financial management tips, disseminate market tips and gossip
and solicit comments and questions from surfers to use on air. Archives
available via the website will include programming information,
transcripts and air schedules of CNNfn and CNN programs, corporate
profiles, a business glossary, stories from Lexis-Nexis and, of course,
links to other sites.

Members of the AT&T Business Network, a dial-up online service, will
have a seamless link to the CNNfn web site. They'll also have exclusive
chat and message boards related to topics and stories on CNNfn.

CNN at Work is CNN's video and print news service for corporations. It
sends Headline News, CNN and CNNfn video over corporate LANs to desktop
PCs in the workplace. It features topic filtering, so you can have the
system look for subjects like "oil." CNN at Work will then grab related
stories from Time, Fortune, Lexis-Nexis and Knight Ridder Financial
News for you. It will alert you whenever stories about oil come up on
the three CNN services and then let you display the video in real-time
or tape it for later viewing.

For now, CNNfn's efforts will be focused on and deployed in the U.S.
There are hopes, but not a definite time table, for expansion to
elsewhere in the world.

All this action puts CNN at the forefront, not only in breadth of
technology, but in the re-purposing of content. Freelance writers have
always tried to resell the same story in different form to multiple
publishers just to survive. For years visionaries on the leading edge
of interactive television have pointed to news coverage as a prime
market. These information technologists have always seen the four hours
of background and additional data that didn't make the two-minute aired
piece as a goldmine. With interactive tv, they said, this additional
footage could be viewed by viewers who "wanted to know more" about any
given story. Obviously, CNN's websites and wired ventures will allow it
to take advantage of this gold mine, in addition to opening up new ways
to create exciting, original online content.

And that's not all. Remember, CNN has an interactive media division as
well. I wouldn't be surprised to see a whole shelf of CNNfn CD-Roms in
my local computer store in the next year or so.

CABLE OPERATORS PLUG IN TO ANALOG SET-TOPS

Though high-speed PC services have displaced video-on-demand as the
cable industry's hot new revenue stream, operators have not given up on
analog tv as a near-term platform for advanced, interactive services.
Jean-Luc Renaud and Mitch Shapiro review an analysis from hardware
manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta.

Anaheim's Western Cable Show made it clear that cable operators and
settop decoder suppliers have begun seriously to explore a strategy
that would use a new generation of "advanced" analog set-top boxes to
deliver limited interactive tv capabilities using on-screen text and
graphics transmitted via the vertical blanking interval (VBI).

These relatively low-cost devices will allow operators to create
"virtual channels" that require neither extra bandwidth nor an
investment in digital video compression.

Among the services that can be supported by advanced analog set-top
boxes are interactive viewing guides (IVGs), enhanced pay-per view
(EPPV) services, interactive advertising, subscriber messaging and text
and graphics-based information channels.

As cable operators have come to realise that near-term revenue streams
cannot justify the cost of digital set-top boxes and the other
components of a VOD system (such as broadband switching, servers and
modulators), many have pushed back their timetables for deployment of
digital set-top equipment.

As this occurs, advanced analog set-tops are emerging as a near-term
alternative to their digital counterparts. Whereas the latter are
expected initially to cost $375-$600, depending upon their
functionality, the former are priced just $25-$60 above the standard
analog converters which cable operators now purchase for $110-$130 per
unit.

According to a paper issued by Scientific Atlanta (S-A), one of the
leading suppliers of cable tv set-tops, "the installed base of advanced
analog set-top boxes in 1995 (in the U.S.) may exceed one million
units, while digital set-tops will be less than 50,000."

The paper, entitled Advanced Analog Systems: Providing Revenue-
Generating Applications for Today's Network Systems, was commissioned
to Probe Research's Gary Kim, described as a long-time observer of the
broadband industry.

In its paper, S-A provided some estimates of the new incremental
revenue streams that might be generated by interactive services running
on advanced analog set-top platforms.

The analysis begins with a pay-per-view business model (Table 1) which
considers three scenarios: low (12,000 subscribers), baseline (15,000)
and high (18,000). Annual operator revenues from PPV (for the average
system) can range from $27,000 to more than $133,000. But operators can
make more money through making PPV "more innovative."

The S-A analysis considered low, baseline and high estimates for an
interactive guide business and for two versions of a "virtual channel"
information service: the first funded by advertisers, the second funded
by subscriber fees.

The types of content that might be delivered via virtual channel
information services, the paper suggests, include news summaries,
weather, traffic, sports, financial information, local event listings,
restaurant menus/delivery, lottery results, health tips and community
events.

Scientific-Atlanta's analysis considers three combinations of IVG
penetration and pricing (Table 2). The "low" revenue model assumes 30%
penetration and a monthly subscriber fee of $0.50. The figures for the
"base case" and "high" estimates are 50%/$1.00 and 80%/$1.95,
respectively.

For all three scenarios, it is assumed that a cable operator would keep
90% of IVG fees, passing on 10% to the provider of program schedule
data. Based on these assumptions, per-subscriber annual revenues in the
three scenarios are: $1.62 (low), $5.40 (base) and $16.85 (high).

The advertiser-funded virtual-channel model (Table 3) is considered
next. In this model, the advertiser provides content and sponsorship.
The network operator's advertising sales department sells the virtual
channel, just as it sells "local avails" now. "From the advertiser's
perspective, this is a strong vehicle for target marketing, is less
expensive to deliver than traditional advertising and marks the
advertiser as an early adopter of technology," argues the S-A paper.

The model considers three monthly prices an advertiser might pay for
each sponsored virtual channel: $500, $1,200 and $1,900. Annual per-
subscriber revenues generated by a single virtual channel under these
three assumptions are: $0.50 (low), $0.96 (base) and $1.27 (high).

Estimated annual operator revenues for advertiser-funded virtual
channels can range from $5,000 to more than $22,000 per channel. Using
rates from various cable advertising sources, estimated rate structures
could range from $500 to $1,900 a month per channel.

Scientific-Atlanta's model for subscription-based virtual information
channels (Table 4) assumes subscribers are charged a monthly fee for a
package of channels and that operators pass on 10% of these fees to
content providers.

The model considers three combinations of monthly pricing and
penetration: $1.00/30% (low), $2.00/42% (base) and $3.00/60% (high).
The annual per-subscriber revenues for these three scenarios are $3.24,
$9.07 and $19.44, respectively.

Based on S-A's analysis, a cable operator using advanced analog set-top
boxes to deliver an IVG and a package of subscription-based virtual
channels, might generate incremental annual revenues ranging from $4.86
to $55.73 per subscriber.

This does not include any additional PPV or subscription-service
revenues that might be generated by IVG and virtual channel promotional
material.

It also does not include potential revenues from direct-response
advertising in which subscribers use their remote control to request
follow-up mailings containing information about a product featured in a
tv ad. Experience with 800-number direct response ads suggests
advertisers are willing to pay significant amounts for access to such
self-selected prospects.

Estimated annual operator revenues for subscriber-based virtual
channels can range from $38,000 to more than $349,000 per package of
channels.

The S-A paper also offers the hybrid model - supported by subscribers
and sponsored by advertising. The subscriber pays an o-la-carte fee for
customized information; the advertiser charges lower advertising rates -
 possibly half the rate for completely advertiser-funded channels.
Benefits of this hybrid model include reduction of sponsorship costs
for the advertiser, allowing smaller advertisers to participate; the
ability for an advertiser to reach a specific target market, for
example, subscribers who pay for sports information; the provision to
subscribers of customized information at a reasonable price; and the
advantage for network operators to relay on two revenue streams
(advertiser and subscriber).

Virtual channels create a new market for content providers who develop
applications for virtual channels and software vendors who provide
authoring tools that facilitate building and testing applications.

So, given their potential revenues and modest incremental costs, it is
not surprising that advanced analog set-top decoders are gaining
increased attention from cable operators that face capital constraints
yet are eager to explore the brave new world of interactive tv.

MORE TV NEWS, OR MORE OF THE SAME?

ABC is launching a 24-hour news channel in the U.S. to capitalize on
its brand name, worldwide reporting resources and 200-plus broadcast
affiliates. NBC and Microsoft are launching a 24-hour news network for,
well, the same reasons, with the added boast they will take advantage
of emerging online distribution technologies.

Rupert Murdoch may launch a 24-hour news channel, he too for the
reasons cited by ABC and NBC, and  because CNN is too left-wing. "We
think it's time for a truly objective news channel," the mighty mogul
said during a speaking engagement.

While the ABC, Microsoft-NBC and Murdoch networks are six months to a
year or longer in the offing, just days ago CNN launched its third news
channel, CNN Financial News (CNNfn). And NBC is already on the air with
two info-oriented channels, CNBC and America's Talking. (NBC will, in
fact, drop America's Talking in favor of the new news network, MSNBC
Cable, thereby plugging it into 20 million homes the day it launches.)

If the rest of the mystic distribution puzzle can be solved, Americans
will be flooded with news. Unfortunately, they'll drown before they're
ever informed.

ABC executives talk about offering their network's top-rated programs -
shows like World News Tonight, Nightline and Good Morning America -
along with live coverage of major breaking news stories. In other
words, they'll chop up what they already produce, repackage it and then
add that greatest of all-news-network fillers, pictures of any old
event you can point a camera at.

It will be CNN with the one thing CNN doesn't have, big-name news shows
fronted by big-name news stars. NBC will do the same, though further
chopping up pictures and sound and graphics into finer bits and bytes
so all that content  can be downloaded from Microsoft's online service-
cum-web-site-cum-cyber-offering. Ditto Murdoch, though presumably his
will have to add in that special something that makes live shots of
press conferences, trials and Congressional hearings less left-wing.

These 24-hour wheels of news will spin and spin. Sparks will fly.
Images will leap from our televisions.

No doubt one of these networks will be on hand with a portable uplink
the day war breaks out somewhere. It will be the live shot of the
century.

No doubt all of them will switch on the next time a criminal-turned-
celebrity or celebrity-turned-criminal hears his verdict from the jury.
It will be a defining moment in our lives.

We and these networks will jump from live shot to defining moment to
live shot. Television news will finally give up any pretense that it
should, even every once in a while, explain what its cameras see or
examine what its microphones hear.

And let me be clear: explaining, examining, you don't do this by asking
your reporter on the scene for twenty seconds of what she thinks, or
even sitting five or six of them down in a studio to hash things over.
In the U.S., since the verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial, not one of
the networks has attempted anything like a definitive documentary on
the problem of race in this country - only the issue that looms largest
in America at the end of this, the American century. I'd expect such a
documentary to use all the story-telling technique and production
pizzazz I'm always told tv news can bring to bear on a story. Why was
the independent low-budget film Hoop Dreams a better examination of
race than anything any network attempted during or after the Simpson
trial?

When American troops are involved in skirmishing in Bosnia, no doubt
camera lenses will spring out of the brush faster than gun barrels. Has
any network even tried to explain how the former Yugoslavia got to be
the way it is, and, then, American soldiers got to be there? This is a
conflict where - at least until U.S. military involvement began -  the
U.S. public didn't care what was going on. So the network news
divisions didn't try too hard to explain it.

All of us, commentators and news executives alike, have for years
accepted the conventional wisdom that the U.S. networks had to give up
on serious documentary work. Prime-time just became too competitive to
waste it on old-time habits like examining and explaining. Today, when
the networks put current affairs in prime, the vehicle is the news
magazine, a salacious mix of consumer scare stories, celebrity (and
royalty) interviews and "investigative journalism" in which the good
guys and bad guys are clearly identified, and nothing much is learned
about a system or plan or idea.

But the broadcasting universe is changing. ABC and Microsoft-NBC, for a
start, are setting up new news networks, with all that round-the-clock
time to fill. Will we get what we gave up, or will it just be more - in
this case oceans more - of the same?

JAN. 18 FCC MEETING DOUBTFUL BECAUSE OF GOVT. SHUTDOWN

     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting Jan. 18 was very much in doubt
because of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight between
Administration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commission
policy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sent
to commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days before
meeting (TVD Oct 23 p5), although that deadline can be waived by
commissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCC
sources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters also
will be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because no
one has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.

     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrum
issues, to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interest
in spectrum matters.  At that meeting, new ways to allocate
spectrum were to be discussed by invited witnesses.  Commission is
required by law to meet at least once each month and there's now
talk that Jan. 30 session will be considered as meeting for month. 
However, since agency legally can't put out notices or news
releases during budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must await
its formal return to work, according to sources.

     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been outside govt.
contractors, such as maintenance, security, vending, transcription
services.  Martin Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, said
he's losing $20,000 daily and has laid off all but 10 of his work
force of 45.  A few are on board because auctions generated small
amount of business, he said.  Clark said he kept his employees on
payroll during week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it
2nd time.  He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses because
experience has shown average daily revenues of $20,000 "don't
change" after snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employees
for Christmas Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry,
very angry about this.  Millions of people across the United States
that do work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."

     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack of
funds, some were permitted to continue working on such things as
auctions, court arguments and international matters (TVD Dec 25
p4).  FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day of
shutdown, and ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess. 
Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec.
18.  SMR auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Some
auction staffers continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div.
Dec. 29. revealed "7 or 8" employees were on board, along with
Wireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau Chief
Rosalind Allen in front office.

     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &
Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Dec. 28, weren't back
next day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18
because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common Carrier
Bureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified as
essential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with Mass
Media Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," said
employee on 8th floor Dec. 29.

     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leaving
building from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not staying
long, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permitted
to work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' staffers
continued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in at
least one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviser
to Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghouse
takeover of CBS (TVD Nov 27 p3).

     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s
$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be on
agenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing comments
have passed while Commission has been closed, and in addition to
comments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaints
and applications once it reopens.  One lawyer said stacks of
petitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting to
be filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCC
filing rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. Robert
Hoggarth said.

     Meanwhile, President Clinton resumed meetings with Senate
Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
Dec. 29 in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expected
to continue through New Year's weekend.

HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said Dec. 29 that staff-level negotiations
have rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early return
of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources said
no deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talks
continued at White House.  They also said that there would be "no
giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statement
contradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who
was reported by Reuters Dec. 28 as objecting to what he called
"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there were
problems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.

     Sources said some published estimates of value of analog
spectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting services
to digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While some
reports have put value as high as $70 billion, sources said figure
is more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount, they said,
wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and consumers
convert to new technologies before either is ready.  Negotiators
also rejected White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to
consumers to help them adjust to conversion through purchase of
set-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use
technology that market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit
development of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill sources said,
adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine whether ATV
licenses should be awarded and what conditions should be attached,
including disposition of analog spectrum.

     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" in
bill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of having
him contradict rest of Senate leadership, including Commerce
Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee Democrat
Hollings (D-S.C.), who said deal was in final form.  House
Republicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to make
changes, principally in sections that had been removed from bill
and that they wanted restored.

     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal of
provision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,
provision that was in House version but not in Senate's.  House
measure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White
(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill also
aimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate on
regulation provision revolved around argument that there's no
telling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it be
common carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separate
titles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preempt
regulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working to
have clauses restored. 

     ACLU sent letter Dec. 22 to members of conference committee on
telecom bill urging vote against another part of Cox/Wyden/White
proposal, dealing with cyberporn on Internet.  ACLU urged rejection
of plan because it "will immediately damage freedom of expression,
the bedrock value at the core of the First Amendment and will
structure the telecommunications industry so that free speech and
privacy are in permanent jeopardy."  Laura Murphy, dir. of ACLU
Washington office, and Donald Haines, legislative counsel, listed
3 objections to bill:  (1) It would "establish a big government
censorship regime" for Internet and on-line communications by
providing criminal penalties for what adult users can see on their
own computers and by regulating protected speech.  (2) It would set
up similar "big government censorship" for TV programs.  ACLU said
V-chip would "vest the government, not parents," with control over
TV set through ratings system "driven by government guidelines on
content."  (3) It would "foster communications monopolies that
stifle diversity and free speech."

     Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that would lift
restrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier licenses. 
Sources said there was no agreement between House and Senate on
measure, so it was dropped because Senate language that would allow
FCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S. businesses was
"worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to receive conference
report this week after returning from break.  But some senators not
only received it, but signed it, before leaving for Christmas.  It
will be up to parliamentary experts to determine status of
conference report if lawmakers have signed, believing it to be
final version, while others say it's still open for discussion. 
House sources said bill isn't final until majority of conferees
have voted for it, but at same time they don't expect major
changes.

     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the work
of the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement for
facilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.) and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.
Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by the
Senate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final product
should be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetings
this week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority Leader
Armey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to be
resolved.

MUST-CARRY APPEAL OPPOSED

     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule for
must-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have been
decided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,
Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid for
quick action (TVD Dec 25 p4).  Govt. brief, signed by Solicitor
Gen. Drew Days, also said expedited schedule would be hardship for
govt. because of federal shutdown and holidays.  Cable interests
had hoped for quick decision on expedited treatment, but hadn't
been notified by Court by our deadline.

     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in this
case," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,
"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by Supreme
Court in earlier decision (TVD July 4/94 p2).  Now, govt. said,
Court must evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence
submitted to lower court to determine whether Congress had enough
evidence to back its decision to impose must-carry.

     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, NAB, INTV,
APTS, PBS and CPB said in joint brief.  However, they said it took
5 months for lower court to consider evidence and uphold
congressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would be
required before this Court could reverse that judgment and strike
down a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how much
this appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Court
to decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."

     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,
just quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heard
this term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmers
repeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time if
necessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't make
quick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't over
facts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also said
majority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at all
because one judge backed full hearing on merits.

     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)
Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staff
employees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply with
expedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows that
must-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth in
channel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry on
channel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers have
more, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry was
imposed, so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable
argument that quick decision is needed because next date for
selecting between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct.,
said any burden of that deadline is on broadcasters who are willing
to accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on
must-carry for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because
no advanced TV will be in service before Court's next term.

CONGRESS TIGHTENS RULES ON GIFTS

     Effective New Year's Day, new ethics rules covering House
members and staffers prohibit them from accepting "any gift" unless
it falls "into one of the specific exemptions."  Cited as of
"nominal value" and acceptable are "baseball cap or a T-shirt,"
while flowers for office "every week" from same lobbyist aren't
acceptable.  New Senate gift rules also are effective Jan. 1, but
they aren't as restrictive as those for House.

     For instance, on Senate side gifts worth no more than $49.99
may be accepted, with gifts valued at no more than $100 (below $10
doesn't count) okay from any one source over 12-month period. 
Current Senate limit is $250 per year for gifts from one source. 
On House side, any gifts of value will be banned except from family
member or close personal friend of long standing.  House rules
don't define "nominal value," but do list several items under that
category that wouldn't be acceptable, along with those that would.

     In explaining new policy (House Rule 52), House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct uses such terms as "Larry Lobbyist"
and "Moe Member," "Lucy Lobbyist" and "Carl Congressman," "Joe
College" and "Roy Representative," "Connie Constituent" and "Myrna
Member."  Among "biggest changes," said memo explaining new rules,
is elimination of local meal exception.  That means member or
staffer no longer will be able to accept meal at someone else's
expense, while senators and their staffers may continue to do so. 
Also prohibited by House are gifts to relatives or close associates
of members.

     However, meals for House members still are acceptable during
travel or speaking engagements "in connection with official
duties."  It said members and staff "may still accept food and
refreshments of nominal value... e.g., coffee and donuts, hors
d'oeuvres [liquor isn't mentioned] at a reception" and "free
attendance at a widely attended event."

     Tickets to sports events, plays and musicals also are
forbidden under new House rules.  As example, "Stanley Staffer" no
longer may accept tickets to hockey game offered by "Laura
Lobbyist."  If "Chloe Congresswoman" goes to widely attended event,
she may not accept "entertainment collateral to the event," such as
theatre tickets or food "not provided in a group setting." 
However, gifts up to $250 in value from long-time friends still may
be accepted, while gifts of more than $250 must be approved by
Committee.

     Attendance at charity events (including with spouse) still
will be exempt under new rules, but gifts of travel and lodging in
connection with such events won't.  For instance, "Ron
Representative" and his wife may accept tickets offered by
"National Assn. of Do-Gooders" for its annual fund-raising dinner
but they may not accept tickets from "MegaCorporation" that
purchased table for same dinner.  Do-Gooders also host celebrity
golf tournament in Palm Springs and if Ron Representative wants to
participate he must pay his own transportation and lodging but may
accept meals and waiver of entrance fee.

     New rule continues to allow payment of travel by House members
and staffers to NAB conventions, for example, because "funding of
this kind of activity is deemed reimbursement to the House and not
a gift to the individual traveler."  Such free travel is limited to
4 days in contiguous 48 states, 7 days (excluding travel days)
elsewhere.  All privately funded travel expenses must be itemized
and made public within 30 days.

     On Senate side, gifts are defined as "any item having monetary
value."  Annual gift restriction of $100 ($250 from personal
friends) doesn't apply to home-state products for promotional
purposes, personal hospitality (except from lobbyists and foreign
agents), political contributions, training "in the interests of the
Senate," charitable fund-raisers "as long as activities are not
substantially recreational."  Unlike House, senators and staffers
may accept travel and lodging for such events.  Senate rules also
contain section on "special prohibitions for lobbyists and foreign
agents."  Under old Senate rules, only gifts valued at $100 or more
counted toward $250 annual total permitted from single source, and
spouses' and dependents' gifts were counted separately.

     Unrelated to House and Senate ethics rules, on Dec. 19
President Clinton signed into law first major revision of lobbying
restrictions since 1946.  While old law applied only to lobbying of
Congress, new restrictions also affect senior Exec. Branch
officials and cover lobbying by nonprofit groups.  Said President
in signing bill:  "Lobbyists in the back room, secretly writing law
and looking for loopholes, do not have a place in our democracy." 
New law specifies that persons who spend more than 20% of their
work time on lobbying must register.  Generally speaking, broadcast
lobbyists said new law would have little or no impact on them. 
They already file reports 4 times annually (new law requires 2 such
reports per year), listing percent of their salaries that goes
toward lobbying activities.

     Time Warner (TW) is withdrawing from cable venture in Taiwan,
citing difficulties in getting govt. licenses.  TW and 2 local
partners had applied for 18 cable licenses in 1994, but none has
been approved, it said, so MSO decided not to pursue $80-million
joint venture.

he will give up his title Jan. 12.  New CBS Pres.-CEO Peter Lund
"has decided to make a change," Ober told colleagues.  His
departure had been widely speculated since Westinghouse acquired
control of network (TVD Nov 27 p3).  Andrew Heyward, CBS News vp
and exec. producer of CBS Evening News, is seen as likely
successor.  Ober is 53, has been with CBS in various jobs for 30
years, was pres. of owned TV stations just before being named News
pres. 5 years ago.  He was paid $1.46 million in "vested and
unvested" stock options when Westinghouse acquired network and had
signed new 3-year contract worth more than $3.3 million in 1995.

     Rep. Tauzin (R-La.) said he won't run for Senate, in part

     Rep. Tauzin (R-La.) said he won't run for Senate, in part
because he expects to play major role on Telecom Subcommittee in
future.  His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said Tauzin "has a handshake
agreement" with Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.) on Tauzin's
future role on committee, and his "seniority would be respected." 
Johnson stopped short of saying that Tauzin would be named chmn. of
subcommittee when current Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) retires at end of
1996.  Spokesman for House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tauzin's
seniority "puts him next in line" for Subcommittee chair, and
Tauzin will be given "full consideration" for job.  Rep. Oxley
(R-O.) is current Subcommittee vice chmn., would like to take over
chairmanship.  Oxley also is chmn. of subcommittee handling
commerce, trade and hazardous waste issues.  Technically, speaker
doesn't appoint subcommittee chmn. -- committee members vote on
recommendations by chairman of full panel.  Tauzin, who switched
from Democratic Party earlier this year, has more seniority than
Oxley, but he also has more seniority than Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.) and wasn't given Bliley's job when he changed
parties.  Hill sources said Tauzin has been in Republican
leadership's good graces for years, working with Republicans to
help them go around Democratic leadership.

ADVANCED FIBER TECHNOLOGIES BRING RAY OF HOPE TO BELEAGUERED
CABLE INDUSTRY

     While the threat of regulatory intervention set an ominous
tone for the Western Cable Show held December 13-15 in Anaheim,
CA, advances in the use of fiber technology to improve the
picture quality, reliability and channel capacity of cable TV
systems dominated the exhibit floor.  "Fiber trunking is just
beginning," said Jim Chiddix, senior vice president of
engineering and technology at cable multiple system operator ATC.
"There were only a few systems installed in 1988, a couple
hundred in 1989, and we're expecting a thousand or so in 1990,"
he said.
     Cable operators are hoping that better picture quality and
greater system reliability will translate into happier customers-
-and take the heat of pending reregulation off the cable
industry.  "More than half of cable subscribers cite picture
quality and reliability--and, more importantly quick response to
difficulties that arise--as problems facing the cable industry,"
says Nick Hamilton Piercy, vice president of engineering and
technical services for Rogers Cable TV in Canada.  With that in
mind, Piercy says Rogers' experimental system in Toronto features
a fiber backbone ring structure that can send signals in both
directions if service is interrupted.  "There's self-healing if
there is a cut," he says.  In addition, the installation of a
secondary ring reduces the number of subscribers served per hub.
It also cuts the amount of coaxial cable (and therefore the
number of amplifiers or power boosters) between the headend and
homes.

CABLE'S FIBER CHALLENGE: ADAPTING OPTICAL DEVICES TO CATV ANALOG
NEEDS

     Reducing the number of devices between the signal source and
subscribers is essential to improve signal power and reduce
picture noise and distortion.  But off-the-shelf laser devices
(built for digital transmission) need to be adapted to the analog
requirements of cable television, says ATC's Chiddix.  Most
optical components developed for digital modulation in
telecommunications were designed for simply turning on and off
high-speed signals, and therefore encounter difficulties when
used to transmit compressed video information in analog form.
     Nonetheless, advances in distributive feedback (DFB) lasers
are resulting in higher power from cable headends with lower
noise and distortion, reports Dave Robinson, director of Jerrold
Division's Cableoptics.  Robinson notes that the first high-
performance lasers built with cable applications in mind
(manufactured by Ortel Corp.) resulted in a 3-5 dB carrier to
noise improvement in Jerrold's second-generation AM Fiber Optics
Backbone system.
     Jerrold's new system can now deliver 80 channels (an
increase of 35 channels) on two fibers for 10 miles with a 56 dB
carrier to noise ratio.  Field trials will begin in April or May
in Cablevision systems in the Northeast, with volume purchases
expected in July, Jerrold's John Burke tells VTN.
     Robinson says Jerrold will continue to take fiber "to-the-
tap" (the tap is a device installed in cable feeder lines that
provides signals to the subscriber's drop), rather than all the
way into the home--at least for the next 10 years.  "Coaxial drop
has one gigahertz (GHz) capability and there is a large cost
penalty extending beyond the tap directly into the home," he
said.
     On the drawing board are optical amplifiers to replace
current devices.  Howard Westlake, research engineer at British
Telecom Research defines optical amplifiers as "devices that
increase the intensity of an optical signal without translating
the signal between an optical and electrical regime."  Westlake
says advantages of optical amplifiers include their compactness,
low component requirements and wide bandwidth capacity for system
upgrades for HDTV and other enhanced services.

CABLE SYSTEM BANDWIDTH INCREASING, BUT THERE MAY BE POINT OF
DIMINISHING RETURNS
     Despite skepticism, cable operators are adamant that
consumer appetite for more and more channels will continue,
either for greater variety of programming, or for future
bandwidth-intensive services such as HDTV, video-on-demand and
two-way interactive services.  Rogers' Piercy, for example,
forecasts a rise in system channel capacity from the current 35-
40 level to 58 channels by the end of 1990, 77 channels by 1993
and possibly 150 channels by 1998.
     With the addition of channels, cable systems have seen a
corresponding evolution of bandwidth from 200 MHz to the 550 MHz
systems shown in force on the exhibit floor--and the industry is
talking about a further increase to a one GHz platform.  However,
one GHz systems may be 8-9 years away, says Intermedia consultant
Dave Large, and "it may not be as simple to make increased
bandwidth increments" as it was in the past.  For example, while
new fiber backbone systems decrease amplifier cascades (or the
number of amplifiers in a sequence), maintenance costs for
amplifiers are not eliminated and signal leakage is still
unaffected.  Furthermore, optical amplifiers for one GHz fiber AM
backbone systems are "a long time in coming--hopefully available
by 1998," adds Bob Young, director of product marketing at
Jerrold.
     But Large says the most daunting problem may lie in homes.
While cable equipment manufacturers are doing their best to
eliminate set-top converters (see story next page), consumer TV
sets will not be able to tune in the ever-increasing number of
channels unless manufacturers change their TV design.  In
addition, home automation standards (such as the EIA's CEbus)
can't handle one GHz signals.

SOLUTIONS TO CABLE'S CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INTERFACE PROBLEM ONLY
ADDING CONFUSION

     Several solutions have been proposed to solve the cable
industry's consumer electronics interface problem (which for
millions of viewers has resulted in a mass of wires and devices
on top of TV sets and the inability to use remote controls.)  But
close investigation of the alternatives only leads to more
confusion, says Alex Best, senior vice president of engineering
at Cox Cable.  "The optimal conditional access device has not yet
been invented," he said.  But trials by cable equipment
manufacturers continue.
     Alternatives include: 1) cigarette pack-sized Multiport
addressable decoders which connect directly into a Multiport plug
in the back of TVs and VCRs; 2) off-premise equipment on a
telephone pole or tap that serves a number of subscribers; 3) on-
premise equipment placed on the side of a home that serves one
subscriber; and 4) "universal" remotes that can control a variety
of consumer products.
     At best, Multiport decoders are only expected to penetrate
5-15% of the 98.7 million addressable subscribers forecast for
1997, says Claude Baggett, director of systems engineering at
CableLabs.  (That is if the Multiport ever gets off the ground at
all, since TV and VCR manufacturers are reluctant to go to the
expense of putting the plug in their products.)  A market for the
Multiport will only develop if VCR manufacturers get into the
act, says Baggett, since TVs have longer lives and will therefore
take longer to be replaced by consumers.  At the Western Show,
Jerrold was showing its EIA Multiport Unit to gauge market
reaction.
     On and off-premise devices offer numerous advantages over
the Multiport, most notably the ability to connect and disconnect
without service calls and the transmission of "clean"
(unscrambled) signals from the headend, which reduces signal
degradation.
     At the Western show, Scientific-Atlanta introduced its
Addressable Interdiction system, which delivers broadband signals
to as many outlets (TVs or VCRs) as required in four subscriber
homes.  Signals for pay services are scrambled using a "jamming"
technique that can encrypt up to 32 channels.  Testing of the
Addressable Interdiction system is now underway at Warner Cable
Communications' Williamsburg, VA system.  A total of 250 homes
will be passed by late this month, with testing lasting over a
year.  Scientific-Atlanta says the system can also be configured
in an on-premise format.
     The advantage of on-premise over off-premise is that the
costs per subscriber always equals the cost per port.  (With
Scientific-Atlanta's 4-port system, if one home is a non-
subscriber, the port goes unused--though non-subscribers can be
sold pay-per-view programming).  Jerrold is now trialing its
Starport on-premise device in Tele-Communications Inc. systems
and hopes to have a prototype in production later this month.
     Zenith, which is "still looking into on and off-premise
technology," is pushing the "universal" remote concept with the
introduction of the PCC-IQ "learning" multibrand remote control,
which can be programmed to operate 41 brands of TV sets, 40
brands of VCRs and 50 brands of cable converters.  It can also
learn up to 120 separate functions to control any other device
operated by infrared commands, such as stereos and compact disc.
Shipments are expected first quarter 1990 at about $30 to cable
operators.

FCC ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL SEE ANOTHER EXTENSION, SIMULCAST
SYSTEMS GAIN FAVOR

     The consensus at the Western show was that the FCC's
Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Services, whose life
was already extended by two years beyond its November 1989
expiration date (VTN, May 15, 1989, p. 3), will need another one-
to two-year extension to complete its task of recommending an
advanced television standard for the U.S.
     Craig Tanner, vice president of advanced television projects
at CableLabs, says that despite the lengthy process of bringing
HDTV to consumers, it's unlikely that the U.S. will follow Tele-
Communication, Inc.'s recommended course of "leapfrogging" analog
HDTV technology by directly implementing digital HDTV as the
technology develops (VTN, April 3, 1989, p. 1).  "It's an
attractive idea but it exists only in concept at this point," he
says.
     Tanner notes that advanced TV experts are leaning toward the
selection of a simulcast system that concurrently transmits one
NTSC signal and one non NTSC-compatible HDTV signal through two
separate 6 MHz channels.  Such a system would leave the HDTV
channel free from the technological constraints of NTSC, and,
eventually, spectrum devoted to original NTSC channels could be
used for other applications (including more advanced versions of
HDTV).
     HDTV transmission proponent North American Philips has
already announced that it is developing a simulcast system it
hopes to submit late in the testing cycle (VTN, Sept. 25, 1989,
p. 3).  Also, the David Sarnoff Research Center is reportedly
working on a simulcast system based on its two-phase augmentation
ACTV system.

CICIORA: CABLE SHOULD WORK ON NTSC IMPROVEMENTS WHILE WAITING FOR
HDTV

     Given the likelihood of delays in testing and standard
setting by the FCC, we won't see HDTV receivers in stores until
Christmas 1994.  Meanwhile, cable should concentrate on
improvements in NTSC delivery, says Walt Ciciora, vice president
of technology for ATC and chairman of CableLabs Technical
Advisory Committee.  "For a long time, NTSC was so much better
than consumer electronics could deliver, and it didn't make sense
to make transmission better than what could be displayed.  Now
the reverse is true," he said.  NTSC enhancements need to be made
not only in the receiver (such as those developed by Faroudja
Laboratories), but in the headend as well through new fiber and
amplifier technologies (see page 1).
     Improving NTSC technology will also prepare the industry for
advanced television.  "HDTV needs more channels, less noise, less
distortion and reduced microreflection--the same requirements for
improved NTSC," said Ciciora.  If the cable industry takes
appropriate steps to improve NTSC, "we'll be in an excellent
position to deliver HDTV long before anyone is willing to spend
money on it".

IMMINENT INVASION OF HDTV VCRs A BOGEYMAN, LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTS
ARE THE THREAT

     Some industry observers, including CableLabs' Tanner,
suspect HDTV may achieve significant penetration of homes sooner
than many predict.  A set of HDTV technologies, including
compression, display, transmission and production, are in "a
state of near readiness," and only need refinement, packaging and
cost reduction for consumer acceptance, says Tanner.  "We should
never underestimate the ability of the Japanese to manufacture at
high volume and low cost," he says.
     But an imminent invasion of Japanese HDTV VCRs will be
staved off by the "consumer electronics constraint," more
commonly known as the chicken-and-the-egg problem, contends
Ciciora.  The long-term development of large screen televisions
and VCRs (or TV/VCR combinations) are the real threat to cable,
since they don't confront the same signal processing problems
that the cable industry faces.  "Over the next 10-15 years, the
TV and VCR baseband path will go from four to nine to 15 to over
20 MHz.  There is no need to compress, so they won't need to
compromise," he says.

CABLE REREGULATION--INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR TELCO ENTRY--LESS
THAN CERTAIN IN '90

     Even if some type of reregulation of the cable industry is
implemented this year, any bill from Congress is unlikely to
include provisions for telco entry into the video business, said
Congressional staffers speaking at the Western show.  FCC
Chairman Al Sikes has already put in motion the Commission's
review of cable that was originally scheduled to start next
October.  A report providing guidelines for possible reregulation
is expected to be submitted to Congress by the end of July.
     "There is a consensus building that telcos will be in the
cable business, though only as a gateway and not allowed to own
programming," says Toni Cook, Majority Counsel of the Senate
Commerce Committee.  "But there is no consensus as to when that
should happen."  Though cable legislation is "inevitable," the
severity of the bill "is anything but certain," adds Minority
Counsel Terry Haines of the House Commerce Committee.  Haines
says "telco entry is an issue whose time has not come," and says
the FCC's report--if it redefines competition or takes other
significant moves that assuage the concerns of Congress members--
could "take a lot of air out of the legislative balloon."
     Ira Goldman, legislative assistant to Sen. Pete Wilson (R-
CA) says if cable rate regulation does occur, it will take away
one of telco's main contentions for entering the video business--
lower rates through increased competition.  "It may be a great
political move by the cable industry to acquiesce to
legislation," he says.

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS URGE CABLERS TO "TURN SYNDEX INTO
PROFITS"

     Hampering prospects for happier cable customers is the
implementation of syndication exclusivity ("syndex") regulations
begun January 1, which requires cable operators offering
programming duplicated by broadcasters to replace those slots
with alternative material.  At the Western show, manufacturers of
commercial ad insertion equipment, routing switchers and
character generators took the opportunity to peddle their gear as
a way to "turn syndex into profits" by substituting local
information and advertising.
     No cable show would be complete without a few potshots
thrown between cable operators and telcos. In a panel session on
telco entry into cable, Tele-Communications, Inc. Senior Vice
President John Sie said the unwillingness of telcos to drop basic
telephone rates was evidence of their intent to use
"institutional cross subsidy" for widespread fiber installation.
"If [the telcos] can offer the cable industry a video dial tone
on a open architecture basis, then we should be able to lease
that channel, repackage it and sell phone services at a much
cheaper price," he said.
     Pioneer Communications announced the compatibility of its
laserdisc format with the Eidak system for copy-protected pay-
per-view.  Pioneer was at the show pushing its pay-per-view event
library system, the Pioneer LaserDisc Universal System (VTN, Dec.
18, 1989, p. 8).  Though the technology "is in the works," Eidak
officials say they're not yet ready to announce the availability
of "Eidakizing" a laserdisc as yet.  Eidak was at the show laying
the groundwork for introduction of its satellite-delivered anti-
copy technology for cable systems.  The company also announced
that CableLabs will join major MSOs TCI and Continental as
minority investors in Eidak Corp.
     CableLabs approved a $3.5 million 1990 operating budget at
its annual meeting in Anaheim, with almost $2 million to be spent
on research and development.  Scheduled R&D joint ventures
include an effort with Jerrold's Applied Media Lab to investigate
NTSC picture quality parameters, including five basic forms of
signal degradation (noise, intermodulation, microreflections,
envelope delay and phase noise) and an agreement with Scientific-
Atlanta to research future headend systems.  Anixter Cable TV
(Skokie, IL) introduced a dual laser version of its Laser Link
that allows cable operators to improve system performance by 3
dB.  The dual fiber system can carry 40, 60 or 80 channels, and
operators using a single Laser Link can upgrade to the dual
configuration with a simple plug-in module.

MANUFACTURERS: SHORT TERM PROSPECTS FOR VIDEO BLANK TAPE
STANDARDS NOT GOOD

     It's highly unlikely that we'll see quality standards set
for blank video tape similar to the Type I, II or IV grade
formats used in the audio cassette business--at least until
advanced video technologies raise consumers' quality
expectations.  Blank tape manufacturers surveyed by our sister
publication Video Marketing Newsletter said that 1) consumers
often can't appreciate higher tape quality given the image
quality limitations of existing TVs; 2) VCRs don't have switches
allowing the user to change the bias; and 3) even if they did,
few consumers would use them, since "most consumers aren't even
sure where the tracking control is on their VCR."  Consumers are
generally indifferent to quality now, but that may be changing
with the introduction of new technologies, says Peter Dyke,
national sales manager at TDK.  "As TV improves with high-
definition and S-VHS, people will begin to care about grade.
We've already seen an increase in high-grade tapes being sold."

KODAK DROPPING VIDEO PRESENTATION PRODUCTS, EPSON TO TAKE OVER
LCD PROJECTOR

     Eastman Kodak's decision to shed several subsidiaries will
include selling off its presentation technology division and
discontinuing the LCD-based LC500 Video Projector, a 70,400 line
resolution, full color portable projector for professional
markets.  The decision "is consistent with corporate plans to
focus our efforts... in our core business areas," says James
Parker, manager, American Zone Sales, for Kodak.
     The LC500, which has found a niche in industrial and
education presentation markets, will not disappear, however.
Kodak had been marketing the product in the U.S. since Fall 1988
under license from LC500 developer Seiko Epson Corp. of Japan,
and relinquished marketing rights in November to Epson America,
Inc.  Epson, which has been marketing the projector in Europe and
Japan since its inception, is keeping the unit on U.S. shelves as
the Epson Crystal Image Video Projector.  The projector will
retail near its former $3,495 price tag, says Epson spokesperson
Gary Yoshimura.  The company plans to expand the device's market
potential by promoting it as a standard peripheral display for
personal computers.  (Epson America, Inc., 2780 Lomita Blvd.,

CALIFORNIA FIRM TARGETS HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET WITH 3D MOVIES

     3D TV Corporation, a stereoscopic developer, has devised a
home video system enabling standard television sets and VCRs to
faithfully reproduce 3D images from encoded videocassettes.
     The $200 system, compatible with all videocassette formats
and most television  and computer brands, consists of a pair of
$50 LCD glasses and a $150 cigarette-package-sized Stereo Glasses
Driver.  When the LCD glasses and VCR are plugged into the
glasses driver, the TV screen emits alternating images--first for
the left eye and then for the right.  The glasses, in sequence
with the emitted images, cover the appropriate eye of the viewer
at a rate of 60 times per second so the picture appears in
continual 3D.
     Following its introduction this month at the Consumer
Electronics Show, 3D TV Corp. will begin marketing the system
with distribution through video specialty stores and mail order
firms.  Company President Michael Starks, who hopes to ship
20,000 units in the first six months of 1990, believes consumer
acceptance hinges on 3D software availability and development and
has therefore stockpiled a 20-title 3D library of feature films,
shorts and documentaries.  The 3D cassettes will retail at about
$50, but "could easily be dropped to $19.95 or sell at $79.95.
It's the same pricing strategy as standard videocassettes,"
Starks tells VTN.
    Based on interest expressed by numerus producers who have
recently filmed in 3D or are interested in tackling 3D
productions, Starks hopes to add about six new films to the
library within the next six months.  "There have been about four
or five unreleased 3D feature films made within the last year or
two, and there's always some old 3D `Bs' being discovered in
somebody's basement," he says.  (3D TV Corporation, Box 1650,
Ross, CA 94957; 415-479-3516.)

FLAT PANELS TO INCREASE SHARE OF TOTAL DISPLAY MARKET TO ALMOST
40% BY 1996

     The total world display market will grow from $12.85 billion
in 1989 to $30.42 billion in 1996, and flat panel displays (FPDs)
will increase their share of the market from 25% ($3.2 billion)
to 38% ($11.7 billion) within the same period, according to
figures presented by Stanford Resources, Inc. at its 1989 Flat
Information Display Conference and Exhibition last month in Santa
Clara, CA.
     According to Stanford Resources President Joseph Castellano,
flat panel displays have begun to replace cathode ray tubes in
portable computers, aircraft instruments and portable/table model
color TVs.  For example, FPDs were used in 1.46 million consumer
TVs in 1989, and that number will grow to 9.9 million units in
1996.  However, manufacturers must bring down the production
costs of FPD, as well as provide full color and higher pixel
counts if they are to replace CRTs in the very large TV and
computer segments, he says.
     Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) will continue to account for
the lion's share of FPD revenues (about 57% in 1989, growing to
62% in 1996).  Active matrix LCDs--which have performance levels
similar to that of today's standard cathode ray tube (CRT)--are
currently the focus of heavy investment in Japan.  The complexity
and cost of manufacturing have hampered the production of large-
screen active matrix LCDs though certain manufacturers have made
progress (such as Sharp's 14" LCD screen, VTN, June 12, 1989, p.
5).
     Will flat panel displays provide the missing link--a low-
cost large screen display--for the commercialization of HDTV?
Television manufacturers appear to have little confidence in
large screen FPDs, given the expansion plans for the manufacture
of large size CRTs by Thomson, Matsushita, Toshiba and Sony,
according to David Lachenbruch, editorial director of TV Digest.
Lachenbruch says one promising large screen technology may be LCD
projection systems like the 100" model recently introduced by
Sharp.
     Consultant Dr. Elliot Schlam, however, says flat panel
displays are the ultimate solution for HDTV displays.  CRTs,
which will be used for "improved" definition TV, are too bulky.
Projection systems take up too much space, though they may be
used for HDTV in the near and mid-term.

     *While letterboxing has long been a staple of the laserdisc

including the feature in a number of foreign language features.
Beth deVoe, director of home video for New Yorker, says the
company has always letterboxed its titles for broadcast, and saw
no reason to change the policy in home video.  "We're just taking
exactly what the filmmakers intended and putting it on the
cassette.  There is a slight problem because you have to make a
brand new 35mm print unsubtitled and then put it on cassette and
subtitle it.  It does cost a lot to do it our way, but our

TELECOM BILL LINGERS AS LAWMAKERS BREAK FOR HOLIDAYS

     Congress adjourned Dec. 22 for Christmas holiday without
filing conference committee report on telecom reform legislation. 
Although Senate Republicans late in day started process of
collecting signatures of conferees, there was no such action with
Senate Democrats or in House, as Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) didn't
release report for examination and signatures.

     By afternoon of Dec. 22, Senate Republicans and Democrats said
final arrangements had been worked out.  House Democrats were
satisfied with language, pending final examination.  But House
Republicans were split, with at least 3 elements in play.  One was
Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), who urged members to sign
conference report.  One was Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields
(R-Tex.), who from his Houston home called lawmakers to urge them
not to sign conference report.  He had left Washington Dec. 21 to
be with his wife, who is in final stage of pregnancy.  At
leadership meeting morning of Dec. 21, Fields listed his objections
to bill following Bliley's status report, and differences
continued.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and of
Commerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their own
minds" about which side to take.  Industry sources said Fields
reluctantly had decided to sign conference report.  Sources also
said Judiciary Committee Chmn. Hyde (R-Ill.) was asking members not
to sign report.

     Third and final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns
(R-Fla.) pointed out.  Despite differences between Fields and
Bliley, no bill will be closed out without leadership approving it,
Stearns said.  At time House adjourned Dec. 22, several Republicans
told us that they still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White
(R-Wash.) said on leaving House chamber:  "We're still working on
it."  Included on list were familiar issues of foreign ownership
and broadcast ownership.  But Reps. Oxley (R-O.) and Goodlatte
(R-Va.) mentioned Internet regulation as point that should be
revisited.  They told us in interviews that there was no reason
that language preventing FCC from regulating content or prices on
Internet should be removed, noting that House had passed it by
large margin.

     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, was
little changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.
Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resulted
in removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC joint
marketing of local and long distance services.  Other than that,
FCC freeze on attribution rules still was out, as were provisions
preventing Commission from regulating Internet, references to
foreign ownership and language to preempt states on price
regulation.  Broadcast ownership language also remained unchanged,
with 35% national audience cap still in place, although FCC could
use its residual waiver authority.  New phrase was added to clarify
Justice Department's role in determining whether RHCs should enter
long distance, saying FCC should give DoJ's opinion "substantial
weight," but "such evaluation shall not have any preclusive effect
on any Commission decision..."

     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),
senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question in
my mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreed
upon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospheres
poisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [House
Republicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the Vice
President to announce he opposes it."  Meanwhile, Bradley Stillman,
legislative dir. for Consumer Federation of America, wanted to
correct impression from Oxley, who had said that if CFA supported
bill, it would be victory for regulators.  CFA doesn't support
bill, Stillman said.

     On Dec. 21, House had offered new broadcast diversity
language, which brought immediate response from one network
affiliates group -- letters to President Clinton and Senate
Commerce Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) protesting proposals as
anticompetitive.

     House broadcast proposal would keep in place 35% national cap
on audience share that could be owned by one owner, but at same
time would give FCC ability to grant waiver to lift cap on
case-by-case basis if action wouldn't harm diversity or
competition.  Factors that Commission could consider in making
decision include:  (1) Effect of acquisition on concentration at
national level.  (2) "Actual aggregate" national audience reach in
which one person or company would own or have "cognizable
interest."  (3) Effect on diversity in local market.  (4) Effect on
public interest, convenience, necessity.  Language on "actual
aggregate" audience is one of 2 parts of proposal put in for Fox,
which argues that it should have higher than 35% ownership because
its ratings aren't as high as networks.  Other Fox-backed provision
would prohibit FCC from establishing or modifying any policy or
rule on attribution or calculation of media ownership.  Broadcast
industry source said provision was inconsistent with rest of bill
because it would bar Commission from acting while other parts of
bill would direct FCC to take action.

     Other elements of bill would allow one owner to have 2 VHF
stations in single market with Commission approval under
"extraordinary and compelling circumstances," while setting
standards for diversity that would call for 10 separately owned
stations in top 25 markets, 6 stations in next 75 and 3 in all
other markets.  Consumer representatives criticized bill as
insufficient in protecting public interest.

                      *    *    *    *    *

     Wireless Cable Assn.'s contention that loophole in bill, which
it blamed on Rep. Schaefer (R-Colo.), could hurt that industry (CM
Dec 18 p6) is inaccurate, Schaefer's office said, saying language
on uniform pricing as applied to buildings was Senate offer, not
Schaefer's.  In any case, staffer said, proposal would put burden
on competitor to make case to FCC in complaint, but if Commission
then accepts case, cable operator would have to prove that there's
no predatory pricing by disclosing its costs of service.  In
addition, current proposals deregulate SMATV operators by leaving
them out of definition of cable operator if system doesn't cross
public rights-of-way.  Provisions weren't drawn up with Liberty
Cable situation in mind, Schaefer staffer said.  Liberty has
protested that language could hurt it in competitive battle with
Time Warner.

JUSTICE DEPT., BROADCASTERS OPPOSE QUICK MUST-CARRY DECISION; 
CABLE DISAGREES

     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule for
must-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have been
decided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,
Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid for
quick action.  Brief signed by Solicitor Gen. Drew Days also said
expedited schedule would be hardship for govt. because of federal
shutdown and holidays.

     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,
merely quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heard
this term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmers
repeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time if
necessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't make
quick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't over
facts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also said
majority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at all
because one judge backed full hearing on merits.

     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in this
case," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,
"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by Supreme
Court in earlier decision (CM July 4/94 p1).  Now, Court must
evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence submitted to lower
court to determine whether Congress had enough evidence to back its
decision to impose must-carry.

     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, said joint
brief by NAB, INTV, APTS, PBS, CPB.  However, they said it took 5
months for lower court to consider evidence and uphold
congressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would be
required before this Court could reverse that judgment and strike
down a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how much
this appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Court
to decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."

     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)
Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staff
employees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply with
expedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows that
must-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth in
channel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry on
channel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers have
more, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry began,
so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable argument
that quick decision is needed because next date for selecting
between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct., said any
burden of that deadline is on broadcasters, who are willing to
accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on must-carry
for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because no advanced
TV will enter service before Court's next term.

     Cable had hoped to know by end of last week whether Supreme
Court will expedite appeal of must-carry.  NCTA, Turner Bcstg.,
Time Warner, Discovery and Atlanta Interfaith Bcstrs. had filed
appeal of U.S. Dist. Court decision and request for expedited
treatment on Dec. 21.

     Dist. Court used wrong definition of broadcasting in its
narrow decision upholding must-carry, original cable brief said. 
Lower court said must-carry is needed to protect individual
broadcasters, rather than broadcasting industry as whole, according
to brief, and industry as whole is healthy:  "The government
effectively concedes that the broadcasting system as a whole is not
in economic jeopardy."  Individual stations that might not be
carried without must-carry usually are little watched and in
communities with unusually high number of stations, cable said.

     Must-carry is too restrictive in protecting broadcasting,
cable said.  If goal is to prevent cable's anticompetitive
behavior, there are less restrictive ways than imposing must-carry
on every cable operator, original brief said.  Other cable
arguments:  (1) Must-carry limits speech of cable programmers
because of channel capacity limits.  (2) Many benefits could be
realized through A/B switches and leased access channels.  (3) Cost
of must-carry on freedom of speech is too high.  (4) "Substantial
First Amendment challenge" shouldn't be decided because one judge
was reluctant to require full trial.

FCC PLANS TO HOMOGENIZE CABLE AND TELCO WIRING REGULATION

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home
wiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is needed
because of convergence of industries.  Rulemaking will deal with
demarcation between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal
leakage and quality, technical standards, customer-premises
equipment (CPE), division of state and federal responsibilities. 
In separate decision, FCC significantly eased limits on amount of
cable costs that can be included in cost-of-service rate
proceedings.

     Regulation of cable and telcos should be comparable "where
appropriate," FCC Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate
"where it makes sense."  Comr. Chong said rulemaking launched Dec.
15 is significant improvement over previous drafts, which she said
didn't recognize impact of convergence of industries.  She said she
would have preferred to move demarcation point immediately, but
went along with rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly." 
Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitive
advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE market
as competitive as telephone equipment market.  Comr. Quello
expressed concern about burden of new rules on incumbents and said
benefits are "difficult to quantify."

     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point would
be appropriate, acknowledging it might be different for
single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'
broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage and
signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should have
to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcos
have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatory
distinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring as
telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-home
broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divide
regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,
states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation of
telephony and video programming.

     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should have
same rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customers
have.  It also said it believes that it may be appropriate to
deregulate cable equipment rates after market becomes competitive
and after transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether
Commission has authority to deregulate equipment rates.

     As result of wiring rulemaking, FCC rejected petitions for
reconsideration filed by Nynex and others asking that demarcation
point between customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple
dwelling units be moved.  Chong said demarcation point, currently
12" outside subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to rivals,
so it reduces likelihood of competition.  Commission did set
rulemaking to determine whether persons other than individual
subscribers should be able to buy wiring in some circumstances.

     In response to separate petition, Commission also amended
rules on wiring procedures when customer terminates service.  New
rules shorten period operator has to remove wiring to 7 days from
30, set specific procedures for notifying ex-customer and amount
customer should pay for wiring, and say customer automatically owns
it if operator doesn't comply.

     New cost-of-service (COS) rules sharply increase amount of
intangible assets that cable operators can include in cost base to
justify rate of return.  Operators now can include only such
intangible assets as organizational costs, franchise costs,
customer lists.  Impact of action was somewhat limited, however,
because of volume of negotiated rate settlements that FCC has
approved, which limits MSOs' COS filings.  Commissioners said eased
rules are justified by agency's increasing knowledge of
complexities of cable industry.  "With age comes wisdom," Quello
said.  Ness said first rules were set "in an incredibly tight time
frame" and FCC now can tailor them better to specific needs of
cable industry.  Fact that Congress appears likely to retain cable
rate regulation "has to be read as a testament to" Cable Bureau's
successful implementation, Hundt said.

     Commission's earlier rules had said that cable operators could
include in cost base virtually none of cost of buying systems
beyond that of tangible assets.  That decision was based on
assumption that system sales prices were inflated based on
expectation of monopoly profits.  New COS rules assume that 66% of
purchase price of systems bought before May 15, 1994, can be
included in base.  New rules also allow operators to include
virtually all of their startup losses in cost base, rather than
just those accumulated in first 2 years.

     FCC will continue to assume current 11.25% rate of return is
appropriate, but started rulemaking to determine whether operators
should be allowed to try to justify higher return based on debt
cost and capital structure.  In other decisions, Commission
declared that:  (1) Systems can include cost of unused channels in
cost base as long as they will be used for regulated service within
12 months.  (2) Assets must be depreciated over useful life, not
over remaining term of franchise, because of presumption that
franchise will be renewed.  (3) Operators can put nonregulated
costs into single "all other" category instead of several.

SOME CABLE LEGAL WORK SLOWING AS REGULATION PASSES PEAK

     End of first round of cable rate cases and industry
consolidation is causing some dislocations among cable attorneys,
but most big law firms we surveyed said work merely was shifting
and some were busier than ever.  Big mergers and cable system sales
are definitely affecting some lawyers.  "There has been a big
consolidation within the industry, which means fewer entities to
represent," said Richard Wiley of Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  "The
impact is significant."  Most top lawyers predicted that telecom
reform legislation would mean even bigger wave of work.

     Despite rumors that some top cable firms were laying off
associates, none we talked with said they were cutting staff, and
most said they were adding personnel.  Cole, Raywid & Braverman,
which devotes 80-90% of its time to cable and has been subject of
rumors since releasing several associates, has added more staff
members than have departed, John Cole said:  "We've been relatively
busy and we've been hiring.  We've been very busy on franchise
renewals and things like that, and the rate work continues."

     Regardless, raft of cable rulemakings, rate cases, must-carry
and program access complaints and other Cable Act-related issues
that caused cable law boom starting in 1993 has tapered off.  As
FCC rationalizes rate rules and moves toward annual, instead of
quarterly, cable rate-setting, and cases become more routine,
there's less legal work to be done.  There has been trend toward
moving such routine cable legal work to in-house lawyers from
outside law firms, several attorneys said, and they indicated that
they have been encouraging trend because of its heavy reliance on
number-crunchers rather than legal expertise.  However, one lawyer
said reliance on in-house counsel doesn't always result in net loss
of legal business because corporate lawyers often seek backup of
outside law firms.

     Some new legal staffers have different skills because of
changing environment.  Frank Lloyd of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky & Popeo, said his firm's last 5-6 hires have been lawyers
with common carrier backgrounds.  "The nature of cable legal work
is different," he said.  "A huge proportion of the FCC work is
moving to the Common Carrier Bureau because so many of our clients
want to move into telephony."  Lloyd said cable clients also are
becoming involved in such typical common carrier cases as universal
service, interoperability, number portability, access.  "Hopefully,
most cable lawyers have already been trying to learn [common
carrier] for a few years," he said.  "We started with VDT and built
on that."

     First wave of cable rate cases has crested, said Seth Davidson
of Fleischman & Walsh, but that's just normal "ebb and flow" of
cable law.  He said cable lawyers remain busy with other issues,
including recent cable wiring and rate rulemakings issued by FCC: 
"We've been busy as all get-out.  I am just swamped."  Lloyd said
rate cases are "a very narrow subset" of cable law, and many
lawyers are happy to have fewer of such cases, which have become
relatively routine:  "I like to deal with the bigger issues of
getting my clients into new businesses."

     Most other cable regulatory issues, notably must-carry and
related points, still remain "very active," Lloyd said.  Wiley said
his firm remains busy with programmer issues, and that's likely to
get even more active as channel capacity crunch eases.

     Consolidation of industry has affected some lawyers.  John
Davis of Wiley, Rein, for example, decided to retire at least
temporarily when clients such as Providence Journal and Sammons
chose to leave cable business.  Davis, who also cited other reasons
for retiring, said result is "same number of lawyers chasing fewer
clients."

     Municipal attorneys report similar industry and regulatory
changes that have forced some repositioning.  Washington lawyer
Patrick Grant of Arnold & Porter said workload hasn't decreased,
but most rate-setting work is over.  He said calculating annual
increases -- now allowed for inflation and external costs -- is far
less complex than initial task of deciphering first and 2nd FCC
rate orders.  One change among cities, Grant said, is that "there's
beginning to develop a bit of a shift from traditional regulation
to a more broad-based focus on [telecom] infrastructure
development," which requires both video and telephony expertise. 
Aside from that, he said, there's still "slew of renewals" that
require legal guidance.

     Eileen Huggard, exec. dir. of National Assn. of
Telecommunications Officers & Advisers (NATOA), said infrastructure
work is "pretty large undertaking" that more cities are studying --
often with help of legal consultants and Washington lawyers.  In
most states, she said, cities still have greater jurisdiction over
video than telephony side of any telecom network, so lawyers with
cable expertise still are in demand.

     Municipal lawyer Joe Van Eaton of Miller, Canfield, Paddock &
Stone said his firm remains busy on cable matters but work directly
related to rate setting has slowed, partly because of perception
created by FCC social contracts and mass rate settlements: 
"Everyone realizes that it doesn't matter [how much cabler charges]
-- the FCC is going to find a way to give it back to the operator." 
He said industry consolidations had spurred work on franchise
transfers.

     Telecom legislation could mean "a boom time for communications
lawyers for a while," Wiley said:  "There will be a tremendous net
gain [in work] for the short term, though I don't know what it
means downstream.  For the short term, the FCC will be very busy
[with rulemakings], and that means lawyers will be very busy." 
Telecom bill "will mean another 3 years of rate regulation," Lloyd
agreed.  Davis said "it will be a whole new world" if legislation
passes:  "Any time there's uncertainty it breeds caution, and that
means work for lawyers.  The government always seems to find a way
to pick up the slack."

DENVER LAWYER FILES CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST TCI'S LATE FEES

     Denver lawyer Steven Zapiler has filed class action suit
against TCI-owned Mile Hi Cable, alleging that company's $5
"administrative fee" for late payments is "capricious,
unreasonable, unconscionable, arbitrary" and has "no rational
relationship to the presumed and/or actual damages to TCI."  At
same time, Louisville lawyer Mark Fischer took out ad in Lexington
Herald-Leader, complete with 800 number, for prospective plaintiffs
in attempt to build class action case against TCI's Telecable on
late fee issue.  Telecable also charges $5.

     Cases are among those resurrecting late fee issue, which has
been relatively dormant in recent years because of scurrying over
1992 Cable Act, as deregulatory focus of federal telecom bill
threatens local control over cable rates.  One municipal attorney
said issue has "arisen time and again over the years" and may see
new life as other regulatory issues subside.  Others said similar
cases may be on horizon in Cal. and elsewhere.

     Denver suit claims that plaintiffs were "financially injured"
by late fee, which is attempt to "blatantly and illegally extract
additional revenue and profits from its subscribers, by
sidestepping federal, state and local laws and regulations."  Among
questions cited by Zapiler were whether TCI:  (1) Made clear or
intended that fees cover liquidated damages and, if so, that it
should be $5.  (2) Made any attempt to determine or estimate actual
losses from late payments and whether they had "reasonable
relationship" to fees.  (3) Had difficulty determining relationship
between fees and damages.  (4) Imposed fees that were "penal in
nature."  However, suit contends that language of late fee
agreement was "created and drafted unilaterally" by operator on
"take-it-or-leave-it basis," leaving subscribers "without
sufficient bargaining power to compel [TCI] to negotiate, bargain
for, and/or obtain terms other than those imposed by [TCI]."

     Fischer said he expects to file similar class action suit
against Telecable in early Jan. after he finishes nailing down "a
couple of loose ends.  He said newspaper ad prompted "a lot of
response" but he hasn't decided which subscribers will become
principal complainants, or whether suit will focus on state or
federal statutes.  He said both are relevant but he won't disclose
specific details until he completes filing.  However, he said state
law is clearer than "murkier" federal statutes -- some involving
1992 Cable Act that, according to Fischer, may contain language
that could help case.

     Late fees weren't addressed directly in 1992 Cable Act, partly
because they're largely matter of state and local law.  Washington
attorney Joe Van Eaton said most states set parameters for late
fees based on administrative costs associated with delayed payment,
including whether operator could have earned interest on money had
it been paid on time.  In most states, he said, "if it exceeds
that, then it's a problem."

FCC VOTES TO PROCEED WITH DBS AUCTION THIS MONTH, SOME PARTIES
RESTRICTED

     FCC voted 5-0 on circulation to auction DBS slots and
frequencies reclaimed from Advanced Communications after company
failed to meet due diligence requirements.  Comrs. Quello and
Barrett voted for item but dissented in part.  Auction is scheduled
for Jan. 18 and MCI has said it intends to open bidding at $175
million.  Advanced attorney Robert Corn-Revere said decision to
proceed with auction was no surprise:  "It was a foregone
conclusion.  The auction was the point of cancelling Advanced's
permit."  Company has appealed decision to revoke its permit, and
oral argument is set for March 19 in U.S. Appeals Court, D.C.

     Rules approved by FCC include restrictions on ability of
existing DBS operators from participating.  "Single spectrum cap"
would limit companies' ability to control more that one
full-continental U.S. slot, meaning that DirecTV, EchoStar and
other DBS permittees are precluded from entering auction unless
they divest other holdings.  Similarly, if TCI-controlled Primestar
wins auction for Advanced's slot at 110 degrees W, TCI-controlled
Tempo would have to divest interest in 119 degrees W slot.

     FCC didn't preclude cable companies from participating in
auction.  International Bureau Chief Scott Harris said rules were
designed to provide balance between various concerns and to foster
competition.  He said certain anticompetitive restrictions that
were in notice of proposed rulemaking were removed as unnecessary
because of limit on number of slots one company can control.  "We
found the right balance with these rules," he said.

     Electronic auctions will consist of sequential multiple rounds
that will award 2 permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degrees W and
another for 24 channels at 148 degrees W.  FCC Wireless Bureau was
given authority to implement and modify DBS auctions procedures. 
Commission said that prior method of redistributing reclaimed DBS
resources (they were made available to other DBS permittees that in
essence formed line) "no longer serves the public interest, and
that the use of competitive bidding would promote the rapid
deployment of DBS service and the efficient use of DBS spectrum
more effectively than any other assignment method."

     Critics of proceeding say best way to promote rapid deployment
of DBS would be to allow Primestar to continue with plans to deploy
2 high-power satellites in 1996.  Those birds are under
construction at Space/Systems Loral plant in Cal.  Winner of
auction has 4 years to construct and launch single satellite or 6
years to construct and launch multiple satellite system.  Critics
also said that winner of auction could delay construction for up to
6 months pending decision of Appeals Court, which could void
auction results.  Industry source said reason FCC proceeded with
auction and didn't wait for court was because "they want to prove
that they can do it [approve auction rules] quickly."  However,
Harris has said that Bureau's decision to cancel Advanced's permit
will withstand judicial scrutiny because company clearly didn't
meet its due diligence requirements.

DAVIC AGREES ON WORLDWIDE INTERACTIVE TV STANDARDS

     Standards for interactive TV and digital set-top boxes were
approved on Dec. 16 by Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) at
meeting in Berlin.  DAVIC also moved high-speed cable modems to top
priority for next step of process, and even agreed to special
meeting in May to increase likelihood that modem standard will be
set in June.  Approval of DAVIC 1.0 standard is "historic moment"
and moves industry "much closer to a world that is better
connected," said DAVIC council member Robert Luff,
Scientific-Atlanta chief technical officer-broadband.

     DAVIC 1.0 sets worldwide standard for wide range of digital
interactive services, including video, voice and data, as well as
for set-top boxes to be used by cable, telcos, satellites.  Luff
described 1.0 as "core" standard that will be added to, probably as
often as every 6 months, as new technologies develop.  He said core
standards probably won't change for foreseeable future, with later
additions to be compatible with and build upon 1.0:  "This is a
giant step toward interconnectivity.  We will have this as a base
for other applications to build from, and it will create stability
for content developers."

     DAVIC's 205 member companies should receive text of 1.0
standard by 2nd week of Jan., Luff said, and it will be available
on-line soon after.  Standard then will go to ITU for what's likely
to be relatively automatic approval, which Luff said typically
would occur in about 3 months.

     "Phenomenal rise" of Internet and World Wide Web were major
issues at Berlin meeting, Luff said, causing DAVIC board to move
on-line standards to "highest priority" for next 6 months.  Goal is
to have on-line connection standards approved as part of DAVIC 1.1
by June, he said, in part because of fear that if there's no
standard by then, equipment makers will launch their modems anyway,
which Luff said could cause "some chaos."  DAVIC meeting in May
(date and location not set) was added because there wouldn't be
enough meetings before June in N.Y.C. to approve on-line standard
by June.

     DAVIC group is working closely with CableLabs, Luff said. 
Cablelabs is developing cable modem standard, and he expressed
confidence that any differences between standards would be
minimized.  He said goal is to allow PC users to access cable media
servers, at least to browse if not to receive full movies, and
DAVIC users to be able to access Internet:  "This is a very
important, do-able goal."

     In addition to modem standard, DAVIC hopes 1.1 will include
standards for digital wireless cable.  It also issued call for
standards proposals for return channels for satellite, modulation
schemes for LMDS, application software portability, security
systems.  Later call for proposals includes 3-D animation and
synthetic sound, higher quality video and audio, modulation plans
for terrestrial VHF/UHF, distributed servers, high bandwidth 2-way
audiovisual, content acquisition and production, multimedia mobile
wireless.

     DAVIC 1.0 includes QAM modulation for hybrid fiber/coaxial
systems, as expected (CM June 26 p3), QPSK modulation for
out-of-bandwidth downstream data, upstream data and satellites,
interfaces for set-tops, harmonized General
Instrument/Scientific-Atlanta media access control protocol,
server-to-network protocol.  Immediate consensus wasn't reached on
standards for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, but Luff said
that's expected to be distributed as annex to 1.0.

CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31
ENTRANTS

     Cal. PUC on Dec. 20 approved rules to open local telephone
loop Jan. 1 and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope to
become local exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broad
cross-section of telecom industry and at least one electric
utility.  PUC said rules are "largely the same" as proposed
regulations released in July (CM July 31 p8) that set broader
outline for opening markets.  Meanwhile, PUC adopted 3-year freeze
on price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and lowered
productivity factor to rate of inflation because "underlying
assumptions and data" that created current 5% factor are
"obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 small
telcos.

     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,
Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,
Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, Century
Telecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, Electric
Lightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI Metro
Access Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,
Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.

     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim number
portability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,
PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabled
residents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote call
forwarding in separate proceeding early in 1996.  All telecom
providers will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and
"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergency
services even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. 
Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiring
written confirmation of each sale, with description of services and
price breakdowns.

     One of biggest cable players is Continental, which said its
certificate covers counties of Fresno, Kings, L.A., Madera, Orange,
Riverside, San Joaquin, Sutter, Tulare, Yuba.  Company said it
plans telephony tests in 3rd quarter of 1996, with full deployment
in 1997, and will use AT&T Network Systems' switches, Synchronous
Optical Network (SONET) digital technology.

     PUC also released its report to state legislature on how
competition may affect universal service and proposed that basic
service include 911 access, free customer service, directory
assistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund to
subsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobby
legislature to change existing law to make change possible. 
Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make sure
they received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, and
would base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential with
incentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitive
bidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. 
Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schools
to new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale of
telecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also should
meet same service quality standards, PUC said.

RUMORED BELL ATLANTIC-NYNEX MERGER SEEN AS FIRST OF MANY UNDER A
NEW LAW

     Reported Bell Atlantic (BA)-Nynex merger discussions could be
first of several megamergers triggered by new law, leaving fewer
than half-dozen national providers, financial analysts said. 
Goldman, Sachs, PaineWebber, Smith Barney, UBS Securities and
Prudential Securities said they expect some level of consolidation
in 1996 as companies seek quick access into newly competitive
markets.  BA and Nynex already:  (1) Have merged cellular operation
into Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile.  (2) Have joint $100-million
investment in CAI wireless cable operator.  (3) Own 50% of PCS
Primeco partnership with U S West and AirTouch, which apparently
fueled speculation if not actual discussions, observers said. 
Others said Ameritech could be 3rd merger partner.

     Companies declined comment on report in Wall St. Journal that
they're discussing merger to create nearly $30-billion behemoth --
No. 2 telecom company to AT&T -- to gain entry into long distance. 
"We don't comment on speculation," Nynex spokeswoman James DePeau
said.  "I can neither confirm nor deny" reports, BA spokesman Eric
Rabe said.  Companies had $13 billion each in revenue in 1995 and
project $28 billion combined for 1996.  BA stock has climbed $8 per
share in recent weeks.  However, merger requires passage of telecom
reform bill now in conference in Congress. 

     Industry observers said merger talks would make most sense for
east coast companies, considering traffic volume between BA region,
which includes Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia, and Nynex
region, which covers N.Y. and Boston.  By merging, companies easily
could convert local network to provide long distance services in
corridor without paying access charges now paid by IXCs.  Analysts
estimate 40-60% of U.S. long distance calls originate or terminate
in BA-Nynex region, which would give companies additional clout in
negotiating access agreements with out-of-region LECs.

     Rush to find partners is likely to create no more than 6
behemoths providing full-service offerings, with AT&T and possibly
Sprint cable venture among finishers, with others less certain,
said Michael Elling, senior analyst, Prudential Securities, N.Y. 
Paging companies already are rushing to consolidate operations,
seeking national presence.  "These companies know they have to get
together," Elling told us.  "There can't be 20 large
facilities-based companies competing for business."  He cited
development of cable modems and PCS networks as technologies that
will destabilize local loop competition in 1996.

     Combined company would have revenues close to $28 billion,
given $27.1 billion generated separately in 1994 and $20 billion
total through 3rd quarter 1995.  Companies currently have imbalance
in efficiency, with BA at 30 employees per 10,000 lines, compared
with 37 at Nynex, with both aiming for 20 per 10,000, UBS
Securities said.  Companies cover 13 states from Me. to Va. and
west to W.Va., regions with more than 65 million residents, with
phone penetration exceeding 95% in New England, Pa., Del. and Va. 
Vt. and Va. exceed 98%;  D.C. has least at 92.8%.

CABLE CONSORTIUM COMES UP SHORT AS CANADA ISSUES 2 DBS LICENSES

     Canadian DBS providers ExpressVu and Power DirecTV have
received licenses from Canadian Radio, TV & Telecom Commission
(CRTC) to begin service in June.  CRTC denied license to joint
venture of Shaw Communications and consortium of cable operators
that had applied to launch Homestar service, Canadian equivalent of
Primestar, citing what it called "significant concerns" over
whether Homestar could implement its application.  CRTC also
approved 5 applications for direct-to-home (DTH) ventures.

     Homestar had planned to use Primestar signal when that company
switched to DBS, but now it's uncertain how Primestar will fare in
U.S. DBS auctions by FCC Jan. 24.  As result, it's unclear where
Homestar would get its U.S. programs.  Company said it was
"disappointed," had planned more than 70 video and 35 digital music
services.  Homestar, like Primestar, would have offered rental
dishes to subscribers and would have been 80% Canadian-owned.  CRTC
said it recognized need for DBS to be alternative to cable in rural
areas as well as competitor elsewhere, and it will open another
round of DBS applications to cable providers no sooner than 6
months after ExpressVu and Power DirecTV begin.  Shaw Pres.-COO
James Shaw said company would "actively pursue this opportunity."

     Power DirecTV, owned by Power Bcstg. (80.01%) and DirecTV,
plans to broadcast U.S. and Canadian programming via DirecTV and
Telesat Anik E-2, respectively.  License, to expire in Aug. 2002,
will be issued as soon as Power DirecTV is incorporated in Canada. 
Power DirecTV had wanted CRTC to levy fee on cable subscribers to
help pay for its communications costs, but agency denied request.

     CRTC approved following U.S.-based services for distribution
by Power DirecTv:  A&E, BET, Comedy Central, CNBC/Financial News
Network, CNN, CNN Headline News, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KRMA-TV
(PBS) Denver,  KTLA (Ind.) L.A.,  Learning Channel, Lifetime TV,
Nashville Network, WABC-TV (ABC) N.Y., Weather Channel, WFLD (Fox)
Chicago, WGN-TV (Ind.) Chicago, WPIX (Ind.) N.Y.,  WRAL-TV (CBS)
Raleigh-Durham, WSBK-TV (Ind.) Boston, WTBS (Ind.) Atlanta, WWOR-TV
(Ind.) N.Y.-Secaucus, N.J., WXIA-TV (NBC) Atlanta.

     ExpressVu, which would use Anik E-1 beginning in June, is
owned by BCE Inc. (33-1/3%), Tee-Comm Electronics (33-1/3%),
Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom, 19%), WIC Western
International (14-1/3%).  U.S.-based channels would include:  A&E,
BET, CNBC/Financial News Network, CNN, CNN Headline News, Comedy
Central, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KTLA L.A., Learning Channel,
Lifetime TV, Nashville Network, WDIV (NBC) Detroit, Weather
Channel, WTBS Atlanta, WGN-TV Chicago, WPIX N.Y., WSBK-TV Boston,
WTOL-TV (CBS) Toledo, WTVS (PBS) Detroit, WUHF-TV (Fox) Rochester,
WWOR-TV N.Y.-Secaucus, WXYZ-TV (ABC) Detroit.

     CRTC Chmn. Keith Spicer said Commission's decision introduces
competition and provides alternative to cable.  Licenses require
use of Canadian rather than U.S programming when similar services
are available and would minimize ratio of U.S.-to-Canadian services
providers can offer.  Commission decided not to regulate DBS rates,
as it does cable, saying that it believes competition between 2
services would keep prices low.

     CRTC also licensed 4 English-language and one French-language
DTH, pay-per-view services.  Sports/Specials and Power DirecTicket
will be distributed nationally, Home Theatre will serve Western
Canada, Viewer's Choice Eastern Canada.  Canal Premiere, French
service, will be offered nationally.  CRTC licensed 4 digital pay
audio services for carriage by all distribution systems, including
DTH, cable and DBS:  Allegro, DMX Canada, Galaxie, Power Music
Choice.  Commission rejected application by Power DirecTV to
operate French-language DTH pay-per-view because of concerns it
wouldn't meet Bcstg. Act terms.  CRTC projected in its ruling that
service would lose $3.7 million over 7 years and probably wouldn't
be able to offer as many Canadian-based programs as Act mandates.

     Ohio PUC received flood of comments on its generic competition

     Ohio PUC received flood of comments on its generic competition
docket, which proposes rules to open local loop.  TW recommended
PUC adopt bill-and-keep interconnection and regulatory parity to
"not unduly burden new entrants with requirements designed for
regulated monopolies."  It also urged PUC to scrap proposed rules'
current service area definition that it said "reflect[s] a
one-provider, one-technology world" and instead allow technology
and markets to define it, and exempt facilities-based entrants from
having to resell services "before they have an opportunity to get
into the business."  Ameritech charged that proposed rules would
"violate the public interest test" by allowing entrants to bundle
service offerings and escape universal service obligations while
denying same benefits to Ameritech, which would be forced to charge
"uneconomic" wholesale interconnection rates.  Ohio Office of
Consumer Counsel (OCC) suggested that PUC add to its proposal,
among other things, more specifics on universal service, basic
service tariff requirements, 3-year exemption from competition for
small telcos, bill-and-keep interconnection regime to account for
traffic imbalances.

     Bell Atlantic (BA) submitted price cap plan to Md. PSC that
proposes 5 categories:  (1) "Access," covering long distance
connections.  (2) "Basic-Residential" for nonbusiness lines.  (3)
"Basic-Other" for business lines.  (4) Discretionary, covering
optional services such as call waiting and call forwarding.  (5)
Competitive, for services offered by other providers such as
Centrex and speed dialing.  BA said it will cap access and
basic-residential rates for 2 years, basic-other for one year. 
After that, BA said, it would adjust services based on Gross
Domestic Product price index minus 1.5%.  Discretionary services
wouldn't rise more than 25% per year, BA said, but competitive
services would be unregulated.  It also said plan would preserve
existing quality-of-service standards.  MCI submitted its own price
cap plan for BA last month that it claimed would shave $72 million
off intrastate toll rates.  BA has criticized plan as
"rate-of-return in sheep's clothing," saying it underestimated
universal service costs by $47 million (CM Nov 27 p8).

     FCC at agenda meeting in mid-Dec. proposed compensation

     FCC at agenda meeting in mid-Dec. proposed compensation
arrangements for LEC-wireless interconnection that would mandate
interim use of "bill-and-keep" as reimbursement method.  Under
bill-and-keep, each carrier terminates calls for others at no
charge.  Commissioners said bill-and-keep isn't ideal system, but
speed is of essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an
economically perfect system would be the enemy of the economic
good."  Beauty of bill-and-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney said, because it
doesn't require setting up new billing systems.  Although it
considers bill-and-keep "preferred" solution, Commission will seek
comments on other options such as setting uniform rate, charging
whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to terminate calls, picking
up one of various state solutions.  Comr. Ness said she would be
willing to listen if someone came up with better system "but it's
got to be less regulatory and it's got to be speedy."  Need for
state role was emphasized, with Chmn. Hundt noting, "we have a good
relationship with the state commissions and we don't want to lose
it... We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting state PUCs
is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate traffic. 
Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Small Cable Business Assn. (SCBA) fired another salvo in its
campaign to stop proposed Time Warner-Turner Bcstg. and Walt
Disney-Cap/ABC mergers because of concerns that consolidations
could further limit small cablers' access to programming (CM Dec 11
p6/Oct 2 p2).  SCBA attorney Eric Breisach sent letter to FCC
opposing Disney-Cap/ABC request for expedited action and repeated
request that Commission investigate allegations of companies'
discrimination against small operators.  SCBA also submitted
additional information on programming costs to FTC in accordance
with that agency's  request.  SCBA said Turner Bcstg. provides
programming on fair basis but Time Warner doesn't.

STAR/WEB TURBOCHARGES DATA ACCESS VIA WEB BROWSERS

"Nobody does real database searches on the Web," goes one
common complaint from observers of today's booming interest in
the Internet, and particularly the World Wide Web.  Such
comments reflect the fact that much of the information
available on the Net is not yet organized for access using
well-established information retrieval techniques.

Now that will change, with the introduction by Los
Angeles-based Cuadra Associates of STAR/Web, an option to the
company's powerful STAR information management and retrieval
software. STAR/Web is a common gateway interface (cgi-bin)
program that connects STAR software to any standard or
commercial World Wide Web server (http daemon). With STAR/Web,
database administrators can let users of their Web hosts or
hosts on their in-house networks use common web browsers, such
as Mosaic or Netscape Navigator, to search with ease for
information organized and structured into online databases.

Provides lightning fast in-depth searches

STAR/Web offers database administrators a simple way to set up
fully interactive, fast data retrieval for users of Web
browsers for complex searches by users who may know little or
nothing about the structure and content of the data. STAR/Web
is ideal for searching databases significant in size and in
the types of information catalogued. STAR sites include
libraries, museums, archives, government agencies, and other
institutions with catalogs of unique print and non-print
collections. When any of these organizations make their STAR
databases available on the Internet through a STAR/Web host,
users will be able to find hidden treasures of photographic
and film collections, as well as literature in many different
disciplines.

STAR/Web customizable assisted-search capabilities give
end-users heightened information retrieval power without
having to become experts in formulating good searches or to
invest in extensive training for many different databases.
System administrators can design web pages for full-text or
index searches that include multiple input boxes. Index
displays on the assisted search screens help end-users select
applicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriate
input boxes-with copy and paste done automatically.
Administrators may pre- define applicable Boolean, proximity,
and ranging operators for the assisted searches.

STAR/Web sites can commercialize their online services with
ordering facilities (e.g., for full-text document delivery;
reproductions of photographs or slides). If STAR/Web is used
in-house, "service" centers can fulfill requests
enterprise-wide for library books, journal articles, file
folders, and other materials found through searching with
STAR/Web. Web pages and input boxes used with STAR/Web
maintain their state while the user views the initial results
of the search. When users select a hypertext link,
conventional search engines immediately forget what the user
entered as search text. As STAR/Web users move from searching
to displaying results, displaying linked files, or selecting
terms from an index display for automatic pasting, STAR/Web
tracks and remembers what the user has entered and selected-to
provide a true interactive retrieval model.

Eliminates HTML programing staff and time

STAR/Web minimizes the overhead in becoming a Web host by
using information already organized in the main
database-whether it is descriptions of items in a collection,
or the full text of documents. And, STAR/Web takes the hassle
out of designing and managing many Web pages for large
collections because it does the translation into HTML
specifications.

"The system administrator uses STAR to set up one or many
assisted searches. These are translated by STAR/Web into
complete HTML specifications (e.g., using table formats and
other sophisticated HTML conventions). Standard STAR reports,
for sorting and presenting users' search results in many
different ways-with online images and hypertext are easily
deaned in STAR as HTML documents. With STAR and STAR/Web, our
sites are up and running fast, with high-quality services
operating in a totally standard Web environment," said Judith
Wanger, vice president of Cuadra Associates, Inc.

Pricing for the STAR/Web option depends on the number of
simultaneous users to be supported. For the typical STAR
system, STAR/Web adds about $240 per simultaneous user to the
system price.  STAR/Web requires STAR, the highly acclaimed
Unix-based software for managing, accessing and presenting all
types of information from corporate and other institutional
databases.

1390.

"ENTREPRENEURAL LIBRARIANSHIP" PROVIDES ESSENTIAL
READING FOR LIBRARY AND INFO SERVICES PROFESSIONALS

Like so many other modern businesses, library management has
entered a new era of accountability.  Libraries must now be
run in much the same way as a successful corporation, with a
focus on responsibility, performance and control. For some
librarians and information managers, this can represent a
dramatic change from the traditional library setting.

But naming an effective, cost-efficient library need not be an
overwhelming task. The same management methods that work for
other businesses can easily be implemented in the library
setting as well.

NEW VOLUME PROVIDES CLEAR AND CONCISE
GUIDELINES AND TECHNIQUES

A new handbook from Bowker-Saur -- "Entrepreneurial
Librarianship: The Key to Effective Information Management,"
by Guy St. Clair -- applies contemporary management and
business techniques to the fields of library science and
information services. Written specifically for this field, the
volume gives users timely management theory they can use to
improve customer service, establish an entrepreneurial
management environment, develop power and influence within an
organization, and improve the quality of the services they
provide.

Entrepreneurial Librarianship offers practical techniques for
creating an entrepreneurial environment in a library or
information services organization, and provides ideas for
initiating such techniques where a less successful operation
is already in place. Specific topics include taking risks,
cultivating teamwork, and displaying leadership.

This definitive guidebook enables library professionals to:

* define entrepreneurial management.

* convince those who are resistant to change.

* adapt the characteristics of successful businesses to the
library setting.

PIONEER-STANDARD ELECTRONICS, INC. JOINS INTERNET COMMUNITY

Customers, Suppliers and Investors Gain Access to the Latest
Information on Company Products, Services, and Financials.

Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIOS), a leading
North American distributor of industrial electronic
components, computers and peripheral equipment, has added a
new tool to help customers and suppliers get immediate access
to the information they need -- a home page on The Internet's
World Wide Web (http://www.pios.com).

"We designed our home page to act as an inviting and easy to
use electronic magazine," says Art Rhein, Senior Vice
President of Sales and Marketing. "It includes headline
stories, colorful maps, and a table of contents that provides
a sneak preview of what's inside. Like a magazine, it changes
monthly, but unlike one, you can click on a map, a headline or
a menu item to immediately jump to where you want to go."

Customers can click on a map of Pioneer's 53 offices to find a
contact name, address, phone or fax number. Other hot-button
items take the user to a graphically rich menu of company
products and services; electronic versions of full-color sales
brochures and collateral. News stories about Pioneer as well
as press releases and copies of annual and quarterly reports
are also one click away.

Pioneer's web site is also inter-active. E-mail messages can
be forwarded to any Pioneer employee through the Internet. The
home page also reaches far beyond Pioneer itself. From its
listing of current suppliers and products, users can click on
the listed company to reach that company's home page, if one
exists.

Other enhancements to Pioneer's web site are in the works.

Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., and its 50% owned
affiliate, Pioneer Technologies group, Inc. is a
billion-dollar plus systems solutions company with more than
50 sales and technical offices throughout North America.

ELECTRONIC MARKETING WILL GENERATE
$230 BILLION OF SALES BY 2000

Electronic Media to Gain Acceptance as Security Concerns are
Resolved

Worldwide sales of goods and services through CD-ROM catalogs,
on-line storefronts and Internet malls will grow from $700
million in 1995 to $230 billion by 2000, a compound annual
growth rate of more than 200%, according to INPUT, the
information technology market intelligence firm.  Although a
large portion of the current sales occur through the shopping
areas of on-line services such as Prodigy and CompuServe, most
of the growth will be through Internet's World Wide Web.

Steve Young, Manager of INPUT's Electronic Commerce Program,
says: "The explosive growth in sales is good news for those
pioneer companies currently marketing through these electronic
media, many of which are learning hard lessons about the
difficulty of getting customers to change their behavior and
accept the use of technology in the buying process."

INPUT research finds that these barriers are about to break
down as confidence builds that network security, including
transaction privacy and trading partner authentication can be
attained. Netscape Communications, Enterprise Integration
Technology, Teisa Systems and RSA Data Security, are leading
providers of security technology, and notwithstanding the
recent rash of negative publicity, they have the capability to
offer a secure environment. As user acceptance increases, a
business infrastructure is developing to support electronic
marketing. This includes the electronic "landlords" (such as
marketplaceMCI), Internet Service Providers (such as Netcom),
software vendors (such as Netscape), system integrators (such
as Andersen Consulting), and advertising services (such as
Ogilvy & Mather).

GLOBAL ACCESS LAUNCHES SINGAPORE OFFICE

As part of its continuing commitment to international
expansion, Global Access Telecommunications Services, Inc., a
leading provider of worldwide satellite and fiber transmission
services for the television and video industry, has opened its
Singapore office.  Global Access' Singapore subsidiary, Global
Satellite and Video Services (Asia) Pte Ltd., headed by Simon
Patch, director of brainess development, Asia Pacific, will
coordinate business for the entire Asia Pacific region.

The newest Global Access office, headquartered in Singapore's
New Tech Park, will be providing broadcast services for a
number of significant customers in the Asia Pacific region,
including ESPN in SingVore, STAR-TV in Hong Kong, and Fuji
Television and Nippon Television in Tokyo. In delivering
satellite transmission services to the Asia Pacific market,
Global Access draws upon 13 years of experience in providing
satellite and fiber broadcast services worldwide.

"As the Asia Pacific broadcast television market explodes,
Global Access is poised to build on the satellite services we
have been providing the region for years," said Jack Morse,
president and CEO of Global Access. "We have experienced staff
with intimate knowledge of the local broadcast market and
issues, and our multilingual Singapore operations center is
seamlessly integrated into our U.S. and U.K. offices. With the
leadership of Simon Patch, we can provide our Asia Pacific
clients with around-the-clock, around-the-world services."

Patch, who brings more than 26 years of experience in the
telecommunications industry to the position of business
development director, has also served as a vice president at
Keystone Communications and business director for Visnews.
Global Access' Singapore-based staff also includes Denise
Lekowski, international services coordinator. Lekowski, most
recently international liaison for Keystone Communications,
brings to the new operation years of expertise in the local
and international market. In addition to its local staff,
Global Access' Boston-based Keith Buckley, vice president,
sales, and Robert McNamara, director, international

SMARTS INTRODUCES INTERNET SERVICES MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Self-Managing Internet Software From System Management ARTS

Pity no more the beleaguered Internet Administrator; novice or
professional. Totally automated, self-managing Internet server
and service administration is here.

The first public demonstrations of a unique software package,
"InCharge For The Internet" created by System Management ARTS
(SMARTS), White Plains, NY, took place during the E-Mail World
& Internet Expo, in Boston.

InCharge employs company developed, "Management by
Delegation" and "Codebook Event Correlation" (patent pending),
for creating automated management products that use familiar
and intuitive Web-based forms.

InCharge automates the installation, configuration and
day-today management of all major Internet services. InCharge
Server software currently runs on Solaris. The server can be
accessed from any client with a Web browser.

SMARTS president, Dr. Shaula Alexander Yemini stated that,
"New users will appreciate the simplicity of InCharge that
masks complex functionality, while experienced administrators
will enjoy the recoverability and automated problem management
features that dramatically reduce the time needed to
administer Internet services."

Features of InCharge include management of all major services
(Web, FTP, E-Mail, DNS and USENET news); error-proof,
task-oriented configuration; automated problem management;
robust service and management security; and Delegation for
managing multiple servers concurrently.

User benefits include: dramatic reduction in time and effort
to manage Internet services; higher availability of servers
and services; enhanced security; and unlimited scalability to
multi-server sites.

"InCharge simplifies Internet service configuration by
turning obscure low-level tasks into intuitive point-and-click
operations," stated Brian Wade, SMARTS Sales and Marketing
Director. "For example, adding a nows feed without InCharge is
a complex, error-prone, time-consuming, lo-step task. InCharge
accomplishes the task reliably, easily and quickly with three
clicks."

ALISAMAIL SOLVES E-MAIL INCOMPATABILITY

Corporate America's growing dependence on E-mail to facilitate
high speed communication in the workplace, and the use of
different platforms to perform different tasks has given rise
to a new problem: Multiple, incompatible E-mail systems that
cannot communicate with each other. With fast, reliable and
cost-effective communication being essential to maintaining a
competitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inability
to communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and other
employees can hinder growth and stifle profits.

with increasing frequency, companies are finding that they
have a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with each
other installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and
legacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate with
each other, savings gained by effective communications cannot
be realized.

At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that in
the "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.
The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporate
Information Systems (IS) group who are faced with the
challenge of integrating the various existing departmental
E-mail systems.

This is a complicated task that involves making systems
interoperate, share directory information and documents across
different platforms.

This does not mean, however, that a standardized,
corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mail
integration technology is widely used to connect disparate
systems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systems
make the concept a sensible alternative.

First, businesses preserve their initial investment. This
investment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mail
system packages, but includes the cost of servers needed to
run the system and the training of users.

These users often have limited computer experience and are
reluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system after
spending hours getting accustomed to its features and
capabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort to
standardize, users are taken out of their friendly computer
environment and placed into an unknown one.

Mail integration software solves this problem by allowing
users to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mail
systems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is
'switched" to make it appear as if users are communicating
with a computer on their very same E-mail system!

Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implement
an enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off older
legacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for a
standard-based information system. Additional benefits depend
on the particular features offered by the mail integration
software they select.

The technological demands of integration are extensive.
Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination of
features, benefits and reputation. Integration vendors
approach the issue differently and the results differ. Alisa
Systems has long been an industry leader in mail systems
integration. They have a reputation for being the best in the
business according to high tech computer publications and
other independent sources whose job it was to compare
integration systems.

Alisa offers a complete mail integration package called
AlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch that
interconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mail
systems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange of
electronic messages, fully editable documents and binary files
between WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,
CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,
ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, word
processing documents, graphic and binary files. Most
importantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,
Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The really
strong point of the system is it's easy to customize how
information is presented." said Don Cole, president of Alisa
Systems.

The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization and
Message Switch are the strengths of the system and separate
AlisaMail from the competition.

The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relational
database and can be used as a corporate directory service.
OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminates
complicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common address
book synchronized with each mail system.

This "master" directory can include an address book of
customers, employees and vendors that contains information
such as their title, organization, department name, E-mail and
postal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as a
photograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized address
book for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessed
by either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/server
application called PeopleFinder.

PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of the
AlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields in
the database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.
Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinder
allows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents to
display information not accessable in the user's address book.

Existing desktop client/server development tools and
applications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.
With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect to
other corporate databases.

Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with the
OpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.
Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directory
would be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains a
master directory of all E-mail users in by requesting
directory updates from each separate mail system. When changes
are made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying or
deleting an E-mail address, the information is then
transferred to the master directory and then used to update
all the other directories.

In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,
AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.
The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronization
is made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "In
essence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory an
aggregate of all the users. It represents the entire
population and there is no distinction in where these people
live." said Cole.

AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.

The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forward
message hub and also handle the conversion of message formats
as required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switch
preserves the functionality of each mail system because it
stores the message in its unaltered format. The format of the
message is then converted only if the recipient mail system
requires conversion. If the receiving mail system does not
support all the functionality of the sender's, the Message
Switch will preserve as much functionality as possible.

Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success of

Aspen Developing
New Electrocatalysts

Aspen Systems Inc. (184 Cedar Hill St., Marlborough, MA 01752-3017;
Tel: 508/481-5058) has been awarded a $74,998 Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the Department of
Energy (DOE) for the development of low-cost, contamination-
tolerant electrocatalysts for low-temperature fuel cells.  Aspens
Kang P. Lee says that power generation from fuel cells via reformed
gaseous fuel or direct methanol oxidation is a very attractive
option for fuel-cell vehicles or other mobile systems.  One of the
major problems with the technology, though, is the high cost and
limited supply of noble metal-based catalysts.  Such catalysts are
prone to carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide poisoning.

Metal carbides, such as molybdenum carbide and tungsten carbide,
exhibit high catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of
methanol.  Such catalysts are also tolerant of carbon monoxide
contamination in the reaction zone.  The problem is that it is very
difficult to manufacture these materials with high surface areas.
Expensive high-temperature reduction and carbonization techniques
or high-energy processes such as ion implantation are used to
prepare high surface area metal carbides.

The Aspen approach is to manufacture Group VI metal carbides using
nonconventional, proprietary surfactants in a chemical reduction
process.  Methods for controlling the composition, morphology, and
particle size of the materials will be developed with the Phase 1
SBIR grant.  The products will then be evaluated with respect to
surface area, particle size, particle morphology, size
distribution, composition, crystallinity, the presence of impurity
phases, and localized electronic energy levels at the surface.
Their electrocatalytic activity of these nanoscale metal carbides
will be investigated for their effect on hydrogen and methanol
oxidation.

Grant Funds a
Catalyst/Collector

An integrated catalyst/collector structure for regenerative proton-
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is the subject of a $75,000
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the
Department of Energy (DOE) to Giner Inc. (14 Spring St., Waltham,
MA 02154-4497; Tel: 617/899-7270).

Tony LaConti says that dedicated PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and
regenerative fuel cells offer benefits to the electric vehicle (EV)
industry and energy-storage programs.  The Giner researchers will
construct a new gas-diffusion electrode/current collection
interface (GCI) structure that they believe will yield superior
performance, stability, and simplicity at the positive electrode of
PEM electrochemical cells.

The Giner structure is based on a stabilized, proprietary metal
sinter that provides PEM fuel cell catalytic activity and
facilitates bulk fluid distribution.  LaConti anticipates improved
bifunctional performance at the positive electrode and similar
construction of both the GCI and bipolar plate, leading to reduced
complexity of the system and increased feasibility of single-unit
PEM regenerative fuel cells.

The GCI structure should be applicable to dedicated fuel cells and
electrolyzers, providing improved performance, simplicity, and
reliability.  Electrolyzers could supply high-pressure hydrogen to
hydrogen-air PEM fuel cells.  PEM regenerative fuel-cell
applications could be particularly important in the future
development of energy storage or load leveling based on solar
energy photovoltaic conversion systems and other advanced low-cost
energy concepts, e.g. wind power.

Improved Molten
Carbonate Matrix

A process discovered by Katsumi Suzuki and a team of scientists at
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (Research Institute,
Fuel Cell Development Dept., 301-15 Toyosu, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135,
Japan) is used to fabricate a porous matrix. The matrix consists of
a thin-plate of lithium aluminate impregnated with alkali
carbonate.  It supports the liquid electrolyte in molten carbonate
fuel cells (MCFC), which need high efficiency and minimal
environmental pollution for in-city electric power generation.

Since mechanical integrity and chemical stability of the porous
electrolyte plate (matrix) affect the reliability and life of the
MCFC, Suzuki and his colleagues have applied the concept of fiber
reinforcements to the plate.  The application comes in the form of
lithium aluminate fibers composed of single rather than
polycrystals.  The single crystals yield more thermally stable
fibers with a high degree of chemical compatibility with molten
carbonate.  Adding the fibers to the electrolyte plate improves
thermal cycle resistance.  All of these characteristics make the
fibers more effective under MCFC operating conditions.

After considering various starting materials and synthesis methods
for the lithium aluminate fibers, the scientists settled on lithium
hydroxide and alumina hydroxide.  Since the effect of a third
component, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, was
unclear, it was eliminated. Additionally, they decided to develop
a new fabrication method based on the low-temperature chemical
reactions in aqueous solutions rather than the reaction
temperatures higher than 400oC commonly used.

In the Materials Research Society's Advances in Porous Materials
[371, 297-302, 1995], Suzuki's team described how it prepared an
aqueous slurry that contained 0.6% mole of lithium hydroxide and
0.6% mole of alumina hydroxide.  The slurry was heated at 50oC for
one hour, and then the temperature was raised to 95oC-99oC under
controlled conditions for about 200 hours, in order to evaporate
water from the slurry.  This process yielded a straight beta-
lithium aluminate fiber with a diameter of one micron and a length
of 10 to 15 microns.   An intermediate phase (about 25 hours into
the evaporation process) produces a complex hydroxide
[LiOH2Al(OH)3nH2)].

Sukuzi believes that the dehydration reaction proceeds between the
complex hydroxide the lithium hydroxide.  They found the formation
of the beta-lithium aluminate to be dependent on the water-
evaporation condition.  Additionally, by varying the molar ratio of
the starting materials, at low water evaporation rates, the
research team found varying levels of the complex hydroxide
present, even though the morphology of the fiber stayed basically
the same.

It was discovered that using a two-stage water-evaporation process
controlled crystal growth and changed the fiber's morphology.  The
second stage involved cooling the slurry to room temperature and
holding it for 24 hours, once half of the residual water in it was
evaporated.  This reaction produced a beta-lithium aluminate with
a larger diameter (3 microns) and longer length (30 microns) than
the original fiber.  The researchers surmised that the reaction
between the lithium hydroxide and the complex hydroxide caused the
original fiber to form the nucleus of the larger fiber.

Based on the knowledge that high temperatures (above 700oC) causes
beta-lithium aluminate to transform to gamma-lithium aluminate,
Suzuki et al experimented with temperatures ranging from 650oC to
950oC, in order to promote transformation.  They observed a
transformation at 800oC in 30 minutes and at 900oC in two minutes.
At both these temperatures, the gamma-lithium aluminate kept the
same fiber geometry as the beta-lithium aluminate.

To evaluate the effect that the gamma-lithium aluminate fiber
reinforcements had on the MCFC electrolyte plate's performance,
Suzuki et al added 10% of the fiber to an ordinary gamma-lithium
aluminate powder and dispersed the mixture in an organic solvent.
This solution formed the basis of a slurry for tape casting and
fabricating the electrolyte plate via the doctor blade method.

They tested 20 heat and cooling cycles, at temperatures ranging
from 350oC to 650oC, on a 10 cm square single cell that contained
the fiber-reinforced electrolyte plate.  Test conditions included
an average cell voltage of 0.75 V and a current density of 150
mA/cm2, levels that matched a comparable cell without the fiber-
reinforced electrolyte plate. The research team noted no
significant gas cross-leakage during the cell testing for the
gamma-lithium aluminate-reinforced plate, while the ordinary plate
exhibit a 5% gas cross-leakage half way through the test cycles.
The fibers retained their original form and remained stable with
alkali carbonates and under MCFC test conditions.

Grant for Modeling
Molten Carbonate

Joseph D Fehribach, a researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2247; Tel: 617/793-5000)
has received a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant to
create mathematical models of molten carbonate fuel cells.
Fehribach says that the models used to describe molten carbonate
fuel cells are generally deficient in certain aspects. The aim of
the research is to develop and study improved mathematical models
for electrochemical fuel cells, particularly molten carbonate fuel
cells.

Fehribach added that these microscale potential models will be
analyzed numerically and analytically to determine what results can
be achieved on this small scale. The equations will be used to
derive consistent models in terms of species concentration. Both
types of models will be averaged to obtain macroscale models that
can be fit to experimental data.

A number of different averaging techniques will be considered in
formulating three-phase homogenized models to obtain a broad
prospective on the relationship between the microscale and the
macroscale. An important part of the work will be addressing
questions of interest to the fuel-cell research community and
comparing the models to experimental results.

Alliant's Product
First on Jupiter

High-power D-size lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries designed and
produced by Alliant Techsystems (5901 Lincoln Drive, Edina, MN
5536; Tel: 612/931-5413, Fax: 612/931-5423) recently provided power
for NASA's Galileo entry probe during its dramatic and apparently
successful descent into Jupiter's atmosphere.  The probe relayed
data and digitally stored photographs prior to its on-schedule
destruction deep in Jupiter's high-pressure atmosphere.

The probe was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere of
an outer planet and although they were eventually destroyed along
with the probe, the Alliant batteries were the first batteries on
Jupiter.  The probe was designed and built by Hughes Space and
Communications Co., and was launched six years ago aboard the Space
Shuttle Atlantis.

According to Rod Bitz, director of corporate communications, the
specially space-qualified D-sized batteries are durable enough to
withstand the severe acceleration, vibration, and G forces the
Galileo probe encountered as it enters the Jovian atmosphere.  The
batteries underwent thorough pre-launch shelf-life and
qualification programs, special engineering tests, and have been
tested regularly throughout the six-year journey to Jupiter.

In 1997, Alliant's lithium batteries again will provide power for
a deep-space probe when the Cassini Saturn mission is launched on
an 11-year journey.  The spacecraft will release the Huygens probe
to inspect Titan, a satellite of Saturn and the only moon in the
solar system known to have an atmosphere.  Additional missions to
the outer planets, including Neptune and Pluto, are under
consideration.

Oak Ridge Design Is
Licensed to Teledyne

Doctors who rely on tests that monitor the brain activity of their
patients could benefit from a new battery developed at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN 37830-6030) and licensed to
Teledyne Electronic Technologies (TET).  The thin-film, solid-
state, rechargeable lithium battery may be used to amplify brain
impulses recorded during an electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure.


At present,  EEGs rely on sensors to detect the extremely low-level
electric signals coming from the body.  The signals are then
relayed through wires to an amplification device.  ORNL reports
that the new batteries may be used in performing electrocardiogram
(EKG) procedures and in other medical diagnostic tools.  Other
likely applications include portable communications devices, where
the devices could be integrated into the circuits; power sources
for personal hazardous gas sensors and micromachines; and backup
power sources for SRAM and DRAM memory.

The new battery, says John Bates (Tel: 423/574-6280, Fax: 423/574-
4143, E-mail: job@ornl.gov) of ORNL, offers many useful features,
particularly in applications requiring small size.  The ORNL device
is only 10 micrometers thick, can be manufactured in a variety of
shapes, and may be applied to virtually any solid substrate, such
as silicon, alumina, glass, and plastics.  When mounted on plastic
substrates, the batteries are quite flexible.

Experimental cells typically have areas of 0.5-2.0 cm2, but Bates
says that there is no fundamental limit the on areal dimensions.
The batteries have high energy densities, can be charged thousands
of times, and have a long shelf life with no measurable change
after one year of storage.  A wide operating temperature range is
another advantage of the devices; cycle testing at ORNL has been
performed between -20oC and +100oC.

The components of the new thin-film battery, including vanadium,
platinum, or nickel current collectors; a cathode; an electrolyte;
a lithium anode; and a multilayer parylene/metal protective
coating, are deposited on a substrate using standard sputtering or
evaporation techniques.  The performance characteristics of the
battery are determined by the type of cathode material, its area
and thickness, and the operating temperature.  The cathode
material, such as crystalline LiCoO2 or amorphous or crystalline
LiMn2O4 or V2O5, and the deposition and processing methods used to
prepare the cathode film determine the operating voltage range,
capacity, specific power, and specific energy.

Batteries with crystalline LiCoO2 cathodes, deposited by sputtering
and then annealed in oxygen at 600oC-700oC, have high discharge
rates with good cathode utilization and small capacity loss with
cycling.  Their disadvantage is the high annealing temperature
required to form the crystalline phase.  Crystalline LiMn2O4
cathodes are deposited by electron-beam evaporation or sputtering
and then annealed at 700oC-800oC.  They feature high discharge rates
of up to several milliamps per square centimeter (mA/cm2) at 25oC,
but also must be annealed to achieve the crystalline form.

Because the batteries are rechargeable, it is not necessary to
supply the power and energy required by a single duty cycle, i.e.
the conditions of current and operating time required by a device
before recharge can occur.  This means that the applications for
which recharging is an option, the batteries can be much smaller
than primary, or nonrechargable, cells designed for the same
application.  The device, which contains fewer toxic materials than
most other batteries, is the focus of a cooperative research and
development agreement (CRADA) involving ORNL and TET.

Chrysler, Post Office
Placing Horizon Orders

Electrosource Inc.  (3800 B Drossett Drive, Austin, TX 78744-1131;
Tel: 512/445-6606, Fax: 512/445-6819) has received a production
purchase order from Chrysler Corp.  for trademarked Horizon
advanced lead-acid EV batteries.  Michael G.  Semmens, chairman,
president, and CEO of Electrosource, says the order could result in
additional orders exceeding $80 million cumulatively over the next
three years.  The order provides cost and delivery terms for
battery packs that Chrysler will use in its new EPIC electric
minivan.

Semmens added, "The production purchase order provides the basis
for us to ramp up our manufacturing capacity to meet Chrysler's
production schedules." The order was announced at the EV and
Infrastructure Conference sponsored by the Electric Vehicle
Association of the Americas and co-sponsored by The Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI), an Electrosource strategic partner.
Chrysler plans to issue build orders to Electrosource against
production and delivery terms described in the PPO.

"Electrosource has met all of the technical requirements to qualify
the advanced Horizon battery for use in our electric minivans,"
said Robert Feldmaier, Chrysler executive engineer in charge of the
electric minivan program.  "We are on schedule with our program to
develop and produce the electric minivan."

Electrosource has received notice that Horizon batteries will be
used in 10 U.S.  Postal Service (USPS) vehicles in two U.S.  cities
slated for evaluation of electric postal vehicles.  Battery
Automated Transportation, International, and U.S.  Electricar each
selected Horizon batteries for use in five vehicles.

Responding to the U.S.  Energy Policy Act requiring an increasing
number of new fleet vehicles to use alternative fuels and the
California mandate for zero-emission vehicles, USPS Vice President
for Engineering William J.  Dowling says, "With our fleet of more
than 200,000 vehicles, it is imperative that we take a leadership
role in demonstrating our commitment to the goals of lower
emissions and energy independence.  Since postal delivery vans
operate with fixed, low-mileage daily routes that are usually
between 12-20 miles, they are excellent candidates for electric
propulsion."

With a majority of funding for the postal vehicle conversion
program coming from the U.S.  Department of Energy, the USPS plans
to convert a total of 25 postal service vehicles in five cities to
electric propulsion systems.  After one year of field testing in
the first phase, the USPS will evaluate the data on all 25 vehicles
to determine the best system.  The second phase of the USPS
conversion program could include conversions of many more mail
carrier vehicles across the nation.

ERC Revenues Up
on Fuel-Cell Activity

Fuel cell and nickel-zinc battery design company Energy Research
Corp.  (3 Great Pasture Road, Danbury, CT 06813; Tel: 203/792-1560,
Fax: 203/798-2945, E-mail: http://www.ercc.com) has reported that
revenues for the 1995 fiscal year increased 13% to $34 million,
compared with revenues of $30 million for the prior year. Bernard
S.  Baker, president and CEO, says the increase in revenues was due
to fuel-cell power-plant construction and test activities and
increased work under the company's various government contracts.

Net income doubled to $442,000 ($0.11 per share) compared with
$220,000 ($0.06 per share) for fiscal 1994.  Net income in the
fourth-quarter fiscal 1995 increased to $90,000 ($0.02 per share)
compared with $37,000 ($0.01 per share).  For the fourth quarter,
revenues decreased 25% to $7.8 million, compared with $10.3 million
in same quarter in the previous year.  Revenues during the quarter
were lower than last year due primarily to completion of
construction of the world's largest carbonate fuel-cell plant in
Santa Clara, CA.  Battery activity also advanced.

Baker told BET, "During 1995, we improved our patent position on
our proprietary nickel-zinc battery that we are developing for
various OEM applications such as laptop computers and other
portable devices.  We are continuing discussions with potential
partners relative to battery opportunities."

Baker also noted that the company was engaged in extensive pre-
testing of its project in Santa Clara, CA, during the fourth
quarter of 1995.  This activity is continuing into the first
quarter of 1996 in anticipation of plant start-up in the second
quarter.  First-quarter revenues this year are likely to be lower
because government contracts are operating under a continuing
resolution from Congress until there is a final budget agreement.


ERC has established a new Internet homepage available at
http://www.ercc.com.  The ERC homepage includes sections describing
the company's fuel-cell and battery technologies, financial
information, and recent news, as well as abstracts of technical
papers prepared by ERC engineers and scientists.  The homepage also
contains links to the home pages of ERC licensees, including AEG
Daimler-Benz, Sanyo Electric, and Mitsubishi Electric Corp., as
well as development partners, including the U.S.  DOE, the Fuel
Cell Commercialization Group, and EPRI.

CARB Mandate
Changes to ZEV

As predicted, the California Air Resources Board (2020 L St.,
Sacramento, CA 95814-4219; Tel: 916/322-2990) has directed its
staff to finalize a plan that would offer changes to the current
Zero Emission Vehicle or ZEV rule, scheduled for introduction in
1998.  The staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2%
requirement in the early years of the program and to ramp up to 10%
ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than 3,000
vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.

Manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit though 2003 for EVs
sold before 1998 and those equipped with advanced battery types
that have the range and lifespan that many experts believe is
needed to make them competitive with gasoline-powered models.
Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based designs,
are expected to be commercially available by 2001.

John Dunlap, CARB chairman, told BET, "This plan provides for a
successful launch of commercially viable electric cars that
protects public health and will provide new high-tech jobs in
California.   This plan promotes a market-based introduction of
ZEV's and will unleash the engineering and the marketing prowess of
automakers.  We have directed our staff to develop that plan and
present it to this board for our consideration at a public hearing
no later than March 1996."

The plan calls for development partnership through a Memorandum of
Agreement that meets the following criteria:

ZEVs should be placed in the Los Angeles and Sacramento basins in
the following volumes: 750 in 1998, 1500 in 1999, and 1500 in 2000
(without credits applied);
Manufacturers would commit to continued ZEV R&D, including the
purchase and evaluation of advanced battery prototypes prior to
1998;
A market incentive (extra ZEV credits) would be provided for
longer-range vehicles and early (pre-1998) vehicles.   Credits
retain full value through 2003;
State of California would purchase some advanced battery vehicles
each year;
Manufacturers would provide adequate materials for training
emergency-response personnel;
All vehicle manufacturer-supported media, publicity, and
legislative initiatives against the ZEV program would be converted
to media, publicity, and legislative initiatives in support of the
partnership and ZEVs;
Ongoing review process with annual reports by a committee of
signatories to include battery technology, market acceptance,
infrastructure, and incentives.  CARB biennial reviews continue
(i.e. 1998, 2000);
Review process to include discussion of product introduction plans
with CARB.
Ford Motor Co.  and Chrysler Corp.  told BET they still plan to
bring EVs to market in California by the 1998 model year despite
the state's decision to delay its electric car mandate by five
years.  Both companies said they were pleased that CARB wants to
ease the 1998 mandate, but they added that CARB's alternative
proposal has some shortcomings, namely that it moves up by a year,
to 2003, the deadline for 10% of vehicles sales being electric.

"We're happy because it's officially on record that the 1998 zero
emission mandate is unworkable,'' said Ford spokesman Howard
Hampton.  ``But there are still a lot of questions as to what they
actually said and did yesterday.  Nothing is set in stone." Eric
Ridenour, Chrysler's director for environmental and energy
planning, said a 10% mandate in 2003 will jeopardize the
development of advanced battery technologies.  "By moving the
required start date forward, we may preclude a fair chance at
getting some of these technologies into the mix. ''

EV advocates are predictably displeased with California's decision.
According to Tim Carmichael of the Coalition for Clean Air (Tel:
415/546-6656), the change in policy is believed to have been
directed by California Gov. Wilson.  He told BET, "We have seen no
scientific or technical reason to delay.  The agency responsible
for world-wide adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline,
and reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to political
pressure."

Melissa Kaznitz of CALPIRG (Tel: 805/564-1207) was displeased and
said, "This proposal represents the next step in the governor's
attempt to dismantle California's clean air plan.  He is selling
out the environment, high-tech business, and consumers to support
his generous patrons in the oil industry." The bottom line is that
the new plan would require only 3,750 ZEVs available between 1998
and 2000 versus 60,000 under the original proposal.  Roland Hwang
of the Union of Concerned Scientists (Tel: 510/543-1872) said the
plan was "inconsistent with the conclusions of the independent
battery panel that called for strong requirements beginning with
the year 2000 in order to maintain research and investment."

It is too soon to say for sure whether other states considering EV
mandates will follow suit, but EV advocates in New York and
Massachusetts are concerned.  Sonia Hamel, the director of air
policy for the state of Massachusetts, says Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld is "very disappointed." She fears that Massachusetts
and New York both are bound to follow California's ZEV program.
Hamel went on to point out that the abrupt 10% requirement in 2003
is not a "smart market launch." Jamie Phillips of the Planning and
Conservation League (Tel: 916/444-8726) added, "From zero to 10% is
a giant leap.  It requires a leap of faith in the car companies --
in whom we have little faith."

Chrysler Introduces
Epic Electric Minivan

Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland Park, MI 48288-
1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) introduced the "Epic" electric minivan at
the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas EV and
Infrastructure Conference in Atlanta, GA.  Robert Feldmaier,
executive engineer for Chrysler's electric minivan program told the
conference, "We see the Epic as the next logical step in the
development of electric vehicles."

The Epic, acronym for "Electric Powered Interurban Commuter," was
developed with Westinghouse and, as described in this issue of BET,
will initially offer the Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acid
battery.  Chrysler has the ability to build the vehicle on-line at
its Windsor, Ontario, Assembly Plant as part of regular production.
No conversion is necessary.  The Epic model designation will be
applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager models that are
optioned with electric power.

Due to development and competitive reasons, the launch date for the
vehicle will not be released at this time.  Feldmaier explained,
"There are several final supplier issues that need to be worked
through, so we're not ready to give an exact launch date.  However,
we've made it clear that this vehicle would be available by the
1998 model year, and that has not changed." Feldmaier added that
demand for the vehicle will also be a factor in establishing a
launch target date.  Cost and range are the two critical market
issues that will shape fleet customer demand.

"Because the minivan is by far our most successful vehicle, and
because it has the unique ability to work as either a commuter
vehicle or a utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense to
us for electric power," he said.  "The large flat floor also gives
us plenty of room to store batteries, and more importantly, to
change battery types as new technologies are developed.  Right now
we're able to get 27 modules at about 1,600 pounds on board of the
advanced lead-acid battery.  We anticipate a range of about 60
miles under ideal conditions with that amount and type of battery."

Cost and price of the vehicle have not been finalized.  Feldmaier
said the low-volume componentry and the cost of batteries will make
the vehicle "significantly more costly than a comparable gasoline
minivan." However, as is the case with all Chrysler production
vehicle launches, pricing will not be announced until the release
date of the vehicle has been established.

The Epic will incorporate several unique customer features,
including a powermeter that gives the amount of power being drawn
by the driver to help optimize driving style to extend range.  The
vehicle will also feature anti-lock regenerative brakes and dual
airbags and will meet all federal safety regulations.

Chrysler will target many of the fleet and utility customers that
have previously purchased its electric and compressed natural gas
(CNG) vehicles.  "At this stage of development, EVs will obviously
have a very limited customer base," said Mike Clement, manager of
alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing.  "We'll first target
those fuel providers that are required to buy alternative fuel
vehicles under the Energy Policy Act."

The Epic will feature an AC Induction Motor with 100 peak hp and 75
hp continuous, along with a single-speed, front-wheel-drive
transaxle.  The EV weighs 5900 lbs.  and can carry a payload of 800
lbs.  The wheelbase is 113 inches in length by 186.3 inches wide by
75.6 inches high, resulting in 68.5 inches in cargo space and 146.2
cubic feet capacity with the seats removed.  The Epic accelerates
from 0 to 60 mph in 16 seconds, has a top speed of 80 mph, and a
range of 60 miles (SAE J1634 cycle - no accessories).

Conductive Charging
Prototypes Displayed

Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:
313/322-3000) and Chrysler Corp. (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland
Park, MI 48288; Tel: 313/956-5741) have unveiled a prototype of a
conductive charging system that the two automakers will use for
their production model electric vehicles (EVs).

Working models of the prototypes will be built so that utilities
can begin planning for their installation.  By choosing conductive
charging, Ford and Chrysler have taken a step toward standardizing
a crucial part of the infrastructure necessary to support the
eventual commercialization of EVs.

With EV structure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta
problems we saw with early video tape technology, says John
Wallace, director - Electric Vehicle Programs at Ford.  By
choosing one standard system of charging, automakers will assist
utility companies responsible for the installation of the EV-
charging network.

The prototype charging system was built by SCI Systems Inc. (Box
1000, Huntsville, AL 35807; Tel: 205/882-4601), a contract
manufacturer of electronic assemblies and products.  The conductive
system includes a home connecting device, which controls and
manages power, and a plug said to be safe and easy to use in all
weather conditions.

We chose a conductive charging system for our production EVs for
numerous reasons, says Bob Davis, executive engineer - Chrysler
Electric Vehicles.  We believe conductive charging is safe and the
most efficient and cost effective method of charging available.
Also, it is well understood by professional electricians and
requires no special tools, expensive diagnostic equipment, or
specialized training for widespread installation.

Conductive charging, the traditional method of connecting
electrical equipment to power sources, uses mating contacts to
transfer the electricity.  Home electric clothes dryers, with their
specially designed mating plugs, use conductive connections.  Like
them, EVs will use a unique--yet standardized--plug.  SCI
engineered the prototype system to the specifications of Chrysler,
Ford, five other automobile manufacturers, electric utilities, and
the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

The parties have been working together as part of the
Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) sponsored by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI).  The IWC was formed in 1991 to
help develop an infrastructure that will allow EV owners to safely
and conveniently plug into charging stations at their homes and
other locations.  These infrastructure products will serve as the
basis for standards under development by the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) and will be proposed as international standards.

SatCon Develops Award-
Winning Technology

SatCon Technology Corp. (161 First St., Cambridge, MA 02142-1221;
Tel: 617/661-0540, Fax: 617/661-3373) is applying its award-winning
flywheel technology to the development of a drivetrain for
Chrysler's innovative, high-speed, hybrid electric race car, the
Patriot.  The car will serve as a "laboratory on wheels" for
advanced developments that could be part of future commercial
vehicles.  Now undergoing testing, the Patriot race car could top
200 miles per hour.

Winner of the Discover Award, SatCon's advanced hybrid electric
race car drivetrain consists of the following components:  a gas
turbine engine, a compact turboalternator unit (TAU), a carbon-
fiber flywheel, an electric traction motor/generator, and a
controller.  An efficient onboard fuel-burning (liquified natural
gas) turbine with a high power-to-weight ratio generates one-half
of a megawatt of electricity.  Power storage and load-leveling
takes place in a high-speed flywheel, which spins at 58,300 rpm.
The wheels are driven by the world's most powerful electric motor
for its size.  The one-foot in diameter motor produces more than
500 horsepower and allows regenerative braking.

The flywheel provides energy to power the traction motor and
augments the reduced-sized (about the size of a shoebox) TAU. The
TAU integrates a high-speed gas turbine with an efficient, high-
frequency AC induction and alternator in a two-spool arrangement on
each shaft.  Each spool generates 185 kW.  The power controller
weighs less than 100 pounds and handles enough current to power 200
homes.

Patriot's flywheel readily accepts regenerated braking energy
during deceleration and quickly charges, cycles, and releases that
energy as the car accelerates.  Custom-designed magnetic bearings
and a vacuum seal eliminate friction and drag losses, enabling the
flywheel to release nearly 90% of the energy it absorbs during
deceleration.

During races, technicians will rev the Patriot's flywheel up to
60,000 rpm, thereby providing enough energy for fast acceleration
as the race begins. The flywheel provides engine optimization by
enabling the combustion engine to run at a constant rate, thereby
saving energy.  In an all-electric vehicle, the flywheel can double
the range of the vehicle and extend the life of the battery pack.

SatCon will soon apply versions of the primary components of the
Patriot drivetrain to the following applications:

The advanced flywheel will serve as a source of "bridging power"
and power conditioning for commercial utility and residential
applications.
The compact turboalternator will provide a very high output,
portable power supply for heavy construction and military use, as
well as prime power for heavy equipment.
The ultra-high-output electric motor will be used to create quiet,
compact, but powerful air conditioning and chilling systems that
are 25% more energy efficient than those in use today.
The compact high-density controller is a key component for a new
generation of intelligent electromechanical products.

These SatCon components make use of advanced technologies
originally developed for defense and aerospace purposes.  SatCon's
flywheels started as energy storage and positioning systems for
orbiting satellites.  The turboalternator that converts the output
of the turbine engine into electric current was developed as a
stationary power source for the Army.  The steel in the ultra-high
output electric motor was developed for a weapons system.

SatCon's Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) system consists of a high-
speed flywheel, a motor/generator, a bearing support system, and a
containment/vacuum housing.  Power and control electronics
efficiently shuttle electrical energy in and out of the flywheel.
Whether in a vehicle or in stationary applications, the firm's FES
systems offer a variety of benefits, including low losses and
efficient operation, long life, safe operation and easy disposal,
braking energy recovery, and electric or hybrid vehicle
improvements.

For space applications, SatCon supplies the FES systems to NASA for
momentum recovery and spacecraft attitude control.  The firm's
innovative integrated Power and Attitude Control System combines
energy storage and spacecraft-control functions in a single FES
system.

For utility applications, SatCon's FES systems provide continuous
electrical power to critical machines and operations during
lighting strikes and other utility line faults.  FES systems can
solve quality problems caused by modern, high-frequency switching
power supplies.  Also, FES systems provide off-peak storage options
for reducing power-generation requirements to meet peak power
demands.

The company is developing a lightweight flywheel, uninterrupted
power supply for the Marine Corps.  This system will prevent
irregularities in voltage and frequency that could result in power
failure or the interruption of critical processes.

Flywheel Powers
Ford Concept Car

The new Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI
48203; Tel: 800/258-3835) Synergy 2010 is a hybrid EV developed as
a concept car to explore futuristic alternatives that could
theoretically triple the fuel efficiency of a typical family sedan.


At the vehicle's recent roll-out, Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and
chief executive officer, disclosed that the Synergy 2010 is powered
by a small, 1.0-liter direct-injection, compression-ignited engine
mounted in the rear that would power a generator that produces
electricity for motors located in each wheel.  Up front, a flywheel
collects excess engine and braking energy, which in turn would be
released to augment the engine when, for example, the car needed to
accelerate quickly or climb hills.

Bob Mull, director of Ford's New Generation Vehicle program, says
that in a direct-injection, compression-ignited engine, high
pressure or heat is used instead of spark plugs to ignite the fuel,
resulting in higher efficiency.  Theoretically, the Synergy 2010's
performance with this smaller engine would be comparable to today's
mid-sized family sedan because of its decreased weight, improved
aerodynamics and lower rolling resistance.

Although not mass buildable at this time, Trotman says, "Synergy
2010 is a good example of the kind of quantum leap, breakthrough
thinking we're encouraging in our new global alignment."

Duracell and Eveready
Include Charge Testers

Both Eveready (Checkerboard Square, St. Louis, MO 63164; Tel:
800/323-8177) and Duracell International Inc.  (Berkshire
Industrial Park, Bethel, CT 06801; Tel: 203/796-4000 or 800/422-
9001, Fax: 203/791-3273)  have announced plans to introduce
proprietary manganese-zinc alkaline batteries that incorporate
real-time charge testers.

In an interesting legal situation that will keep patent attorneys
occupied until the matter is definitively settled, both companies
claim to control valid patents for the same technology.
Spokespeople for both companies are claiming to be the "first" to
introduce these testers, with roll-out dates scheduled for first-
quarter 1996.

Eveready made the first announcement when Vice President of
Marketing David Hatfield proclaimed that the company would
introduce "the first on-battery tester," which he promises will
"jolt the consumer electronics industry by enabling users to test
the power of their Energizer brand batteries at any time for
unprecedented confidence in battery-operated products and
appliances." He added that the new Energizer on-battery tester will
be rolled out worldwide beginning with a U.S.  introduction in the
spring of 1996.  The tester was originally developed and patented
by Strategic Electronics (Reno, NV).

The Energizer on-battery tester will be available on AA, C, and D
cell sizes.  Like the Duracell tester, it utilizes thermochromic
technology that measures the amount of power in a battery based on
the amount of heat generated in the tester.  A consumer simply
presses both green dots firmly for 10 seconds.  At full power, the
word "GOOD" appears in the tester window.  When the tester stays
completely black, less than 25 percent of the power is remaining.


According to Hatfield, research indicates that 95% of consumers
prefer the convenience of the Energizer on-battery tester over
testers incorporated into the packaging.  With the on-battery
tester, consumers can check the power on the spot anytime, anywhere
-- without having to store or carry anything.  The new Energizer
way eliminates the clutter and hassle of having to store on-package
testers.  Moreover, 94% of consumers liked the idea after they
tried it, and nearly all (97%) said they'd recommend it to friends.

"Our research indicates consumers want to be able to determine
whether or not their batteries are good without the hassle of
having to save the packaging," said Hatfield.  "With the Energizer
on-battery tester, they'll never be caught off-guard in guessing
the state of batteries in their cameras, toys, portable cassette
players, or other frequently used electronic devices."

Energizer says that the U.S.  launch of the new Energizer on-
battery tester will be supported with an aggressive television and
print advertising campaign, as well as in-store promotion and
merchandising.  The convenience of the new product will be touted
through a national television campaign.

After Eveready's announcement, Duracell immediately responded with
its own declaration claiming what the company calls "the world's
first alkaline battery with a fuel-gauge-like power tester."
According to Duracell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles
R.  Perrin, the new trademarked line of PowerCheck Batteries allow
consumers to determine a battery's power anytime, anywhere.
Specifically, PowerCheck Batteries will be rolled out worldwide,
beginning with a launch of AA-sizes in the U.S. in the late spring
of 1996.  Availability in Canada and Europe will follow in the
summer of 1996, and PowerCheck Batteries will be sold in AAA, C,
and D sizes in early 1997.

Like the Eveready system, PowerCheck Batteries feature a fuel-
gauge-like tester located directly on the battery.  To activate the
tester, consumers press the dots on the side and bottom edge of the
battery.  A yellow thermochromic indicator measures heat resistance
in the cell and provides an easy-to-read indication of remaining
battery power.  When remaining battery power is sufficient, the
display rises into the "Good" zone on the indicator.  When
remaining battery power is insufficient, the display remains in the
"Replace" zone.  Perrin says that the launch of the PowerCheck
Batteries will be supported with new advertising and strong in-
store promotional activities.

The tester is the result of a joint venture between Duracell and
Avery Dennison Corp.  Charles D.  Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer of Avery Dennison, says this strategic alliance
was established two years ago.  Duracell licensed the original
technology from Eastman Kodak Co..  Kodak was awarded at patent for
the technology in 1991 (about the same time as Strategic Alliance)
in what was probably an error by the patent office.

In fiscal 1995, Eveready shipped almost 1.5 billion alkaline
batteries in North America alone and sold more than 6 billion
batteries in 160 countries.

Benchmarq Files
Chip Patent Suit

Semiconductor manufacturer Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc.  (2611
Westgrove Drive, Suite 109, Carrollton, TX 75006; Tel: 214/407-
9845) has filed a lawsuit against Dallas Semiconductor Corp.  (4401
S. Beltwood Parkway, Dallas, TX 75244-3292) in the Federal District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division.

In that lawsuit, Benchmarq is seeking a declaratory judgment that
certain of the company's products, including its bq2010/Battery
Management Product, bq4287/Real Time Clock Module, bq2201/Non-
Volatile Static Random Access Memory Controller Product, and
certain related products, do not infringe upon various patents held
by Dallas Semiconductor.

Derrell C.  Coker, Benchmarq's president, says the company filed
its lawsuit in response to allegations by Dallas Semiconductor that
Benchmarq's products may infringe upon various patents held by
Dallas Semiconductor.  Coker added, "In its product-development
efforts, Benchmarq has always attempted to ensure that its products
do not infringe upon the patents of any party and intends to
vigorously defend its products against this type of claim." With
this in mind, "Benchmarq felt that it had to act forcefully to
defend the integrity of its product-development effort."

Benchmarq designs, develops, and markets mixed-signal (analog and
digital) integrated circuits and electronic modules for portable
and power-sensitive electronic systems.  Benchmarq's battery
management integrated circuits and modules control fast-charging,
conditioning, and monitoring of rechargeable batteries, principally
for portable electronic systems, including personal computers,
cellular telephones, camcorders, power tools, shavers, and
electronic games.

Dueling Charging
Standards Created

Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI 48203; Tel:
313/390-2310) and Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland
Park, MI 48288-1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) has selected conductive
charging for their "standard" EV refueling technique.  Ford
director of Vehicle Programs John Wallace told said that,  "With EV
infrastructure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta problems
we saw with early videotape technology.  By choosing one standard
system of charging, automakers will assist utility companies
responsible for the installation of the EV charging network."
Unfortunately, this decision is actually a step backwards for EV
infrastructure standardization and creates precisely the kind of
VHS/Beta situation Wallace says he is trying to avoid.

This is because GM and its subsidiary Hughes (432 N. Saginaw St.,
Suite 801, Flint, MI 48502; Tel: 800-253-5328), with the support of
the Department of Energy and the public utilities' research
consortium Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), have already
picked inductive charging as an EV "standard." Conductive charging,
which is currently used by most EVs, depends on a direct conductor-
to-conductor contact between the electrical power source, the
charger's rectifier(s), and the EV's battery.  GM's charging uses
a non-conductive inductive connection between the power source and
the battery.

Which system is "better?" Conductive charging is less expensive (on
the order of $1,000 for a single vehicle system, versus on the
order of $2,000 for an inductive system).  Inductive charging is
faster (at least twice as fast, and if properly configured, much
faster).  Inductive charging is theoretically not as efficient as
conductive charging.  However, in practice, both systems are about
equally efficient.  Inductive systems (which use plastic, as
opposed to metal parts) weigh less.  Inductive systems may be safer
than conductive systems, especially if charging takes place outside
in the rain.  GM and EPRI cite this as a pivotal advantage.  Ford
says conductive systems can be made just as safe as inductive
systems.

The real answer to the Ford/Chrysler decision may be due to
marketing considerations.  The system they selected is available in
prototype form as the "home connecting device" from SCI Systems
(2101 Clinton Ave., Huntsville, AL 35805; Tel: 205/882-4800), an
established electronics and avionics design and manufacturing
company and a rival of GM's Hughes subsidiary in the aerospace and
other electronics markets.

SCI, like Hughes, is a member of the Department of Energy's EV
Infrastructure Working Council (IWC), but it was a relative
latecomer to the EV infrastructure business.  The Department of
Energy, via EPRI, has been promoting inductive charging as the best
bet for EV applications since the late 80s.  This attitude had all
but assured that GM and Hughes, which control key inductive-
charging technology, would come to dominate the EV charging
infrastructure.

It was only recently, and with a considerable amount of reluctance,
that EPRI has expanded its view to encompass the possibility of
widespread conductive EV charging.  Even if the wide use of EVs is
delayed, the decision is of more than academic interest.  Whether
it happens in five years or 20 years, the creation of an EV-
charging infrastructure will require billions of dollars of
capital.

TRP'S FINALE: 34 PROJECTS WIN $137 MILLION FOR DUAL-USE R&D

By:
Bill Loveless

   The Technology Reinvestment Project closed out 1995 by announcing its
final batch of awards -- 34 projects in dual-use technology that will
receive $137.4 million in government funding.
   The selections, whose announcement had been delayed until Congress and
the Clinton administration agreed on an appropriations bill for the
Department of Defense in FY-96, were the last for TRP as it has been known
since 1993.
   (A list of the projects is on pages 7-8.)
The program is being overhauled by Defense to respond to congressional
demands that the Pentagon pay stricter attention to military needs in
providing support for technologies with both defense and commercial
applications.
   When FY-97 begins in October, the Pentagon plans to have in place a new
name and a new office for dual-use technology (FTR, 21 Dec, 3).
   A $195 million allocation for TRP in the Pentagon's FY-96 appropriation
is sufficient only to support the program's 131 current projects, including
the most recent ones. It does not allow for any solicitations.
   DOD plans to request $300 million for the program in FY-97, when the new
Joint Dual-Use Program Office opens. The new office will be operated for a
year by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has managed TRP since
its inception, and then by the Pentagon's defense research and engineering
office.
   The latest projects, whose selections were announced Dec. 22, were among
140 proposals received last summer by ARPA and fell into six ``focus
areas,'' including affordable advanced controls, biological sensing,
digital wireless communications, microelectromechanical systems and
non-warfare technologies.
   The $137.4 million in government funding that will support the new
projects for a year is less than half the estimated total cost of the
projects, the Pentagon said.
   The largest project -- in the affordable advanced controls category --
is a $48 million effort led by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, St. Louis, to
build a vehicle-management system.
   A number of federal laboratories are participants in the projects,
including the Naval Surface Warfare Centers in Bethesda, Md., and Dahlgren,
Va.; the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; the Air
Force's Rome Laboratory, Rome, N.Y., and Wright Laboratory, Dayton, Ohio;
the Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Fort Belvoir,
Va.; the Army Weapons Sciences Directorate RD&E Center, Redstone Arsenal,
Ala.; and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.
   With the latest TRP awards, about $686 million in Pentagon funds have
been committed to the 131 projects.
   Meanwhile, Lee Buchanan, the TRP director, said this week that the
Department of Defense's plan to move the dual-use technology program from
ARPA to the Pentagon's defense research and engineering office (DDR&E)
responds to congressional perceptions that TRP has sometimes played down
military needs in choosing projects. The Joint Dual-Use Program Office will
also assure the Air Force, Army and Navy of involvement in project
selections and encourage them to integrate dual-use technologies in their
procurement decisions, he said in response to questions from Federal
Technology Report.
   ``The fact that the office is ultimately headed for DDR&E -- out of ARPA
-- reflects the complete emphasis on injecting the notion of dual use into
service procurement,'' he said. ``If this doesn't eventually end up
changing the way the services do business, it will not have been
successful.''
   Buchanan said it was ``not clear'' whether other federal agencies will
participate in future selections of dual-use technology projects, as they
have in the past.
   ``The emphasis is on DOD expenditures benefiting the military,'' he
said. ``Where that involves other agencies, and I imagine it can more than
not, we want them at the table. But there is no room for projects that
effectively transfer DOD money to civilian agencies.''

INEL PROPOSES FACILITY TO MIMIC EARTHQUAKES, OTHER DISASTERS

By:
David Kramer

   Idaho National Engineering Laboratory is proposing a new ``user
facility'' that would test the effects of earthquakes and other natural
disasters on new structural materials.
   The planned facility, which has already been dubbed the ``Advanced
Combined Effects Test Station,'' would exploit the peculiar geology at the
INEL site in southeast Idaho to enable scientists to generate earthquakes
comparable in intensity to the tremors that occurred in Kobe, Japan, and
North Ridge, Calif., in recent years.
   According to INEL Director Barton Krawetz, the region's fractured basalt
slope plain makes it seismically quiescent, and shock waves from the
manmade quakes would not propagate beyond the INEL site.
   In a recent interview, Krawetz said the ``Astrodome''-like facility is
expected to cost about $1 billion -- not much, he maintained, when measured
against the $180 billion in damage caused by the Kobe quake alone.
   Most of the funding would be derived not from INEL's parent, the
Department of Energy, but rather from other federal jurisdictions,
including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that respond to natural
disasters. Krawetz said he hoped that the facility can become a
``presidential initiative'' -- an elevated status that would vault it over
other projects competing for scarce federal funding.
   ``New structural materials other than iron and concrete can be advanced
only after full-scale testing. We think a user facility can appear here,''
Krawetz said.
   As with other user facilities located at DOE laboratories, ACETS'
customers would include both industry and university researchers. Krawetz
said he imagined it being used by the secondary insurance industry as well
as a company like Bechtel National Inc., which ``might want to bid on
building a new city in Saudi Arabia.''
   ACETS would also have a broad international appeal, and other nations,
including Japan, could be expected to contribute to its construction, he
said.
   The facility would be big enough to test structures hundreds of square
feet in size, Krawetz said. Apart from earthquakes, it would be capable of
producing winds as high as 200 miles per hour, as well as torrential rains.
While the area is arid, plenty of water is available from the Snake River
aquifer, he said.
   The facility would also help to re-establish INEL in the minds of the
research community, he noted.
   ``Some people think of us as a dump,'' Krawetz said, referring to INEL's
role as storage site for virtually all the types of radioactive wastes
roduced by DOE. ``We want to change the word on the street about this
place.''
Fees generated by ACETS also could help defray some of the fixed costs for
maintaining INEL from DOE's Environmental Management division, which is the
lab's landlord, he noted.

ATP, OTHER NIST PROGRAMS GET HIGH GRADES IN NEUTRAL REVIEW

By:
Bill Loveless

   An independent report card on the National Institute of Standards and
Technology released last week concludes that the Advanced Technology
Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership have enhanced NIST's
traditional work in standards and measures and not detracted from them, as
some critics of ATP and MEP have maintained.
   The annual assessment of NIST by a National Research Council board
suggests that eliminating ATP or MEP, which Congress established when it
broadened the institute's mandate in 1988, or tampering with NIST's
long-established programs, would result in more harm than good.
   ``Given the current political debate on the fate of the Department of
Commerce, and proposed legislation that would significantly reorganize NIST
and its functions, the board makes two observations,'' the report said.
``First, it is not possible for the nation to maintain government-certified
standards, weights and measures without the technical activities of the
NIST laboratories.''
   The report praised the ``cadre of highly qualified scientists and
engineers at NIST'' and described their work as ``absolutely essential'' to
maintaining the leading role of the U.S. standards and measurement system.
   ``Second,'' the report added, ``rather than detracting from the
traditional functions of NIST, the expanded role and new programs NIST has
assumed since 1988 have augmented that function in a positive manner. In
particular, the board has noted a synergy between the NIST laboratories and
the Advanced Technology Program, which has stimulated appropriate new
research directions in the laboratories and helped identify emerging needs
for standards and measurement services.''
   Although NIST contracts annually with NRC for the assessment, the
institute has no control over NRC's selection of board members nor over the
conclusions, a spokesman said this week. The latest review, which covers
FY-95, was conducted by 144 U.S. scientists and engineers from academic,
industrial and other research organizations.
   The board was chaired by Wilmer Bottoms of Patricof & Co.
   Although it credited NIST with assisting in the formation of high-tech
industries, the report acknowledged that specifically assessing the
institute's industrial impact is often difficult.
   ``Merely totaling the number of [cooperative r&d agreements] or industry
fellows is not an adequate measure of the impact the laboratories have on
U.S. industries,'' the report observed. ``Those counts do represent
valuable industrial cooperation on a case-by-case basis, but such numbers
could clearly be driven to excess if used as the only measure.''
   The report urged NIST to ``identify additional ways of measuring'' the
costs and benefits to the economy of the institute's programs.
   ``This effort is especially important as NIST's basic mission -- and the
funding provided by Congress to support it -- are under review,'' the
report said.
   NIST officials have admitted that their defense of ATP in the face of
attacks from the Republican-led Congress has been hampered because most of
the projects have not been completed yet and there is no generally accepted
way to measure their impact on the economy.
   Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have vowed to kill ATP this year,
although they relented in their opposition to MEP and agreed to legislation
providing funds for the program in FY-96 (FTR, 7 Dec, 1).
   Whether the NRC report will have any impact on NIST's critics in
Congress was uncertain, although the spokesman for the institute said NIST
considers the findings ``very useful'' in managing its labs and programs.
``It certainly doesn't hurt'' to have the NRC assessment, he added.
   The report followed by several weeks a broader review of federal science
and technology policy by the National Academy of Sciences that questioned
whether ATP would fulfill its goal of advancing technologies that the
private sector considers too risky to invest in (FTR, 7 Dec, 4). NRC is the
principal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences.
   Participants in the earlier report, led by former NAS president Frank
Press, ``to our knowledge made no inquiries'' at NIST regarding ATP, the
institute's spokesman said. Those involved in the latest report, he added,
spent a considerable amount of time at NIST.
   For copies of the report, ``An Assessment of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology Programs, Fiscal Year 1995,'' contact the National
Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave., NW, Box 285, Washington, DC 20055;

ARPA OFFERS TO ASSIST LAUNCH OF SHIPBUILDING R&D PROJECTS

By:
Neil MacDonald

   As part of its marine technology (``MARITECH'') effort to help develop a
U.S. shipbuilding sector capable of competitive commercial construction and
affordable naval shipbuilding, the Advanced Research Projects Agency is
seeking ideas from the private sector for advanced technology development
projects.
   Up to $20 million is expected to be available from ARPA for projects,
with selection taking place during the second quarter of FY-96. The
proposals must be cost-shared, with ARPA only investing a maximum of 50% of
the total project cost.
   Despite its long tradition of innovation, in recent years the U.S.
commercial shipbuilding sector has languished, tending to license designs
for new ship types from foreign yards rather than develop them itself.
Little dual-use technology transfer has been evident in the past between
America's naval ship construction programs and the commercial sector.
   MARITECH could change all of that, according to ARPA. Advanced hull
forms and innovative designs, such as high-speed catamarans, hybrid
surface-effect ships, and low-wash multihulls, often developed by
Australian and European shipyards, have been particularly evident in the
U.S. passenger ferry scene.
   Otherwise, the only real bright spots in the picture have come from
yards building vessels for riverboat casino use.
   Two technology-related thrusts embodied in the latest MARITECH
solicitation are aimed at remedying some of these woes by improving
shipyard practices in fundamental ways. For example, applying various new
technologies and processes to make their business tasks such as market
analysis, supplier relations, materiel procurement, cost estimating and
financial systems more efficient.
   ARPA sees a range of communication and electronic commerce technologies
allowing some of these tasks to be better executed and integrated.
   In addition, total process systems could be used to address the
development and demonstration of system-wide, integrated, design and
production technologies.
   ARPA is not interested in ``individual technologies for specific
processes, rather its emphasis is on ``revolutionary, enterprise-wide
systems for the shipbuilding industry that would help dramatically reduce
the total time and cost of the design and construction process in U.S.
yards.''
   Possible technologies include total process simulation/modeling,
product-to-process decomposition, material tracking, advanced CAD/CAM/CIM,
yard layout, and the integration of these with management systems
technologies.
   MARITECH proposals are expected to come from teams featuring, typically,
a technology developer(s), shipyard, supplier, and shipowner or operator,
and to include a commercialization plan for the technology.
   By the project's conclusion, the technology is required to be capable of
demonstration. The closing date for proposals is Feb. 23.
   For more information, send a fax to Robert Schaffran at (703) 696-2204.

INDUSTRY EXTOLS PASSAGE OF LAW ON MERITLESS SECURITIES SUITS

   The first congressional repudiation of a veto by President Clinton
touched off celebrations among high-tech industries.
   Just before Christmas, both the Senate and House voted to override
Clinton's veto of legislation designed to curb so-called meritless
security-fraud lawsuits (FTR, 7 Dec, 6). It was the first time that a
Clinton veto had been rejected by Congress.
   ``From a Silicon Valley perspective, we are delighted that the House and
the Senate rectified an outrageous decision to veto this legislation,''
George Sollman, vice president of the American Electronics Assn. and chief
executive of Centigram Communications Corp., said in a statement issued by
AEA Dec. 22.
   ``As people have said about Silicon Valley -- there are two types of
CEOs -- those who have been sued and those who are about to be. We hope
this legislation will put an end to this type of legalized extortion.''
According to AEA, about 53% of Silicon Valley's high-tech companies have
been sued for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the nation's
securities laws.
   The new law attempts to thwart frivolous lawsuits by giving judges power
to sanction attorneys who make such filings and by having defendants pay
settlements according to their share of guilt.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTER OFFERS MINORITY TRAINING

   Minority students will learn how to move technology from the laboratory
to the marketplace under a new program at the National Technology Transfer
Center.
   The Entrepreneurial Technology Apprentice Program (ETAP) will offer
students from historically black colleges and universities hands-on
training, mentoring and other assistance through a one-year course
addressing technology management, manufacturing assistance and industrial
r&d apprenticeships, NTTC said.
   The curriculum for the program, which is scheduled to begin in June, is
being developed by Wheeling Jesuit College, the home to NTTC, and the
center's staff.
   NTTC, a federally supported organization in Wheeling, W.Va., appointed
Faye Lyons-Gary as an associate director for ETAP.
   Lyons-Gary is one of two new officials at NTTC. The center also
announced recently its appointment of Chuck Millick as director of its
Wheeling operations.
   Lyons-Gary was the director of industrial relations at Clark Atlanta
University and The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and
Minority Institutions Environmental Technology Consortium before going to
NTTC.
   Among her other previous positions, Lyons-Gary was an intern with
Lockheed Martin Energy Systems' Office of Technology Transfer at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory.
   Currently three of the nation's 117 HBCUs are involved with ETAP:
Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio; the University of Arkansas at
Pine Bluff; and West Virginia State College in Institute, W.Va. Other
institutions have expressed interest in the program, NTTC said.
   ETAP will emphasize fund-raising so that it can expand to all HBCUs,
Lyons-Gary said.
   Although supported by the Department of Commerce's Minority Business
Development Agency, the NTTC program is also ``looking into contributions
from private industry, federal grants and foundations,'' she said.
   For more information on ETAP, call Lyons-Gary at (304) 243-4347.
   Millick, who was previously with General Electric, Kimberly Clark and
BDM, will help improve NTTC's information, training and other programs.
   ``These are very challenging times because our clients are changing as
the world is changing,'' Millick said. ``We need to work with our
customers, see what they require and provide them with valuable
resources.''
Millick said he also intends to strengthen NTTC's relationships with NASA,
which supplies the center's federal funding, and other government
agencies.

BUDGET IMPASSE STYMIES RULES ON FOREIGN LICENSES, INVENTIONS

By:
Neil MacDonald

   Two Department of Commerce proposals for modifying and streamlining
regulations for acquiring and protecting foreign rights to U.S. government
inventions, and for licensing of foreign patents acquired by the federal
government, remained in regulatory limbo at the end of the year due to the
federal budget crisis.
   They are just two of several regulatory changes proposed by DOC for
promulgation during FY-96. Most of the department has remained closed since
Dec. 16 as a result of the budget impasse, but an agency official familiar
with the proposals told Federal Technology Report last week that the
timetable for introducing the changes was now essentially up in the air.
   He said that when they were being planned last year, final action on
them by October had seemed a reasonable target. In retrospect, the present
budget situation and congressional attempts to dismantle Commerce made this
time frame look ``optimistic,'' he said.
   Although their wording has yet to be published, it is understood that
one of DOC's proposals by the Technology Administration advocates changes
to provide equal treatment of domestic and foreign rights to inventions
made by federal employees.
   Most federal inventions are the subject of only U.S. patent filings
unless there is an obvious or overwhelming need to also seek foreign patent
coverage.
   The process by which such decisions are currently made is believed to be
fairly arbitrary with some agencies seeking and often securing foreign
patent rights but failing to exploit them through foreign license
agreements. In addition, obtaining foreign patent rights is both an
expensive and time-consuming task.
   According to a DOC official, the second proposed change is ``motivated
by a desire for clarification'' of existing language regarding the
licensing of foreign patents owned by the federal government, and also
reflects some recommendations made by the Clinton administration as a
result of its campaign to ``reinvent'' government as a more efficient
enterprise.
   Both proposals -- known as Rule Identification Numbers 0692-AA15 and
0692-1116 -- are characterized as having ``substantive, nonsignificant''
priority levels with no legal deadlines and having no effect on small
entities.
   Another proposal -- 0692-AA14 -- by the Technology Administration deals
with an interim rule published in August that would allow certain federal
government contractors, mostly nonprofit organizations, small businesses
and grant recipients, to file notifications of their inventions and
election of title to funding agencies using approved forms of electronic
media.
   That rule would also update some earlier patent definitions. Final
action on the rule is expected in April.

PAPER REVIEWS FEDERAL IMPACT ON SMALL, HIGH-TECH COMPANIES

   A new report from the National Academy of Engineering suggests that one
of the best ways for Washington to help small high-tech companies is to
make sure that regulations and other traditional government functions
interfere as little as possible with their operations.
   The report, ``Risk and Innovation,'' says the government should
routinely assess the impact of its regulations on innovation among small
high-tech businesses and minimize them when possible, particularly in light
of the disfavor with which the Republican Congress looks on direct federal
funding for commercial technologies.
   Given that view on Capitol Hill, the report also urged the government to
go easy on university projects in deciding where to cut federal funding for
r&d. Campus r&d, it said, offers ``rich'' potential for new start-up
companies.
   The ``extreme budget consciousness'' in Congress means that federal
initiatives on behalf of small high-tech businesses should ``focus first on
establishing mechanisms within government -- many of them off-budget --
that can improve the general environment for innovative enterprises,'' the
report, prepared by the NAE Committee on Technology, Management, and
Capital in Small High-Tech Companies, said.
   ``Because the structure and implementation of regulations affect the
character and speed of innovation (through the risks they can create or
remove for companies), regulatory approaches across a wide variety of
government functions need to be carefully considered with regard to their
impact on small high-tech companies,'' the report said.
   The committee was chaired by Henry Kressel, managing director, Warburg,
Pincus & Co.
   ``Private investment is likely to be much greater than any imaginable
level of public investment in fragmented, technically dynamic industries
with low barriers to entry and a history (or widely perceived prospect of)
successful entrepreneurship,'' the panel said.
   ``In such industries the important question is, how can government
research, development, and demonstration complement the huge private
investment (risk-taking) to the benefit of the national economy?'' the
report said. ``The challenge in program design and implementation is to
articulate and adhere to an industry-specific rationale for government
support in light of substantial private sector activity ... .''
   The NAE committee also concluded that state and local governments should
have more say in the development of federal r&d programs, technical
assistance and other national mechanisms that promote economic growth.
``Local and regional programs may have an advantage in that they are closer
to the resources that small companies need and are potentially more able to
adapt to the needs of small high-tech companies,'' the report said.
   Although the report was not intended to comment specifically on federal
programs, it noted some concerns raised by the public regarding the
Advanced Technology Program, the Technology Reinvestment Project and the
Small Business Innovative Research program during meetings conducted by the
NAE panel.
   ``Participants in several of the industry-specific workshops, software
and medical devices in particular, noted that programs such as TRP, ATP and
SBIR that could provide financing for small high-tech companies were less
useful because of the long review cycles and time delays inherent in highly
bureaucratic programs,'' the report said.
   The NAE committee also came across criticism that SBIR spawned too many
companies, called ``SBIR houses,'' whose only income was funding from the
program, and that it adhered ``too rigidly'' to the missions of the
agencies providing its cash.
   The reaction, the report said, reflected the findings of a recent
General Accounting Office report, which concluded that while the quality of
proposals submitted to SBIR ``remains high,'' multiple awards to the same
companies ``has become a problem.''

NTIA REVISES POLICY ON GRANTS WITH `SECTARIAN' IMPLICATIONS

   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration recently
modified a policy that had prohibited it from awarding grants to
organizations involved in sectarian activities.
   Under the change, the Department of Commerce unit will no longer reject
a grant application simply on the basis that an award ``might result in
some attenuated or incidental benefit to sectarian interests,'' NTIA said
in a Dec. 20 statement.
   The revised policy affects three NTIA activities: the Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistant Program, the Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program, and the National Endowment for
Childrens's Educational Television.
   As a result of the change, the government also entered into a settlement
with Fordham University under which Fordham will receive a Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program grant to install radio broadcast
services, NTIA said.
   Fordham was previously ruled ineligible for such a grant because its
radio station broadcasts a Catholic Mass each week, NTIA said.

NIST PREPARES `ULTIMATE RULER' TO GAUGE VAST ATOMIC LANDSCAPE

   Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology are
testing what they view as the ultimate molecular ruler and a potentially
valuable tool for the semiconductor industry.
   Once fine-tuned, the Molecular Measuring Machine -- or M3 -- will be
capable of locating molecule-sized features in vast expanses and of gauging
``with unprecedented accuracy'' the distances between them, according to
NIST, which held a press conference recently to report on the machine's
progress.
   The new machine's range is 250,000 times greater than that of most
scanning tunneling microscopes, which are generally used now to perform
such measurements, NIST said.
   ``For perspective,'' NIST said, ``M3's anticipated capabilities are akin
to being able to locate two widely separated grains of sand in a ...
960-square mile patch of desert and then to measure the distance between
them to within 1 millimeter.''
   In tests so far, the machine measured specimens encompassing only a
small part of its planned 50-millimeter span, NIST said. In subsequent
tests, it will measure specimens over its entire range.
   The machine is considered especially important to the semiconductor
industry, NIST noted.
   ``For the semiconductor industry to continue its decades-long trend of
crowding ever more and ever smaller devices on slivers of silicon, it will
soon require measurement methods that are accurate to within 0.0024
micrometer, or 2.5 nanometers,'' the institute said.
   M3 will be used to calibrate various measurement references that
semiconductor manufacturers can use to check the accuracy of their own
measurement equipment, NIST said.
   A number of organizations have collaborated with NIST on the machine,
including Hewlett-Packard Corp., Zygo Corp., Intelligent Automation, Inc.,
and Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge national laboratories.

Scale Metrology Group, (301) 975-3490; E-mail, ecteague@micf.nist.gov .

REPORT PROMPTS DOE TO APPROVE LASER FUSION UNIT AT LIVERMORE

By:
David Kramer

   Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has determined formally that the National
Ignition Facility supports U.S. nonproliferation objectives, clearing the
way for construction of the $1.1 billion laser fusion device at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.
   The decision, announced Dec. 20, followed a lengthy public examination
of claims by environmental groups that NIF, which is designed to mimic on a
laboratory scale the fusion stage of nuclear weapons, would present
proliferation problems.
   A report prepared by the Department of Energy's arms control and
nonproliferation office concluded instead that NIF would advance U.S.
nonproliferation objectives because it would allow the nation to sign on to
a treaty outlawing nuclear testing.
   The unprecedented study was requested by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif.,
former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who had questioned
whether the facility would aid or hinder the spread of nuclear weapons.
O'Leary ordered the examination in September 1994. The report, which was
reviewed by outside experts, concluded that the technical proliferation
concerns posed by NIF would be ``manageable'' (FTR, 28 Sept, 12).
   ``I am pleased that we can now move forward to meet our goals in
stockpile stewardship,'' O'Leary said in a statement. ``The National
Ignition Facility will contribute to the ability of the United States to
maintain its nuclear stockpile without underground testing. We are
committed to operating the facility in the most open manner possible while
supporting our objective of reducing the global nuclear danger.''
   DOE considers NIF a key element of its ``science-based stockpile
stewardship program''-- its plan for ensuring the continuing reliability
and safety of remaining nuclear weapons without the need for underground
tests.
   Jackie Cabasso, executive director of the Western States Legal
Foundation, and a leading NIF opponent, said the report's ``conclusions are
not supported by its findings.'' The study, she said, ``does not change the
fact that NIF is a very serious threat to nonproliferation policy, both
through the development of innovative technologies for nuclear weapons
development and by example for a renewed commitment to nuclear weapons as
an instrument of national policy.''
   Cabasso called ``contradictory'' the U.S. position of supporting a
comprehensive test ban treaty while at the same time building new
facilities to substitute for testing. She also expressed dismay that the
final version of the report had not been made available publicly prior to
O'Leary's announcement, saying the omission ``belies DOE's real serious
commitment to public participation.''
   But Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who represents the Livermore area,
commented that ``NIF will play a vital role not only in keeping America's
national defense second to none, but also in developing renewable energy
resources for our future.''
   NIF construction will bring 2,500 jobs to Livermore, while 1,000
permanent staff positions are expected to be created. The facility is
expected to be completed in 2002.

GAO QUESTIONS DOE PLAN TO MOVE SUPERCOMPUTER UNIT TO BERKELEY

By:
David Kramer

   The General Accounting Office has concluded that a Department of Energy
plan to relocate a supercomputing center from one national lab to another
will not be cost-effective, according to Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who
requested the evaluation from the congressional watchdog.
   But DOE's number-two official insisted that the GAO findings were
``consistent with'' the agency's decision to move the center from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis told Baker Dec. 21 that cost was only one
of six criteria considered in the relocation.
   ``We continue to believe that our decision to relocate the center to
LBNL is in the best interest of the public ... ,'' Curtis said in a letter
to Baker. The decision, he added, ``was based on a peer review process
aimed at securing the highest level of long-term performance in [DOE]
mission areas.''
Baker, who represents the Livermore area, had cited the findings of the GAO
report, which was released Dec. 19, in asking DOE to take another look at
its plan to move the National Energy Research Supercomputer Center.
   `` ... [T]his new NERSC proposal is a costly effort that would achieve
no clear scientific benefit,'' Baker said in releasing the GAO report. ``I
am very concerned by this ill-conceived and unjustified proposal, and plan
to urge the Energy Department to carefully reevaluate it.''
   The GAO report, which examined only the costs of the NERSC move, said
that relocating the facility to LBNL could cost more than the $4.4 million
estimated by LBNL. In addition, GAO calculated that maintenance of the
facility at LBNL would cost about $617,000 more annually than it would to
keep NERSC at LLNL.
   In what DOE officials had earlier acknowledged was largely a
budget-driven exercise, DOE's Office of Energy Research sought competing
bids from LLNL and LBNL last year for operation of NERSC, and instructed
the labs to assume a 15% to 20% reduction in funding from FY-95 levels. The
labs' proposals were evaluated by an outside panel of specialists, the
majority of whom recommended that the center be relocated to LBNL.
   While the two bids were nearly identical in cost terms, LBNL offered to
run the center with essentially its existing 100 staff, while LLNL proposed
to cut 14 positions. GAO noted that LBNL was able to maintain staff levels
in part by drafting nine graduate students from the adjacent University of
California at Berkeley.
   Despite its location at LLNL, NERSC is used solely for unclassified
research, mainly by programs supported by DOE's Office of Energy Research
(ER). The decision to relocate the facility to LBNL, an ER-administered
lab, raised suspicions that DOE was motivated by a wish to consolidate ER
programs in ER facilities, and possibly ``prop up'' LBNL. Both motives were
denied by DOE officials.
   In its review, GAO warned that LBNL may have underestimated the
relocation expenses. It said that while Berkeley had included the cost to
move about 220 people within the lab to accommodate the move, additional
relocations could be required. And DOE may need to incur additional costs
to convert the vacated NERSC facility at Livermore to a new use, it said.
   A DOE official said this week that LBNL has since ``scrubbed'' the
moving estimates and stands by the $4.4 million figure.
   GAO said David Nelson, the ER associate director for computational and
technology research, told its auditors that cost was only one of six
criteria that his office used in evaluating the proposals. Others included
benefits to ER; impact on ER missions through interdisciplinary internal
and external collaborations; lab management's support; and demonstrated
capability to integrate future technological advances to support ER's
computing and communications needs.
   Baker complained that many LLNL employees will experience considerable
inconvenience because of the ``unsound'' move.
   ``I am very concerned that for the sake of bureaucratic reshuffling, a
significant number of hard-working men and women are going to have to begin
prolonged commutes from Livermore to Berkeley,'' he said. ``Satisfying
Washington bureaucrats is not a good enough reason to disrupt the lives of
LLNL employees.''
   Baker also termed unsatisfactory the explanation he had received from
Curtis for the relocation, which was announced Nov. 3.
   ``Mr. Curtis said in his [Nov. 3] letter that LBNL offered `superior
long-range vision' and `improved opportunities for internal and external
collaboration.' This is obscure, bureaucratic nonsense that fails to
explain any sound basis for the proposed move,'' he said.

LIVERMORE CONFERENCE EXPLORES NEW LINKS WITH SMALL BUSINESS

   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hosted a one-day conference last
month to explore new ways for large organizations, including national labs,
to forge links with small- and medium-sized manufacturers and suppliers.
The conference was co-sponsored by the CommerceNet ``Commerce at Light
Speed'' project, an effort by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency to promote business over the Internet, and by LLNL, in
support of the Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing-National
Information Infrastructure program.
   According to the LLNL Newsline, Roger Flanagan, AM-NII project
coordinator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said the $24 million effort
was initiated in 1994 in recognition that DOE was still doing many things
``the old way.'' He said project founders realized that DOE needed to
employ new manufacturing strategies used by private industry as well as new
information technologies to streamline and strengthen relationships with
commercial suppliers.
   The program's current emphasis, Flanagan said, is on filling needs
affecting several sites managed by DOE's Defense Programs division,
outsourcing more services and completing pilot projects in key technical
areas. These areas include distributed simulation (Y-12 Plant), technical
data exchange (Kansas City Plant), security and intelligence agents (Sandia
National Laboratories), enterprise information modeling (Los Alamos
National Laboratory) and electronic commerce (LLNL).
   Mike Snow, the DP representative for AM-NII, told Newsline that DOE's
weapons complex used to have a high volume of design and production tasks
with competition between sites for assignments and plenty of time and
resources to get the job done.
   Today DOE is fielding no new nuclear weapons designs and is dedicated to
maintaining the nuclear stockpile and components. In fulfilling its new
responsibilities, he said, the department is facing a scarcity of
resources, uncertain production needs, limited testing opportunities,
declining funding, an aging work force and a shrinking knowledge base.
   To overcome these challenges, Snow told Newsline, DOE must initiate
greater teamwork among its many departments and labs and with its
industrial suppliers, limit and expedite prototypes, do more modeling and
simulation work and move to more flexible manufacturing. It must also
improve information handling to connect workers with data instead of
``moving bodies around'' from site to site.

LAB RESURRECTS CLOSED FACILITY FOR ION-IMPLANTATION RESEARCH

   With help from a shuttered fusion experiment at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, a new process for surface treating materials to improve their
wear resistance will soon go commercial.
   Scientists at Los Alamos and the University of Wisconsin have begun
working under an Advanced Technology Program-backed cooperative r&d
agreement with an 11-company consortium that includes General Motors Corp.
Harley-Davidson Inc. and A.O. Smith Corp., to further scale up the
technique of implanting ions on the surfaces of materials. The implantation
process alters the structure of the material in such a way as to harden
it.
   According to Don Rej, a LANL technical staff member who was the first
principal investigator on the project, the CRADA partners are using a
UW-developed process known as Plasma Surface Ion Implantation and
equipment, facilities and computer modeling capabilities at LANL. The first
two commercial systems for PSII are being built by North Star Research
Corp., Albuquerque, N.M.
   One of the North Star-built units is to be placed in commercial
wear-hardening service at Empire Hard Chrome Inc., Chicago. It is expected
to be used for large-scale automotive and other industrial applications.
The other unit will be shipped to a research facility in Finland.
   Prior to perfecting the plasma technique of implantation, the PSII
process was considered too expensive, slow and complicated for widespread
commercial use. But, according to the fall issue of ``USCAR Dateline
2000,'' a comprehensive cost analysis, including amortized capital
equipment, personnel and consumables, predict large-scale treatment costs
of less than half a penny per square centimeter.
   According to Rej, the primary advantage to the PSII process over the
better-known beamline ion implantation method, is the former's ability to
harden material faces which are not in the ``line of sight'' of a beam. In
PSII, the part is immersed in the plasma in which the ions are produced.
Beamlines are produced by accelerators, and if more than one surface area
is to be treated, the part must be manipulated to expose the particular
surfaces.
   GM and LANL recently completed work in PSSI under a CRADA that began in
1991. According to Rej, the lab is now proposing to continue that work
under auspices of the threatened Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, the consortium of several government agencies and the Big Three
automakers.
   According to a summary of the three-year, $15.5 million ATP project,
automakers are interested in the process because it could be used to treat
the surfaces of lightweight aluminum or magnesium alloys so they can
withstand the high wear and other demanding environmental conditions
characteristic of engines. Substituting these materials for steel and iron
could result in a 10% decrease in the cost of making automobile
powertrains.
   ATP is administered by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
   PSII also could be used to treat the surfaces of dies and tools,
resulting in an expected 10-fold increase in performance life.
   The ATP project will aim to develop and demonstrate prototype
technologies for high-volume applications of PSII. The technology has never
been applied in treatment chambers larger than 1 cubic meter. Unknowns
include the behavior of plasmas in large systems and the uniformity of
treatment achieved on irregularly shaped parts.
   Rej said LANL's primary contribution has been scaling up the technology,
which was developed by UW with support from the National Science
Foundation. The university had only a small table-top unit, while Los
Alamos had a much larger device left over when DOE canceled its alternative
concepts fusion program. The lab also had high voltage technology from its
nuclear physics and Strategic Defense Initiative programs, and computer
modeling capabilities from its nuclear weapons program.
   Other members of the ATP consortium are ABB High Power Semiconductors,
Pittsburgh; Diversified Technologies Inc., Bedford, Mass.; Empire Hard
Chrome; IONEX, Bellaire, Mich.; Kwikset Corp., Anaheim, Calif.; Litton
Electronic Devices, San Carlos, Calif.; NANO Instruments Inc., Oak Ridge,
Tenn.; and PVI, Oxnard, Calif.

DOE'S BARTLESVILLE LAB EXTENDS $100,000 FOR OIL-RECOVERY R&D

   The Department of Energy's National Institute for Petroleum and Energy
Research, Bartlesville, Okla., will provide $100,000 to James E. Russell
Petroleum Inc. to improve a new process to clean water used in oil field
operations.
   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsored
project with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. Russell
Petroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continue
research on the project.
   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into the
reservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. But
impurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,
often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.
   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.
Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.
The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to clean
coal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. It
was unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective for
onshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independent
producers, DOE said.
   According to DOE, the original Russell Petroleum project showed that the
air flotation device may make economic sense for many independent
producers. The company credits the technology with contributing to the
recovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have been left
in the ground.
   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,
Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producers
determine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum design
and operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost of
implementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correct
method of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.
   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oil
producers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells.
   The Russell Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitation
DOE issued to the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of the
program. The department has recently requested proposals for follow-on
projects from participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of the
program.

ELECTROCHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL

   Los Alamos National Laboratory is testing a simple treatment method that
may help small businesses eliminate hazardous wastes from their production
lines. The system may also greatly reduce the volume of inorganic mixed
wastes in storage at Department of Energy facilities like Los Alamos.
   The electrochemical process works at room temperature and low pressure
and runs on familiar direct-current electricity, the lab said. It does not
produce toxic fumes or secondary waste.
   Heavy metals are removed and recovered. Cyanides and toxic organic
compounds are broken into harmless carbon dioxide and nitrogen. And all the
work is done by electrons flowing through the solution.
   The system may prove to be a boon to hospitals and industries that
produce small volumes of hazardous waste, the lab said. Developing separate
treatment methods for each kind of waste is prohibitively expensive. The
electrochemical process, in contrast, can treat many substances cheaply and
safely.
   In December, Los Alamos began expanding the treatment system from a
bench-top experiment that handled less than 2 gallons per day to a pilot
project capable of treating the contents of a 55-gallon drum per day. Jacek
Dziewinski, who leads the project, estimated about 90% of the inorganic
mixed wastes at Los Alamos could be treated using this method.
   Los Alamos is developing the treatment system in partnership with
Faraday Technology Inc., Dayton, Ohio. The company is optimizing the
process for industrial waste streams, especially those with heavy metals,
while Los Alamos is working on mixed waste containing radioactive
materials.
   The original work that led to the concepts developed by Faraday
Technology Inc. was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the
Department of Defense. The Los Alamos research is sponsored by the
Laboratory's Environmental Management Programs.

PARTNERS FOR BIOFUEL PROJECT

   Companies interested in forming partnerships for the development of
commercial equipment for a unique biomass pretreatment technology are being
sought by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Described by NREL as an
``important step in an overall process for producing ethanol and
potentially other commodity chemicals from cellulose biomass,'' the
technology is part of a major project within a biofuels program that NREL
manages for the Department of Energy.
   The project involves the conversion of a wide range of cellulosic
biomass items, such as agricultural and forestry residues, wastepaper,
municipal solid waste, underutilized wood, waste from paper and pulp
production, herbaceous energy crops, and woody energy crops, into ethanol
as a transportation fuel.
   Currently NREL is operating a process development unit (PDU) from which
it is gathering essential data for scaling up the pilot plant to a size
able to commercialize the conversion of biomass to ethanol. Potential
corporate partners would be encouraged to use the PDU infrastructure to
evaluate pilot-scale or prototype equipment designs, the lab said.
   With ethanol production from corn already providing over 1 billion
gallons a year for fuel blending purposes, NREL feels that ``significant
opportunities to further penetrate'' the oxygenate market in the short
term, as well as supply of large amounts of near-pure ethanol for use as a
gasoline substitute, could exist if the costs of ethanol production from
cellulosic biomass could be lowered.
   At this stage, NREL is only seeking ``expressions of interest'' from
potential partners and sees several possible collaborative mechanisms,
including cooperative r&d agreements, cost-shared subcontracts, and
researcher exchanges.
   For more information, contact Ray Prazak at (303) 384-6876 or Scott
Montgomery at (303) 275-3193.

Formulation of
Flexible Firestops

A flexible, fire retardant material intended for use as firestops
in deterring the spread of fire, smoke and fumes during fires in
buildings has been formulated by researchers at 3M (St. Paul, MN
55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  Walton W. Welna reports that the
product includes an intumescent material, a stabilizing agent and
an elastomeric organic binder throughout which the intumescent
material and stabilizing agent are dispersed.

Fire, smoke and fumes in confined spaces, such as multifloor
buildings, can be life threatening.  Frequently fire originating in
the space between a floor and ceiling of such a structure will
spread, along with the resultant smoke and fumes, to other open
spaces in the building, especially to open spaces above the point
of origin of the fire.  The spaces between conduits and piping and
the floors and ceilings through which they pass, or through
penetrations, must be protected by fire resistant materials.  A
through penetration offers an area of low resistance to fire, smoke
and fumes and may serve as a chimney for heat, flame and fumes.
Through penetrations may be filled with commercially available fire
retardant and intumescent putties, caulks, wraps, sheets or mats,
or firestops.

Many commercially available firestop products can reduce or
eliminate the chimney effect for through penetrations and pass the
rigorous ASTM E-814 fire endurance test.  After intumescing and
charring, the material is not easily blown out of penetrations when
subjected to water hose pressure typical of fire fighting
conditions.  Essential characteristics of a firestop material
include the ability to expand and to char, and the charred material
must have enough strength to withstand the test conditions.
Although adequate firestops exist, the goal of 3M researchers was
to formulate a product which retains its expansion, low compression
set, and flexibility after long-term exposure to oxidative
environments.

3M says that the new firestops are an improvement over existing
products because they have superior aging properties, i.e., they
are more resistant to degradation due to ozone and/or oxygen.  They
also have low compression set in the unexpanded state, and superior
char strength in the expanded state.  Finally, the firestops use
ingredients which are believed to be less toxic than those in
conventional compositions.

The intumescent material in the 3M product is a granular hydrated
alkali metal silicate with an average particle size of 0.2-2.0
millimeters (mm).  About 95% by weight of the particles are greater
than 0.2 mm in size.  The alkali metal silicates which work best
are granulated sodium silicates with a moisture content of 5-30% by
weight and a silicon dioxide (SiO2) to sodium oxide (Na2O) ratio in
the 2.0:1.0 to about 3.75:1.0 range.  The elastomeric binder is at
least partially crosslinked, and the stabilizing agent has a
melting point of 105-125(C.  Enough of the stabilizing agent must
be used to keep the composite expansion and compression set
properties stable, even after prolonged exposure to oxidative
conditions.  The 3M product is described in U.S. Patent 5,476,891.

Additives Can Further
Improve Properties

It may be possible to find effective intumescent flame retardant
additives to further reduce the ignitability, heat release rate and
smoke generation of even the best flame retardant plastics,
composites, adhesives, and fabrics, says a scientist at Polytechnic
University (Six Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201; Tel: 718/260-
3715).  Edward D. Weil reports that in some cases there are
empirical guidelines, and in other cases theory points our
promising directions.

Shifting the degradation pathway away from volatile fuel release to
crosslinking and/or the generation of vapors with low fuel values
may represent the likely basis for the highly effective phosphorus-
based flame retardant systems in cellulose.  The degradation is
shifted from volatile levoglucosan to the formation of crosslinked
char.  Enhanced water release is undoubtedly another important
factor.  A quantitative study of the thermal effects of flame
retarding cellulose by alkali showed that the reduction of the fuel
content of the volatiles counteracted the enhanced rate of
degradation and enhanced volatile generation.

Crosslinking, char enhancement and water release are probably the
main modes of action of phosphorus flame retardants in certain
other systems, i.e., in rigid urethane systems, reports Weil.
Phosphorus flame retardants have several other distinct modes of
action, including endothermic, radical scavenging and coating
effects.

Work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
has provided quantum chemical support for the concept that
crosslinking should help flame retardancy.  The initial formation
of thermally stable crosslinks begins the process of char formation
and retards the formation of volatile fuels.  For instance, the
dechloranes, together with certain metal oxides, are high
temperature vulcanizing agents for polyolefin elastomers.  When
they are used as flame retardants, the result is greatly increased
char yield.

This concept also works with a fairly wide range of thermoplastics
where there is a functional group that can be exploited for
purposes of crosslinking.  Acid catalysts flame retard polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA), apparently by causing anhydride links to form.
In some cases, they cause crosslinks to form.

Various other polymer-specific catalytic systems have been found.
One is the action of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) as a catalyst for the
trimerization of the nitrile group in styrene-acrylonitrile
copolymers, with resultant char enhancement.  Sulfonate salt flame
retardants, which work at very low levels in polycarbonates, are
catalysts for the formation of an intumescent char, although
increased carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution may also have an effect.

Another polymer-specific additive that is almost surely catalytic
is platinum used at low levels in peroxide-cured silica-filled
silicone rubbers.  The details of the catalytic effect of platinum
are not clear, although it may somehow inhibit depolymerizaton of
the siloxane structure.  This is one of the most effective flame
retardants known, and it has a detectable effect at parts per
million (ppm) levels.  It provides reason to hope that other such
highly efficient catalyst systems may be found.

Dow Corning's New
Resin Modifiers

A new family of resin modifiers in solid silicone powder form is
being marketed by Dow Corning Corp. (Midland, MI 48686).  Marketed
under the somewhat confusing name "Si Powder Resin Modifiers," the
product is a free flowing, 100% active silicone powder intended to
enhance the physical properties of highly filled flame retardant
thermoplastics, modify thermoplastic burning characteristics, and
improve processing efficiency.

Dow Corning developed the additives to meet the needs of
compounders and injection molders, who want the benefits of a
silicone additive.  The second goal was to improve some of the fire
performance characteristics of plastics without negatively
affecting processing and molding properties.  The Dow Corning
contact is Thomas Vassallo (Tel: 517/496-6289), Additives Industry
Manager.

Si Powder additives are believed to be compatible with halogenated,
halogen-free and phosphorus-based flame retardant additives in a
wide variety of thermoplastic powders.  They are easy to compound
and can be premixed with thermoplastic pellets or powders.  The
additives significantly reduce the rate of heat release and the
evolution of smoke and carbon monoxide of burning plastics such as
polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene and polycarbonate.

Loading levels of 0.1-1.0% permit the resin modifiers to reduce
extruder torque and power consumption and improve the surface gloss
of the final product, but loadings of 1.0-8.0% are required to
modify the burning characteristics of thermoplastics.

Loadings of 3.0-5.0% can restore the impact resistance that flame
retardant additives tend to produce, and levels in the 15% range
may actually improve impact strength.  Such loadings can also
reduce the required loadings of the primary flame retardant
additives.  The new modifiers are available in several grades with
different organic reactivity.

The type of organic reactivity determines compatibility and
performance in particular applications.  The powders are available
in 5-pound samples, 100-pound fiber packs or in bulk.  Dow Corning
is testing Si Powder additives for use in polyolefins, styrenics,
vinyl resins, engineering thermoplastics, and thermoplastic
elastomers.

Phosphorus-Based
Masterbatches Debut

Albright & Wilson Americas (Box 26229, Richmond, VA 23260) has
introduced its trademarked Amgard CPC 400 Series of red phosphorus-
based flame retardant masterbatches.  Mark Huggard says that the
Amgard CPC 400 products include 50% red phosphorus in various
carriers.  The nonhalogenated products do not require synergists to
achieve maximum flame retardant performance.  All of the new
products are solid pellets and are intended for use in nylon 6,
nylon 6,6, polyamide and glass-filled polyamide resins.  End use
applications include wire and cable jacketing, extruded products,
and injection molding resins.

Advantages of the Amgard CPC 400 products include minimum loss of
physical properties in compounded products, excellent thermal
stability and chemical inertness.  They facilitate nonblooming in
final products and have minimal impact on the electrical properties
of base polymers.

Composite Walls
Keep Prisons Secure

A composite security wall system with high impact performance and
compliant with certain fire codes has been built by engineers at GE
Plastics (One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201; 800/845-0600 or
413/448-7110).  Bruce M. Torrey reports that the security wall can
be employed in wall systems in institutions such as minimum
security prisons, detention areas, hospitals, asylums and
psychiatric facilities.

The GE composite, more fully described in U.S. Patent 5,477,652,
includes a thermoplastic polycarbonate sheet and a gypsum board dry
wall product laminated together with an adhesive.  The easy to
install composite is then fastened to wall studs with the
thermoplastic sheet on the inside, i.e., in contact with the wall
studs.

Providing the building and construction industry with an easy to
install, high impact and penetration resistant security wall system
has proven difficult.  Current designs call for the installation of
metal mesh with gypsum board or concrete or masonry wall products,
which are heavy and costly to install.  Other gypsum type products
that are double walled would add considerably to overall
construction costs.  Since such security wall products require
double installation or expensive masonry or concrete products, a
single composite security wall system would significantly reduce
overall costs by being easy to install.

One product on the market today that has been successfully used in
security wall systems is a material with a gypsum core and
densified gypsum outer layers.  While this product provides higher
impact than standard gypsum, it must be double walled to provide
enough security for institutional use.  Its impact resistance, 100
foot pounds (ft. lbs.) or less, is not sufficient to meet the
requirements of many applications.

Other systems that have been used to provide impact performance and
to meet building code requirements for fire resistance consist of
masonry products or several (more than two) layers of gypsum board.
Still other approaches call for the use of metal mesh welded to
metal studs with gypsum board fastened over the metal mesh.  The
gypsum board in this system would actually be fastened to the metal
wall studs.

The polycarbonate sheet used in the GE system is normally about
0.080 inch thick and does not exceed 0.125 inch.  Such a system can
withstand an impact of well in excess of 650 ft. lbs. on the dry
wall side.  In fact, the impact could not actually be measured,
since the metal studs collapsed without the composite cracking or
breaking.  Other materials tested for impact failed at 100-200 ft.
lbs. of impact.

In addition to impact resistance, the composite also meets the
requirement of the National Fire Protection Assn. (NFPA) Life
Safety Code 101 as "Limited Combustible" under NFPA Standard 295.
This standard also requires the product to meet strict flame spread
(ASTM E84) and BTU per lb. limits not exceeding 3500 BTU per lb. of
sample, as outlined in NFPA Standard 259.  A test sample of the new
composite that included a 0.81 inch thick polycarbonate sheet,
contact adhesive and gypsum wallboard 0.75 inch thick, when
subjected to the NFPA 259 and NFPA 101 Limited Combustibles tests,
had a total BTU content of 1746 BTU's per lb. of content.

Foam Fills Holes in
Structural Components

Engineers at BASF Corp. (3000 Continental Dr., Mt. Olive, NJ 07828-
1234; Tel: 201/426-2600) have formulated flame retardant rigid
polyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams containing paraffinic based
oils intended for use in filling water-containing cavities in
structural components.  Agus Sampara reports that BASF formulated
a rigid polyurethane foam to which a base stock lubricating oil
made of at least 55% by weight of paraffinic carbons and less than
10% by weight aromatic carbons was added.

The hydrophobic agent protects the polyurethane foam from reacting
with environmental moisture.  The foam is intended for deposit in
railroad spike holes or any structural member with a cavity in
which moisture would otherwise react with the isocyanate to produce
an uncontrollable foaming mass.

Considerable attention is being directed toward repairing rather
than replacing structural components, such as railroad ties, as a
more efficient and cost effective means for extending the use of
the whole structure.  When a section of rail must be replaced, or
during routine railroad maintenance, the rail is detached from the
ties by removing the spikes and tie plates, leaving behind railroad
ties having spike holes.  Before these railroad ties can be reused,
the spike holes must be plugged to provide the tie with structural
integrity and prevent water from accumulating within the hole and
rotting the wood.

Various methods to plug spike holes have been proposed, including
driving wooden dowels or metal inserts through the hole.  These
methods  are labor intensive and often leave gaps between the
insert and tie through. The gaps can be a place for water to
accumulate.

An alternative approach is to plug the spike holes with a high
density rigid polyurethane foam.  The problem is that environmental
water or moisture in the holes causes the injected polyurethane
composition to foam uncontrollably, resulting in an undesirable low
density foamed mass with low strength.  A proposed solution is a
hydrophobic urethane employing a coal tar or a coal tar pitch
additive.

The coal tar repels environmental water present and prevents water
from reacting with the foam ingredients.  Unfortunately, coal tar
pitch is predominately composed of polynuclear aromatic compounds
including volatile components carcinogenic to humans such as
anthracene, phenanthrene, and acridine.  Coal tar is also a known
carcinogen and contains numerous aromatic volatiles toxic by
inhalation.

Consequently, the BASF engineers set out to find an alternative to
coal tar based rigid polyurethane foam products which would prevent
the urethane composition from reacting with environmental water or
moisture, while reducing the carcinogenic health risks associated
with the aromatic compounds in coal tar.

The BASF rigid polyurethane/polyisocyanurate is produced by
reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a polyol compound having at
least two isocyanate reaction hydrogens, a lubricating oil with a
base stock having at least 55% by weight carbon atoms in paraffinic
form and no more than 10% by weight carbon atoms in aromatic form,
a foaming agent and a urethane promoting catalyst.  Crosslinkers,
surfactants, emulsifiers and/or a trimerization catalyst to promote
the formation of the isocyanurate structure may also be used.  The
paraffinic based oil is a mixture of paraffinic and naphthenic
hydrocarbons and contains only trace amounts of aromatic
hydrocarbons.

Among the flame retardants which may be used are pentabromodiphenyl
oxide, dibromopropanol, tris(b-chloropropyl)phosphate, 2,2-bis(-
bromoethyl) 1,3-propanediol, tetrakis(2-chloroethyl) ethyl
diphosphate, bis-(2-chloroethyl) 2-chloroethylphosphonate,
molybdenum trioxide, ammonium molybdate, ammonium phosphate,
pentabromodiphenyl oxide, tricresylphosphate,
hexabromocyclododecane and dibromoethyl dibromocyclohexane.  These
flame retardant additives are used in concentrations of 1-25 parts
per 100 parts of polyol mixture.  U.S. Patent 5,476,681 protects
the BASF product.

New Product for
Cable Insulation

A nonhalogenated flame retardant insulation with high oxygen index
has been prepared by researchers at Champlain Cable Corp. (Hercules
Dr., Colchester, VT 05446; Tel: 802/655-2121, Fax: 802/655-2025).
Howard F. McRae reports that the new product features a synergistic
combination of chemistry and irradiation for fabricating wire and
cable insulation and heat shrinkable tubing.  Other advantages are
believed to include improved tensile strength and elongation.

Superior insulating construction materials such as tiles and wall
boards can be produced by a polycondensation process in which
carboxyl groups of an olefinic base are linked with the silanol
groups of a silicone material.  The silanol groups are linked with
hydroxyl groups contained in a hydrated fire retardant filler to
provide an insulation that tolerates high loadings of the flame
retardant.  Although crosslinking in these formulations allow the
inclusion of large amounts of fire retardant filler materials in
the insulation, they cannot be processed into wire insulation of
commercial quality.

One of the drawbacks is that they cannot be easily extruded.
Another difficulty is their characteristically substandard tensile
strength, elongation and flexibility.  The increased crosslinking
of these formulations, while improving the fire retardancy through
higher flame retardant loadings, binds the polymer chains to the
extent that flexibility and elongation are impaired.  Such
overbinding, while useful in tiles and wall construction materials
which are not commercially affected by the reduced flexibility and
elongation, hinders performance in wire and cable insulation.

The Champlain Cable product reflects the discovery that commercial
grade insulation for wire and cable, particularly plenum wire and
cable and heat shrinkable tubing, can be fabricated by reducing the
crosslinking of the components of the polycondensation process.
Conventional insulation chemistry utilizes olefinic base materials
containing 6% carboxyl groups by weight, too high a percentage for
fabricating commercial grades of wire insulation.  Champlain
reduced the range of carboxyl groups to about 1% by weight of the
base material.

Champlain subjected the new formulations to electron beam
irradiation to improve the tensile strength, and to allow generally
higher loadings of the flame retardant additive.  Normally, when
greater amounts of filler materials are employed, the tensile
strength and elongation decrease.  Irradiation often improves
tensile strength, but had never been found to increase the
elongation.

It was shown that without the silanol groupings, the resultant
formulation does not demonstrate an increase in elongation after
irradiation. On the other hand, there is a synergy between the
chemistry of the Champlain product and the irradiation, in which
the combination of the two processes provides an increase in both
tensile strength, to 1,000-2,000 psi, and elongation, to 370-450%.

The hydroxyl-containing fire retardant filler used in the
insulation is normally magnesium hydroxide, but alumina trihydrate
may also be employed.  The formulation, which permits flame
retardant additive loadings three times as high as those in
conventional insulation, has greatly improved flame retardancy.
Oxygen indices of 42-72 have been achieved.  U.S. Patent RE35127,
a reissue of U.S. Patent 5,063,266, details the new Champlain Cable
work.

Ceramic Composite
Shaped for Furnaces

A new shaped ceramic composite material produced at 3M (St. Paul,
MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110) is intended for use in
applications requiring good heat resistance and mechanical
properties, such as gas fired radiant burner tubes, gas burner
nozzle liners, heat exchangers, thermowells, core busters or flame
dispersers and other gas fired furnace components.  Robert G. Smith
reports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coating
of a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,
and a silicon carbide coating.

Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosive
environments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnaces
and aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types of
commercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,
nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,
monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers and
ceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper use
temperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.

Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with an
upper use a temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, they
are generally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problem
of conventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible to
select a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare a
radiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use in
high temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is only
possible by taking great care in the selection of materials and by
making some compromises in properties.

The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon and has a
thickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.  The 3M
product includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-20.0%
by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boron nitride,
and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.  U.S. Patent 5,476,684 was
assigned for this invention.

Zirconium Lowers
Smoke Generation

Flame retarded wool fibers with a zirconium-based finish are the
choice of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group (Pacific Highway S.,
Seattle, WA 98188; Tel: 206/394-3111) for use in decorative
applications in commercial aircraft, says the company's Sally A.
Hasselbrack.  Although the company is continuing to perfect these
materials, the zirconium materials have shown an outstanding
acceptance of dyestuffs, inherent resistance to burning, ease of
flame retardance, and great capacity to tolerate the wear and tear
of service in aircraft.

Hasselbrack credits the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Regulation (FAR) 25, Appendix F, Part II with facilitating the new
flammability testing that will save many lives in post-crash fires.
The regulation uses a more realistic ignition source to initiate
combustion during simulations of post-crash fires.  It also
mandates retroactive coverage for the entire U.S. commercial air
fleet.  The Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft were the first to include
design guidelines stipulating the incorporation of materials with
limited smoke and toxic gas emission whenever possible.

Early technology for decorative fibers in aircraft interiors
incorporated the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fibers in the warp
and a phosphorus-based flame retardant finish on the wool filling
yarns.  Research performed at the Ilkley, West Yorkshire, U.K.-
based International Wool Secretariat (IWC) then led to a zirconium
and titanium compound-based Zirpro flame retarding finish for wool
fibers.

Requirements for textile products applied to vertical surfaces,
e.g., wall tapestries, are covered by FAR 25 amendments.  To meet
these requirements, tetrabromophthalic acid (TBPA) is used in
combination with the Zirpro treatment.  The success of this system
is due to the synergism between the zirconium finish, which works
in the solid phase, and the organobromine acid, which works in the
vapor phase.  The IWC, newly renamed Wools of New Zealand (WNZ),
recommends two forms of the TBPA compound: an emulsified paste with
a 40% bromine content, and a liquid form of disodium salt of
tetrabromophthalic anhydride with a 15% bromine content.

The utilization of TBPA is an essential part of Boeing's washable
wool program, the company's latest area of interest for flame
retarded wool.  When flame retardant washable wool first became
available, about 10 years ago, shrinkage after the first laundering
was 5-7%.  Shrinkage with subsequent launderings was minimal.
Since a strong correlation exists between dimensional stability and
abrasion, or wear resistance, Boeing did not initially use the
product.  As more Boeing 737s were sold to developing nations, the
company received an increasing number of requests for a washable
flame retardant product that would meet the shrinkage and
appearance requirements of the airline industry.  A new effort was
initiated to reduce shrinkage to 2% over 15 launderings.

The WNZ says that any type of shrink resistant process must be
compatible with the Zirpro process, because the Zirpro process is
the only existing flame retardant process for wool durable to
washing.  The organization's suggested techniques for the shrink
treatment of wool include a chlorine-based treatment applied to the
fiber in its worsted tops form, and to the woven, dyed fabric by a
padding process.  WNZ recommends that the weight of the fabric
should not fall below 11 ounces per square yard (oz/yd2) and that
only 100% wool fabrics should be used.  Both shrinkage and
appearance retention are improved by using a tightly woven fabric.
At 14 oz/yd2 the materials can withstand 19-20 launderings.

Lowering the Rate
of Heat Release

Helping furniture manufacturers produce upholstered furniture with
low rates of heat release is the intent of researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  Thomas
Ohlemiller (Tel: 301/975-6481) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. finds
that the flammability of upholstered furniture continues to be a
substantial problem in both residential and public occupancies.

Both smoldering and flaming ignition problems exist.  The
smoldering problem, existing primarily in residences, is being
addressed through a voluntary industry program and by the
consideration of regulations covering cigarette ignition
propensity.  The flaming ignition problem and its consequences in
terms of heat release are being addressed in differing manners,
depending on the type of occupancy in the building in which the
furniture is used.  California Technical Bulletin 133 requires that
public occupancy furniture respond to an arson-like 18 kilowatt
(kW) igniter with a peak heat release rate of 80 kW.

This severe test has encouraged the development of barrier
technology, which involves a protective fabric layer in upholstery
between the foam and the outer layer of fabric.  Such technology is
believed to be cost effective since it is not meeting strong
industry resistance.  On the other hand, there are so many
variables in furniture design that only very large companies are
able to perform the large number of empirical tests needed to
ensure compliance across their product line.  This, coupled with
the technical attractiveness of barriers for controlling heat
release in any upholstered furniture, has prompted BFRL's ongoing
efforts to develop a quantitative understanding of the various
factors that control the heat release curve using mockups
containing various barrier fabrics.

In the study, BFRL will characterize the relationships between
small scale test data and full scale mockup behavior.  The focus is
on mockups containing a barrier fabric.  The results of related
work by the Association for Contract Textiles and the European
Community will also be considered.  After completing the barrier
effects of several fabrics in  a fixed mockup geometry, BFRL will
systematically vary the geometry.  This calls for a series of
mockups involving a very limited material selection, but wide
variations in seat, seatback and arm cushion dimensions.

Curable Printed
Circuit Boards

Curable flame retardant resins intended for use as the basic
material in printed circuit boards has been prepared by Gurit-Essex
(Papiermuhlestrasse 155, CH 3063 Ittigen-Bern, Switzerland; Tel: 31
580388) scientists.  Herbert Schriber, Gunter Burkart, and Bruno
Knaus report that the new formulation includes a thermally curable
1-oxa-3-aza tetraline group-containing compound, a curable epoxy
compound, and a flame retardant.  The flame retardant additive may
be aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, elemental red
phosphorus, oxygen acids of phosphorus, inorganic salts of oxygen
acids of phosphorus, polyphosphates, boric acid, or salts of boric
acid.

Although bromine-based flame retardant additives impart the
required flame retardance to resins used in the manufacture of
printed circuit boards, they can generate poisonous and/or
corrosive gases when exposed to fire.  As a result the Gurit-Essex
researchers sought a nonhalogenated alternative to flame retard the
resins.  U.S. Patent 5,443,911 explains the Gurit-Essex work in
detail.

Formulation Doesn't
Corrode Machinery

A new transparent, flame retardant, aromatic, polycarbonate resin
formulated by scientists at Teijin, Ltd. (1-11 Minamihonmachi,
Higashi-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/268 2132, Fax: 6/266 1481)
does not corrode the molding machinery used to process the resin
into plastic components.  Masahiro Miyouga and Shinichi Souda
report that the new resin is highly transparent and includes 100
parts by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, 0.01-1.00 part
by weight of a perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt and 0.02-
2.00 parts by weight of a halogenated triaryl phosphate flame
retardant in which at least one halogen atom is substituted on the
ring-forming carbon of each aromatic hydrocarbon group.

Aromatic polycarbonate resins have many excellent properties which
facilitate their widespread use, but they are also quite
combustible and require high loadings of flame retardant additives
when used in applications where flame retardancy is required.
Several conventional methods for imparting this flame retardancy
are used.

One is the incorporation of an organic halogen compound.  For
example, a polycarbonate oligomer obtained from tetrabromobisphenol
A as a dihydroxy component is often used in amounts that make the
bromine concentration in the final resin 5-15% by weight.  In
another instance, a carbonate copolymer obtained from
tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol A as dihydroxy components is
used in amounts to make the bromine concentration 5-9% by weight.
The problem is that when an aromatic polycarbonate resin containing
such a bromine-based flame retardant is molded or processed, the
machinery will most likely corrode.

Increasing the bromine concentration increases the corrosion.  The
goal of the Teijin researchers was to develop an aromatic
polycarbonate resin that would reduce corrosive tendencies, while
maintaining excellent flame retardancy.

One approach is the use of formulations that include 100 parts by
weight of a halogen-free conventional polycarbonate resin with a
molecular weight of 10,000-30,000, 5-60 parts by weight of a
halogen-free ultrahigh molecular-weight polycarbonate resin with a
molecular weight of 100,000-250,000 and 5-20% by weight of a flame
retardant.  The use of ultrahigh molecular weight resins is
expensive, though, and handling such materials is difficult.  In
addition, the resulting compositions have low transparency, and
their molding and processing characteristics are only mediocre.

Bromine-free flame retardants may also be used in conventional
molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resins.  For example,
potassium perfluoroalkanesulfonate decreases the production of
corrosive gas, but, when used in high enough loadings to impart
sufficient flame retardancy, it decreases the heat stability of the
resin.

The Teijin breakthrough was the discovery that when potassium
perfluoroalkanesulfonate is combined with a small amount of
halogenated triaryl phosphate and incorporated into an aromatic
polycarbonate resin, the resin maintains its flame retardancy and
transparency can be retained, but corrosive tendencies are
decreased.  The perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt contains
an alkyl group with 1-8 carbon atoms, and the hydrogen atoms of the
alkyl group are replaced by fluorine atoms.  The alkali metal in
the salt is potassium or sodium.

Other examples of usable salts include potassium
perfluorobutanesulfonate and sodium perfluorooctanesulfonate. The
halogenated triaryl phosphate flame retardant must be free of
impurities such as salts and phosphate ester halides.  These
impurities cause turbidity and decreased transparency in the final
resin.  The Teijin work is more fully described in U.S. Patent
5,478,874.

New Encapsulant for
Semiconductor Devices

A new flame retardant epoxy molding compound, formulated by
researchers at Dexter Corp. (Franklin St., Olean, NY 14760; Tel:
716/372-6300, Fax: 716/372-6864), is intended for use in the
encapsulation of semiconductor devices.  Anthony A. Gallo reports
that epoxy resin compounds have often been used for encapsulation
of semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits (IC), large
scale integrated circuits (LSI), transistors, and diodes and other
electronic components.  Such encapsulants generally comprise an
epoxy, a hardener, a catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a
colorant, a coupling agent and a flame retardant system.

Conventional flame retardant epoxy molding compounds use systems
that can include halogenated compounds, transition metal oxides and
hydrated alumina.  The problem is that at high temperatures, these
flame retardant additives detract from the compatibility of the
encapsulant with semiconductor devices.  Other applicable flame
retardant systems include an organic phosphine compound and
antimony oxide; and antimony trioxide or antimony tetraoxide and
halogenated compounds.

Although these conventional flame retardant combinations provide
reasonable flame retardance and satisfactory compatibility on
electronic devices, the Dexter researchers believed that there was
a need for products with improved high temperature compatibility
and performance, and lower cost and toxicity.

The new Dexter formulation, detailed in U.S. Patent 5,476,716,
includes an epoxy, a novolac or anhydride type hardener, a
catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a colorant and a coupling
agent.  The flame retardant system includes a halogen-containing
organic compound, and either antimony pentoxide or magnesium oxide.
The halogen-containing organic compound may include either chlorine
or bromine.  Examples include polyglycidyl ether of
bromophenolformaldehyde novolac, halogenated bisphenol A and its
derivatives such as tetrabromobisphenol A, and glycidyl ethers of
halogenated resins such as the diglycidyl ether of
tetrabromobisphenol A.

3M Continues Quest
of Halon Alternatives

Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds can be used as chemical fire
extinguishing agents in streaming applications, total flooding and
explosion suppression and inertion, report scientists at 3M (St.
Paul, MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  These chemicals are under
consideration as replacements in fire extinguishing applications
wherein applications where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or halons have been used.

Because of a steady flow of bad news about the damaged
stratospheric ozone layer, the deadlines for the end to
industrialized countries' production of CFCs and other ozone
depleting chemicals were accelerated by countries who are parties
to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone
Layer.  Research has been initiated to replace all CFCs and halons,
such as CCl2F2, CCl3F, CF3Br and CCl2FCClF2, with substitute or
alternative compounds and technologies.

A number of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), e.g., CH2FCF3, or HFC-134a,
are being used or have been proposed as CFC substitutes.  HFC-134a
is more ozone friendly.  HCFCs, such as CH3CCl2F, or HCFC-141b, are
CFC substitutes, but although they are not nearly as damaging,
these substitutes do carry ozone depleting chlorine into the
stratosphere.  Another proposed substitute is the simple omega-
hydrodifluoromethyl perfluoromethyl ether (CF3OCF2H).

Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers formulated by 3M are hydrophobic and
less oleophobic than the perfluoroalkyl ether analogs, chemically
inert, thermally stable, water insoluble and normally liquid at
20(C.  They can be produced in high yield and high purity and with
a wide range of molecular weights.  The covalent bond between the
omega-hydrogen and terminal carbon, i.e., the carbon-hydrogen bond,
is generally degradable by atmospheric photooxidation, making the
omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers environmentally acceptable.

3M's George G.I. Moore discloses that these normally liquid, omega-
hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds (and some their mixtures) have a
saturated perfluoroaliphatic chain of carbon atoms interrupted by
one or more ether oxygen atoms.  The compounds can be prepared by
the decarboxylation of the corresponding fluoroalkyl ether
carboxylic acids.  U.S. Patent 5,476,974 details the 3M omega-
hydrofluoroalkyl ethers.

Testing the Limits
of Replacements

The lean flammability limit of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement
refrigerants will be ascertained by a team of researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  Carole
Womeldorf (Tel: 301/975-4415) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. reports
that hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-32 and a mixture of HFC-32 and HFC-125
are the refrigerants under study.  These materials are being
considered as replacements for ozone depleting CFCs.

A critical element in the risk analysis of alternative refrigerants
is the lean flammability limit.  Variations in the flammability
limit can occur, depending on the initial conditions chosen for
conducting the test.  There is a need to eliminate these variations
and to establish invariant, fundamental lean flammability limits
which can be attributed to refrigerant mixtures in a manner similar
to fundamental thermodynamic properties like enthalpy of formation
and adiabatic flame temperature.

BFRL will modify an existing burner facility to operate in a
symmetrical, adiabatic mode with independent control of the gaseous
refrigerant and air flows.  The burner will be calibrated using
methane to ensure that the facility is capable of reproducing the
published values of the lean flammability limit.  Stoichiometric
flames of HFC-32 and air will be examined.  The flow velocity will
be varied to establish the extinction strain rate and to identify
the dynamic range of the burner using a less flammable fuel.  The
fuel/air equivalence ratio will be varied about the stoichiometric
point, and the strain rate will be adjusted to identify the most
robust mixture (normally slightly rich for hydrocarbon flames).

The lean flammability limit of HFC-32 can be found using the zero
strain rate extrapolation method.  The critical flammability ratio
can be found by slowly increasing the fraction of HFC-125 in the
HFC/air mixture while maintaining the overall equivalence ratio and
strain rate, or by fixing the concentrations of all constituents
and slowly increasing the strain rate by reducing the spacing
between the upper and lower burners.

M.A. Hanna to
Acquire CIMCO

M.A. Hanna Co. (200 Public Square, Cleveland, OH 44114; Tel:
216/589-4000) has a preliminary agreement to acquire all of the
outstanding capital stock of CIMCO, Inc. (Briggs Ave., Costa Mesa,
CA 92626; Tel: 714/546-4460), a producer of thermoplastic compounds
and plastic components.  M.A. Hanna manufactures flame retardant
plastics, rubber and color and additive concentrates and
distributes plastic resins and engineered components.

The company, in a move that it says is "consistent with its
strategy of being an intermediary between the polymer producer and
end product manufacturer," intends to sell CIMCO's plastic
components business and retain the plastics compounding operations.
T. Russell Gilbert, president and CEO of CIMCO and CIMCO's largest
shareholder, says M.A. Hanna, will buy the molded components
business as a going concern shortly after completing the
acquisition of CIMCO is completed.  Gilbert owns 615,984 shares, or
21%, of the CIMCO shares outstanding.

CIMCO's plastics compounding businesses, which operate as
Compounding Technology, Inc. (CTI), are located in Singapore;
Corona, CA; and Charlotte, NC.  "The acquisition of CTI helps us on
three fronts to have a more balanced market profile," says Martin
D. Walker, M.A. Hanna chairman and CEO.  "First we will grow our
international business."  CTI provides M.A. Hanna with an excellent
basis for growth in Asia.

In fact, the operation in Singapore is CTI's largest.  CTI is also
in the process of expanding its production capabilities into
Europe.  Second, CTI's strong engineering plastics business will
add breadth to our specialty compounding portfolio throughout the
world.  Finally, we are able to build a stronger position in the
electrical, electronics and business machines markets."

States Adopt NFPA
Life Safety Code

Continuing their ongoing commitment to keeping citizens safer from
fire, officials in Alabama, Delaware, Maine, Maryland and Tennessee
have adopted the 1994 edition of the National Fire Protection Assn.
(NFPA, One Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269-9101) trademarked
Life Safety Code.  The Life Safety code, which provides basic
requirements for safety in buildings during emergencies, includes
provisions for building design, construction, operation and
maintenance to protect occupants from fire, smoke and toxic gases.

The latest edition of the code ensures that public safety
requirements are current and continue to be met.  NFPA works with
local authorities to help them implement code requirements and
encourages officials to adopt updated versions of its codes and
standards.

In the U.S., all health care facilities that receive Medicare or
Medicaid funding must comply with the Life Safety Code, according
to federal requirements.  To date, 33 states have adopted and
enforce the code, which requires that new and existing buildings
allow for "prompt escape" or that a means to provide people with a
reasonable degree of safety is considered.  Key provisions include
requirements that locks and hardware on doors must be installed to
permit free escape, exits must be marked by readily visible signs,
any door in a means of egress must be capable of swinging to the
open position to allow for the full use of the opening, and
evacuation signals must be audible and visible.

"Adoption and enforcement of state-of-the-art codes and standards
is a proven method for reducing fire loss," says NFPA president
George D. Miller.  "In some way virtually every building, process,
service, design and installation is affected by the codes and
standards developed through NFPA's open consensus codes- and
standards-making system."

Fire and Nonfire
Signals Differ

A better way to differentiate the patterns of fire and nonfire
signals using multiple sensors is the subject of a project at the
University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742; Tel: 301/405-1000).
Thomas J. McAvoy reports that incorporating intelligence into a
fire detector so that it can recognize signature patterns is
intended to permit prompt fire detection, while allowing the
detector to discriminate between signatures from fire and nonfire
sources.  The primary purpose of this initial University of
Maryland work was to investigate the patterns of signatures
associated fire and environmental sources using small scale
experiments.

The scientists generated products from a wide range of conditions,
from flaming or pyrolyzing samples to heated samples and those
obtained with an atomizer.  They also measured gas concentrations,
light obscuration and temperature to characterize the products.  In
analyzing the data, they were able to identify trends from which an
elementary expert system can be built to identify the source of
airborne products.

McAvoy, writing in Fire and Technology, 31(2), reports that several
patterns were evident.  The maximum carbon dioxide (CO2)
concentrations achieved during experiments with flaming fires are
significantly greater than the maximum CO2 concentrations achieved
during experiments with nonflaming fires (pyrolyzing fires, heated
liquids and environmental odors).  The nonflaming sources can be
identified based on the carbon monoxide (CO) and metal oxide sensor
peak measurements.  Except for three experiments using pyrolyzing
solids, the peak CO concentration is greater--though the detector
response is less--for nonflaming fires than for environmental
sources.

The researchers built and tested an elementary neural network which
properly classified all fires except for one pyrolyzing event.
Based on this preliminary work, commercial fire detection systems
based on the analysis of airborne products appears feasible.
Additional research is needed to identify the optimum types and
number of sensors that should be coupled to provide prompt
detection between various sources.

Smoke and Dust
Particles Sensed

A smoke detector capable of sensing both smoke and fine particles
such as dust has been constructed by engineers at Hochiki Corp. (2-
10-43 Kamiosaki, Shinagawa-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/444 4111, Fax:
3/447 1388).  Conventional  photoelectric analog smoke sensors
include a light emitting chamber and a light receiving chamber.
The light receiving chamber is placed in a position where it does
not directly receive light from the light emitting chamber.

Diffused light caused by smoke is detected in the light receiving
chamber, and a signal corresponding to the smoke density is
obtained.  A drive circuit for light emitting elements such as
light emitting diodes (LEDs) is located in the light emitting
chamber, and a light receiving signal amplifying circuit with an
element, such as a photodiode, is located in the light receiving
chamber.  When diffused light caused by smoke is detected by the
light receiving element, a signal at a level corresponding to the
smoke density is photoelectrically converted by the photodiode and
then amplified.  In this way, a conventional smoke detector obtains
the analog signal having output characteristics required by an
automatic fire notification system.

The problem is that in such an analog sensor, the integrated amount
of diffused light is detected.  As a result, only a small amount of
light is present in the area where the volume of fine particles
caused by a fire is small.  It is, therefore, not possible to
detect a very small amount of smoke generated in the initial period
of a fire.  Since fine particles such as dust cannot be detected by
the these sensors, it is not possible to distinguish dust and water
vapor from smoke, nor to distinguish environmental abnormalities
such as the contamination of the inside of the chamber at the same
time smoke is detected.

Atsushi Manmoto and Yukio Yamauchi report that the Hochiki detector
makes use of a light emitting device that projects a light beam
onto a monitor area.  A light receiving device is arranged so that
instead of receiving the light beam directly, it receives diffused
light caused by fine particles, i.e., dust or smoke, entering the
monitor area.  The output from the light receiving device is
amplified and counted and its average value per unit of time is
computed.  The result is that the signals caused by environmental
dust and smoke from fires can be differentiated, leading to a more
reliable instrument.  U.S. Patent 5,477,218 fully describes the
Hochiki work.

Checking Accuracy
of Fire Models

Researchers at Clemson University (Dept. of Mathematical Sciences,
Clemson, SC 29634-1907; Tel: 803/656-2616) have completed a
prototype sensitivity analysis capability for a fire model computer
program.  Their intent, reports Michael M. Kostreva, professor of
Mathematical Sciences, was to analyze the approach of the existing
HAZARD I fire model and to evaluate and demonstrate newly obtained
results on the mathematical foundations of fire models.

While HAZARD I is an established computer tool for modeling fires
in residential buildings, it lacks sensitivity analysis
capabilities.  Such a feature would allow users to better
understand the influence of certain input data on the computational
results.  This understanding could be translated into better use of
resources for gathering data and generally enhanced credibility of
the modeling results.  HAZARD I has successfully incorporated a
succession of increasingly complex fire models, including FAST,
CFAST and CONRAD 2.  A corresponding set of models equipped with
sensitivity analysis capabilities are needed.

Earlier approaches to fire model sensitivity analysis made use of
the simple ASET model.  The Clemson approach involved the ASET,
FAST, CFAST and CONRAD 2 models.  These include local methods of
finite difference type, along with the direct methods which use
some additional differential equations.  Global methods, which
involve averaging over a collection of preselected scenarios, were
not considered.

The results, relevant sets of input parameters and model outputs,
were accumulated in tabular form.  Examples of presently available
zone fire models have been assembled, along with the relevant
parameters for fires involving up to four rooms.  Kostreva found
that a limited sensitivity analysis, considering a carefully
selected subset of input parameters, is feasible, even for the more
complex models.  The graphical presentation of the results
facilitate a good quantitative understanding of the underlying
relationships.

MIT Simulates
Fire Plumes

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Dept. of Mechanical
Engineering, Cambridge, MA 02139) scientists are building a
computationally-based large fire plume model in which buoyant fluid
mechanics, combustion, radiative transport and their mutual
interactions are all fundamentally represented using physically
sound approximations.  Ahmed F. Ghoniem (Tel: 617/253-2295) reports
that the approximations will be well resolved, both spatially and
temporally.  The model's computational efficiency, achieved by
simulating each of the processes, will allow the performance of
practical simulations on an advanced engineering workstation.

The simulation of fire plumes yielding burning rates, pollutant
formation rates and the radiation field is necessary as a tool for
the assessment of the environmental impact of large fires.
Computational modeling of these fires is complicated by the
presence of several complex physical processes, including
turbulence, transport and chemistry.  The wide range of physical
scales in these processes complicates their numerical modeling even
further.  The overall dynamics of the process is essentially
unsteady, and conventional numerical approaches could be very
expensive, since the domains of these fires are often extremely
large.

To overcome these difficulties, the MIT investigators are preparing
a computational model of fire plumes based on a simulation of all
of the significant physical processes involved.  They are employing
the vortex method to obtain solutions of some of the equations
involved, including the buoyancy and baroclinic terms, using
computational elements distributed along the layer separating the
plume (fuel and products) and the surrounding air and products in
the turbulent regime.

Mixing and combustion processes are simulated using the transport
element method in which only species concentration and temperature
gradients are computed, and only where vortex elements exist.  Fast
chemistry assumption is used in the computation of the burning
rate, temperature and major species distribution.  The
concentration of the computational elements within the narrow zone
of plume boundaries provides this approach with the necessary
efficiency.

An extensive validation study of both the isothermal plume and the
reacting plume models has been performed.  For the isothermal
plume, the relationship between the puffing frequency and the pool
diameter has been established and the results compared with
experimental data.  For the reacting case, they repeated the same
study and obtained good agreement with experimental data.

In both cases, they concluded that puffing is a buoyancy
instability formed at the base of the plume near the pool due to
the tendency of the rising plume to accelerate upward, thereby
reducing the plume diameter below that of the pool.  The conical
interface is subject to gravitational instability which leads to
the roll-up of the material interface and the concomitant puffing.
This puffing is responsible for the strong entrainment field into
the fire plume and the high upward penetration of the flames.

Ghoniem's team will next incorporate a soot formation model and a
liquid-gas interface boundary condition at the pool surface.  The
soot formation model is necessary for the computation of the
radiative transport fluxes, which contribute significantly to the
fuel evaporation and pyrolysis.  The liquid-gas interface condition
is intended to establish a physical basis for determining the
vaporization rate of the fuel.  A radiative-based transport
algorithm will also be constructed and incorporated.

Occupant and Fuel
Load Determined

A project at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742;
Tel: 301/405-1000) is intended to provide a method for determining
the occupant load in a wide variety of both open plan and
compartmented office buildings for use in fire safety planning.
James A. Milke reports that the work will also determine how to
collect fuel load data for office spaces.  The problem is that
questions have been raised concerning the accuracy of currently
accepted occupant and fuel loads.  The subject arose after
preliminary studies were conducted in open plan and compartmented
office buildings.

The researchers first reviewed current occupant load survey
procedures and data collection forms.  In an occupant load
analysis, two parameters are needed: the number of building
occupants at any given time and the area of floor space.  The
approach is to count building occupants present during a survey
along with unoccupied workstations which appear to be occupied
under normal conditions.  Counting individuals not actually at
their workstations is an obvious source of inaccuracy.  In
addition, an improved methodology would account for guests or
visitors in a given building, along with people involved with
maintenance and custodial work and building contractors.  Most of
these individuals may be readily identified due to their different
working attire.

A preliminary version of a revised data collection form and
procedure was then prepared which reduces the obvious inaccuracies
in the conventional approach.  The new approach was then
successfully used to conduct occupant load surveys in public and
private sector office spaces in the metropolitan Washington, DC,
area.  The research team is now preparing their approach for
evaluating the fuel load evaluation which involves surveying office
spaces prepared for moving.  It is said to significantly simplify
the current procedure which includes weighing or estimating the
weight of the materials in office spaces.

Characterizing Polymer
Flammability at NIST

Characterizing polymer flammability is the objective of a new
project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab
(BFRL).  Jeffrey Gilman (Tel: 301/975-6573) and Takashi Kashiwagi
(Tel: 301/975-6699), both of BFRL's Fire Science Div., will
determine the chemical structure of polymer residues generated
under well defined fire conditions for the purpose of determining
the links between original polymer structure, nonhalogenated
additives, char characteristics and flammability properties of
polymeric materials.

Two trends starting to significantly affect the U.S. plastics
industry are polymer recycling and a demand for nonhalogenated
flame retardant treatments.  The degradation products of polymers
flame retarded with halogenated additives are corrosive, and some
may be toxic.  One alternative approach to flame retarding polymers
is to form a char during burning.  This approach is ideal in that
carbon atoms retained in the condensed phase, as char, lessen the
available fuel for flaming combustion even as they help to insulate
the polymer from the heat of the flame.  Presently, though, there
is very little quantitative information about the relationship
between polymer structure, char properties, the effect of
nonhalogenated additives and realistic flammability properties.

BFRL will evaluate polymer/additive systems using its cone
calorimeter to find those with improved flammability behavior.
Preceramic polymer/organic polymer blends will be prepared and
evaluated.  The solid state decomposition chemistry of the
promising candidates will then be characterized, and samples at
intermediate stages of composition will be generated from the
preceramic/organic polymer blends in an inert flow pyrolysis
apparatus at many different temperatures.  Char yield,
aromatic/aliphatic ratio and crosslink density will be measured.

For higher heating rate conditions, the samples will be evaluated
under fire-like, nonoxidizing conditions in a gasification
apparatus which exposes large compression molded 100 gram disk
samples to a radiant heat source of 25-40 kilowatts per square
meter in a gaseous nitrogen atmosphere.  Gaseous degradation
products for the selected polymer samples.

BOOKS

International
Perspective

Fire Standards in the International Marketplace, published by the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), offers a new
view of fire standards from an international perspective.  Leading
researchers in the field from France, England, and the U.S. have
presented material in three areas of concern.

First, the Test Method Development section covers the cone
calorimeter, including its development, standardization, and
future; three smoke test method evaluations; and a review and
comparison of ASTM and international fire standards.  The second
part of the book, International Aspects of Fire Standards, deals
with worldwide developments in fire safety engineering and
Eurocodes for structural fire designs.  Fire Performance in the
Real World, the volume's third section, covers fire resistance
testing controversies and the history, development, and future of
fire resistive joints.

The book, reports ASTM, is aimed at individuals and companies
concerned with the sale and flammability of products in the
international marketplace, researchers and testing personnel in the
fire standards professions, and fire regulatory officials.  Fire
Standards in the International Marketplace is available from the
ASTM (100 Barr Harbor Dr., W. Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; Tel:
610/832-9585, Fax: 610/832-9555, email: service@local.astm.org).

STRATEGIES FOR COMPATIBILIZATION OF POLYMER BLENDS
[960101]

This (University of Texas) paper deals with strategies
for making polymer blends compatible.  The blending of
polymers offers attractive opportunities for achieving
unique property combinations and for improving
mechanical toughness, but it requires knowing how to
control interactions to achieve miscibility or phase-
separated blends with proper interfacial coupling.
Without controlled interactions, blends do not perform
as desired and some strategy for compatibilization is
necessary.  In order to obtain useful mechanical
properties, preformed block or graft copolymers may be
added to act as interfacial agents, or they may be
formed in situ by reaction of suitably chosen
functionalized polymeric components for control of
phase morphology and the interface between the phases.
(This 1991 conference paper was recently made available
as a reprint.)

BLENDING OF THERMOTROPIC LIQUID CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS
WITH THERMOPLASTICS [960102]

This work (by Virginia Polytechnic Institute) concerns
the optimization of the reinforcing effect provided by
liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) when combined with
thermoplastics.  The first phase of the research is
concerned with the generation of in situ composites
where the LCP fibrils are directly generated during
processing.  Because the formation of in situ
composites requires extensional deformation, the
fibrils are highly oriented in one direction, leading
to materials having highly anisotropic mechanical
properties.  Methods for reducing the mechanical
anisotropy of in situ composites are also studied.  The
desire to reduce the mechanical anisotropy leads to
pregeneration of LCP fibrils using a novel dual
extrusion technique.  The materials containing the
pregenerated microfibrils, referred to as
microcomposites, are then processed at temperatures
where the LCP fibrils are not melted, and the
mechanical   anisotropy of injection-molded
microcomposites is reduced.  The report covers research
concerned with the in situ composites, the process for
generating the microcomposites, and the results of the
processing studies.

FERROCENE POLYMERS HAVING POLYANILINE BACKBONES
[960103]

This (University of Pennsylvania) paper deals with
ferrocene polymers having polyaniline backbones.
Adding either aniline or m-phenylenediamine to one of
the cyclopentadienyl rings of ferrocene permits polymer
film formation by oxidative electropolymerization of
these side groups in acetonitrile solution.  The
monomers are prepared by reacting
N, N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide and the
appropriate amine in refluxing water.  A variety of
substituted aniline compounds have been synthesized to
demonstrate that polymer film formation most likely
occurs by a head-to-tail coupling of the aniline
moieties.  The electrochemistry of the
polymer-film-coated electrode in supporting electrolyte
only displays well-defined responses for the ferrocene
portion of the polymer, and is not complicated by
voltammetric responses of the supposed polyaniline
backbone.  These films are stable, with continuous
potential cycling showing less than 5% diminution in
the oxidative and reductive currents over 50 repetitive
scans.  (This 1991 journal paper was recently made
available as a reprint.)

STATUS OF RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND APPLICATIONS OF
BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS AND PLASTICS IN JAPAN [960104]

This (Loyola College) report concerns a fact-finding
team of American scientists and engineers that visited
Japan to assess the status of research and development
and applications involving biodegradable polymers.  The
team met with representatives of 31 universities,
government ministries and institutes, companies, and
associations.  Japan's national program on
biodegradable polymers and plastics evaluates new
technologies, testing methods, and potential markets
for biodegradables.  The program is coordinated by the
Biodegradable Plastics Society of Japan, which seeks to
achieve world leadership in biodegradable polymer
technology and identify commercial opportunities for
exploiting this technology.

The team saw no major new technology breakthroughs.
Japanese scientists and engineers are focusing on:
natural polymers from renewable resources; synthetic
polymers; and bacterially-produced polymers such as
polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(amino acids), and
polysaccharides.  The major polymers receiving
attention are: the Zeneca PHBV copolymers; Biopol(tm);
poly(lactic acid) from several sources;
polycaprolactone; and the new synthetic polyester,
Bionolle(tm) from Showa High Polymer.  In their present
state of development, these polymers all have major
deficiencies that inhibit their acceptance for
large-scale applications.

THE KINETICS OF SOL-GEL SiO2 SYNTHESIS REACTIONS:
RECENT PROGRESS [960105]

This (University of Minnesota) paper deals with recent
progress in the study of the kinetics of sol-gel SiO2
synthesis reactions.  Sol-gel ceramic synthesis has
drawn much interest in recent years.  In production,
1-5 organometallic molecules, usually metal alkoxides,
are polymerized in an alcohol/water solution with
dissolved acids or bases to form a ceramic or glass
material having exquisite chemical and microstructural
control.  Since the chemistry and microstructure of the
solid determine its properties, this technology can be
used to design materials having specified mechanical,
optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties.
These  materials  may  be monoliths, films, fibers, or
powders.  Sol-gel synthesis offers a degree of control
of composition and structure at the molecular level
that is unachievable with traditional sintering or
precipitation methods.  It also offers an economical
alternative to layered vapor deposition manufacture of
coatings and fibers.  Owing to their controlled
chemistry and microstructure, sol-gel ceramics can be
densified at much lower temperatures than conventional
sintering temperatures, thereby saving energy and
protecting delicate structures in the material itself
or in its substrates.  The microstructure can also be
controlled to produce optical films, catalyst supports,
monolithic ceramic bodies, etc.  Since the precursor
molecules are pure and dissolved, atomic placement and
bonding can be controlled in order to `tune' the
mechanical/optical properties.

GELCASTING OF SINTERED REACTION-BONDED SILICON NITRIDE
[960106]

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) paper deals with
gelcasting of silicon metal for the production of
sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN), which
is investigated in order to identify associated
advantages over conventional forming techniques (i.e.,
die and isostatic pressing).  Compacts are formed from
identical powder mixtures by both gelcasting and
pressing, and are nitrided and sintered to produce
SRBSN ceramics.  The characterization of the samples
include measurement of: green density; green and
nitrided pore structure; weight gain during
nitridation; final density; microstructure; toughness;
and flexural strength.  It is found that a more uniform
pore structure exists in the green gelcast samples, and
it is believed that this pore configuration aids in
nitridation and manifests itself in a more uniform
final microstructure.  In addition, improved mechanical
properties are achieved in the gelcast samples.  These
improvements are attributed to green microstructure
homogeneity.

BILATERAL U.S./RUSSIAN WORKSHOP ON SELF-PROPAGATING
HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS PROCESSES [960107]

This (New York State College of Ceramics) report
summarizes the Bilateral US/Russian Workshop on
Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis
(Nov. 6-7, 1993, Honolulu, Hawaii).  The workshop
focused on both fundamental and applied aspects of the
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS)
process.  The goal was to identify and suggest
approaches to remedy the generally acknowledged gaps
that exist in our detailed quantitative understanding
of the essential chemistry and physics of the SHS
process.  The applied topics focussed on the rather
more practical aspects of the SHS process, in order to
help prioritize the fundamental studies in such a way
that our enhanced understanding leads to improved
SHS-based advanced materials fabrication methods.  The
two topic areas are, of course, interrelated:
fundamental studies can enhance commercialization
potential, and technological market-driven needs can
suggest important fundamental  science-driven studies.
The workshop allowed many of the world's key, presently
active, SHS researchers to discuss the state-of-the-art
and remaining work of SHS research, and to initiate
meaningful collaborative research projects between U.S.
and Russian scientists.

ORGANIC-INORGANIC COMPOSITES [960108]

One of the most important recent advances in the
ceramics area is the introduction of preparative
techniques heavily based on chemical reactions, for
example the generation of ceramic-type materials by the
hydrolysis of an organometallic compound.  A typical,
and important reaction of this type is the acid- or
base-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS): Si(OC2H5)4 + 2H2O ---> SiO2 + 4C2H5OH.  The
formed gel is dried to remove unreacted TEOS, ethanol,
water, and catalyst (which is generally chosen to be
volatile).  It is then fired into a porous ceramic,
which may then be densified into the final ceramic
object.

There are numerous advantages for generating ceramics
in this way, including: increased purity; lower
processing temperatures (permitting survival of organic
guest molecules); control of ultrastructure (at the
nanometer level); the possibility of adding a new
material to the pores prior to densification; and the
relative ease in preparing ceramic alloys.  This
(University of Cincinnati) paper present a review of
organic-inorganic composites, consisting in large part
of descriptions of how some of these ideas can be
extended using concepts from the area of polymer
chemistry.  The modifications are generally carried out
by having the polymer chains terminated with functional
groups that can participate in the ceramic-generating
reaction.  This permits intimate bonding between the
inorganic (ceramic) phase and the organic (polymer)
phase, in a way that is most likely to give novel
mechanical properties.

EVOLUTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND MODELS
[960110]

Risk, the all-encompassing four-letter word, became a
widely used household cliche and an institutional
mantra in the nineties.  Risk analysis models have made
a number of sharp paradigm shifts to evolve itself as a
decision-making tool from individual risk perception to
societal risk-based regulatory media.  Risk always
coexists with benefit and is arbitrated by costs.
Risk-benefit analysis has been in use in business and
industry in economic ventures for a long time.  Only
recently, risk management in its current state of
development evolved as a regulatory tool for
controlling large technological systems that have
potential impacts on the health and safety of the
public and on the sustainability of the ecology and the
environment.

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) paper
summarizes the evolution of risk management concepts
and models in industry and the regulatory agencies in
the U.S. over the last three decades.  It also
discusses the benefits and limitations of this evolving
discipline as it is applied to high-risk technologies,
from the nuclear power plant and petrochemical
industry, etc., to nuclear weapons technology.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO ELEMENTAL IMAGING IN 3-DIMENSIONS
[960113]

This (Sandia National Laboratories) report concerns the
feasibility of a radically different method of using
x-ray excited x-ray fluorescence to perform two- and
three-dimensional elemental imaging at the
micrometer-size scale.  The proposed new approach is
investigated using both laboratory and synchrotron
x-ray sources.   Investigations center around the use
of two different types of monochromators and a CCD
detector, to allow the imaging of characteristic
excited x-radiation in two dimensions, one element at a
time.  The goal of this approach is to be able to
obtain three-dimensional images in a similar way as is
now possible using x-ray tomographic microscopy
methods.  Unfortunately, after considerable research it
was not possible to obtain sufficient signal using
either x-ray source, and the project was terminated.
However, it is possible that the advent of more intense
synchrotron x-ray sources could allow this technique to
be used for certain restricted applications.  The
results obtained here indicate that, without some
further breakthrough, it is unlikely that a practical
instrument could result from this approach.

ANALYSIS OF PARTICLE FILTRATION USING THE METHOD OF
VOLUME AVERAGING [960114]

This (University of California) report presents and
discusses analysis of the process of filtration of
non-charged submicron particles, using the method of
volume averaging.  The particle continuity equation is
represented in terms of the first correction to the
Smoluchowski equation that takes into account particle
inertia effects for small Stokes numbers.  This leads
to a cellular efficiency that contains a minimum in the
efficiency as a function of the particle size, and this
allows identification of the most penetrating particle
size.  Comparison of the theory with results from
Brownian dynamics indicates that the first correction
to the Smoluchowski equation gives reasonable results
in terms of both the cellular efficiency and the most
penetrating particle size.  However, the results for
larger particles clearly indicate the need to extend
the Smoluchowski equation to include higher order
corrections.  Comparison of the theory with laboratory
experiments, in the absence of adjustable parameters,
provides interesting agreement for particle diameters
that are equal to or less than the diameter of the most
penetrating particle.

BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSING OF GEOTHERMAL BRINES AND SLUDGES
[960115]

Development of cost-efficient biochemical processes for
the treatment of geothermal brines and sludges has led
to the identification of several options that allow the
conversion of geothermal wastes into useful products.
A laboratory-scale pilot plant operating in a batch
mode has been constructed and used to extract and
recover toxic and valuable metals and metal salts from
geothermal residues.  Metal extraction and recovery
efficiencies of better than 80% per 5-25 hour treatment
cycles are achieved.  The new technology is versatile
and can be applied to brines and sludges derived from
hypersaline as well as low salinity resources.  The
biochemical processes: can be integrated with existing
facilities; allow recycling options; and yield revenue
generating feedstocks and waste volume reduction.
Selected versions of this technology are now being
readied for field trials.  This paper (from Brookhaven
National Laboratory) presents and discusses recent
advances and the current status of this emerging new
technology.

NANOSCALE METALLIC MULTILAYERS [960122]

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) paper
concerns the development of nanoscale multilayer
structures, which is being driven by a wide range of
commercial applications that require enhanced material
behaviors.  Innovations in physical vapor deposition
technologies, in particular magnetron sputtering, have
enabled the synthesis of metallic-based structures
having nanoscaled layer dimensions as small as
one-to-two monolayers.  The parameters used in the
deposition process are paramount to the formation of
these small layer dimensions and the stability of the
structure.  Therefore, optimization of the desired
material properties must be related to assessment of
the actual microstructure.  Characterization techniques
such as x-ray diffraction and high resolution
microscopy are useful to reveal the interface and layer
structure, whether ordered or disordered, crystalline,
amorphous, compostionally abrupt or graded, and/or
lattice strained.  The paper emphasizes experimental
studies of mechanical properties, and reviews
techniques for synthesis of metallic multilayers having
subnanometric layers, with applications based on
enhancing such material behaviors as reflectivity and
magnetic anisotropy.

PROCESSES FOR MAKING HIGH-RESOLUTION LARGE-SCALE
MEASUREMENTS [960124]

This (Wright Laboratory) report deals with
high-resolution large-scale measurements.  As spatial
resolution of any measurement process increases, the
amount of data per unit area (or volume) increases.
This leads to huge amounts of data and/or long
measurement times when attempting to map small spatial
variations in material properties over large spatial
dimensions.  It is, therefore, desirable to develop
techniques so that high-resolution information can be
obtained while maintaining the ability to cover large
areas without being overwhelmed by measurement time or
data.  The report discusses the issues involved, and
seeks to formulate and advocate strategies that could
guide such endeavors.

SYSTEMATIC MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE BETTER
DECISIONS INVOLVING SOFTWARE-INTENSIVE SYSTEMS [960125]

Systematic measurement develops timely and meaningful
information by quantifying the software system's
development process and the product's technical
performance.  It includes the collection, analysis, and

systematic measurement technology to help management
make better decisions in developing software-intensive
systems.  It presents the principles of quantitative

USING MEDIUM-ENERGY PARTICLE SCATTERING FOR
CHARACTERIZING SURFACES [960126]

Ion scattering is a versatile tool for characterizing
surfaces, and is generally regarded to be
nondestructive to most inorganic materials although the
electrical properties of the sample are usually
altered.  This (Vanderbilt University) paper discusses
recently developed scattering techniques, using
time-of-flight particle detection, that work well with
ions whose energies are at least an order of magnitude
lower than those required for conventional analyses.
This reduction in the ion beam energy makes possible
novel measurements, such as characterization of thin
films on polymer substrates, and enhanced capabilities
such as improved sensitivity for trace element
detection.  The energy resolution of the time of flight
detector has made possible thin film thickness
measurements on semiconductors and optical devices.

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF MOLECULAR MOTION USING TAILOR-MADE
OPTICAL FIELDS [960127]

The overall objective of this (Princeton University)
research is to establish the physical principles for
achieving control over molecular motion through the
introduction of tailor-made optical fields.  The effort
involves basic theoretical developments as well as
selected applications.  Emphasis is given to
establishing the robustness of laser field designs to
various inevitable uncertainties and errors that may
arise.  An entirely new algorithm, based on quantum
mechanical tracking, is introduced as a basis for a
comprehensive treatment for molecular control, as well
as the inversion of controlled dynamics to learn about
the underlying Hamiltonians.  A fundamental
controllability algorithm is established that can
assess whether it is feasible to reach acceptable
degrees of control in any particular molecule.

USING LASERS IN MICROELECTRONIC AND MICROMECHANIC
FABRICATION [960128]

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
concerns the application of lasers to microelectronic
and micromechanic fabrication.  Over the last few
years, vigorous research activity has been directed to
laser processing for microfabrication.  The new
techniques that have emerged are motivated by
possibilities ranging from achievement of a 0.15 micron
optical lithography, to development of entirely
nonlithographic laser direct writing methods for
circuit prototyping and postfabrication (final step)
processing.  The technology is poised as a simpler,
faster, and less expensive alternative to x-ray,
electron, or ion-beam lithography for fabricating next
generation VLSI.  It would make methods available for
interactive circuit design, multichip modules, and 3-D
micromechanics.

A NOVEL NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION TECHNIQUE USING
PULSED ULTRASOUND AND NEURAL NETWORKS [960132]

A novel nondestructive evaluation technique that uses
the spectral signature of a pulsed ultrasound signal to
identify metals had recently been abandoned because of
the difficulty in interpreting the results.
Traditional analysis was inconvenient to apply to this
type of problem because of the complicated, noisy, and
incomplete nature of the data.  This (Army Armament
Research, Development, and Engineering Center) report
details the application of neural networks to the
technique, to provide a radically different approach to
computation.  These massively parallel neural network
systems provide a mechanism to extract pertinent
information from input data while maintaining a high
degree of fault tolerance.  The report discusses the
design of a neural network system capable of accepting
data from nondestructive test equipment and producing
output relative to the quality of the sample being
tested.

SCANNING X-RAY DIFFRACTION: A TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING
PHASE FORMATION IN CO-DEPOSITED THIN FILMS [960134]

Investigating the formation of new metastable phases in
alloy thin films requires ways of quickly determining
the crystalline structure of samples having different
compositions.  This (Argonne National Laboratory) paper
presents a novel technique for acquiring structural
information from films intentionally grown with a
composition gradient.  Binary metal alloy films are
deposited using a phase-spread sputtering method.
Using a narrow incident x-ray beam and a translating
sample stage, combined with a position-sensitive x-ray
detector technique, detailed information on the
metastable phase diagram is rapidly obtained.  Results
from studies of phase formation in Zr-Ta alloys are
presented, and extensions of the analysis technique to
ternary systems are discussed.

THE DEFORMATION OF THIN LUBRICANT FILMS [960135]

This (Georgia Institute of Technology) report concerns
boundary lubrication, elastohydrodynamic lubrication,
and the dependency of the friction coefficient upon
load and sliding velocity.  The coefficient of friction
in concentrated contact is often dealt with as a
disposable parameter in numerical analyses.  Boundary
and elastohydrodynamic lubrication have been recognized
as separate regimes of concentrated contact lubrication
since the EHD solution of Ertel-Grubin.  Delineation of
these regimes is nearly always based on the magnitude
of the film thickness relative to surface roughness,
rather than a transition in friction.

ADVANCED POLYMER-MATRIX COMPOSITES: CHARACTERIZATION OF
NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR [960136]

Due to the presence of curing stresses and oriented
crystalline structures in the matrix of polymer-matrix
fiber composites, the in situ nonlinear properties of
the matrix are expected to be different from those of
the bulk resin.  This (NASA) report discusses a plane
stress micromechanical model to retrieve the in situ
elastic-plastic properties of (Narmco 5260 and Amoco
8320) matrices from the measured elastic-plastic
properties of (IM7/5260 and IM7/8320) advance
composites.  In the micromechanical model, the fiber is
assumed to be orthotropically elastic and the matrix to
be orthotropic in elastic and plastic properties.

LIGHTWEIGHT TITANIUM-BASE ALLOYS [960138]

This (McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories) report
concerns the development of new titanium alloys having
10% lower density, 50% higher elastic moduli, and 50%
higher strength than Ti-6Al-4V, and a 150 C increase in
service temperature above that of Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo.
The feasibility of adding significant amounts of Be,
Li, and Mg to Ti-base alloys to effect these
improvements is discussed.  Rapid solidification
processing is employed to obtain extended solid
solutions of Be concentrations far exceeding the limits
indicated by the equilibrium phase diagram.  Master
alloys of Ti-Al-Be and Ti-V-Al-Be are produced by
melting pieces of Lockalloy (60 wt% Be-40 wt% Al) and
elemental additions, in a BeO-wash-coated alumina
crucible, and casting at 1450 C into a chilled mold.
Powder is produced by melting the master alloys in an
uncoated graphite crucible, initiating metal flow at
1300 C, and dispersing the stream by centrifugal
atomization.  (This 1989 report was only recently
released for public use.)

WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST ISSUE OF INSIDE NIST!  

     We believe you will find INSIDE NIST an indispensable tool and an
important resource as you do business with this exciting agency. While
NIST is undergoing some budget challenges, its core programs remain as
vital as ever.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), a major budget player who
oversees NIST funds in the House of Representatives, has made a
commitment to the continued growth of the core programs.  While it is
still too early to tell definitively, it also looks as though the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Malcolm Baldrige Award will
move forward and grow.  Questions still remain about the fate of the
Advanced Technology Program, however, and INSIDE NIST will keep you
posted on all new developments.
     Our mission with INSIDE NIST is to provide you with the inside
track on how to win more contracts from NIST's programs, and on how to
profit from its ongoing standards development.  We want you to use
INSIDE NIST as your "inside source" for the activities of this dynamic
agency.  
     Now, here's the news:

ATP FUNDS ZEROED OUT OF FISCAL 1996 HOUSE MONEY BILL

     NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP) will not receive federal
funding beginning Oct. 1, according to legislation approved by the
House Appropriations Commerce Subcommittee.  ATP funding had ramped up
to $340 million in the current fiscal year.  In attempting to kill the
program, the subcommittee said such funds should more appropriately
come from private industry. 
     Zeroing out ATP accounted for most of the reduction in funds NIST
will suffer in fiscal 1996 if the House bill is approved.  Funds would
be slashed from $763.8 million to $404 million.  Every other NIST
initiative, including the core programs (known as the Scientific and
Technical Research Services or STRS), the Manufacturing Extension
Partnership (MEP) and the Malcolm Baldrige Award, apparently will
advance.                                                              
     NIST continues to promote ATP to industry, even though NIST
officials know that ATP funding could be eliminated.  (See related
story, p. 5.)  A revised ATP competition has a solicitation deadline
of Sept. 12, less than three weeks before all ATP funds are set to
expire.  A NIST official told us the Congres-sional budget process is
of long duration and that ATP funds could yet be reinstated. 
     ATP funds amounting to $187 million that were not used in fiscal
1994 may be used to help close out ATP initiatives begun before Oct.
1, 1994.  ATP programs begun after that date may not receive any
additional funds.  
     Commerce Secretary Ron Brown reacted angrily to the news of ATP's
demise in the bill by noting that the elimination of ATP "is
unacceptable."  Brown also expressed unhappiness about "deep
reductions" in NIST funding, although a House Appropriations
Subcommittee staff member said funding would be about the same in
fiscal 1996 as in fiscal 1995.  A NIST official said his understanding
was that the mark would be reduced from $90.6 million to about $81
million.
     There was no mention of Baldrige Award funding in the
appropriations bill but NIST officials are confident it will be
included as part of STRS.  If that is the case, the NIST breakout in
fiscal 1996 is as follows: $263 million (NIST Labs including
Baldrige), $81 million for MEP and $60.1 million for construc-
tion/renovation of NIST research facilities.

CRIPPLING RESCISSION BILL NOW EXPECTED TO BECOME LAW   

     A rescission bill that knocks back NIST funds in a variety of
areas in the current fiscal year now is expected to be signed into law
by President Clinton in the near future.  Clinton earlier had vetoed
the measure for reasons unrelated to NIST program funding.
     The cutbacks include $17 million for NIST's Scientific and
Technical Research Services (STRS), $15.7 million for the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and $30 million for the
construction/renovation program.
     The cutbacks would detrimentally impact a NIST solicitation
issued June 8 for non-profit agencies to submit proposals for new MEP
centers.  NIST had promised $41 million for such proposals.  The
number of centers and funding will now be cut back as the result of
the rescission, according to NIST spokesman Mike Newman.     
     "[This legislation] hurts our move to make the labs self-funded,
not to be as dependent on outside funding," according to Newman.  In
the past, a good portion of funding has come from other federal
agencies. 
     "We want to take the lead in technical emphasis on activities at
our lab," concurred NIST spokesman Mat Heyman.  Such outside emphasis
"skews your operation," continued Heyman.  "The [other funding agency]
does what it wants with [the results]."
     Funding for the construction program would almost be halved, from
$64 million to $34 million.  "Priorities are going to have to be
shifted quite a bit," the spokesman said.  "It's pretty drastic."
     The House already has passed the revised rescission measure but
the Senate has yet to act.  However, the Senate is expected to approve
the bill after it returns from the July 4 congressional recess.
     The Appropriations Subcommittee markup actually represents a
reprieve for MEP.  The House Science Committee approved legislation
that does not include ATP or MEP.  An amendment to that legislation,
which was approved by the full committee last week, would not preclude
funds for ATP and MEP.  (While actual funds come through the
appropriations process, the new Republican Congress is attempting to
address authorizing bill concerns in that process.)

  ...Morella Guards Core Programs at Expense of ATP and MEP

     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.), whose district includes NIST-
Gaithersburg, authorized legislation June 15 that would allow $273
million to go to STRS and Baldrige.  She rightly indicated at that
time that the appropriators may add funds for MEP.  It is interesting
to note that the programs Morella did not include funding for were
those that would have the least impact on jobs in her own district.
     In fact, the agency thinks it can make the cuts without loss of
jobs, according to Newman, although he acknowledged that staff
cutbacks do constitute "one possibility."  One unwanted but necessary
remedy may be furloughs to keep costs down and jobs intact.      
     Morella claimed that her hands were tied as the result of a
budget resolution.  In order for the authorizing committee to have any
impact on the appropriations committee mark-up, it would have to fall
within those caps, she told the subcommittee. 
     "If it were possible, I think you all know that my preference
would be to fully fund every NIST function," Morella said.  "However,
given our commitment to balance the budget, that simply cannot be the
reality."
     "We do not have the budget to fund ATP and MEP, in addition to
the core scientific work being done at the NIST laboratories," Morella
intoned.  "NIST core programs must be a priority." 
     Associated with saving STRS is continuation of a strong lab
construction and renovation program, according to Morella.  "Without
the necessary renovation and construction of facilities, NIST will
simply not be able to adequately fulfill its basic mission in the
future," she said. 
     Democrats on the Science Subcommittee bitterly fought the
legislation.  Rep. John Tanner (D-Tenn.), ranking minority member,
offered an amendment that would have increased funds to $754.2
million.  That was defeated by a vote breaking down along party lines. 
Tanner's amendment would have approved $330 million for ATP and
bolstered funding for MEP to $130.6 million. 
     The Appropriations Subcommittee did not have specific breakouts
by NIST labs, according to a staffer there.  Morella's authorizing
subcommittee included the following figures: 

     *  Electronics and Electrical Engineering Lab ($39.6 million); 
     *  Manufacturing Engineering ($19.6 million); 
     *  Chemical Science and Technology ($28.1 million); 
     *  Physics ($28.1 million); 
     *  Material Science and Engineering ($54.3 million); 
     *  Building and Fire Research ($13.5 million); 
     *  Computer Systems ($30.7 million); 
     *  Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing ($11 million); 
     *  Technical Assistance ($19.1 million); and 
     *  Research Support ($28.2 million).     

     The Morella legislation also would allow for the expansion of
NIST's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) from 9 to 15
members; authorize a NIST metro shuttle; increase the cap on the NIST
postdoctoral fellows program; give excess scientific equipment to
secondary schools; raise the cap on the 
number of winners of the Baldrige quality awards from two to four; and
allow NIST to extend its Personnel Demonstration Project.
     The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to meet July
11, followed by a full House vote.  The process then begins in the
Senate, followed by conferencing the two bills.
     NIST officials believe there will be more of a fight in the
Senate to restore some funds for ATP.  Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.)
has said he will fight for both ATP and MEP.  No Republican senator is
yet on record as supporting either program, however, a NIST official
acknowledged.
     ATP was originally slated for elimination in the Republican
Party's Contract with America.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), chairman
of the House Science Committee and vice-chairman of the House Budget
Committee, has threatened to kill ATP from the beginning of the
congressional term.

  ...Unfavorable GAO Report Further Hurts ATP's Efforts

     These efforts were further boosted by a General Accounting Office
(GAO) report originally commissioned and released June 15 by former
House Science Committee Chairman Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.) which
says that attempts to measure the success of ATP are not accurately
stated.  NIST officials have attempted to show that ATP is already
paying dividends for the American taxpayer as an argument to continue
the program.   
     GAO charged that NIST incorrectly overstated the results.  In
four instances, it found, results were overstated or lacked adequate
support.  Walker charged that "one can open up nearly any page of the
GAO report and find evidence that Advanced Technology Program is
exactly the wrong way to advance U.S. competitiveness." 
     The action on ATP comes following efforts to rally support for
the program among involved industries.  Brown has actively called for
business--particularly the small business community--to lobby for the
program.

BOULDER GIVEN BACK-OF-THE-BUS STATUS ON CONSTRUCTION/RENOVATION PLANS

     The original construction and renovation plans for NIST talked of
equally helping the Gaithersburg, Md., and Boulder, Colo., campuses,
but as money becomes more of an issue it is clear that the
Gaithersburg headquarters, which is in Rep. Connie Morella's (D-Md.)
home district, is first among equals.
     "One hundred percent of our efforts are going to Gaithersburg in
fiscal years 1995 and 1996," NIST Associate Director Samuel Kramer
said at a recent briefing on the plans, which falls under the rubric
Capital Improvements Facilities Program (CIFP).  
     That is despite the fact that Boulder labs are as old or in some
cases older than the Gaithersburg facilities.  Like Gaithersburg,
Boulder is slated to have a state-of-the-art Advanced Technology Lab
(ATL) built on its campus.
     Despite the similarity of the ATL name to NIST's Advanced
Technology Program (ATP), Kramer attempted to distance the new lab
from the technology program, whose funding is now being threatened. 
     "They are two different things," Kramer said.  "The ATL is an
intramural research program which will address the core activities of
the Lab."  In contrast, the ATP "is an extramural program which has a
separate mission."
     The Gaithersburg ATL, costing from $115 million-$130 million,
will be "the world's most advanced technology lab," Kramer said.  "We
have looked at labs throughout the world, and this facility will be
the best," he told the briefing.
     The new Gaithersburg ATL will be over 31,000 gross square meters. 
The facility will be only one story high.  The metrology labs will
exist underground.  Due to budget considerations, NIST had to adjust
its original estimate for the program downward from more than $1
billion to $540 million.  "We had to cut the budget request to address
early technical obsolescence," Kramer said.

  ...Disruption To Be a Key Concern

     There will be disruption as the result of the construction at the
NIST Gaithersburg campus, and the agency already has made plans to
rent nearby space, known as "NIST North," to accommodate displaced
employees.  Jorge Urrutia, NIST director of administration, told us
there are plans for as many as 540 displacements, but noted that it is
unclear exactly how many will be impacted.
     For example, the Physics Lab, where sensitive experiments are
undertaken, is located next to a major construction area.  "We are
asking [the construction crew] not to do certain things at certain
times--such as drive piles or use earth-moving equipment--but there is
no doubt there will be a loss of productivity in these areas," Urrutia
said.
     At a facility where subatomic particles are measured, it is
unclear how well clean rooms will be able to operate during
construction.  Vibration will also no doubt constitute a major
problem.
     An Advanced Chemical Sciences Lab (ACSL) also is being
constructed as part of the program.  Construction is set to begin in
June 1996, with occupancy expected in May 1998.  With regard to ATL,
construction also is expected to begin next June, with occupancy by
October 1999.  Both schedules may be impacted by budget reductions.
     The existing chemistry lab, which Kramer said has deteriorated
faster than other campus facilities, will be renovated at some point,
although Kramer said it is not a priority item.
     NIST now is building a materials processing lab, largely to
recycle material, at a cost of approximately $1 million.

FAILING ATP CIME PROGRAM REEMERGES AS TIMA

   A former NIST ATP focus program that yielded only one award in
response to its first solicitation has been recast and rebid. 
Technologies for the Integration of Manufacturing Applications (TIMA)
has replaced Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics (CIME).
     A Proposer's Conference on TIMA held June 20 at NIST-
Gaithersburg's Green Auditorium stated the new technical goal is
"creating a cost-effective, plug-&-play real-time manufacturing
execution software environment for discrete manufacturing."  Sought-
after characteristics include integratability, configurability,
adaptability, extensibility and reliability.
     NIST officials say that a particular emphasis will be on
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), which bridge the gap between
high-level management systems and factory-floor-control systems.  MES
applications link business and manufacturing systems, tracking a job
on the shop floor in near-real time.
     A total of $18 million in current-year funding is available to
fund the first TIMA awards, according to NIST officials.  Full project
proposals are due Sept. 12.
     A variety of flaws were cited among the proposals that originally
were submitted to receive CIME funding, according to a paper released
last month by NIST's Amy Knutilla (knutilla+cme.nist.gov).  Of the
original 15 proposals, representatives from six proposals were invited
to NIST for oral review.  Those boiled down to only one award.
     "There were no major trends in strengths or weaknesses of the
proposals," said Knutilla.  Were the results consistent with other ATP
proposals, the failure would have come in the original
conceptualization of the idea or in the too-harsh evaluation of the
proposals, one source observed.
     However, Knutilla also found that "most of the proposals made
only a high-level, cursory attempt to address some of the ATP
criteria, with some proposals completely neglecting some criteria." 
Other damning features included "excessive use of industry buzzwords,"
"low technical risk," the naming of partners without commitments from
those partners, providing "an unclear discussion on the potential
technical leverage of [the] proposal," lack of a management plan, and 
little experience with CIME. (For more information, contact Barbara
Goldstein at 301/975-2304 or e-mail to goldstein+eeel.nist.gov)

NIST SPOKESMAN: CLASSIFIED AREAS FEW 

   NIST officials denied pervasive rumors that the agency still
derives a significant amount of its budget to perform classified
activity.
     There is almost nothing being done in the classified area,
according to NIST Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.
     "There are probably a few, but there are probably only a very few
[classified activities]," qualified NIST spokesman Mike Newman.  He
would not go further.
     Both reacted with some anger to a report that linked NIST Deputy
Director Ray Kammer to a large classified program undertaken with the
National Security Agency (NSA).  While Heyman acknowledged that NIST
was involved with classified parts of Clipper Chip, an NSA program, he
said the overall impact when compared to other NIST activities is
"very tiny."
     When asked if "a fair amount" of activities at NIST are
classified, Newman responded, "That's garbage.  There may be some
projects that we are doing with the military that may have some
classified elements, but most of the research area is unclassified."

UNDERSTANDING METALLIC DENDRITES STIMULATES NIST RESEARCHERS

   NIST metallurgists housed on the first floor of the Materials
Building in Gaithersburg are gaining insight into dendrites, literally
"tree-like" forms created when metals become solidified. 
     Dr. William Boettinger showed INSIDE NIST editor C. David Chaffee
some of the metallic formations under microscope at his lab recently. 
Such studies are serving as the building blocks of metallic alloys
that can have any number of extreme properties.  One is an engine
turbine that only will melt at about 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
     Boettinger observes that dendrites also are common in snowflakes
and in ceramics.  They have a freezing or solidification point well
above that of water and often do not have a liquid phase.  Thus, they
can remain in "frozen" form to thousands of degrees Fahrenheit.  "When
people think of something in freezing terms, they think of water,"
Boettinger tells us.  "The metallurgist does not think of freezing in
those terms."
     When asked what eventual practical applications the understanding
of these patterns will have, Boettinger notes, "At this point, it's
like trying to tell a skier that patterns on each of the snowflakes on
his lift are important." However, skiers do understand that snow can
come in different forms, such as light powders and heavy, wet snow. 
     Boettinger has joined with James Warren, a NIST physicist, to
study the transition of these metals from vapor or liquid to solid. 
Controlling this solidification is a fundamental goal of the
metallurgist.  The two men are working to further describe this
simulation using computer equipment.
     The alloy that Boettinger demonstrated under the microscope had
white spots that he said are regions of high concentration of
impurities.  These white spots are brittle particles that can lead to
premature failure of the casting.
     Specifically, Warren and Boettinger developed a comprehensive
phase-field model for solving heat and solute diffusion equations
during solidification that avoids tracking the liquid-solid interface. 
Their work has been written up in Nature and Computational Science &
Engineering.   

     More Inside The Corridors items:
     Appropriate for the Fourth of July, NIST's Gaithersburg library
was displaying how NIST scientists helped to preserve and restore the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  The original
documents had been deteriorating before they were able to turn things
around.  The library now sports a "Welcome to the Virtual NIST
Library" computer screen to entrants, upon which a widescreen home
page of the NIST virtual library is displayed.

     Much of last month's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology
(VCAT) meeting in Boulder had to do with the recently completed
Delivering Results, a testimonial from industry on NIST programs.  A
meeting discussion point was how NIST is tracking the effectiveness of
its programs.  Now chaired by Bob Hermann of United Technologies, VCAT
represented a "routine review of what we are doing," according to NIST
Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.  Most of NIST Director Arati
Prabhakar's presentation dealt with the budget situation.  Biotech
Professor George Whitesides of Harvard University made a presentation
and NIST officials tried to see what similarities are ongoing between
his program and that of NIST.  A tour of NIST-Boulder's physics lab
was included.

STATE PROGRAMS BLAMED FOR DIMINISHED BALDRIGE INTEREST

    The Malcolm Baldrige Award program is receiving a lower number of
applications than it has in the past in part because it is now
"competing with state, local and regional programs that have sprung up
[which are] based on the Baldrige Award," according to NIST spokesman
Mike Newman.  "People are competing for [the state] awards first
before they go to Baldrige," he added.
     Companies are also more likely now to be preoccupied with other
things--such as satisfying International Standards Organization
standards and competing abroad.  "They are still interested in
improving their quality, but they are not specifically looking to
apply for the Baldrige Award," Newman said.
     The spokesman observed that the agency continues to mail hundreds
of thousands of criteria for the Baldrige Award.
     Approximately 30 states have established state quality awards
programs, most of which are modeled after the Baldrige Award.

  ...Program May Be Expanded to Include Four Categories

     NIST proponents are pushing to increase the number of categories
in which NIST awards are made annually from two to four.  The new
categories would include health care and education.
     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.) has included such a provision in
legislation approved by the House Science Committee.  NIST has
received applications from 65 health care and educational
organizations supporting such a move.
     Curt Reimann, director of the Baldrige Award program at NIST,
said the new programs could help the organizations improve
performance, facilitate communication and foster partnerships.

NIST SEES ITSELF PLAYING KEY ROLE IN INFOBAHN    

    NIST officials see the agency as playing a two-part role in the
development of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  In one
role, it is a "facilitator, keeper and conformance tester" for the
NII, according to information NIST has released. 
     This is buoyed by "funding high-risk industrial ventures,
performing laboratory research, helping smaller manufacturers apply
new technologies, and participating in policy and standards formation
to be sure the technologies are available for real-life applications
of the NII."
     In addition, NIST Director Arati Prabhakar participates in the
Department of Commerce's Information Infrastructure Task Force as
chairwoman of the Committee on Applications and Technology.  The
second part is more of an individual activity as opposed to a NIST
activity per se, the spokesman said.   
     At a recent meeting, directed by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, a
live video hook-up connected people in the auditorium with a submarine
off the coast of California, students in the Midwest and a classroom
in North Carolina.

CONGRESS TO REVIEW BELL ATLANTIC-TCI DEAL,
ADMINISTRATION POSITION UNCLEAR

The antitrust implications of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s proposed
acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media
Corp. will be scrutinized by House and Senate Committees in
the near future. What remains unclear is what posture the
Clinton administration's Justice Department, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) or the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) will take with regard to the vertical integration of
network and programming interests represented by the merger
of the telephone and cable giants.

The merger, which ranks among the largest in U.S. history,
presents a potential dilemma for the administration, which has
made a point of emphasizing the private sector's leading role in
the development and financing of a national information
infrastructure.  The reliance on the private sector to hasten
bringing the benefits of an interactive infrastructure to the
nation may run smack into the long-standing Democratic
dedication to tough enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws.

Vice President Al Gore, the administration's point man on the
"information superhighway", issued a cautious statement.  "The
Administration believes that rapid deployment of the
information infrastructure will create jobs, increase our standard
of living, and provide a wide range of services in areas such as
education, health care, and entertainment," he said.

The merger "demonstrates the intense private-sector interest in
the information infrastructure.  The Administration supports any
development in the communications marketplace that is pro-
competitive and fosters the development of an open, interactive
information infrastructure.  Subsequent formal reviews will
determine whether this proposal meets those goals," Gore said.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) said the proposed merger will speed
up the information superhighway, but at the same time, the
chairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee said
he was concerned that access to that kind of technology would
only be available to the rich.  The merger proposal leaves many
questions unanswered and "raises all kinds of bells and whistles,"
Markey told ITP in an interview.  "Will it (access to the
information superhighway) happen for everyone, or only the
well-to-do?" he asked.  Markey added that he did not want the
nation to become divided into "the information rich and the
information poor."

It is the government's role to set the policy for the national
communications infrastructure with the private sector taking the
lead in building that system, he said.  "But in setting that policy
we must make certain that everyone participates in the future,"
Markey added.  The real challenge will be to see "who gets what
and when," he said. Those questions were not answered in the
Oct. 13 press conference announcing the proposed merger,
Markey said.

Markey said his panel will hold a series of hearings to examine
the many issues surrounding the merger, including the antitrust
implications.  At the same time, he asked the FCC to start a
formal inquiry to "assess the potential technological and market
bottlenecks created by mergers, acquisitions, and alliances
among cable, telephone, and computer companies."

In an Oct. 13 letter to acting FCC Chairman James Quello,
Markey said the Bell Atlantic-TCI announcement is "just the
latest tremor signalling the shifting nature of the
communications marketplace."  Specifically, Markey said the
FCC inquiry should address:

whether any recently proposed industry mergers, acquisitions, or
alliances creates an organization or alliance that controls
sufficient market dominance to "choke competition and stunt
innovation" in any area of the new video marketplace.

how the merging of regional Bell Operating Companies and
cable companies affects the competition in the current video
market and in the future broad communications market.

whether there should be continued restrictions on telephone
companies owning or operating cable systems within their service
territory.

whether the government should take additional steps to ensure
open systems in the communications marketplace, paying
particular attention to potential bottlenecks in video software
and set-top boxes and in encryption and compression
technologies for satellite distribution of video programming, and,

whether the recently adopted vertical and horizontal limits on
concentration in the cable industry are adequate to protect
consumers and/or competitors.

Markey told ITP there is "no question" more mergers and
alliances between telecommunications companies would be
announced in the future. This is not necessarily good or bad, he
added, but urged quick completion of the inquiry, which he told
Quello was needed "to ensure that the emerging marketplace
remains open and accessible to all and that some of the deals
now being made or contemplated do not result in either closed
systems or anti-competitive practices."

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) said
"the question for consumers and competitors is whether such a
combination will open up new markets or technologies or simply
foreclose markets to current and potential entrants." Reserving
judgement on the competitive implication of the merger, Brooks
said that responsibility now rests with Assistant Attorney
General Anne Bingaman and her antitrust division.  Brooks said
he will monitor development "very closely" and consider the
implication of such mergers as he proceeds with his own
telecommunications legislation.

"Perhaps such integration is now a fact of life needed to deliver
the most innovative products to consumers.  But if that also
results in driving out creative small and mid-sized competitors,
we may all be the ultimate losers," Brooks said.

Reaction from Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-OH), chairman
of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, was not so measured.  He
"condemned" the proposed merger and called for hearings and
said he will urge Justice and the FTC to intervene.  "The TCI-
Bell Atlantic merger is a double whammy for consumers--they
could face overcharges for both cable TV and local phone
service," the statement said.  "Instead of lower prices from fierce
head-to-head competition between the phone and cable
companies, consumers are facing a mega-monster."

He warned of grave consequences if the merger is allowed to
continue.  "The more you concentrate programming and
economic power, the more you hurt consumers.  TCI, already a
giant in cable and programming, set its sights on expanding its
empire to the Home Shopping Network and now Paramount," he
said.  "Other industry giants like Viacom are also rejecting
competition in favor of combination.  The phone companies
promised us robust competition, but instead of trying to beat the
cable giants, they want to join them and consumers will be the
losers," Metzenbaum said.

Don Elder, a Federal Trade Commission spokesman, would
neither confirm nor deny the FTC is investigating the merger,
but noted that neither company is on its "early termination" list
of mergers and acquisitions given de facto approval.  The "early
termination" list is a daily report of business agreements the
FTC believes raise no antitrust issues.

By ITP's news deadline, neither Justice nor the FCC had a
reaction to the merger.  But some state regulators did.In Bell
Atlantic's home state of Pennsylvania, Vice Chairman of the
Public Utility Commission Joseph Rhodes Jr. viewed the
proposed merger with skepticism.  "In my opinion, Bell Atlantic
must prove to this commission that they can accomplish this
merger without divesting themselves of Bell of Pennsylvania," he
said.

"We have fought for years to determine if Bell of Pennsylvania
customers are unfairly subsidizing, for example, Bell Atlantic's
efforts at diversification such as its recently announced plans to
invest $1 billion in Mexico," he said.  "Bell Atlantic has fought
this audit at every juncture.  Imagine the difficulty we would
have to audit a merged Bell Atlantic-TCI.  Bell Atlantic
shareholders, not Bell of Pennsylvania ratepayers, should bear
the risk of this merger."

NIST SEEKS INDUSTRY VIEWS ON REVAMPING
ATP PROJECT-SELECTION PROCESS

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will
host a meeting Oct. 19 to solicit industry views on selecting
projects and establishing major program areas under the
Advance Technology Program (ATP). NIST Director Arati
Prabahkar and ATP Director George Uriano will be the
featured speakers at the meeting, which will be held at NIST
headquarters in Gaithersburg, Md.

With increased funding proposed in fiscal 1994 and the years
following, ATP will move from a pilot program to a full-fledged
civilian technology program.  The government is asking all
interested parties for their ideas for new program areas that
should be included in the ATP.  Since 1990, 60 projects have
been funded through ATP.  This does not include the projects
that will be funded this year with remaining monies for fiscal
1993, which ended Sept. 30.  That announcement, which could
include up to 30 projects, is likely before the end of the month,
a NIST official said.  ATP funding for FY-93 was $67.9 million.

At ITP's news deadline, House and Senate negotiators were
close to approving a budget for FY-94 that aides say will
probably reflect the $199.5 million proposed by the Clinton
administration.  The House earlier had cut the president's
request to $129 million (ITP, June 28, p. 1).  The
administration's intention is to ramp up the program by 275
percent until it reaches $750 million by FY-97.

The meeting with industry is the best avenue on getting ideas for
the best return on tax dollars, said a NIST spokesman.  "The
idea is to explain our intention to establish areas for more tightly
focused research and what the criteria shall be for selecting what
those program areas are," the spokesman said.  Program areas
would encompass a group of projects with a common feature
that works toward a specific technology or a business goal, he
explained.  Project proposals would still have to compete under
previously determined criteria published in the Federal Register
as part of the ATP project solicitation.  Ideas for program areas
will be accepted at any time, while proposals for specific projects
under the ATP could only be accepted in response to an ATP
solicitation, which last occurred in February.

Selection criteria for the program areas will also be discussed at
the meeting. In a notice for the meeting, NIST said it intends
the program areas to have "well-defined technology and
economic goals, and generally will require development of an
ensemble of complementary technologies."  The shift to focused
competitions centered around specific programs "will allow the
ATP to achieve greater benefits for the nation by concentrating
support on suites of interrelated technologies and reaping the
benefits of scale and synergism," according to the agency.

To register for the meeting, or to receive documents distributed
at the meeting after Oct. 19, contact the ATP office at 1-800-
micf.nist.gov, or by
facsimile at (301) 926-9524.

HOUSE SCIENCE PANEL READYING NEW MEASURE
TO SPUR DEVELOPMENT OF `GREEN' TECHNOLOGIES

The House Science Committee's proposed legislation on "green"
technology should be finalized and ready for introduction within
the next few weeks, according to committee sources.  And while
a previously circulated one-page outline of the proposal has been
rendered "obsolete," many key initiatives still remain on the
drawing board as the committee aims to craft legislation that
would encourage the development and adoption of green
technologies by the government and private sector.

Environmental, or "green" technologies include both the
traditional technologies for "pollution control and clean-up, as
well as `other' products and processes that provide significant
environmental and economic benefits," said Rep. Tim Valentine
(D-NC) chairman of the subcommittee on technology,
environment and aviation at an Oct. 5 hearing.  "It is this latter
group of technologies that has the potential for widespread
impact across many industries," Valentine said.

But now, with a renewed emphasis on the environment led by
top officials in the Clinton administration including Vice
President Al Gore, both government officials and representatives
of the private sector are calling for incentives for government-
public partnerships, financial incentives to develop new
technologies and relief from too stringent regulatory
requirements.  "Flexible, performance-based regulation that
stimulates innovation for both environmental and economic
benefits will have to be a collaborative exercise," said Pete
Howard, vice president of environmental affairs for Georgia-
Pacific Corp.

DETAILS OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION

At ITP's news deadline, committee members were still reviewing
each section of the proposed legislation, suggesting additions and
fine tuning other areas.  The "framework is still being cleaned
up," said one committee aide involved in drafting the legislation.
Also, the legislative language is being modified for consistency.
For example, this would eliminate any confusion over the terms
"green technology" and "environmental technology," the aide
said.

The proposed legislation is originating in the panel's
subcommittee on technology, environment and aviation.  The
legislation is expected to address:

Greater coordination among government agencies involved in
the development and adoption of green technologies;
establishing an Environment and Technology Clearinghouse; and
enhancing the capability for life cycle assessments of material
flows.

Greater emphasis on green technologies in existing programs;
establishing an Innovative Environmental Technologies Awards
Program; promoting the development of Environmental
Remediation and Monitoring Technology; establishing an
Industrial Integration Demonstration Project; and creating a
President's Total Environmental Quality Award.

Encouraging green technology projects in Small Business
Innovation Research grants; promoting the government as a
market to accelerate the development of green technologies;
evaluating the impact of regulatory practices on the contribution
of innovation to pollution prevention, control and remediation.

Promoting industry education and outreach; integrating
environmental sustainability issues into engineering education;
enhancing public knowledge of sustainable development through
the National Science Foundation.

Improving technical standards of environmental performance
and efficacy; providing guidelines for consumer claims.

Improving international assistance promoting green technologies;
establishing an International Environmental Technology Center;
enhancing export financing (steps the Clinton administration has
already begun); improving benchmarking; and clarifying the
potential for international green markets.

Partnerships between government and the private sector that
include risk sharing should be encouraged, said government and
private sector representatives at another recent congressional
hearing.  Representatives from both sides also called for
financial incentives and regulatory relief.

"We have started a dialogue with American companies who want
to collaborate to share the risks of technology development with
(the Environmental Protection Agency) and other federal
agencies," senior EPA official Walter Kovalick said in testimony
Sept. 30 before a Senate environment subcommittee.

As far as specific provisions in the proposed House legislation,
financial incentives remain under consideration, but committee
sources say the proposal most likely will call for a study to
determine what incentives would be the most viable. There are
so many tax incentives now available to companies that it doesn't
make sense to impose a specific standard, said one source.

HOUSE JUDICIARY PANEL HEARS SOFTWARE
INDUSTRY LEADERS DISCUSS COMPETITION, TRADE
PRACTICES

Against the background of a possible Justice Department
investigation into alleged anticompetitive trade practices by
industry leader Microsoft Corp., executives from some of the
nation's leading computer software firms went before a House
Judiciary subcommittee last week to discuss competition in the
computer industry.  Chief among the concerns of the industry
officials was competition from overseas computer firms, software
piracy and trade restrictions that hamper the ability of U.S. firms
to effectively compete with their foreign counterparts.

Outdated, "unrealistic, unilateral controls that effectively prohibit
exports of software with encryption capabilities" imposed by the
United States must be lifted, said William Neukom, vice
president of law and corporate affairs for Microsoft.  Neukom
argued that these trade barriers threaten the industry's future
international sales.  The Clinton administration has proposed
liberalizing export restrictions on computers but not encryption
software.  That position has been criticized by the Software
Publishers' Association (ITP, Sept. 6, p. 12).  He also said that
software piracy, which is rampant in many areas, costs U.S.
companies approximately $10 billion annually in foreign
revenues.

Innovation must continue to be encouraged, Neukom said.  "The
benefits of continuous software innovation permeate the
economy" as software innovation improves the competitiveness
of other U.S. industries that utilize software products, he said.
Neukom also noted that the competitiveness of the computer
industry means that "not all companies that exist today will be as
successful or even in existence five years from now."
Competition will increase overall, he said, as firms vie "to
develop more advanced operating systems that take advantage of
the explosive technological growth in hardware."

David Bradford, general counsel of Novell, Inc. told the
lawmakers that congressional efforts to clarify the treatment of
joint ventures under the antitrust laws and to eliminate any
unnecessary obstacles to their formation was a boost to the
industry's ability to compete internationally.

But one area that still needs improvement is the patent system,
according to Jerry Rogers, president and chief executive officer
of Cyrix Corp.  "America must address its antiquated patent
system so that it may encourage innovation rather than hinder
it," Rogers said.  The Cyrix official claims that "under the
present system patents are issued that reflect marginal advances
in technology or a similar implementation of existing
manufacturing process or product" which in turn advances large
corporations while intimidating smaller companies.

In general, the witnesses side-stepped discussing the alleged
trade practice violations by Microsoft. However, Paul Johnson, a
vice president of First Boston, testified that the government must
"make sure that the current dominant market leaders do not
abuse their natural economies of scale."

Johnson said, "In other words, Microsoft clearly dominates the
market for PC operating systems and applications.  No one can
deny it, and I doubt anything could be done to change it.
However, Microsoft should not be allowed to abuse this market
position in terms of pricing leverage or `anti-competitive'
activities," he said.  Justice is reviewing files compiled by the
Federal Trade Commission to determine if Microsoft has
engaged in anticompetitive practices (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 12).

While noting that the computer industry is "fast-moving and
complex," Subcommittee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Texas) said
that does not mean "it is immune from antitrust and other
competition-related problems."

At the same time, Brooks pointed out that such characteristics
do not mean "that the market would necessarily be served by the
replacement of one dominant industry monolith with a number
of smaller companies able to unfairly exert control over
particular key segments of the computer industry."  Brooks also
stressed that as long as federal agencies are investigating charges
of unfair competitive practices within the industry, his committee
did not intend "to invade upon that process."

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES PILOT PROGRAM
FOR NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

The House Telecommunications Subcommittee approved
legislation Oct. 14 to fund pilot projects that promote the
development of a national information superhighway.  The
Telecommunications Infrastructure and Facilities Assistance Act
of 1993, H.R. 2639, authorizes grant money for communities or
organizations that develop innovative uses for nationwide
computer networks.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee and
key sponsor of the proposal, said the measure "reflects the
commitment of the government to make certain that health care
institutions, schools, libraries and local governments share in the
communications future."

To fund the pilot projects, the bill will have the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
establish and maintain a Telecommunications and Information
Infrastructure Development Program that will promote the
widespread availability of advanced telecommunications to health
care providers, educational institutions and state and local
governments.

Markey said the program "is designed to support the formation
of a nationwide, high-speed, interactive infrastructure made up
of a variety of technologies through the interconnection and
improvement of existing facilities and the deployment of new
facilities."  The bill authorizes an additional $151 million in
Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996 for NTIA to award grants for 50
percent of construction costs.

SPACE STATION BECOMES FOREIGN POLICY VEHICLE;
JOINT VENTURE WITH RUSSIA PROPOSED

Dr. John H. Gibbons, director of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), announced Oct. 6 that
the United States will incorporate the Russian Mir space station
into the newly redesigned and recently renamed space station
Alpha project, formerly called space station Freedom.

The new space station option grew out of a meeting held Sept. 1
and 2 between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.  Under the terms of the
agreement reached between Gore and Chernomyrdin, the
United States will pay $400 million over four years for the use of
Mir and the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  In return,
the U.S. will receive assurances from Russia that it will abide by
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the agreement to
limit the spread of rockets and related technologies.  China and
Brazil have been accused of breaking the MTCR, and many fear
that cash-strapped Russia might find it unable to resist selling
banned technology.

Marcia S. Smith, a specialist in science and technology policy for
the Congressional Research Service, emphasized that the Mir
option is only one of three choices emerging from the confusion
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA)
efforts to redesign and trim costs for the space station.  The
three designs are the "American option"; using a Lockheed Corp.
"bus" for guidance navigation and control; the
"American/Russian" option, using a Salyut tug for the same
functions; and the "Russian/American" option developed during
the Gore/Chernomyrdin discussions.

The latest announcement comes on the heels of a rocky year for
the project, which is criticized for being over budget and a waste
of precious federal science funds at a time of record budget
shortfalls.  In a packed hearing room before the subcommittee
on space of the House Committee of Science, Space and
Technology, Gibbons defended the option to employ Mir as a
means of cutting both deployment time and expenses.  Members
of the panel voiced skepticism about the uncertainty raised by
issues such as the attempted coup quashed by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, sovereignity and control, and technical difficulties
in linking the two programs.

The new modular design, a composite of two out of three plans
submitted by NASA in June after the Clinton administration
demanded a less expensive station, would include Mir as a
component of a larger station.  Gibbons stated that Mir would
provide the U.S. with a quick boost in knowledge while
providing Russians with needed capital to help that country's
economic development.  "We now have the historic opportunity
to combine our efforts in space across a spectrum of programs,"
Gibbons testified.  "Not in the context of an adversarial
relationship, but rather, one that is based on cooperation and
partnership.  We believe that the steps taken during the
Gore/Chernomyrdin meeting will set us on a course that will
allow us to work together on space activities to minimize costs,
maximize research potential and reduce the time needed to do
projects."

COLLABORATION WOULD OCCUR IN THREE PHASES


The Russian/American collaboration would occur in three-
phases.  The first phase would give the U.S. the right to fly long-
term missions on Mir to develop skills needed for future space
station operations.  Phase two would begin shuttle service to a
Mir module as an "interim human-tended science facility."  The
third phase would be full-scale integration of the Russian space
program into the international space-station consortium currently
led by the U.S.  Other members of the consortium include
Canada, European countries and Japan.  Gibbons said details
will be made available Nov. 1.

Gibbons fended off a series of questions, on the one hand
assuring Rep. Jim Bacchus (D-FL) that the space station
program would continue to be based at Cape Canaveral (in
Bacchus' district), while assuring others on the committee that
neither extra money would be appropriated for the proposed
joint venture nor any American jobs put at risk.

"No one should confuse the course we are charting as
relinquishing control of the Space Station or exporting jobs out
of the U.S.," Gibbons said.  "In developing this cooperative
program, we are focusing on areas that will not negatively impact
the U.S. aerospace sector.  In some areas, such as dynamic solar
power and closed life support systems, we believe that the net
gain of new technologies from the Russians could stimulate jobs
in the U.S."

The most contentious issues, however, were the most technical.
Integration of the two space station projects reveals fundamental
technical differences between the programs that may make
joining them difficult.  The Russian/American space station
program would use a 51.6 degrees orbit, as opposed to the space
shuttle, which has always used a 28 degrees orbit.  Adopting to
the new orbit would reduce the launch window from Florida to
six minutes every day while simultaneously increasing the need
for thrust or reducing the size of payloads.

Responding to a question from Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
(R-WI), Gibbons said the orbital degrees can range from 42 to
52 degrees, but that Russia could not lower itself to our orbit
without risking dropping its spent rockets on China.

Increasing the thrust of the space shuttle probably would require
the continuation of another controversial NASA project, the
advanced solid rocket motor (ASRM).  Ironically, on the
morning of the hearing, the House voted not to consider a rule
change that would have allowed appropriations for ASRM to
continue despite being voted down.  Other options, according to
Gibbons, are to let the Europeans or Russians "do the heavy
lifting."

All of this could become moot, according to Gibbons.  "What we
have is a space station called Alpha that is destined to go
forward with or without Russia," he said.  The proposed $400
million investment will buy "access to the great reservoir of
experience from the Mir," he said.

At a subsequent hearing Oct. 14, NASA Administrator Daniel
Goldin dismissed concerns by some panel members that Russian
technology might be uniformly inferior.  Goldin noted that in
recent years, Russia has made more launches and had fewer
failures than the U.S. space program.  Collaborating with the
Russians will allow the launch of the laboratory module by July
1997, with completion of a new space station by April 2001 at a
savings of $3.5 billion over what it wold cost the U.S. to
complete the project without Russian assistance.  If collaboration
does not occur, Goldin said the laboratory module launch would

OMB OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW GOVERNMENT
EFFORT TO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

The state of information technology within the government when
the Clinton administration took office was "appalling," according
to Sally Katzen, administrator of the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.
Testifying Oct. 7 before the House Space, Science and
Technology Committee, Katzen said an essential component of
the National Performance Review (NPR) will require
overhauling the way the government uses, manages and
disseminates its vast store of information.  Noting that the
government has spent staggering sums yearly on information
systems without providing decent service or significantly
improving information infrastructure, Katzen said the two
programs must be integrated to ensure that the goals of either
program are achievable.

According to the NPR report "From Red Tape to Results"
released Sept. 7, more efficient use of information technology is
one of the administration's highest priorities both for improving
government services and reducing costs. The review projects a
savings of up to $5.4 billion over five years by bringing the way
government distributes data into the information age, while at
the same time improving citizen- access to information.  Efforts
to improve information technologies in the past have been
hampered by bad management and programs lacking central
goals or leadership, according to Katzen.

"The federal government's track record in integrating
[information technology] into systems supporting its operations
has produced some successes--and some costly failures," Katzen
testified.  "Despite spending $25 billion in fiscal year 1993 on
information technology, the federal government lacked the
strong and effective leadership required to assure that it makes
the most of these resources."  Without leadership, Katzen
continued, systems developed to deal with small and specific
problems actually aggravate dissemination problems because
separate departments create information fiefdoms--databases
that duplicate those of other agencies and departments.  This,
Katzen said, exacerbates the perception of government as a poor
service-provider and drives up government costs in general.

"In the past, the oversight community--OMB, the General
Services Administration, Congressional committees and the
Inspectors General--has often aggravated the situation by
overemphasizing specific costs such as the acquisition cost of
individual information technology projects, rather than assessing
their effect on program delivery," she said.

THREE STEPS TO INTEGRATION

Katzen proposed a three-step process to integrate the goals of
the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the National
Performance Review.  Beginning immediately, her office will
evaluate and publicize successful government information
technology ventures across departments and agencies.  This will
aid other departments in determining what programs are
available and effective.

The second phase, which will cover the next 12 to 18 months, is
to "achieve measurable performance gains through fundamental
changes in information management practices."  Katzen
described a possible program, allowing the Department of
Veteran Affairs access to Department of Defense personnel data
on the assumption that there is significant overlap between the
departments.  This would not only save the departments the cost
of having to input the same information twice, but would save
military personnel the aggravation of having to supply it several
times.

The third step would be "to tie the short- and long-term efforts
together" by determining what laws and regulations should be
established, changed or abolished to make the best use of
information gained during the first two steps.

More efficient use of information will also make it easier for the
government to encourage the development of a national
information infrastructure.  The federal government, being the
largest information provider in the country, will provide
significant traffic on any "information highway" that develops.
Moving public information to the network, as outlined in the
reinventing government report, will provide a flood of traffic on
the network.  This will encourage public use and, in turn, will
build the network.

Katzen testified that among the services likely to be more
efficient using NII would be an "integrated electronic benefit
transfer" (EBT) system.  This system would move entitlement
payments from the check- and paper-based systems used today
to an automated teller machine, bank-wire network and plastic
access system.  "In the Food Stamp program alone, there are
over 26 million monthly recipients and the government spends
$400 million annually just to print, distribute and ultimately
destroy stamps," Katzen said.  "EBT adopts commercial
electronic payment practices for the delivery of government
assistance services, enabling benefits to be transferred
automatically."

Other links between the NII and NPR would include heightening
public access to government services through the creation of
information kiosks for retirees so they can access social security
or other information; a national network to link federal state
and local law enforcement and public safety agencies to increase
coordination and reaction times; a national environmental
database that would combine the information gathered by the
Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the
Department of Commerce and others; and a government-wide e-
mail system.

Katzen said that, as part of NPR, agencies should be encouraged
to work more closely with the information industry and be
provided with incentives to innovate.  Among her suggestion
were:

permit agencies to retain a portion of any savings that their
innovations create, instead of the current system in which
agencies that do not expend their full appropriations find their
budgets reduced the following fiscal year;

promote performance-based contracting, instead of narrowly
defined, low-risk procurement, allowing agencies to leverage the
expertise of the contractor with award fees, performance
incentives and value engineering;

use multi-year funding, which would free information managers
from year-to-year appropriations battles; and

establish a government-wide venture capital fund to promote
partnership between government and industry to develop new
technologies.

Finally, Katzen said the most important aspect of making the
NII and NPR work together would be rigorous and constant
retraining of government workers to keep abreast of new
technologies.  "Many members of the federal workforce lack
sufficient training and background to use new technologies
effectively, and many managers fail to realize the importance
of...training,"  she said.  "Even though the government spends
billions of dollars each year on information technology, contracts
and acquisitions do not include training provisions in the initial
design stages."

U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE
IS AT THE CENTER OF ECONOMY

Under Bruce A. Lehman, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
will be on a "quest for quality and customer service" during the
next several years.  Lehman was sworn in as assistant secretary
of commerce and commissioner of the Patent Office on Sept. 15.
He intends to continue a multi-year automation plan for systems
serving the agency's main activities--patent and trademark
processing, information dissemination and administration.  The
slow pace of patent processing in the past has prompted
congressional criticism, but Lehman believes that "automation
may open the way for truly international patent searching--
maybe even to a world patent."

Many still regard patents and other intellectual property rights as
esoteric subjects.  But this view is not held by corporations,
universities, government research centers and others who
increasingly seek patents here and overseas for their new
products or processes.  Governments have also realized the
importance patents play in the technology competitiveness race,
and many have begun to modernize their national patent offices
to meet demand and to benefit from new information-handling
and storage technologies.  In addition, patent office directors are
being urged to charge "user fees" that reflect the real costs of
providing services to inventors and patent attorneys.
Automation may offer an economic solution that serves well
both government agencies and patent applicants.

In existence since 1790, the Patent and Trademark Office
expects to deal with about 188,000 patents and 142,000
trademark applications this year, and estimates that it will collect
fees of about $486 million.  From its offices in Arlington, Va., a
staff of 4,893 receive, examine and process America's
technological hopes for the future.  As a link to the health of
technology-based industries, Lehman said his office "stands at
the very [center] of a technology-based economy."  It is
surprising that the Patent Office does not come under the aegis
of the Commerce Department's newly empowered Technology
Administration, as do the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and the National Technical Information Service.

Nevertheless, Lehman sees new opportunities for his agency.
For example, through the recently announced Information
Infrastructure Task Force, he will lead an Intellectual Property
Working Group looking into policies that will encourage use of
the new infrastructure.  His group will investigate ways of
ensuring "copyright integrity" for creators of information and
entertainment products, as well as investigate the relationship of
"standards" and "open systems" to copyright law and "fair use"
principles in the context of electronic superhighways.

As part of the new U.S.-Japan trade-framework agreement, the
Patent Office will be leading the U.S. government side on all
intellectual property issues in these negotiations.  "Few
assignments given to the Commissioner of the Patent Office
have been more important that this one," Lehman said.

NO LONGER A DICKENSIAN BACKWATER

Once a Dickensian backwater of information-handling with dusty
shelves of dog-eared papers, shoe-box filing systems, primitive
copying machines and constant vulnerability to fire and rodent
damage, today's Patent Office is being equipped with automation
systems so its operations can run with fewer staff yet achieve
faster response times.  These computerized systems include
workstations with state-of-the-art graphic interfaces for
examiners and networks of databases with foreign patent
organizations.  Increasingly, CD-ROM formats are used for
storing and searching current and past patent records.

Lehman recognizes that automation alone doesn't immediately
improve the quality or efficiency of its services.  "I believe that
[quality] is closely linked in any organization with morale," he
said.  To increase morale, Lehman will review the Patent
Office's structure and in particular the patent examining corps
and its support functions.  Lehman hopes to identify changes
which will give improved support for examiners and create a
better sense of teamwork and customer service in all employees.
Furthermore, examiners may be offered new career development
opportunities--such as being detailed to other federal agencies--
to broaden their experience and perspective.

Concern has been voiced by Patent Office insiders and
intellectual property lawyers about efforts to reduce patent
pendency (the time it takes for a patent to be issued or an
application to be rejected), and whether this is being achieved
partly at the expense of the quality of examination.  Lehman
said the basis for this concern is that the patent examining corps'
performance criteria emphasize production rather than "quality"
in the examination process.  Ongoing quality audits by the
agency's in-house patent quality review unit suggests that quality
is improving; however, Lehman said the criteria used to judge
examiners needs a closer look to see if changes could provide
incentives for quality equal to those encouraging production.

In a new mission statement for the Patent Office, Commerce
Secretary Ronald H. Brown recently defined its role as:

Administering the laws relating to patents and trademarks so as
to promote U.S. industrial and technological progress and
strengthen the national economy;

Developing and advising the secretary and the administration on
intellectual property policy, including copyright matters; and

 Advising the secretary and other U.S. government agencies,
such as the U.S. trade representative, on trade-related aspects of
intellectual property in cooperation with the International Trade
Administration.

One of Lehman's urgent tasks will be to consider the possible
adoption of the first-to-file patent system as a prelude to the
Patent Harmonization Treaty.  Presently the United States uses
a first-to-invent approach but is the only developed country using
it.  First-to-file and other changes recommended by an Advisory
Commission on Patent Law Reform in September 1992, would
permit integration of the United States into an international
patent system.  A consensus initially appeared to support
adopting them but has since deteriorated and Lehman will hold
public hearings and solicit new comments on the matter.  A
recent General Accounting Office report found that 66 percent
of the companies it surveyed were in favor of the change.

Despite his background in intellectual property, Lehman seems
unlikely to be a prisoner of the system.  Addressing American
Bar Association members in New York recently, he said "It's my
desire to develop a better mechanism for making and exercising
the office's obligation to make policy in a variety of areas
involving patent, trademark and copyright systems.  All too often
[the Patent Office] had been a passive bystander as technology,
the courts or Congress have forced it into reacting to a limited
number of policy choices.  Many historic decisions as to
patentability of a new art have been made in a `Star Chamber'
proceeding in the commissioner's office with only a few insiders
present and nothing more to go on than the information
supplied by one patent applicant.  I intend to reverse this
process."  Lehman is drawing up a list of areas of "turmoil" and
will hold public hearings on the policy options involved.  Topics
likely to be examined are computer-related inventions,
particularly software, and biotechnology inventions.  Perhaps in a
few more years, Lehman speculated, the ability to examine
patents using a desk-top personal computer may lead us to
question whether we even need a centralized patent office any
longer.

DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY ENLISTED
IN WAR AGAINST BREAST CANCER

The Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and Fischer Imaging Corp. of Denver signed a
cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) last
week to create a new mammography system that will allow
earlier detection of breast cancer.

The three-year, $3.28 million agreement will utilize an imaging
technology previously developed for weapons applications.
Fischer is funding 73 percent of the project.  While both DOE
and Fischer will contribute "nearly equally" in the initial r&d
phase, according to DOE, Fischer will support the clinical trials
and the approval process before the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

After devoting three years to solving technical problems, it is
expected to take another two years to prove the system works in
clinical tests and to obtain FDA approval.  The research phase is
estimated to cost less that $2 million, with the clinical trials and
approval process costing another $1.5 million.

Specifically, the CRADA is aimed at "developing a new imaging
system that will produce clearer images using less radiation, thus
enabling earlier and more accurate detection of breast cancer
and the saving of lives," according to DOE.  The CRADA
partners will develop a device that eliminates the use of X-ray
film, and instead uses sophisticated detectors to directly record
the X-ray image in digital form.  The detector array employs
charge coupled devices (CCDs) to record 20 million individual
pixels, each 30 times smaller than the period at the end of a
sentence.  Since the image is digital, a computer can be used to
enhance the image.

At the signing ceremony held in Washington on Oct. 6, Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary said "Health care is technology
intensive and the battle for better, safer and cheaper health care
demands that we use every weapon at our disposal.  The
national laboratories are a vital element in our technology
arsenal, and this agreement shows that we are using the
laboratories to help wage the battle for improved health care."
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said the agreement "is a
breakthrough in the area of defense conversion and a
breakthrough in the fight against an epidemic."

Also, the technology commercialized under this agreement is
expected to hasten the widespread use of "telemedicine" insofar
as it will allow transmission of images over information
highways, facilitating communication between radiologists.  Dr.
Faina Shtern, head of the Diagnostic Imaging Research Branch
of the National Cancer Institute, praised the project and said,
"While digital mammography is still under development, its
potential to improve breast cancer management warrants further
research."

CANADIAN BELL SCIENTIST CLAIMS TO CRACK
DES ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM; NIST CONSIDERING
REVIEW

A Canadian computer scientist claims to have designed a
machine to crack the federal government's Data Encryption
Standard (DES), merely by searching random numbers at high-
speeds for a few hours.  Michael J. Wiener, a scientist with Bell-
Northern Research in Ottawa, presented the paper at a
conference in August.  A spokeswoman for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, whose scientists originally
designed the DES algorithm in 1981, said they first saw the
document Oct. 13 and have not yet evaluated Weiner's blueprint.
DES is used widely in computer communications.

The heart of the machine is a special chip that Weiner said can
test the keys "at the impressive rate of 50 million per second," by
eliminating the need to feed data in and out of the chip while it
is running. Wiener undertook designing the chip and explaining
how it works in a 47-page document "for the purpose of
assessing the resistance of DES to an exhaustive attack," he said.
By using this attack, "DES keys can be found one to two orders
of magnitude faster than other recently proposed designs."
Wiener said his design shows how to build a machine for $1
million that will break DES in about 3.5 hours.

"The chip can be comfortably clocked at 50 MHz," slower than
the chips which run a 486 computer, "and would cost $10.50 to
manufacture," Wiener said.  In the machine, ten key search chips
are controlled by a "microcontroller" which searches for codes.
The machine uses 12 groups of 10 chips, controlled by a master
microcontroller to form a "shelf."  "Four shelves are contained to
form a frame which is controlled by a PC.  A frame costs
$100,000 and contains 5760 key search chips," the document said.

DES CRACKED `ALARMINGLY QUICKLY'

"USING the design described here, DES keys can be found
alarmingly quickly," Weiner wrote.  Given that a key search chip
tests 50 million keys per second and a frame costs $100,000 and
contains 5760 chips, he computed the following approximate
search-time-to-cost ratios:  A $100,000 machine would take 35
hours to crack the code; a $1 million machine would take 3.5
hours; and a $10 million machine would take only 21 minutes.
He said a machine could be built in ten months by three people.
With labor, support and manufacturing, Weiner estimated a
simple machine would cost a total of $500,000 to build.

DES may be replaced by the new Clipper Chip data encryption
algorithm called "skipjack," an allegedly impenetrable encryption
algorithm introduced by the Clinton administration in April.  In
an independent review of the Clipper Chip, Georgetown
University Computer Science Professor Dorothy Denning said it
would be 36 years before the cost of breaking skipjack by
exhaustive search will be equal to the cost of breaking the Data
Encryption Standard today.  "Thus, there is no significant risk
that Skipjack will be broken by exhaustive search in the next 30
to 40 years," Denning said (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 13).

Wiener told ITP that his research was intended as an exercise to
help DES users asses the strength of the encryption.  He
emphasized that he has not built a machine, but only provided
the blueprints for a chip, and that NIST has not commented on
his work.  He added that cracking DES did not imply that the
same key search techniques could be used to crack the Clipper
Chip "skipjack" algorithm.  "Certainly all encryption systems are
more or less vulnerable.  It depends on the size of the keys."
Noting that skipjack used very large keys, he said it would not be
practical to attack with random key searches.

David Banisar, a policy analyst for Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, a public interest organization that monitors
encryption policy, said the code-breaking chip is significant
because it creates in practice what has previously been proposed
only in theory.  "He's actually gone through with a computer-
aided design program and designed the chip, which nobody had
done before," Banisar said.  Weiner noted that DES could still
remain foolproof if its algorithm was tripled in each use.  If used
in this way, the encryption code in effect becomes numerically
"larger than the national debt spread around the earth and moon
in orbit," Banisar added.

MEMBER STATES' WORRIES SLOW
EC PROGRESS ON R&D FRAMEWORK PLAN

BRUSSELS--Work is proceeding slowly on the European
Commission's proposal for a new EC framework program for
r&d.  EC research ministers discussed this proposal, which is the
fourth in a series of four-year programs, for EC funding last
June and they were scheduled to do so again Oct. 11.

All 12 member states have expressed serious reservations about
the commission's proposal.  The difficulties mainly concern the
proposed budget of 13 billion ECUs (1 ECU = $1.17) from 1994
to 1998.  But selection criteria for r&d program support also are
controversial.  The budget figures put forward by EC member
states vary from 6.5 billion to 14 billion ECUs.  Generally, it is
expected that member states will try to narrow this range to
some figure below 13 billion ECUs.  That sentiment concerns
the commission, whose staff believes a budget of 13 billion
ECUs is the minimum necessary for the EC to support r&d.

Most member states still disagree with the commission's
distribution of funds within research categories, but it seems
clear that they agree on reducing funding for communications
and information technology.  The commission and member
states want to give their final approval to this framework
program in December.  This goal is ambitious.  The problems
cited above are substantial.

INTELSAT GROUP TO STUDY PRIVATIZATION
IN RESPONSE TO REQUEST BY U.S. OFFICIALS

A special Intelsat working party has agreed to a U.S. proposal to
include the privatization of the global satellite consortium on the
group's agenda of strategic issues for further study.

Representatives of the U.S. government and the U.S. signatory,
Comsat Corp., proposed that the working party include on its
agenda a study of the implications of converting Intelsat from
"an international, intergovernmental organization into a private
multinational corporation," an informed source told ITP.  The
working party met in Washington last month following the
conclusion of the Intelsat Board of Governors meeting Sept. 9 to
15.  The meeting was convened to establish an agenda of key
issues for Intelsat's future that need near-term study.

An Intelsat spokesman confirmed that "the issue of privatization
is on the agenda" of the working group but noted that the group
was charged by Intelsat's Assembly of Parties last November
with studying a host of strategic issues.  "It would almost be
remiss if they didn't consider privatization," he said, "but it is not
a foregone conclusion.  We're not looking at it to happen
tomorrow or two years from now, but there's obviously a
possibility it could happen over the long term."

The working group originally had been formed to consider
responses to calls by the United States and some other member
nations for a loosening of requirements under Article XIV(d) of
the Intelsat Agreement for consultations with Intelsat before
member nations permit the use of separate satellite systems for
international services.

The U.S. proposal to look at a privatization of Intelsat reflected
a view by U.S. government policy-makers that Intelsat needs the
greatest possible flexibility to meet growing international satellite
service competition, sources said.  "Increasingly, it's a strain for
the U.S. government to try and mediate battles between Intelsat
and its competitors, when we believe Intelsat needs greater
flexibility, and its competitors say it shouldn't have that flexibility
while it retains the treaty privileges and immunities," one U.S.
government source said.  "So, it seems to make sense to consider
this--the option of privatization and the pros and cons."

In their presentations to the Intelsat working party, U.S.
government and Comsat representatives reportedly made it clear
that the United States is committed to Intelsat remaining
economically competitive and that it recognizes "the universal
service principles inherent in the Intelsat agreements" and the
fact that Intelsat remains the only provider of satellite services
with global reach.

TOUGH CHOICES FACE U.S. MANUFACTURING
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE TOLD

The U.S. government should adopt an "industrial development
policy" to provide guidance to small and medium-sized
manufacturing companies, said Philip Braverman, senior vice
president and chief economist of DKB Securities Corp, Oct. 5 at
a Joint Economic Committee hearing chaired by Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-IN).

Braverman said such businesses were "likely to benefit most
from a stream of information and suggestions on where their
investment dollars might be most expeditiously placed and which
are the most likely avenues for productive research."  He also
suggested holding regional, industry-wide meetings attended by
top people in various fields to "plan collectively" for the future.

"Recognized experts in various high-technology disciplines could
be invited to take `dollar-a-year' government positions to foster
progress in their fields," Braverman said.  Pilot projects, modeled
after the recently announced government and industry
partnership to develop an environmentally correct car, should be
encouraged.

Braverman was one of three witnesses before the committee--all
of whom agreed that difficult choices confront U.S.
manufacturing in its efforts to deal with declining jobs,
intensified foreign competition and sluggish adoption of new
technologies.  The hearing examined recent statistics of
manufacturing job losses and the prospects for halting or slowing
this trend through stimulating U.S. manufacturing growth,
possibly using new technologies.

Hamilton expressed concern over the latest unemployment
figures, saying they showed that each month the equivalent of
one-and-a-half Fortune 500 company's employees lost their jobs
in the nation's manufacturing sector and this posed serious
questions about the future of America's manufacturing
capabilities for domestic as well as export markets.

Hamilton's remarks were put into national perspective by Julie
Fox Gorte, senior associate at the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment (OTA).  She said that more than 18
million Americans, or 15 percent of the U.S. workforce, were
employed in manufacturing.

Generally these were "jobs with better pay and superior benefits
than the average for production and nonsupervisory workers,"
Gorte said "[so] people who lose manufacturing jobs typically
find replacements only with either lower pay, fewer benefits or
both.  For that reason alone, dwindling manufacturing
employment is a concern."

Gorte referred to several OTA studies which identified possible
policy options to reduce the impact of foreign competitiveness
on U.S. industry.  But she said "An issue [currently] facing many
smaller manufacturers in particular is lack of access to bank
financing; even though the recession is officially over, many
(especially smaller enterprises) are having a tough time getting
loans.  This situation developed after OTA's work on
competitiveness was delivered, so our reports suggest no options
to remedy it; however, the issue needs addressing."

TECHNOLOGY MOVES TOO FAST FOR SMALL
COMPANIES

Commenting on possible measures to increase technology
diffusion, Gorte said the pace of technological change was "often
faster than enterprise managers can cope with" at small- and
medium-sized companies who also have trouble "learning about
and understanding new production machinery and techniques, or
soft production technologies such as continuous improvement
and statistical process controls."

She observed that Japan and Germany both have "well-
developed networks to inform small manufacturers of what
technological improvements (both hard and soft) they could
make," and noted that extensive public subsidies for loans to
enable small enterprises to adopt new technologies existed in
Japan, Korea and several other nations.

In the United States, Gorte characterized such systems of
technological extension and information service as "much more
rudimentary, particularly at the federal level."  Although a few
states have well-developed manufacturing extension services,
they are "typically much smaller than the potential demand for
their services," Gorte noted.  Learning from and expanding on
the most promising of the new technology extension efforts,
including parts of the recently authorized Technology
Reinvestment Program, over the next several years was
recommended.

Gorte singled out as an example of a small yet meritorious
public cost-sharing program in civilian technology development,
the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  "In the few years
of its operation [ATP] has gained a reputation for sensible
management and promising investment," Gorte said.  "Early
evaluations show that it continues to look promising."

BRIEFS

The Commerce Department this week will announce the winner
or winners of the 1993 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award.  This year, 76 companies applied for the award, which
recognizes overall quality strategy and management.  That field
was narrowed to 13 in August and teams from the award's board
of examiners visited the companies in September.  The finalists
included  four manufacturers, five service companies and four
small businesses.  The Baldrige award has been given since 1988.
Last year's winners included AT&T Network Systems
Group/Transmission Systems Business Unit, Texas Instruments
Inc. Defense Systems & Electronics Group, AT&T Universal
Card Services, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel co. and Granite Rock Co.

The Department of Energy's Office of Defense Programs has
approved its first technology transfer projects for Fiscal Year
1994.  The awards, totalling $8.4 million, will be funded through
DOE's national laboratories.  The projects approved range in
scope from electron beam processing of manufacturing waste to
intelligent control systems for combustion engines, according to
a DOE official.  The Y-12 facility operated by Martin Marietta
received $900,000 for one project; Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory received $900,000 for three projects; Los Alamos
National Laboratory received $1.4 million for three projects and
Sandia National Laboratory received $5.2 million to fund nine
projects.

The Clinton administration has agreed to establish a defense
conversion clearinghouse in the Commerce Department.  The
proposal was introduced by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) as an
amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Department
Authorization bill (ITP, Sept. 20, p.18).  The Office of Economic
Conversion Information would provide information on federal,
state and local defense conversion programs for companies,
workers and localities hurt by military downsizing and base
closures.

The Superconducting Super Collider's (SSC) fate may be
determined when the House considers this week the $22 billion
Fiscal Year 1994 spending bill for energy and water projects.
House opponents were furious last week when House and
Senate conferees agreed to include $640 million in funds for the
SSC in the bill despite the House having voted to kill the project
by a vote of 280-150 in June.  The Senate had voted 57-42 to
continue the project.  So far, the federal government has spent
$1.6 billion in the SSC, which will cost an estimated $11 billion
to complete.  Opponents have charged that in tight fiscal times,
the money could be either saved or better spent on more
practical technology endeavors.

Faulty kidney transplant data render patients 'dead'+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry is investigating irregularities
in data in a national computerized network on kidney transplant
patients which has led to some being wrongly classified as deceased,
ministry officials said Monday.
     The officials said the ministry has ordered an overhaul of the
data bank which was set up in April this year.
     The network collects information on a national scale about
patients and matches them with an organ when one becomes available
to ensure a fair and equitable system for the transplants.
     The irregularities apparently originated when inaccurate data
under the old system, collected mainly by a national hospital in
Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, were fed into the new network, the
officials said.
     One male patient in Niigata Prefecture on the central Sea of
Japan coast was denied a request for a transplant after he was
classified as dead.  He is still undergoing artificial dialysis.
     Another patient in the same prefecture, who had received a
transplant, was also classified as dead.
     Faulty computer software also caused one patient in the Kinki
region around Osaka and Kobe to be removed from the priority list for
transplant.
     The error was discovered when the patient's doctor made
inquiries about the change, and the patient's chances for a
transplant were not affected.
     Some 20,000 people are listed on the system and till late
November, 112 transplant operations had been carried out under it.

Child born after sperm cultivated from sterile father+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Japanese woman succeeded in delivering a child this month
using a method in which sperm cultivated directly from testicular
tissue of the sterile father was injected into her egg cells,
doctors at Nagoya University's medical department said Monday.
     The medical department's group, headed by Nobuhiko Suganuma, an
assistant professor of obstetrics, said it was the second successful
birth using the method in Japan following another such case in the
southern Japanese region of Kyushu.
     Suganuma's team cultivated a tiny bit of tissue taken from the
man's testicles until they yielded four mature sperm cells, which
they injected into four of the wife's ova in a microscopic
fertilization technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI).
     One fertilized egg cell was returned to the woman's womb, and
she was confirmed pregnant two weeks later, the doctors said.
     The woman, who is in her 20s and living in Aichi Prefecture,
central Japan, gave birth to a little girl 49.5 centimeters tall and
weighing 2,715 grams, through Caesarean section early this month,
they said.
     The father, who is in his 40s, had been completely unable to
produce sperm on his own.
     A total of nine women out of 31 who have tried the ICSI
fertilization method, but not the sperm cultivation method, have
become pregnant since the medical team started in 1992, they said.

Boy likely to get second liver transplant+

KYOTO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The ethics committee of Kyoto University's medical department
is moving toward giving the go-ahead for a live liver transplant for
an 8-year-old boy after an earlier transplant from a brain-dead
donor failed, university officials said Monday.
     In the operation, a part of the liver of the boy's mother, 34,
would be transplanted to the child.  Pending formal approval by the
panel's subcommittee on liver transplants, the surgery might be
conducted in early January, they said.
     According to the university, it would be the first time in Japan
that a live liver transplantation has been conducted on a patient who
has received a liver from a brain-dead donor in an earlier operation.
     The boy received his first liver transplant in an operation in
Australia in December 1988, when live liver transplants were still a
taboo in Japan.
     However, the boy continued to suffer from bleeding after the
first operation, prompting doctors to advocate another try with a
live transplant from his mother.
     Two other patients received live liver transplants at the
university, but they both died some time afterward.

Women urged to watch vitamin A intake during pregnancy+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Women should carefully watch their vitamin A intake directly
before and during pregnancy because overdosage can cause birth
defects, the Health and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday.
     The ministry cites an epidemiological study of more than 20,000
women in the United States, which showed that women whose daily
vitamin A intake was more than 15,000 international units (IU) were
3.5 times more likely to give birth to a deformed child than women
who had less than 5,000 IU a day.
     ''There is no reason to be overly concerned as long as one keeps
to a normal diet, but in the initial stages of pregnancy women must
avoid supplementing their dietary intake with massive doses of
vitamin A preparations or vitamin cocktails containing it,'' the
ministry said.
     Among those women who supplemented their dietary vitamin A
intake with 10,000 IU from vitamin pills or vitamin mixtures, one in
57 women delivered a child with a deformity such as hare lip or
hydrocephalus.
     In addition to refraining from taking vitamin pills and other
food supplements containing vitamin A, pregnant women should also
avoid vitamin A rich foods.
     Such foods are, for instance, dried lamprey eel which contains
some 150,000 IU of the vitamin per 100 grams, chicken liver with
47,000 IU and pork liver with 43,000 IU, according to the ministry.
     Some medications also contain the potentially harmful vitamin.
Depending on age and other physical parameters doctors recommend a
daily dietary allowance of at least 1,800 IU.
     The average daily intake in Japan stands at 2,600 IU, far below
a dosage that could be harmful, ministry officials said.
     In a bid to prevent people from taking an overdosage the
ministry is, nonetheless, considering issuing special nutritional
guidelines, ministry officials said.

UTILITY WORKS TO CHANGE NDE CRITERIA FOR
GENERATOR TUBES

In the coming months, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)
plans to spend $3-4 million to help develop new
nondestructive examination criteria for cracked steam
generator tubing in nuclear reactors.  If approved by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the new criteria
would, for the first time, allow some circumferentially
cracked tubes to remain in service.

ComEd's action is prompted by the discovery in November
of about 2,000 indications of circumferential cracking in the
steam generator tubes of the utility's Byron-1 nuclear reactor.
Because of the extensive cracking, the utility has proposed to
pull 10 tubes from Byron-1 -- one of the largest tube pulls in
the U.S. to date.  The tubes will be used to validate NDE
crack detection and sizing techniques as well as estimate leak
rate and burst data.

ComEd will be working with the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), which is leading the nuclear industry's
efforts to develop new plugging criteria for cracked steam
generator tubes.  Circumferentially cracked tubes traditionally
have been plugged upon discovery.  However, with
extensive cracking being found in several plants around the
country, large-scale plugging is threatening the economic
viability of some reactors.

EPRI's project to develop alternate plugging criteria is being
carried out by three contractors -- Westinghouse, Zetec, and
Aptech -- which are developing NDE techniques and stress
corrosion cracking samples for inspector qualification testing.

EPRI recently ironed out an agreement among all major
nuclear vendors on the NDE parameters for sizing
circumferential cracking in non-sleeved tubes.  The agreement
should help to yield a consistent set of inspection data when
reactors around the country undergo their next outages.

The inspection data collected during the outages, and from
laboratory testing, will be used to develop approximate flaw
growth rates for cracking tubes.  Being able to accurately
predict how fast cracks will grow is essential for reducing the
chance of a tube rupture.

The means to assess crack growth rates took on even more
importance in November when EPRI submitted a proposal to
the NRC to allow known circumferential cracks to remain in
service so that their growth rates can be tracked.  EPRI
proposed that a cracked tube could be boxed in by plugging
all the surrounding tubes so that, if a rupture occurred,
damage to nearby tubes would be minimized.  The NRC has
accepted the proposal with some reservations, but has not yet
made a final decision.

ComEd technicians hope that by pulling tubes from Byron-1,
they can gather data about crack growth rates and NDE
detection capabilities that could be applied to Braidwood-1,
another ComEd reactor.  Commonwealth is seeking to make
Braidwood a lead plant for implementation of alternate
plugging criteria for top of the tube sheet circumferential
cracking.

ComEd technicians recently found 25 indications of
circumferential cracking at Braidwood, which has a similar
design to Byron.  The utility is preparing itself in case the
extensive cracking that occurred at Byron happens at
Braidwood as well.  Braidwood-1 has two cycles and Byron-
1 has two and a half cycles remaining before their steam
generators are scheduled to be replaced.

Commonwealth has already been able to obtain an alternate
plugging criterion for another problem at Byron and
Braidwood: outer diameter stress corrosion cracking at the
tube support plates.  In November, the NRC approved a 3-
volt eddy current criterion, which is the highest to date.
NRC's traditional criteria is more stringent, requiring utilities
to plug reactor steam generator tubes when an eddy current
reading of one volt or greater is detected.

NRC's approval of the higher voltage standard included a
requirement to lock in a number of tubes into the tube support
plates.  ComEd estimates that using the higher voltage
threshold could save it from plugging 1,020 tubes at Byron-1
and 913 tubes at Braidwood-1.  This would result in a
combined savings of at least $5.7 million.

The agency's decision is an important indication that a 3-volt
threshold may come into wider use by the NRC.  Although
the criterion applied only to ComEd, Westinghouse, which
designed Byron and Braidwood, is expected to seek a generic
approval of the new threshold.

IOWA STATE DEVELOPS NDT TECHNIQUE FOR
GLOBAL INSPECTIONS

Researchers at Iowa State University have developed a new
NDT technique called GlobalView that achieves the global
inspection of objects of all sizes using ultrasound.  Its
inventors say the technique has a variety of applications
ranging from inspections of civil structures and airframes to
earth crust monitoring.

The GlobalView technique, also known as spread spectrum
nondestructive testing, combines ultrasonic testing with
technology from the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System
and radar signature analysis.  GlobalView transmits a very
wide bandwidth ultrasonic signal that floods the test object or
structure with acoustic energy.  As with traditional pulse-echo
ultrasonic systems, this signal propagates in the material and
is reflected by inhomogeneities which may be flaws.

However, unlike pulse-echo systems, which rely on the
transit time of the ultrasonic wave to locate flaws, the
GlobalView system measures the composite characteristic of
the entire acoustic system including the structure and the
transducers.  By measuring the cross-correlation functions
between the various input and output transducers, the system
can form an aggregate acoustic signature of an object or
structure.

The GlobalView unit compares the original, or reference,
acoustic signature with one taken at a later date to indicate the
presence of flaws or to determine if changes in the object
have occurred.  By taking an object's acoustic signature, the
system can detect changes in the object's characteristics such
as volume, shape, dimension, composition, density,
homogeneity, and acoustic velocity.

The signal processing used with this wideband signal is
capable of increasing the sensitivity of the measurement by
many orders of magnitude beyond what is possible with
conventional ultrasonic testing.  Thus, the instrument can
penetrate highly-attenuative materials.

Iowa State researchers, led by principal investigators Steve
Russell, Samuel Wormley, and Emmanuel Papadakis, have
built and tested two prototype systems.  The first system
mainly consists of software that is used in conjunction with
commercially-available ultrasonic instrumentation.  The
second prototype is mainly hardware, using analog methods
for most of the signal processing.

While the software approach provides maximum flexibility,
researchers say the hardware approach would be less
expensive to manufacture and would have faster processing
times.

The technique is particularly useful for inspecting objects
with "blind spots" or other geometries that prevent the use of
pulse-echo or pitch catch ultrasonic techniques.  Parts or
structures composed of high attenuation materials or with
restricted access are also good candidates for GlobalView.

Researchers have found that the technique can distinguish
between flaws because different types of changes or identical
changes in different locations show up uniquely in the
correlation signature.  GlobalView has been successful in
locating small flaws in copper blocks, small steel assembly
line parts, and large sections of bridge structure.

The developers say GlobalView will make it possible to
perform continuous, low-cost, monitoring of bridges and
airframes and other critical structures.  For example,
airframes could be automatically monitored before each
takeoff to insure structural integrity while avoiding expensive
down time for detailed inspections.

However, the technique also has applications beyond
traditional NDT tasks.  Earthquake fault zones could be
monitored for changes below the surface of the earth to help
predict earthquakes.  GlobalView could also be used for oil
exploration by creating an acoustic signal that penetrates deep
into the earth's crust.

NRC AUDITS WESTINGHOUSE FOR MISSED
INSPECTIONS

In October, a four-person team of auditors from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) visited a Westinghouse
testing facility in Pennsylvania to determine why the company
had failed to discover several obviously cracked steam
generator tubes during a 1993 inspection of the Salem-1
nuclear power plant.  NRC auditors are also seeking
information on why Westinghouse used an eddy current
probe that had not been fully qualified to inspect 4,000 tube
support intersections during the reactor's current outage.

According to Ted Sullivan, a section chief in NRC's Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulations, the agency has prepared a draft
audit report that is due to be finalized and released to the
public in January.  Sullivan said that the site visit to the
Westinghouse facility near Pittsburgh lasted from Oct. 23rd
to Oct. 27th.

The NRC began the audit after finding out that Westinghouse
technicians had used an 0.080-inch-diameter motorized
rotating pancake coil eddy current probe to inspect dented
intersections at Salem-1.  The Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) has approved the 0.080-inch-diameter probe
to detect cracks for tube support plates without dents, but not
at dented intersections.  EPRI has qualified an 0.115-inch
diameter probe for inspections of dented intersections.

While using EPRI-qualified probes is the industry norm,
inspection vendors and utilities can also approve
independently the use of other probes for specific tasks such
as inspecting dented tube support plate intersections.
However, there is the danger that flaws may be missed unless
the proper probe and instrumentation is used.

Westinghouse is trying to get the 0.080-inch-diameter probe
qualified by EPRI, but the company will most likely have to
re-inspect Salem-1's steam generators before the qualification
process is completed.

The NRC also wants to find out why Westinghouse
inspectors failed to detect a number of tubes with greater than
40% throughwall cracks during a 1993 outage at Salem-1.
These tubes had remained in service during the reactor's
operating cycle, although they should have been plugged
prior to restart.

The NRC has had to inspect the Salem-1 plant several times
over the last few years because of numerous operational
violations.  The agency has fined Public Service Electric &
Gas Co., Salem's operator, more than $2.3 million since
1980.

PARTNERS SCORE SUCCESS WITH ULTRASONIC
SENSOR

Morton International's Automotive Safety Products Division,
based in Utah, has adapted an ultrasonic system developed by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
inspect airbag inflators for welder verification and process
control.

Morton-ASP is the leading supplier of airbag inflators to the
automotive industry.  Under a cooperative research and
development agreement, NIST's Materials Reliability
Division in Boulder, Colo., worked with Morton engineers to
develop, test and install a prototype nondestructive testing
system for verifying that there are no anomalies associated
with the weld joint process of the mass-produced inflators.

A unique feature of this inspection system was the use of
electromagnetic acoustic transducers, or EMATs, which can
perform the necessary ultrasonic tests at high speed without
contaminating the part or the environment with couplant
fluids.

Off-line trials involved examining up to 100,000 inflators and
were so successful that Morton contracted Sonic Sensors of
San Luis Obispo, Calif., to build three commercial units.
These units are now installed on the production lines and
provide process control information on the welding
operations.

NAVAL CENTER MARKETS ITS NDE EXPERTISE TO
THE PRIVATE SECTOR

As defense budgets shrink, an increasing number of military
bases and research centers are marketing their R&D efforts to
the private sector.  The newest installation to join this list is
the Naval Surface Warfare Center located in Carderock, MD,
which is hoping to provide expertise in NDE sensors,
metallurgy, welding, and structural monitoring to the railroad
industry.

At a December 7th meeting, officials from the Center noted
that Navy and railroad operations overlap in many ways.
Navy ships require high-quality welds whose integrity must
be monitored nondestructively, as is also true for welded rail.
Moreover, maintenance and machinery diagnostics are
concerns for both parties.

The Warfare Center has developed several NDE sensors such
a portable coating analyzer for substrate/coating adhesion
assessment and acoustic weld sensors.  Warfare Center
officials hope that these types of technologies can be
transferred to the private sector through the use of cooperative
research and development agreements (CRADAs).

The number of CRADAs entered into by the Center pales in
comparison to many other military installations and officials
hope that meetings like the Dec. 7th event will increase this
total.  The Warfare Center currently employs more than 4,000
people, more than half of which are scientists and engineers.
The Center's fiscal year (FY) 1994 budget totaled $767
million, which included $312 million for research and
development of test and evaluation technologies.

NDT FINDS CRACKING AT TWO REACTORS

Engineers using nondestructive testing recently found steam
generator tube cracking in the Point Beach-2 nuclear power
plant operated by Wisconsin Electric Power Company and in
the Diablo Canyon-1 plant operated by Pacific Gas & Electric
Company.

At Point Beach-2, eddy current inspection discovered axial
defects in the reactor's steam generator tubes within the
tubesheet crevice.  Circumferential cracking was also found
in the parent tube of previously sleeved tubes near the upper
sleeve joint.  The crack findings extended Point Beach's
outage, which started on October 7th, by an extra two weeks.

Previous tube plugging and sleeving had already reduced
power in the two-loop 497-MWe reactor by 10-15 MWe.
Wisconsin Electric Power has applied to the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin for permission to replace the
reactor's steam generators during the plant's fall 1996
refueling outage.

Engineers at Diablo Canyon-1 in California recently
discovered 70 corroded tubes in one of the plant's steam
generators.  This finding pushed the number of pluggable
tubes at Diablo Canyon-1 over the threshold 1 percent of the
tubes tested.  Pacific Gas & Electric notified the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission as required by regulations and
expanded the testing program.

The testing involved extensive ultrasonic examinations and
engineers decided to pull several tubes for metallurgical
testing.

A total of 1.7% of Diablo Canyon-1's steam generator tubes
are now plugged.  The utility expects Diablo Canyon-1 to be
back in service sometime before January 30, 1996.

IN BRIEF

%  The American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT)
has a new site on the World Wide Web called "NDT Link."
ASNT can be reached at http://www.asnt.org/ndt.  The Web
site contains technical information, which is comprised
primarily of online articles from Materials Evaluation
magazine, society information, local society events, a
schedule of events, industry services, and links to other
NDT-related sites.  At this point, most of these areas lack
complete information, but hopefully in the near future the site
will be finished.

%  XiTec (Windsor Locks, CT), a leading manufacturer of
mini c-arm fluoroscopic imaging systems with applications in
health care, NDT and other industrial fields, recently reported
an increase in profits.  The company's net income for the first
quarter ended Oct. 31, 1995 amounted to $1.65 million, an
increase of 36.9% over the comparable prior year's period.
The quarterly revenue performance was the second best in the
company's history, falling short of the record fourth quarter
of last year by approximately 12 percent.  XiTec attributes its
increase in revenue to the market's continuing acceptance of
the company's XiScan 1000 track system coupled with
favorable results from increased emphasis in the marketing
and sales sectors.

%  In early December, dye penetrant inspection helped
engineers in California discover why a five-ton electronic
message board collapsed in Rancho Cucamonga, killing a
freeway motorist.  Caltrans engineers using dye penetrant
found several fractures in the signpost, ranging from
microscopic to several inches long, which were invisible to
the naked eye.  Caltrans is now inspecting each of the 228
signposts statewide.  At this point, no fractures have been
found on any other signposts.

%  With the help of ultrasonic testing, a 71-year old riverboat
is undergoing an overhaul in New Orleans, LA.  The
riverboat President is used for gambling on the Mississippi
river and is usually based in Davenport, Iowa.  Workers at
Trinity Gulf Repair will replace steel in the 297-foot
President's hull, if necessary, then sandblast and paint it.
Ultrasonic testing will determine if the bottom's steel meets
the prescribed 3/8-inch thickness.  Depending on the extent of
the repairs, the job could run as high as $750,000.

%  In early November, Asoma Instruments Inc. (Austin, TX),
a manufacturer of X-ray fluorescent analysis tools for
nondestructive testing, purchased Twin Cities Inc., which
makes products similar to Asoma's.  Asoma will provide
sales and field support for Twin Cities from its locations
around the world, while factory support for Twin Cities'

FAA TIGHTENS WING INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

In late November, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
issued a series of airworthiness directives (ADs) intended to
improve nondestructive inspections on the wings of Airbus
A300-series, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, MD-11, and Air
Force KC-10A aircraft.

The AD applicable to Airbus A300-series transports requires
repetitive high frequency eddy current inspections to detect
cracks at the aft spar web of the wings.  The FAA's action
was prompted by reports that cracks have been found in the
rear spar web of the wings of an in-service airplane and
during fatigue testing on a test wing.

The cracking, which could result in reduced structural
integrity of the wing, occurred due to fatigue-related high
shear stress.  The directive affects 89 airplanes of U.S.
registry.

A second AD applies to McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, -30,
and -40 series airplanes, and KC-10A military airplanes.
This action requires repetitive visual inspections to detect
corrosion or cracking of the lower front spar cap and the skin
panel of the horizontal stabilizer, and repair of corroded or
cracked parts.

The spar cap must be modified according to a McDonnell
Douglas service bulletin before the accumulation of 42,000
total landings for DC-10-10 airplanes and before 30,000
landings for DC-10-30, -40, and KC-10A aircraft.  The AD
was prompted by reports indicating that corrosion, caused by
water entrapment, was found on the horizontal stabilizer in
these types of aircraft.

The FAA's new requirements affect approximately 286 DC-
10 and KC-10A aircraft worldwide, 142 of which are
registered in the U.S.  The FAA estimates it will cost
operators $20 million to comply with the AD.

The FAA also added extra inspection requirements for DC-
10-10 series planes.  In a separate AD, the agency is
requiring visual and eddy current inspections of the wings to
detect cracks in the aft spar lower cap, in certain stringer
butterfly clips on the bulkheads, and in certain fastener holes.
The FAA has found that, during fatigue testing of the wing
structure, cracks developed in these areas due to fatigue-
related stress.

The inspections must be performed before 15,000 landings
have accumulated and modifications to the affected parts must
be completed within five years of the AD.  The FAA
estimates that 53 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by
this AD, costing a total of $7.5 million for compliance.

Another AD requires eddy current inspections to detect
cracking of the upper spar angles on the left and right sides of
the wing pylons on McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplanes.
This inspection must be repeated if an aircraft experiences an
excessive maneuver, turbulence overload, or hard landing.
The upper spar angles must be replaced by Dec. 27, 2000.
Approximately 123 MD-11 aircraft worldwide are affected by
this action.

AFTER NDT DISCOVERS PROBLEMS, NRC BOOSTS
OVERSIGHT AT MILLSTONE REACTOR

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is adding
inspectors at the Millstone Station nuclear power plant in
Waterford, Connecticut after intensive nondestructive testing
turned up several faulty welds in piping systems that need to
be repaired.

In December, the NRC decided to place both a senior resident
inspector and resident inspector at each of the three Millstone
units.  Currently, one senior resident and four resident
inspectors are assigned to the site.

The NRC's action was prompted when the Millstone 3 unit
was taken offline in late November so workers could remove
insulation in the reactor coolant system and evaluate a leaking
valve that prevents water from backflowing in a 10-inch pipe.
During the inspection, workers discovered a defective weld
on one of four 3/4-inch pipes in the instrumentation for the
reactor coolant system.  Northeast Utilities, the reactor's
operator, decided to shut down the plant to repair the faulty
weld and to replace an additional 15 welds in the
instrumentation system as a precaution.

At the same time, an intensive ultrasonic inspection was made
of 154 welds in piping systems around the Millstone 1
reactor.  Inspectors discovered 11 welds that needed repair.
The utility is now using a robotic welding process to lay new
weld material over the old weld.

In addition to increasing its oversight of Millstone, the NRC
also sent Northeast Utilities a letter requesting information on
what actions the utility has taken to ensure that future
operation of Millstone 1 will be conducted in accordance with
its operating license and NRC regulations.  According to a
statement by the NRC, this request stems from the findings
by the NRC Acting Inspector General that certain activities at
Millstone 1 "may have been conducted in violation of license
requirements."

AGEMA DEVELOPS NEW THERMOGRAPHY SYSTEM
TO SEE BELOW THE SURFACE

Agema Infrared Systems has developed a new NDT
technique called "lock-in" thermography that can spot flaws
several millimeters below the surface of a material.  Its
developers say the new technique is faster and more accurate
than active thermographic inspection techniques.

Lock-in thermography is unlike either passive or active
thermographic techniques.  Passive thermography converts
infrared radiation emanating from an object into a thermal
picture of the object's surface.

In active thermography, an energy source such as a flashlamp
is aimed at the test object and the heat flow through the
specimen is measured.  Flaws in the specimen cause changes
in the heat flow which are detected by a thermal imaging
system.

While active thermography has the advantage of being a
noncontact technique, it also has certain drawbacks.  The
technique requires several lengthy tests to eliminate the effects
of different emissivities across the surface of a material.
Active techniques such as pulse thermography must take into
consideration the effects of ambient radiation and often
require high energy levels that can lead to unacceptable
heating of materials.

Lock-in thermography was developed to overcome the
limitations of both active and passive techniques.  In lock-in
thermography, a harmonically modulated source, usually in a
sinusoidal waveform, is used to energize the test material.
Defects in the material produce reflections that interfere with
the incoming waves and create a pattern that is detected by a
thermal imager.  The imager measures the signal amplitude of
four phase-correlated points on this wave and the results are
averaged.

A computer is used to interpret the measurements picked up
by the imager and to create amplitude and phase images of the
test object that are independent of ambient radiation and
variations in emissivity.  According to Agema, amplitude and
phase images of an object can be produced in a couple of
minutes using a high-speed computer.

The lock-in system is based on Agema's Thermovision 900
thermal imaging system which produces real-time
measurements and has 12-bit digital image processing.  The
unit also includes a dedicated system controller for high-
speed data processing and specially adapted software that
coverts thermographic measurements into amplitude and
phase images.  The system produces a pure sine wave that is
synchronized with the frequency of the Thermovision 900
scanner.

Lock-in thermography is being developed in partnership with
Stuttgart University and MTU Munich, a leading German
manufacturer of turbine blades.  The technique has been used
to inspect objects like an electronic resistor and a honeycomb
structure, but the researchers are now examining a wider
variety of materials.

To date, most of the tests have been carried out at frequencies
between 3.75 Hz and 0.03 Hz, giving depth rages of 3 mm
for non-metals and 10 mm for metals.  The next stage of
development will involve adapting the lock-in thermography
system for a range research environments.

NASA EVALUATES NDT TECHNIQUES FOR
COMPOSITES

Researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center in
Cleveland, Ohio recently completed a study that evaluated
various NDT methods for characterizing ceramic-, metal-,
and polymer-matrix composite materials.  The study found
that certain ultrasonic methods can provide quantitative data
on microstructural anomalies and that time-resolved
thermography can be a useful noncontact method for
detecting delaminations.

The researchers evaluated a method for obtaining precise
ultrasonic measurements and mapping which provides data
on sound velocities, coefficients of attenuation, and peak
frequencies of echoes.  Also evaluated was an acousto-
ultrasonic technique that generates data on velocities and rates
of decay of waves in plates.

Among the study's finding were that speeds of sound vary
with fractions of volume occupied by pores and fibers.
Researchers also determined that coefficients of attenuation
increase with degrees of inhomogeneity of volume fractions
of pores and fibers.

The researchers' results also confirmed the efficacy of using
time-resolved thermography as a noncontact, nonionizing
method for detecting anomalies such as delaminations.  The
method is particularly valuable because it requires access to
only one side of a specimen.  This allows the technique to be
used at more stages of fabrication and processing than other
NDT techniques that require access to both sides.

SALE OF HERCULES' FIRM UPSETS SEMITECH

by Lucy Reilly
Sematech officials are attempting to block the anticipated sale
of a key U.S. company to Nippon Sanso of Japan, claiming the sale
would violate a proprietary and confidential information
contract.

Nippon subsidiary Matheson Gas Products Inc. wants to purchase
Semi-Gas Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Wilmington, Del.-based
Hercules Inc. With sales of $20 million last year, Massachusetts-
based Semi-Gas is the largest supplier of gas handling equipment
to the semiconductor industry worldwide, Hercules officials said.

"Sematech feels very strongly that it is against the best
interests of the U.S. semiconductor industry and the nation as a
whole for Semi-Gas Systems to be sold to a foreign competitor
whose apparent intentions are worldwide market domination," wrote
Turner Hasty, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Sematech, in a letter last week to David
Hollingsworth, chairman of Hercules.

Sematech is concerned that a final sale would provide inside
information on Sematech strategies to Nippon, thereby harming
national security and divulging proprietary U.S. technology
information. Semi-Gas and Sematech have been collaborating for
more than two years on technical development projects.

"Unauthorized disclosure of this information or any improper
attempts to obtain access to it will cause Sematech irreparable
harm," Hasty wrote.

Sematech General Counsel Robert Falstad, in a similar letter last
week to Nippon's legal team in New York City, wrote, "Hercules
Inc. and Semi-Gas Systems are not at liberty to disclose this
information to any third parties, including Matheson Gas Products
and/or Nippon Sanso, without Sematech's prior written consent."

Sematech is a joint government/industry consortium with 14
corporate members. The $250-million consortium receives half of
its funding annually from the Defense Department's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.

"I want to express my deep disappointment with your intentions to
sell Semi-Gas Systems to a foreign company," Hasty wrote. "In his
Jan. 10 letter, Dr. Sam Harrell, president of Semi/Sematech Inc.,
told you of our concern about the proposed sale of Semi-Gas
Systems, particularly to a foreign concern. We offered to work
with Hercules to help you find an American buyer for Semi-Gas
Systems. We did not even receive the courtesy of an
acknowledgement of Dr. Harrell's letter.

"We understand that Hercules Inc. has refused to consider a
leveraged buyout by Semi-Gas Systems management that would have
enabled it to remain an American company," Hasty continued. "The
interests of the U.S. Department of Defense may be affected by
any sale of Semi-Gas Systems to a foreign buyer. Accordingly, we
believe that appropriate agencies of the U.S. government will
review the propriety of this proposed transaction."

BABY BELLS BATTLE BIG BUSINESS: Regional Phone Cos. Undertake
`Misinformation Campaign'

by Lucy Reilly
The seven regional Bell companies are waging a "disinformation
campaign" in an effort to alter federal policy by arguing that
the nation's telecommunications industry is becoming second rate
to international competitors, charges a group of large U.S.
corporations.

Fourteen powerful firms, operating under the banner of the Ad Hoc
Users Committee, submitted their claims to the Department of
Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration recently. The committee blasted statements from
the Bell holding companies that other nations are surpassing the
United States in network modernization programs because of
regulatory and structural impediments in the United States.

"These arguments are nothing more than an attempt by the RBHCs to
build a case for expansion of their present monopolistic
positions to include services from which they are now restricted
and to use their positions to reap even greater financial rewards
than they have to date," the committee told NTIA.

"In short, far from being second rate, the United States
telecommunications infrastructure is unsurpassed by any other in
the world," the committee's report states. "There is absolutely
no basis for believing that existing regulatory policies and
practices have impeded maintenance and improvement of the
domestic telecommunications infrastructure. The United States is
investing in its telecommunication's infrastructure at rates of
23 to 92 percent higher than in Japan and the major European
nations."

The committee includes Aetna Life and Casualty Co., American
Airlines Inc., American Express Co., Boeing Computer Services,
Electric Data Systems Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Electric
Co., Honeywell Corp., IBM Corp. Monsanto Co., Online Computer
Library Center, J.C. Penney Co., Procter & Gamble Co., and Sears
Roebuck & Co.

The Ad Hoc Committee submitted its claims along with 120 other
groups this spring in response to a notice of inquiry published
by NTIA regarding a comprehensive study on the domestic
telecommunications infrastructure.

The majority of respondents want to revise the nation's
telecommunications policy. In particular, an abundance of state
governments and small companies filed wish lists for introducing
and improving the use of fiber-optic networks to rural areas.
States that filed extensive plans for comprehensive networks
include Minnesota, Tennessee and Washington.

Many submissions proposed plans for improving technological gaps
or enhancing local medical and educational programs. However,
comments by the nation's large corporations focused more on
controversial federal policies which regulate the industry.

Such policies "are burdens and critical liabilities to the U.S.
position in the global economy," wrote the National Center for
Telecommunications and Information Policy, the research and
political analysis division of the Public Service Satellite
Consortium.

"Until U.S. policymakers come to terms with these facts, both the
future of the U.S. industrial base and critical constitutional
protections embedded in our political culture will be placed in
continuing jeopardy," the division's report states.

Contrasting the Ad Hoc Committee's comments, the strongest plea
to loosen existing regulations was filed in a joint submission by
the Regional Bell Holding Cos., Southern New England Telephone
Co. and Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.

Other nations "are leapfrogging us by focusing on their own
future telecommunications needs and adopting policies to meet
these needs, whether the United States remains in the game or
not," the joint report states.

The phone companies argue that the use of private networks can
have unfair advantages for corporations using them. Private
networks can be designed to have excess circuitry. Operators of
these networks would then be in a position to resell switching or
line capacity to outside clients. Sears, Westinghouse, Merrill
Lynch, Northwest Airlines and Federal Express have spun off
telecommunication subsidiaries to do just that, the phone
companies's report notes.

The joint report urges NTIA to favor abandonment of the AT&T
Consent Decree and several other regulations in favor of
"forward-looking public policies," including:

 *  the establishment of depreciation rates that reflect the
    reality of technological change;
 *  the adoption of incentive regulations; and
 *  the elimination of cable cross-ownership restrictions, which
    ban local exchange carriers from offering video programs in
    their own territories.

AT&T agreed that policy changes are needed to end regulation of
the industry. Moreover, AT&T's comments to NTIA stated that the
U.S. government should foster competition abroad, promote
standard setting for interconnection and interoperation of
networks, adopt price-caps similar to what British Telecom did
several years ago and foster domestic research and development.

However, "the assertions that the nation's telecommunication
industry is `second best' and `falling behind' other nations are
nonsense," AT&T's report states. "This system has been planned
and built by private enterprise, not by the government, and
national telecommunications policy has been to place maximum
reliance on competition and market forces for three decades.

"Indeed, since the competitiveness policy was fully implemented
with the [divestiture of the Bell system in 1982], the
telecommunications industry has experienced economic growth,
technological innovation, and benefitted...users [which
is]...virtually unprecedented in American economic history,"
AT&T's report continues. "The decision was thus a necessary and
logical step and, indeed, the watershed event in implementing the
longstanding national competitiveness policy."

The National Cable Television Association expressed its concern
that the NTIA announcement suggested the adoption of mandatory
investment in a network to be funded by higher monthly telephone
rates levied on all citizens.

"Such a policy would create serious inefficiencies in the
delivery of telecommunications services and end up costing
average consumers billions of dollars for plant and equipment
designed to deliver services that they neither want nor need,"
the cable association wrote.

CONGRESS LEVITATES OVER MAGLEV
by Kimberly Dozier

Another magnetic levitation bill has been launched in Congress,
this one by Rep. Robert Mrazek (D-N.Y.), a member of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.

At a news conference last Wednesday, Mrazek said that if the
United States does not have its own maglev system designed and
ready to be put in place in the next three years, foreign
competitors will fill the void.

Mrazek's bill calls for $50 million in the 1991 transportation
budget for a national design competition to set the standard for
domestic maglev systems. The program would be managed by a maglev
administration set up within the Department of Transportation.
This group would establish minimum health, safety and
environmental standards for the industry, and establish safety
rules and regulations.

The $50 million would be the preliminary portion of $350 million
to be awarded to no more than six finalists in the design
competition, with an additional $600 million to be given out to
build a prototype system. The second-phase funding would be
available to any state or local government, public-private
consortium or any combination of government or private entities.
The prototype, at least 40 miles long, must comply with the
federally selected design standard and demonstrate the commercial
viability of the technology.

The funds are not meant to be the bread and butter of maglev R&D,
but a way to entice the domestic defense and aerospace industry
into joining the program. Maglev is seen by many as one of the
financial saving graces for defense contractors as they face a
decline in large military projects. Few industries, however, are
willing to risk R&D on what would be a radical departure from
today's transportation system without government leadership and
at least token financial support.

Should the program be successful, and contracts abound for
various new maglev routes around the country, industry investment
is expected to exceed the original $950 million from the federal
government. Mrazek predicts that maglev could become a $30-
billion to $60-billion industry.

Mrazek said that though he and others were disappointed by the
$6.1 million for maglev R&D in Transportation Secretary Skinner's
budget request for fiscal year 1991, he does not anticipate
administration roadblocks to the proposed legislation. He added
that he doesn't expect maglev to be a hard sell in Congress,
since many congressmen represent areas with companies that would
benefit from the program.

A growing number of bills are floating around on Capitol Hill
that favor maglev, including Sen. Ernest Hollings' (D-S.C.)
S.2236 which would require the Department of Transportation to
support more maglev research and foster a maglev system, and Sen.
Daniel Moynihan's (D-N.Y.) bill that would initiate maglev R&D
under the Federal Highway Administration's jurisdiction. Mrazek's
bill is the first to call for a federal maglev agency, and create
a competitive program both for prototype design and corridor
location.

FIRST CLEAN COAL RESULTS IN

The first test results are coming in for the $5-billion
government-industry Clean Coal Technology program, Department of
Energy officials say. An advanced pollution control process that
works inside the ductwork of existing coal-burning power plants
has met its design objectives, removing up to 70 percent of the
acid rain-causing sulfur pollutants from the exhaust gases of a
high-sulfur coal-burning plant in Ohio.

The $19.4-million project could lead to commercial use of the
"Coolside" technology, developed by Consolidation Coal Co. of
Pittsburgh. Coolside, an alternative to the more costly scrubber
technology, is the first of two processes to be demonstrated by
Babcock and Wilcox Co. of Alliance, Ohio, to control pollution
from older utility generating stations.

"The key advantage of the Coolside process is that by using the
plant's existing equipment to capture pollutants, it avoids the
need to build large, costly add-on scrubbing vessels," says
Robert Gentile, the Energy Department's Assistant Secretary for
Fossil Energy. "This is especially important in smaller or older
plants that are tightly spaced or have short remaining operating
lives. And, because the process operates downstream of the
boiler, it does not affect boiler performance and can be used on
a wide range of boiler types and sizes.

The Coolside process works by injecting sulfur-absorbing hydrated
lime powder into the combustion gases after they leave the coal
boiler. A mist of water droplets, along with sodium-based
additives, are sprayed into the gases as they move through the
plant's ductwork. The lime particles absorb the sulfur pollutants
which are then captured by existing particulate collection
devices. The water mist improves both the level of sulfur removal
and the performance of the particulate collection equipment. The
process produces a dry, disposable waste product, rather than the
wet sludge typical of today's scrubbers.

U.S COCOM PROPOSAL MAY FREEZE OUT USSR

by Aviva Freudmann
The U.S. government's Defense and Commerce departments are
finalizing a proposal for a two-tier approach to relaxing
controls on high technology exports to the Soviet bloc. The plan
calls for more liberal rules for Eastern Europe than for the
Soviet Union.

The Bush administration's aim is to introduce new rules at a
"historic" meeting of the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) in Paris on June 7 and 8.
The proposed two-tier structure will be the subject of talks next
month between the U.S. and its Western allies.

U.S. Commerce Department Undersecretary for Export Administration
Dennis Kloske, the point man for U.S. export control policy, told
a business conference last week that there is "an emerging
consensus" in the administration favoring the two-tier approach.

His remarks followed disclosure, two weeks earlier, that the
Defense Department had decided not to block exports of many U.S.
computers to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, thereby
allowing the Commerce Department control over the sales. The move
was seen as a victory for the Commerce Department, which has
pushed for sole authority to monitor high technology sales.

In his remarks last week, Kloske stressed that the proposed two-
tier export regime means that Eastern European governments will
have to introduce controls to prevent re-export of Western
technologies to  the Soviet Union.

Kloske also said that West Germany, in particular, should pay
more attention to ensuring that its high technology exports to
East Germany do not end up in Soviet hands.

The reason for retaining controls on high technology exports to
the USSR is fear that they will be used for military purposes.
The U.S. is not opposed to relaxing the rules on sales of
civilian non-strategic technologies to the Soviet Union, Kloske
said.

But trade experts quoted by Reuters say that Soviet officials are
unlikely to stand by idly while the rest of the Warsaw Pact
countries catch up with Western technology.

The Soviet Union "has been able to get its hands on much of this
technology for years, even when it was restricted," said Randy
Bregman, director of Soviet and East European services for Apco
Associates, a Washington-based consulting group.

Many of the export controls have more political than practical
value, he added. If Hungary or Poland acquires certain new
technologies, it won't take long for the know-how to show up in
the Soviet Union, in spite of formal controls, he said.

Western manufacturers have much to gain from relaxing controls on
exports to the Soviet Union because of that nation's large
market potential compared with Eastern Europe, Bregman added. He
said that keeping formal controls in place would cause the Soviet
Union short-term difficulties, particularly as it tries to
modernize its backward telecommunications system.

The Soviets use a phone system that is more than 30 years old. It
has only about 10 phone lines per 100 people, a ratio lower than
that in Hungary, East Germany or Czechoslovakia. This compares
with 90 phones per 100 people in the U.S., and 60 lines per 100
in Western Europe.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said recently that the
United States would agree to exports of 10-year-old telephone
technology, which he said would help the Soviet economy. However,
the older technology would force the Soviets to use an analog
dial-up system rather than the digital push-button technology now
common in the West.

Mosbacher, speaking in West Germany, explained that United
States policy is to support perestroika, "but the reality is that
[the Soviets] have the potential to be a great military threat."

The use of 10-year old technology is not likely to be acceptable
in the Soviet Union, argued Stepan Pachikov, a Soviet computer
scientist who heads ParaGraph, a joint venture with a U.S. firm
that publishes Moscow's first computer newspaper.

"If we wanted to just upgrade 30 or 40 percent of our phone
system, then the answer would be `yes,' 10-year-old technology
is good enough," Pachikov said.

But he pointed out that Western nations had a tough time of it
when they tried to adapt their analog phone systems to digital
computer transmissions. "If we want to communicate adequately
with the West, then the equipment on both sides of the line must
be equal."

The head of ParaGraph's U.S. partner, IDG, agreed that export
barriers are increasingly unenforceable. On a recent trip to
Hungary, IDG president Patrick McGovern learned from government
officials that returning Hungarian tourists had brought with them
at least 70,000 computers of the sort that appear on CoCom's
restricted list.

DOE CONSIDERS FOREIGN PARTICIPANTS IN SSC

by Lucy Reilly
The Department of Energy is considering a controversial proposal
to accept bids from foreign companies to construct the magnets
for the $8-billion Superconducting Super Collider. Ideally, DOE
(and its contractors) would prefer direct financial contributions
from foreigners, but foreign governments "would prefer to
participate in the hardware as opposed to simply outright grant
of cash," says Russ Wylie, director of external affairs at the
SSC site headquarters in Dallas.

U.S. industry executives are concerned that if the SSC contracts
are opened up, they won't be able to compete against foreign
companies who often are bankrolled by their own governments.

"Foreign companies operate under a subsidized umbrella and will
be able to underbid U.S. industry and run away with the whole
ball of wax," says Carl Rosner, president of Intermagnetics
General Corp. of Guilderland, N.Y.

The companies that are thought to have the best chances of
landing contracts to make the magnets for the SSC include General
Dynamics, Westinghouse, Grumman and Italian-based Ansaldo.
Ansaldo has hooked up with Grumman in pursuit of an SSC contract.

The request for proposals for the magnet portion of the SSC are
expected to be released in the next few weeks. A total of 10,000
magnets, worth an estimated $1 billion, will be used in the
collider.

The exclusion of foreign firms could generate further conflict
for the United States, which recently began negotiations with the
European Community to conduct joint research in several areas of
technology. In addition, closing the process to foreigners may
not bode well for U.S. officials, who have been pushing for other
nations to open access to their consortia and industrial
contracts.

"I think there are other ways [the government] can get sufficient
funding" without having to open bidding to foreign firms, said
one industry source. "It's unlikely in the initial stages of the
project that DOE will open the floodgates. For the U.S. to be
competitive, it needs to keep some of the technology inside."

SUPERCOMPUTER RESEARCH PICKING UP IN TENNESSEE

Using a new massively parallel Intel supercomputer at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory as a hub, officials at Oak Ridge and
the University of Tennessee are setting up a cluster of new
research institutes. The institutes, which receive backing from
major computer companies, will carry out research in physics, the
environment and computer sciences.

The effort is designed to bring supercomputer-based research in
Tennessee to the same level as other high-tech oriented states,
especially neighboring North Carolina and Alabama.

Use of the Intel iPSC/860 machine instead of the more common Cray
non-parallel supercomputers should also give the state a lead in
parallel processing techniques, says Jack Dongarra, who is
directing the new computer studies program.

Dongarra, who left the Argonne National Laboratory last September
to take a joint Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee position, says
use of the lower cost parallel processors appears to be a more
efficient way to produce supercomputing power than the Cray
approach which uses more expensive single components. The new
Intel machine costs $3 million compared to at least $20 million
for a Cray.

"We take the long-term view that parallel processing is not a fad
but is here to stay," says Dongarra. "We believe that what we are
starting to do here is the way supercomputing will be done in the
future."

Intel unveiled the iPSC/860 in January saying it provided high-
speed processing at one-tenth the cost of industry leader Cray.
Besides Oak Ridge, NASA's Ames Research Center in California has
received one, and some large corporations including Ford Motor
Co. and Prudential-Bache Co. have placed orders.

The new Oak Ridge machine, delivered in January, has 128
processors or separate nodes arranged to work together. Working
at full capacity, using a "hypercube" networking principle, it
can perform 5.2-billion operations per second (5.2 gigaflops).

It replaces an Intel-PSC/2 machine which has 64 processors and is
not classified as a supercomputer. The Oak Ridge lab "traded in"
the older computer when it bought the new one, but Intel has
decided to donate the older machine, worth about $500,000, back
to the University of Tennessee.

Thus, says Dongarra, the new Computational Sciences Institute
will be able to use the smaller machine to do preparatory
research for projects involving the larger supercomputer. Oak
Ridge itself has had a parallel processing research program since
1984 based on the smaller machine.

The new institute, with a start-up budget of $500,000, will
concentrate on developing new algorithms for parallel processing.
It also will develop graphics applications for use with parallel
processors.

At the same time, it will work with the other joint institutes to
tackle several "grand challenges," including world climate
modelling andd superconductivity theory, says Dongarra. In these
cases, the computer group will lend special expertise to the
other research groups when they get stuck on problems.

The Computational Sciences Institute has recently held talks with
both IBM and Digital Corp. which could lead to corporate funding
for some of the research.

The Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee project that is farthest
along is the Institute for Heavy Ion Research, created in 1988.
This group has focused on the behavior of atomic nuclei under
stress using supercomputer techniques.

As a side effect of the heavy ion research, the institute has
proposed a new gamma-ray detection device, the "gammasphere," and
has been selected by DOE as the preferred site for building the
$16-million machine.

A second joint physics research unit, the Institute for High-
Energy Research, is being started by Oak Ridge and the University
of Tennessee. This institute will focus on building detector
equipment for the Superconducting Super Collider and developing
SSC experiments.

Oak Ridge officials have recently started efforts to bring work
on the proposed L-Star SSC detector to the lab using the new
institute as a means of attraction.

Another joint institute, still in the planning stages, would
perform research in both the energy and environment fields,
complementing work on greenhouse effect problems underway at Oak
Ridge. The supercomputer would be used particularly for
atmospheric modeling.

University of Tennessee officials say that the two Intel machines
give them direct access to a level of supercomputer power that is
rare for most universities. They hope this will give their
researchers an advantage in winning research funding.

At the same time, the new computational sciences institute is
looking forward to the purchase of an improved supercomputer with
1,024 parallel processors and a capacity of one-quadrillion
operations per second (1 teraflop). The $15-million unit will be
available in two to three years.

According to Dongarra, securing a one-teraflop machine would put
the institute in a world leadership position for parallel
computing and attract additional research work from several
industrial and government sources.

ASME TO SCREEN COUNTERFEITS

Counterfeit and substandard screws, bolts, washers and other
fasteners will have a harder time making it into U.S. markets
thanks to the newly initiated American Society of Mechanical
Engineers' fastner accreditation program (FAP).  "In many
instances, suppliers provided bogus quality certifications and
other misrepresentations to their buyers," says SME. This has
lead to millions of counterfeit fasteners with have cracked,
sheared or otherwise failed in helicopters, trucks, bridges,
nuclear power plants, coal mines, tanks and other military
equipment.

SME hopes that the accreditation program will help government
efforts in stemming the flow of counterfeit goods by subjecting
would-be fastener suppliers to stringent reviews. Until now, the
Defense Department and aerospace industry had no way of
determining whether or not they were dealing with a supplier
capable of producing high strength, high quality and safe
fastener products, says ASME.

U.S. FIBER-OPTIC STRATEGY PROPOSED

The fiber-optic public interest group called "Opt In America" has
filed a formal complaint with the federal government charging
that the United States lacks vision for the future of fiber
optics. "We hear a parochial debate on process and
technique....We need a driving vision of where we want to end
up," says Opt Chairman John Eger. "We had that with telephones,
cable and broadcasting. We do not yet have that with
fiber optics."

Eger says that of 94 million homes in the United States, a scant
15,000 are scheduled for fiber-optic wiring. Meanwhile, Japan and
several European countries are moving ahead with fiber-optic
plans for homes. Opt advocates a switched, broadband fiber-optic
network to the home.

AST MARKETS COMPUTERS TO JAPAN

Irvine, Calif.-based AST Research Inc. is testing the waters of
the Tokyo marketplace with the first U.S. personal computer that
can run both the most popular Japanese and American software
packages. The company's SX/16 "will be seen as a test case of
the openness of the Japanese market," says one Tokyo analyst.
"If it doesn't do at all well, there will be a lot of harsh
words." The machine can run the many Japanese-language software
packages developed for computers made by NEC Corp., the Japanese
giant that controls about half the domestic PC market.

James Ashbrook, senior vice president of AST, says the computer
would be ideal for multinational companies that work in both
Japanese and English. Industry analysts say AST's success will
depend on how successful the company is at cultivating
distribution channels in the tough Japanese market rather than
the quality of the product.

U. WASH. MANY COLORED DISPLAY

University of Washington engineers have invented an
image-processing system that may be "the world's sharpest,
fastest and least expensive," says the Seattle-based university.
The system consists of a single circuit board for the NeXT
computer that produces images with several million colors rather
than the 256-line limit of most computers, says Yongmin Kim,
professor of electrical engineering and leader of the research.
"It executes incredibly complex functions with a speed
approximating that of a supercomputer...but will cost about half
as much to manufacture as other image-processing systems, which
sell from $65,000 to $30,000 depending on the application."

The system will have the most immediate application in medical
technology, researchers say. The computer will yield
three-dimensional, true-color X-rays, which can be manipulated to
examine all sides. "New X-rays can be popped onto the screen in
a second, and up to 16 images can be called up at once with the
push of two buttons," says the University of Washington.
Previous technology could display only one picture with poor
color resolution and difficult manipulation of the image.

Kim's team received primary funding for system development from
University of Washington with some money contributed by the Navy.
The system has been licensed non-exclusively to Daewoo Telecom
Co. of Korea, and will be marketed by Leading Edge Products Inc.
in the fall.

NATIONAL VEHICLE SAFETY PROGRAM

Lockheed Integrated Solutions of Sunnyvale, Calif., has won a
$4.5 million contract from the Arizona and California departments
of Transportation and to run the Crescent project, which is the
culmination of five years of research by Arizona's Heavy Vehicle
Electronic License Plate Program. The Crescent project's goal is
to integrate new technologies to improve the productivity and
safety of commercial vehicles. Lockheed will conduct a two and
one-half year test of about 4,500 commercial vehicles along a
crescent-shaped route of western states. A data collection system
consisting of weigh-in-motion, automatic vehicle identification
and automatic vehicle classification equipment will be installed
in a number of locations along the route. Results will be used to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management
by transit agencies, state and local government.

SOVIET AIRLINE BUYS GE ENINES

The Soviet national airline, Aeroflot, has selected General
Electric's CF6-80C2 aircraft engine to power up to 10 Airbus
Industrie A310-300 aircraft. The engine order is worth
potentially more than $150 million. "We're very excited about
this order," said Donald Morrison, director of European sales
for GE aircraft engines. "We've built a strong presence in
Eastern Europe over the past several years, and adding Aeroflot
to our customer list really solidifies our position." GE is the
only western aircraft engine manufacturer to have received engine
orders from an Eastern European airline.

AUSTRALIA: CSIRO TO LOSE NEW CHIEF - MCINTOSH TO HEAD DEFENCE DEPT

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

CSIRO will soon be seeking a new Chief Executive as a
result of Federal Government moves to switch the
incumbent, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, to the top job in the
Defence Department.

No formal announcement of the change is expected in the
near future, but informed sources in Canberra have
assured Scitech the move is definitely 'on', providing his
on-going battle with illness does not become a major
problem.

Any such transfer would make good administrative sense
in the light of Dr McIntosh's outstanding defence-oriented
professional background and would be likely to be welcomed
by the armed services. It would certainly be welcomed by
our military allies in Britain and the United States.

It would also be seen as a clear promotion for Dr McIntosh
- from running CSIRO and answering to a junior Minister
(Mr Peter McGauran) to supervising a $10 billion Defence
operation which has a Minister (Mr Ian McLachlan) inside
the Howard Cabinet.

The sources said Dr McIntosh, whose start at CSIRO
coincidentally occurred as the Coalition Government took
office, had been disappointed with the comparatively
junior status given to science by the new administration.
His feelings had not been dispelled by the Federal Budget's
bogus 'increase' in CSIRO funding (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9),
they said.

Dr McIntosh was recently announced as the head of a
special committee appointed to conduct a thorough review
of the Defence Department. It is expected that this role
will be used as the lever to subsequently appoint him as
head of the Defence Department, thereby utilising the
specific knowledge he would have gained through the
inquiry to significantly improve its vast and complex
administration.

(The review coincides with separate plans to revamp the
operational capabilities of the Army, including the transfer
of 1000 non-combat personnel to combat units).

He is expected to officially remain as chief of the CSIRO at
least until the Defence inquiry is completed. (The current
target date for the review report - and an implementation
plan - is March 10 next year).

The Government is placing great store in the results of the
inquiry, having indicated it wants to find annual efficiency
savings worth around $500 million from the Defence
operating budget. Ironically, the Government had
announced at the time of the Federal Budget that Defence
was the only portfolio which would not face some level of
funding cuts.

Mr McLachlan said the review was intended to "examine
specific management activities in Defence with a view to
eliminating needless duplication, making appropriate use
of commercialisation options, and reflect, where
appropriate, modern business practices".

He said about $5 billion of the Department's annual budget
was spent on areas other than designated combat forces
and related equipment. The emphasis of the review would
be "efficiency gains" in these areas, ranging from logistical
support "down to postage stamps and stationery".

The review committee will include: Vice Admiral Robert
Walls, Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force; Dr
Richard Brabin Smith, Chief Defence Scientist; Mr Ian
Burgess, Chairman of AMP; Mr John Stone, former
Secretary of the Treasury; and Mr Andrew Michaelmore,
Executive General Manager, Business Development,
Planning and Technology, of Western Mining Corporation.

Dr McIntosh, 53, graduated in science (honours) from the
ANU and later obtained a PhD in physics there. His
working career started with the Weapons Research
Establishment, at Salisbury, South Australia. After serving
two years' national service (having attained the rank of
Major) he became a lecturer in mathematics and computer
science at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
(RMIT).

He joined the Defence Department in 1974 and after a
series of promotions through the Australian Public Service
became Chief of Capital Procurement in the Defence
Department in 1988, then Secretary of the Department of
Industry, Technology and Commerce in 1990.

During 1991 he became the UK's Chief of Defence
Procurement, responsible for spending $20 billion a year,
and played a major part in introducing the latest Trident
missiles to Britain's armed services. His work there was
highly praised and led to a knighthood, personally
bestowed earlier this year by the Queen. (He uses the title
only in Britain). The US Government also gave him its
highest possible civilian defence honour for foreigners, the
Medal for Distinguished Public Service, (Scitech, Vol 16, No
7) for his work in coordinating and strengthening the
defence efforts of Britain and America.

Dr McIntosh returned to Australia to takeup his
appointment as Chief Executive of the CSIRO. A Fellow of
the Royal Aeronautical Society, UK, his list of achievements
includes numerous prizes in fields including military arts
and accountancy.

Clearly, his background indicates his level of professional
interest in all areas of Defence and his level of
achievement in Australia and overseas is such that he is
eminently qualified for the post of Secretary of the
Defence Department.

It is understood that the Government has not yet
considered his replacement at CSIRO.

AUSTRALIA: SENATE QUESTIONS ON SCITECH STORY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Last month's Scitech front page story (Natural Heritage
Trust a fraud) led to questions being asked of the
Government in the Senate.

The Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator
Meg Lees, sought responses to a number of matters raised
in Scitech from the Leader of the Government, Senator
Robert Hill (see next story for full transcript).

These included statements from Scitech's source - a senior
Coalition advisor - that the trust is "a cynical political
invention and a blackmail device" and that it "is a gigantic
and disgusting sham".

Senator Lees also raised the comments of the source that
the Trust concept had been "a blatant blackmail device
created by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr
Andrew Robb; that the plan had been imposed upon
Senator Rod Kemp (the former shadow Minister for
Environment); and is now being imposed upon you
(Senator Hill)"

Other questions related to the claim by our source that
"senior Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doors
about the policy" and that "the deceit had sickened this
particular advisor and a number of other Coalition staffers
who are genuinely concerned about the national environment
for the sake of their children and for the nation's
long-term future".

Senator Hill made no attempt to answer any of the specific
allegations, not even the suggestion that he had been
`saddled' with the Trust policy. He simply twice made brief
comments outlining the Government's usual claims about
the need for the partial privatisation of Telstra if money
was to be made available to start to rectify the continent's
many serious environmental problems - land degradation,
soil salinity, and rising water tables.

Other Government Senators sat silent throughout the
questions and the answers. Not one attempted to rebut the
allegations even by way of an interjection.

Senator Lees later issued a press release, again referring
to the Scitech front page article, in which she said the
advisor's admission had confirmed every criticism of the
Trust concept which had come from the Australian
Democrats.

Senator Hill issued no press release on the allegations and
has apparently made no public comment on the matter.

Despite the Government's public silence it started a major
internal search for the source of our story, with a number
of people being wrongly accused by Coalition Ministers,
MPs, Senators, and staffers alike.

Scitech even received a call from a long-time Liberal Party
acquaintance (an advisor in a very high office) willing to
volunteer `nominees' while trying unsuccessfully to learn
the identify of the source. Again, there was absolutely no
questioning of the accuracy of the story.

During the subsequent debate on the Telstra (Dilution of
Public Ownership) Bill, some days later, Senator Lees again
repeated many of the claims published in Scitech,. Yet
again, there was no denial of the details from the
Government.

AUSTRALIA: TRUST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The official Hansard record (see story above) is as follows:

Senator Lees: My question is to the Minister for the
Environment. What is your reaction to the following two
direct quotes from a magazine published today? The first
one is: The linkage to the environment is just a sop,
designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to
blackmail other parties and the general community into
accepting it. The second one is: A lot of the opponents of
the Telstra sale have long suggested the Natural Heritage
Trust was a cynical political invention and a blackmail
device. Some have also suggested it was a creation of Mr
Robb. They have always been correct on both counts,
despite the Government's continuing denials. It is time the
community was told the truth - the Natural Heritage Trust
is a gigantic and disgusting sham.

Senator Hill: I suppose we will learn in the supplementary
question the source of the quote. The answer of course is
that this Government is intent on reinvesting a large sum
of money in the natural capital of Australia. The time for
that is overdue. Through ignorance, in particular, we as a
nation have done enormous damage to our natural
environment. We have failed to appreciate how fragile it
is. We adopted European farming practices, for example,
without understanding fully how they would affect our
streams and our soils. As a result of that, there is now
very severe degradation, salinity, and rising water tables -
a lot of major damage that is going to take a very large
sum of money to remedy.

The Government, of course, needs to obtain that sum of
money. There are only two real sources. For the former
Government, it would have been to borrow more. They
borrowed literally billions more than they raised. I guess
you borrow or you tax more, or you sell an asset and
reinvest part of the capital proceeds of that asset in this
particular task. That is what we have chosen to do - a very
legitimate policy decision to sell one-third of Telstra, a
telecommunications company, and to reinvest $1 billion of
the proceeds of that sale in our natural environment. I
personally do not see any sham in that. It seems to me to
be a sound policy, sensibly based and something that is -
certainly, the need to remedy, the need to reinvest the
capital - strongly supported by the majority of
Australians.

What is interesting is that, as the debate develops, even
the funding source of it is becoming supported by many,
many more Australians. I hope that in the next few weeks
the Senate will see fit to support the Government on its
piece of legislation to provide that capital fund, and that
we can then go about doing something really worthwhile
for the natural environment that previous Governments
have not been prepared or able to do.

Senator Lees: I thank the Minister for his answer, but
what we are looking for is a decisive commitment. If I can
just advise you that the magazine I quoted from is Scitech
magazine, published today, and the quote has actually
come from a senior Coalition advisor.

What is your reaction to his revelations - again, I am
using his words - that the Telstra link is a gigantic and
disgusting sham; that it's a blatant blackmail device
created by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party,
Andrew Robb; that the plan was imposed upon Rod Kemp
and now is being imposed on you; that senior Coalition
MPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy;
and that the deceit had sickened this particular advisor
and a number of other Coalition staffers who are
genuinely concerned about the national environment for
the sake of their children and the nation's long-term
future? This is really a question about the seriousness of
this Government's failure to do something about the
problem.

Senator Hill: The Honourable Senator gives me one more
minute to urge upon her to take an action that will really
benefit the Australian environment and therefore accord
with the wishes of the Australian people; that is, support
the sale of one-third of Telstra and help set-up this $1
billion fund to reinvest in the natural capital of Australia.

Yes, Senator, we will continue to support the environment
through recurrent expenditure, but what is now needed is
more - what is now needed is the reinvestment of a very
large capital sum. If you work together with us, if we put
that $1 billion in place, we earn income on that $1 billion,
and we add that to our normal recurrent expenditure, we
could provide an annual appropriation over the next five
years of very substantial sums of money that could make
a difference to vegetation, to streams and waterways, to
the national reserve system, to coasts and seas, and that

AUSTRALIA: A MESSAGE FROM THE PUBLISHER

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Thank you to all our subscribers who responded to the
survey published in our August edition. We were well
pleased with the response rate and the level of positive
feedback.

There was a very strong indication of the types of
information you want from Scitech and over the coming
months we will be increasing our coverage of these
important areas at the expense of those you told us were
less popular.

The most frequent negative comment, from a minority of
respondents, was that Scitech is taking a political stance.
We have no preference for any political party and we
believe it is our responsibility to report on the activities of
whatever government is in power, the reactions of the
community we serve to these activities (especially where
these are against the message that the government is
seeking to portray) and to make informed analysis and
comment. However we will in future clearly distinguish
comment from reporting by introducing an editorial
column (see back page), which a majority of respondents
indicated would be of interest to them.

There was also some interest in an annual index. To
accommodate the needs of people who wish to reference
articles in Scitech we have decided to make the entire
contents of the 1996 editions available on disc in ascii text
so they can be searched using any text retrieval software.

The price of this is $100 for customers who subscribed
prior to January 1996 and $350 for non-subscribers (a
discount is available for those who started their
subsciption in 1996). Please contact Michaela Baer at our
office for details.

AUSTRALIA: DEPUTY PM PLEDGES SUPPORT TO SCIENCE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, has pledged
that the Howard Government will give continuing support
to science and technology - and its Labor predecessor's
ambition of establishing Australia as "the clever country".

His remarks came during a speech to the Australian
Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering
(AATSE) last month on the topic: Science and Technology -
A Vital Part of the APEC Agenda.

"The Australian Government is working to ensure that
developments in science, technology and engineering are
serving the interest we, and all nations, have in improved
standards of living. And we are pursuing, through
international organisations, the strengthening of a world-
wide intellectual property regime", Mr Fischer said.

"Science and technology are integral to discussions about
improving economic performance and strengthening
economic cooperation. One of this century's major lessons
is that the economic performance of a nation cannot be
isolated from its performance in science and technology, or
its investment in R&D. The fact is that science and
technology are vitally important to good economic
performance.

"Since the turn of the century, per capita incomes in the
OECD nations have increased sixfold in real terms. Most of
this increase comes as a result of increased productivity
and this, in turn, is usually generated by increases in
knowledge and technical advancements. And, of course,
increased knowledge and technical advancements are
driven by developments in science, technology and
engineering - the link is clear and well understood", he
said.

Mr Fischer said the Coalition recognised the importance of
international transfers of knowledge and technology to the
competitiveness of local industry. This was essential
because the majority of the world's breakthroughs in R&D
occurred in only five countries - the US, the UK, Japan,
Germany and France. Smaller countries, including
Australia, made valuable contributions to scientific
knowledge, often in specialised fields. Australia had
specialised advantages in several areas - natural resource
science, agricultural technology, geoscience, and ecology.

"The Coalition Government fully understands that science,
technology and engineering are central to advances in
productivity and new product development. Science and
technology underpins Australia's economic future in an
increasingly competitive world.

"The Government is committed to making the most. of
Australia's undoubted excellence in key areas of science,
technology and engineering R&D. We are also committed to
encouraging free and fair international access to scientific
and technological developments. Australia's reputation as
an innovator is well deserved - and it is due to the efforts
of those here, and all your colleagues, that we can be
proud to call Australia a clever country", the Deputy PM
said.

AUSTRALIA: MCGAURAN RUNS AWARENESS PROGRAM

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's $2 million Science and
Technology Awareness Program appears to have a bright
future, at least in the short-term.

This follows the decision of the Minister for Science and
Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, to take effective personal
control of the scheme. Informed sources in Canberra
suggest there are two elements to that decision: it will
help to promote community awareness of the benefits of
science and technology expenditure and it is a good way
for the Minister to raise his current level of media
exposure.

Meanwhile, officials responsible for the day to day
administration of the scheme have called for applications
for grants in 1997. They said: "We are looking for fresh,
new ideas to raise the profile of science, engineering and
technology, to change the way Australians thinks about
these vital areas of endeavour - and to capture the
interest of young Australians".

Information/application kits are available through the
Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, Canberra.
Tel: 06 276 1714. Fax: 06 276 2002. Applications close on
December 23.

Editor's note: Mr McGauran is extremely ambitious,
regarding himself as a good chance to ultimately become
Leader of the National Party. He has quickly established a
reputation in relevant circles as an extremely energetic -
and approachable Minister. But he is also known to be
somewhat frustrated by his present junior status in the
Howard Ministry.

The science awareness program provides an excellent
vehicle for the Minister to promote himself to the
community and to the media. It allows him to choose from
a long list of "goods news" items (research projects and
scientific breakthroughs) which are of widespread interest
and which are unlikely to attract the cynical response
which many other political activities can engender.

AUSTRALIA: CHIEF SCIENTIST: FASTS CONCERN

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Coalition Government's plans to permanently change
the role of Chief Scientist to a part-time appointment (now
rumoured to be one day a week!) has raised concerns
within the science community.

The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological
Societies (FASTS), which represents a total membership of
40,000 across both fields, has publicly questioned the
move.

The President of FASTS, Dr Joe Baker, has admitted there
could be some benefits to the concept of appointing a
scientist who is still actively working beside research
colleagues in the field for much of the time. He said this
would maintain real links with the science community and
help to avoid the new Chief Scientist from becoming
bogged-down within the structure of the bureaucracy.

But there are many minuses involved in the idea, Dr Baker
said. The most obvious was the logistical impossibility of a
one-day a week Chief Scientist effectively keeping abreast
of all relevant developments across "the sprawling world
of Australian science in sufficient detail to offer credible
advice to the Government".

The issue is to be discussed at the FASTS Council meeting
later this month. The Minister for Science and Technology,
Mr Peter McGauran, will attend a session of the Council
and Dr Baker has indicated the Minister will be questioned
on the matter.

No date for an announcement of the new Chief Scientist
has yet been determined but Canberra sources believe it is
imminent.

AUSTRALIA: SCIENCE FUNDING AND CSIRO 'SAFE'

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Science funding - and the existence and operations of the
CSIRO - are likely to be maintained in coming years,
according to the CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm
McIntosh.

He also predicted a continuation of Government-sponsored
schemes to help promote industry R&D and an
evolutionary change in the existing structure of
Government (State and Federal) research activities.

These ideas emerged when Dr McIntosh gave the Brodie-Hall
Address in Perth last month.

He said: "The first prediction I'll make is that Governments
in Australia, particularly Federal Governments, but I think
probably also State Governments, will continue to support
science strongly. Now you might think that's a pretty rash
sort of a prediction to be making, but if you look back over
the past few years, by and large, State and Federal
Governments have given science a fairly prominent place.
And in the last (Federal) Budget, when this was a
reforming conservative Government dedicated to massive
slashes in outlays, science was one of the few areas to
survive relatively intact.

"The university system as a whole was cut, but science in
universities was preferentially protected - not completely,
but preferentially. The amount of money put through the
research grants process for universities was increased for
science infrastructure.

"CSIRO was sustained at about the same level of funding -
there were some interesting ups and downs (Scitech, Vol
16, No 9) but it survived with about the same money and
has an opportunity to increase its funding in some
interesting constructive ways.

"Now all of this happened at a time when the Government
was taking $4 billion off in the first year and another $4
billion in the second. That says that somebody in the
Government at least felt science was worth funding and I
think it will persist into the next century," Dr McIntosh
said.

"The second thing I will predict is that the structures will
change, however slowly. State Governments are getting
out of extension services and by and large they are
changing the structures. We, among others, are finding
ourselves in the position of being heavily pressed for
mergers, take-overs, joint-ventures and other mechanisms
that would have the effect of progressively, over time,
changing the research structures in Australia.

He said: "There is a serious set of discussions going on in
that way with a number of the States, and I would guess
that in due course this will go for the Federal agencies as
well.

"The third prediction I would make is that we are by no
means at the end of the schemes designed to encourage
R&D. I think the tax schemes are dead because of the
recent history regardless of whether that is a good or a
bad thing. I believe it will become clear that the other
schemes are not necessarily doing all the things that were
done before and it will probably take two or three rounds
before we have schemes which by popular acclaim are
likely to generate the sorts of internationally-competitive
R&D that we need. So I suspect that is not too stable.

"If all of that happens - and I say that is what I believe is
most likely - then I think we are likely to have quite a
positive environment for R&D in Australia," Dr McIntosh
said.

"The final comment, or prediction if you like, is that CSIRO
will continue in much of its present form. Now that's a
pretty rash prediction indeed. There are two ways that
could be untrue. Firstly, the Government could do to CSIRO
what New Zealand did to its equivalent body (DSIR) -
break it up into little pieces that mirror major activities
and then flog them off or privatise them, or whatever.

"I don't see any evidence of that happening at the
moment, and as long as CSIRO is actually contributing
through large multi-disciplinary sorts of activities, I think
there is a compelling case not to do so. We now have this
almost unique institution, only the French have anything
like it. We have this almost unique capability in the world
to tackle large problems and I think we'll keep it.

"The other thing that could be seriously threatening to the
existence of an organisation like CSIRO is not so much that
we would break it up or change it internally, but that we
would actually starve it to death. Again, I see very little
likelihood of that happening," he said.

AUSTRALIA: UNION'S POST-BUDGET FEARS EASING

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Assurances from the Howard Government and CSIRO
senior management have partly allayed fears within the
CSIRO staff union that widespread sackings and asset sales
would follow this year's Budget allocations.

The Secretary of the CSIRO Division of the Community
Public Sector Union, Mr Peter O'Donoghue, told Scitech he
was "never 100 percent certain" that CSIRO would manage
the loan of $60 million in a way that would not adversely
impact of its staff. Now he feels less concerned about the
immediate future of his members than he did at the time
of the Budget announcement.

He had been pessimistic about the likely impact of the
Budget because of the Government's announcement that it
was increasing funding when it was actually taking back
the 'extra' money (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9).

"I was fearful that the organisation might spend the so-
called extra money without making adequate provision for
repaying it down the track. If that happened I could not
see that asset sales would recoup the money and I feared
there would have to be widespread sackings as a result,"
Mr O'Donoghue said.

"Since that time I have had discussions with the CSIRO
Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. Following those
talks I feel less apprehensive than before, but we always
have to remain wary to protect the interests of our
members.

"Apart from our concerns about the Budget arrangements,
we have been anxious for our members and jobs due to
proposals by the Government to considerably reduce
CSIRO's cash reserves. In the meeting with Dr McIntosh he
said discussions with the Government on this matter had
been positive but a final decision had not yet been
reached.

"The union is seeking a meeting with the Minister for
Science and Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, in order to
obtain assurances on this." Mr O'Donoghue said.

Licensing of the technology for CSIRO is being handled by
a Queensland firm, Comserve Australia Pty Ltd. It has
signed a joint marketing agreement for Indonesia with a
the Jakarta-based PT Ramatelino Perdana Consultant. The
Minister said the deal was a first for CSIRO and for private
sector organisations in Australia and Indonesia. He said
the leading-edge technology would assist authorities in
Indonesia to properly plan strategies for land-use, water

AUSTRALIA: ENVIRONMENT'S NEW NAME

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Five major groupings within the Department of
Environment, Sport and Territories are to be identified in
future as Environment Australia.

The Minister for Environment, Senator Robert Hill, said he
regarded the new name as an important symbolic change.
He said: "It recognises that environment functions have
reached a point in their history where a new approach is
needed to achieve the aims of the Government."

The departmental groups to be combined within
Environment Australia are:

* Australian and World Heritage Group (combining the
functions of national and international heritage).

* Environment Protection Group (consolidating existing
environment protection functions with additional
responsibilities, such as climate change and Greenhouse
activities).

* Biodiversity Group (combines several major components
including biodiversity conservation, sustainable land and
water use, and reserve and wildlife management).

* Portfolio Marine Group (to reflect the Government's
priorities in this area, coordinate coasts and clean seas
programs, and develop an overall marine policy for the
Commonwealth).

* Environment Priorities and Coordination Group (will
support the Environment Executive on international,
economic and environment information matters, and will
manage major cross-portfolio activities).

Senator Hill said the restructure would not impact on the
statutory functions and independence of statutory advice
from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service
(ANPWS) or the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC). He
said policy work will be focussed in the Department with
the authorities concentrating on their statutory wildlife,
parks and heritage protection responsibilities.

The new structure will become fully operational later this
year, following the development of sectional structures for
each functional group. This process would involve
consultation with staff, he said.

The Minister has also announced the names of the Senior
Executives of four of the five groupings. They are: Ms
Sharon Sullivan (Australian and World Heritage Group); Dr
Peter Bridgewater (Biodiversity Group - and Director
ANPWS); Environment Priorities and Coordination Group,
Mr Phillip Toyne; and Dr Ian McPhail (Portfolio Marine
Group - and Chairman, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority). He said the head of the Environment
Protection Group would be announced in the near future.

AUSTRALIA: INSECT SUSPECTS IN VIRUS ESCAPE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Research into the unauthorised spread of rabbit calicivirus
from its island testing site off South Australia in October
last year has reinforced suspicions that insects were
responsible.

A range of genetic tests undertaken at the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory have found that a range of
insects, including bushflies, blowflies, and mosquitos, are
capable of carrying the virus.

Molecular tests on 16 separate groups of insects captured
in areas where the disease had become established found
that 13 groups carried some evidence of the virus and one
carried live calicivirus.

The CSIRO was seriously embarrassed by the 'escape' of
the virus while it was allegedly undergoing intensive
testing to ensure it would not harm humans, livestock, or
native fauna.

Although not yet conclusive, scientists regard the tests as
a good indication that the rapid spread of the virus from
Wardang Island to all mainland States and Territories had
been essentially caused by insects. (There are some
theories that outbreaks of the virus in isolated rural
districts in NSW were the result of anxious farmers
trading in the carcasses of diseased rabbits to overcome
delays in the official approval for its release).

Meanwhile, the Minister for Primary Industries and
Energy, Mr John Anderson, has officially approved the
release of the disease at 280 locations throughout
Australia (NSW, 50 sites; Queensland, 50; South Australia,
50; Victoria, 50; WA, 40; NT, 30; ACT, 5; and Tasmania, 5).

Officials in Tasmania have refused to participate in the
program - at this stage - pending the results of further
testing on its wildlife species because of fears the virus
could produce unexpected results.

Farmers and wildlife officers working in regions where the
virus has now been established for up to 12 months have
reported a staggering reduction in rabbit numbers and the
relatively fast re-establishment of many native shrubs,
trees, and grasses - some of which had not been commonly
seen for many years.

The release program is seen as a major boost to the
national environment by cutting rabbit numbers, thereby
reducing erosion and related problems caused by over-
grazing and the spread of underground warrens. Similarly,
native animals will face less competition for food and
shelter, and farmers will have more grazing capacity for
their livestock.

It has been officially estimated that direct environmental
damage and lost farm production due to rabbits (pre-virus)
totals in excess of $650 million a year.

Opinions are divided about the effects of the anti-rabbit
scheme on populations of feral animals, such as foxes and
cats. Some experts feel their numbers may be reduced by
the reduction in rabbits as a food source but others
believe this will lead to an increase in feral animals
hunting small native species.

as Executive Director".

The departure of Mr Carbon from the bureaucracy has

AUSTRALIA: TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE "OLD" FORESTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A new high-tech solution to identifying tracts of old
growth trees within logged forests is under development
by CSIRO, State Forests (NSW), and the timber industry.

The airborne unit uses digital cameras to record infra-red
light emitted from forest areas and this data can later be
processed by computer into colour-coded maps of the area
surveyed. Fast-growing trees (new growth) show up as
red and slow-growing (old growth) are shown as green or
blue.

A major cause of dissension between pro-logging and anti-
logging groups is the argument that old-growth forests
require special protection for the sake of biodiversity,
providing sanctuary for endangered native species, and
maintaining areas of `pristine forest' for future
generations.

The system is currently undergoing field tests in forests
surrounding Bateman's Bay on the NSW South Coast.

AUSTRALIA: R&D WILL STOP - OR GO OFFSHORE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's numerous changes to the R&D
tax concession and its eligibility criteria will have a serious
negative effect on Australian industry, according to two
major independent surveys of business intentions.

Both found that a large proportion of respondent
companies had indicated that the reduction from 150
percent to 125 percent in the tax concession rate would
make the majority of companies reconsider plans for
future R&D projects. Many firms expressed concern that
the reduced concession, combined with a significant
increase in related compliance costs, would adversely
affect the economics of undertaking the work in Australia.

Some would seek to take advantage of the more-generous
range of concessions available in countries such as
Singapore and Malaysia, while others would simply seek
to import technology already developed overseas.

The studies were undertaken by Price Waterhouse
Technology, through the Australian Industry Research
Group, and by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

The Price Waterhouse survey was sent to 250 strategically
selected companies which were likely to be affected by
the range of Budget changes to the R&D concessions. These
covered such industry sectors as mining and resources,
high technology, telecommunications, building, food,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. Responses
were received from a number of leading Australian
companies as well as many SMEs.

The executive summary of the survey found:

* Two-thirds of respondents said the (former) concession
had been a major factor in their investment in R&D.

* Following the changes (lower benefit, higher compliance
costs) more than half would reduce their R&D effort by 20
percent or more, or switch to offshore R&D, or
subcontracting.

* More than 65 percent of respondents say they will need
to change or improve their systems to take advantage of
the new concessions within the new six-month lodgement
deadline.

* Overall, the cost of compliance as a percentage of the
available tax benefits, is expected to rise by 114 percent.

* At the same time the level of R&D benefits will fall by an
average of 45 percent.

* Almost half of the respondents had serious concerns
about the level of service provided by AusIndustry.

* The results suggest that R&D in Australia may again
"decline to the inadequate levels of the early 1980s,
indicating a clear need for a reconsideration of
Government policy in this area".

The second study involved 125 responses to surveys sent
by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to 395 large to medium
companies across Australia.

It found:

* 40 percent of respondents believed the concession
changes would have a negative impact on their future R&D
activities.

* 56.8 percent of companies currently claiming the
concessions would think again concerning future R&D
because of the reduced concessions.

* 24 percent of respondents said they would now seriously
consider moving their R&D offshore to locations such as
Singapore and Malaysia. (It described this as "the most
concerning implication of the survey" because only 46.4
percent of respondents had been aware of the R&D
concession schemes in Malaysia and Singapore. The
number of companies aware of the offshore possibilities
was steadily increasing as a result of the controversy
surrounding the Budget changes and this appeared likely
to ultimately increase the number of Australian companies
which would seek to relocate their R&D efforts overseas).

* 34.1 percent of companies which had claimed local R&D
benefits over the past five years would now consider
moving those operations offshore.

* 29 percent of respondents said they would continue to
undertake local R&D but would no longer find it
worthwhile to claim the reduced concessions because of
the effects of the higher compliance costs and the reduced
benefits available.

The survey states: "There is no question that reducing the
concessional rate of the R&D concession to 125 percent will
have an immeasurably detrimental impact upon the
amount of R&D being carried out by Australian companies.
It is certain that the reduction in the amount of R&D
conducted in Australia could lead both to an increase in
unemployment and a decrease in taxation revenue
collected by the Government, Further, the reduction will
affect both the amount of the Government's taxation
revenue and the Australian economy on many other
levels.

"The most obvious and detrimental of these will be the
steady movement of corporate R&D operations offshore,
particularly in high technology growth industries. It will
inhibit growth in Australian business and render the
'clever country' significantly less progressive and
technologically second-rate. Further, the reduction in the
concessional rate will encourage more companies to
purchase technology from foreign countries, sending more
and more potentially taxable Australian dollars and capital
offshore. The effects of this sort of flow will have serious
and potentially irreversible consequences for the
Australian economy.

"The reduction in the concession rate is actively dissuading
Australian companies from undertaking R&D activities. In
doing so the Government is sending a clear message to
companies that, despite its rhetoric, the Government is not
willing to properly support R&D activities conducted in
this country. The proposed 125 percent R&D tax
concession cannot compete with other OECD countries
despite the Budget's claims to the contrary. This simple
fact will ensure irreversible damage to Australia's future
whilst assisting our neighbour countries in their economic
and technological growth".

AUSTRALIA: CSIRO CHIEF ENDORSES CUTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The general thrust of the Howard Government's cuts to
R&D tax concessions have been supported by the CSIRO
Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. This emerged
during a major speech in Perth in which he expressed
confidence in the future funding of science and the CSIRO.

Dr McIntosh said some Budget measures (such as the
abolition of R&D syndication) had been necessary because
of their very high cost to overall revenue.

He said: "It's a fascinating reflection that when the
Government abolished the syndication R&D tax scheme
and lowered the level of assistance through the ordinary
tax scheme from 150 percent to 125 percent, one of the
fundamental issues was whether 125 percent was enough
to retain the serious R&D in Australia.

"Another was whether we would now be out-competed,
particularly by the Asian enthusiasts for R&D, even of
Australian firms. The judgement was made by the
Government that 125 percent was sufficient.

"The case of syndicated R&D was a more complex set of
discussions. The overwhelming impression, as the
Treasurer so colourfully put it, was that the taxation
syndication system had been heavily rorted. Heavily
rorted is not a term that a taxation syndicate R&D user
like CSIRO would use; it's not something you would say
about your customers, "Dr McIntosh said.

"But clearly it was, at the very least, an economically
inefficient scheme - I mean that in the sense that the
amount of tax revenue forgone to generate a given amount
of R&D was very high. There is no doubt the tax
syndication scheme did generate extra R&D (CSIRO was a
positive beneficiary of that), but it was also true that it
cost an awful lot of forgone revenue.

"My own memory is that when the scheme was first
introduced I met a senior businessman in Australia at the
time and I said the scheme would lead to a major increase
in R&D in companies. He replied that there would actually
be a major increase in accounting activities to redefine all
operations that could possibly be deemed to be eligible to
obtain the benefits which would flow from such actions -
and that is what happened.

"There was an apparent major surge in R&D with no extra
R&D being done, at least initially. Over time that changed
quite significantly and we reached the point where the
most difficult decision was how to change the scheme
without throwing the baby out with the bath water. What
the Government decided to do was create a scheme which
was no longer tax-based but which retained most of the
ingredients of the syndication R&D scheme," he said.

Dr McIntosh said the importance of the syndication
scheme was that it had attracted a number of major
players into the area of R&D, including a finance house
which had learned that the risks in such investments
(with the taxation benefits) were commensurate with
those in housing, construction or the stock market. It had
also attracted major overseas players who could supply
enabling technology to help local firms leapfrog over
existing technology and develop worthwhile new ideas.
The scheme had also involved local companies which
intended to exploit the products and processes developed
under the scheme and a local "do-er", such as CSIRO, which
would undertake the actual R&D.

"It was, in many cases, the combining of those players that
was more important than the mere fact that the R&D was
being subsidised in some way.

"What we and others are now trying to do is to convince
the Government that the new Start program needs to have
the combination of characteristics needed to attract the
same group of players, rather than providing a single
grant which would attract the Australian player alone, but
which would not attract the enabling technology and
which would be most unlikely to attract the financial
institution. We really need a mechanism out of the grant,
loan, and interest rate subsidy scheme which puts all that
back together," Dr McIntosh said.

He predicted that no administration would be likely to
return to a tax-based R&D scheme "for another generation"
because of the Government's complaints that the
syndication scheme had been "rorted so heavily".

"Those of you who remember the Whitlam Government
will remember that the administration of its various
programs poisoned the well for that sort of scheme for a
generation and I think the same would be true this time.
But we do have an opportunity in the replacement
schemes to get many of the same characteristics and those
in the field might like to think about how they would
argue their design to the Government so these sorts of
schemes can survive," Dr McIntosh said.

AUSTRALIA: GOVT'S URGENT OIL SEARCH PLANS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Official estimates that Australia has only 14 remaining
years of proven domestic oil reserves have triggered
urgent efforts by the Howard Government to tackle the
problem.

Officials are currently reviewing existing arrangements for
promoting oil exploration to determine what changes are
needed to bolster search programs.

The Government is concerned about the potential
ramifications of local oil supplies running dry - it could
cripple most sections of primary and secondary industry
or add enormously to our annual import bill, thereby
making our exports less competitive on world markets.

Canberra sources have told Scitech the 14 year estimate is
genuine but industry experts are confident there are new
oilfields awaiting discovery in Bass Strait and along the
north-west and northern coasts of Australia.

(Current estimates are that the world has 43 years of oil
reserves, based on known fields and present consumption
trends.)

The dilemma for the Government is deciding what to do
and when to do it. Current levels of oil exploration are
quite high even with existing incentives. And the industry
would be expected to have a vested commercial interest in
maintaining - or expanding - those programs to ensure
continuity of supply in the years ahead.

But some officials fear the industry may try to take
advantage of the looming domestic oil drought by delaying
some programs in the hope that community and business
pressure would force the Government to open its
chequebook and offer much more generous exploration
incentives.

According to the Canberra sources the Government is most
likely to `hasten slowly' - working hard in the background
to develop a range of appropriate measures, but delaying
any formal announcement or implementation until at least
the time of the next Federal Election campaign. This is not
due for another 2-1/2 years.

The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick
Parer, recently received a draft green paper on a
sustainable energy policy. The final document is expected
to be made public within a few weeks.

Senator Parer said in a subsequent speech: "Of the figures
I have so far, the one that really set the red light flashing
with me was the situation with our existing oil reserves.
With current production rates, and assuming there are no
new discoveries, we've got only 14 years of oil in this
country.

"We have to accept these are accurate figures, put them on
the table, throw them open to discussion, and we have to
work out a policy for how we handle this over the next 20
years," he said.

The Minister said he believed Australia was still "under-
explored", including the continental landmass itself. It was
probably true that most of our prospective new fields
were offshore but there was still ample scope for dryland
exploration across Australia.

The Deputy Director of the Australian Petroleum
Production and Exploration Association, Mr Peter
Cochrane, said putting a figure on existing oil reserves was
"extremely difficult". He agreed that Australia was still
under-explored. Bass Strait production was beginning to
wind-back as the known reserves were being depleted but
"it's not a worry as long as the Australian exploration
regime remains competitive - and we continue to explore
thaose areas the industry believes are prospective", Mr
Cochrane said.

AUSTRALIA: $10M WIND-POWER PLANT FOR NSW

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia's first grid-connected wind-powered electricity
generating plant is to be built in NSW over the next 12
months at a cost of $10 million.

It will generate about five megawatts of power, estimated
to meet the normal needs of some 3500 homes.

The NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister, Mr Michael Egan,
said the project had resulted from five years' research of
wind patterns at the chosen site, Crookwell (near
Goulburn) in the southern tablelands region. He said it was
hoped the project would encourage more investment in
renewable energy projects as a means of lessening
Greenhouse problems.

The facility, described as a wind-farm, will comprise eight
600kw pitch-regulated wind turbines - three-bladed
propellers mounted on 40 metre towers. They will be built
on elevated ground on a local farm by Pacific Power, one
of the three NSW power-generation bodies established
recently when Mr Egan split the former Electricity
Commission into competitive units.

A local electricity distributor, Great Southern Energy, is a
partner in the project.

The power produced at the site will be channelled into the
State grid, unlike Australia's only other wind-farm (a
stand-alone 2 megawatt local facility at Esperance in WA).

AUSTRALIA: BUDGET CHANGES SLASH ENROLMENTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The extensive package of higher education changes in the
Federal Budget are being blamed for a significant
reduction in preliminary numbers of school-leavers
seeking admission as students for 1997 in some States.

The worst-hit region is NSW and the ACT where first-
round entry applications for next year have seen a drop of
as much as 30 percent from the levels recorded 12 months
earlier. The problem seems to have affected mainly the
smaller institutions -the Universities of Sydney and NSW
recorded drops of around two percent.

But the reduction in applications elsewhere in NSW has
generally been substantial. Examples include: Australian
Catholic University (30 percent), Macquarie (around 20
percent), Wollongong (16 percent), Western Sydney (14
percent), New England (10 to 15 percent), Charles Sturt
(11 percent) Newcastle (10 percent), and Southern Cross
(six to 12 percent).

The ACT figures are also down substantially - ANU (17
percent) and University of Canberra (14 percent).

Collation of these figures has been made difficult because
of a series of administrative problems which have beset
the Universities Admissions Centre which processes
applications for most NSW and ACT universities.

Preliminary 1997 application figures from other States
vary widely, with Queensland's institutions expected to
record (final) increases of up to eight percent. A smaller
rise - around two percent across the board - seems likely
in Victoria. There is no significant change in enrolment
trends in WA, and a very mixed result in SA (Flinders
University has seen a 17 percent increase but the
Universities of Adelaide and South Australia have fallen
slightly).

Observers have blamed the combination of Federal Budget
cuts to some areas of higher education, the big increase in
HECS charges for students starting next year and beyond,
the crackdown on eligibility for Austudy, and moves by
universities to cut courses and staff numbers for the fall-
off in applications. There is still no apparent explanation
for the variation in the trend among the States.

AUSTRALIA: NTEU: UNI CUTS UNNECESSARY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The significant cuts to jobs, facilities, and courses at most
NSW universities in 1997 are unnecessary and do not
reflect the level of funding available to the institutions,
according to the National Tertiary Education Union.

The senior industrial officer with the NSW branch of the
NTEU, Mr Chris Holley, said extensive research undertaken
by the union had found there was no justification for the
range and extent of the proposed cuts already announced
by the universities.

He said half of the 10 institutions had actually received
small increases in their Federal Government funding for
next year when compared with the 1996 figures, ranging
from one percent to three percent. And those which had
been cut had only lost between 0.2 percent and 1.7
percent, hardly requiring the extensive programs of
campus closures, staff cuts, course reductions, and limits
on student numbers which have been announced by some
NSW universities.

Mr Holley said the university administrators behind the
cutbacks had apparently been using the adverse publicity
surrounding the Federal Government's new priorities in
higher education as an "excuse" to do more than was
actually needed to tighten their own budgets. Similarly,
they were attempting to "blame" a long-delayed pay rise
for academic staff for cuts which went well beyond the
level necessary to cover that cost.

The various cuts had also been determined without any
apparent regard for the potential additional income which
was now available to universities by admitting full fee-
paying local students, a source of revenue previously
denied to them by earlier Governments, he said.

According to the NTEU study, the five NSW universities to
suffer cuts in 1997 are: Sydney (Allocation $306.5M; down
0.2 percent), NSW ($233.9M, 0.8 percent), UTS ($134.8M,
0.2 percent), Macquarie ($102.7M, 0.2 percent), and New
England ($84.7M, 1.7 percent).

Those which will have more Federal money are: Western
Sydney ($177.4M, up 1.8 percent), Newcastle ($136M, 1
percent), Charles Sturt ($91.3M, 1.1 percent), Wollongong
($88.1M, 1 percent), and Southern Cross ($48.6M, 3
percent).

AUSTRALIA: STUDENTS: VANSTONE MUST GO

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Student organisations around Australia have called for the
resignation of the Minister for Employment, Education,
Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone,
over her involvement in the "Wright family" saga.

The Minister received front page publicity in national
newspapers when she gave a Senate Committee details of
the "millionaire family" which she said had been abusing
the Austudy system by arranging their financial affairs so
they could receive benefits for their children. Senator
Vanstone said the case had been made public (only the
name had allegedly been changed) to demonstrate the
need for a tough crackdown on Austudy eligibility criteria,
as proposed by the Coalition's first Federal Budget.

The Minister has subsequently been forced to apologise to
the Senate on several occasions as different elements of
the original story were found to be wrong - including the
fact that the family had been a "composite", based on
several things which the Government had feared "might"
be abused.

The Federal Opposition has - unsuccessfully - demanded
that the Minister resign or be sacked by the Prime
Minister for misleading the Parliament. It has now been
joined by student organisations incensed by the various
education cuts and fee increases imposed on the higher
education sector by Senator Vanstone through the Federal
Budget.

A spokesman for the National Union of Students, Mr Van
Badham, said: "All Australians have been lied-to by the
Minister - Senator Vanstone's behaviour is unfit for her to
continue to hold Ministerial office".

The Education Officer of the University of Melbourne
Student Union, Ms Felicity Martin, said: "Thousands of
genuine Australian families will suffer real hardship as a
result of the changes Senator Vanstone has introduced -
and which she has attempted to justify through the
vilification of a bogus millionaire family. She must go".

AUSTRALIA: AFTER LITERACY - NUMERACY FEARS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Following recent controversy about high rates of illiteracy
among Australia's high school student population, there
are fears in academic circles that a forthcoming report on
numeracy and science skills could be equally bad.

The President of the Australian Mathematical Societies
Council, Ms Jan Thomas, said: "We are bracing ourselves
for bad news later this month. That is when the Australian
Council for Educational Research will release the findings
of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS). This has assessed the skills of children at three
age levels - 9, 13, and 16 - across some 50 countries".

Ms Thomas said the Australian body had decided to start
taking action to review teaching of maths and science in
Australia even before the TIMSS results were announced.
"We are not just waiting for the figures - we have already
arranged a top-level forum at the Academy of Science, in
Canberra, to identify three priority items for urgent
Government attention. It will bring together government,
industry, and education groups - all parties with a real
interest in the future of science and mathematics
education in Australia".

The forum will be staged on November 20. The Minister
for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs,
Senator Amanda Vanstone, and the Minister for Schools,
Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, have
agreed to speak on the day. Other confirmed speakers
include: Dr Jan Lokan, the Australian coordinator of TIMSS,
and Professor John de Laeter, a member of the Australian
Science, Technology and Engineering Council.

AUSTRALIA: AUST FEES WEST'S HIGHEST

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Howard Government's proposed higher education
charges are the highest in the western world, according to
the Australian Democrats.

Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, of South Australia, said the
increases listed in the Government's Higher Education
Legislation Amendment Bill would, if passed into law,
place Australia behind only South Korea on the world list
of such charges. She said the legislation sought to recoup
60 percent of the cost of providing higher education
services to a student - double the World Bank's
recommended maximum figure.

"The World Bank, in 1994, prepared a report - Higher
Education: the Lessons Experience - which recommended
that students in higher education should not be charged
more than 30 percent of the cost of providing their tuition.
But the Coalition has not only ignored that suggestion, it
has decided to force Australian students to repay double
that figure", the Senator said.

She urged the non-Government majority in the Senate to
use their numbers to block the legislation, thereby sparing
students the consequences of its implementation.

AUSTRALIA: TWO SATELLITES IN ORBIT BY 2001

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia is now planning to have two locally designed and
built satellites in orbit by 2001.

This follows the Federal Government's announcement of a
$1 million feasibility study into the development of the
ARIES-1 (Australian Resource Information and
Environment Satellite), the world's most advanced
minerals exploration technology.

The remote-sensing satellite will be based on developments
by CSIRO over the past 20 years. The concept uses 256
different frequencies to permit observations which can
effectively strip away layers of vegetation and then closely
check the earth beneath for telltale signs of mineral
deposits in the target area It can also be used to check the
condition of vegetation cover, effects of land degradation,
and a range of other environmental applications.

The Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter
McGauran, said the Federal Government will contribute
$300,000 to the feasibility study and a consortium of 10
international mining companies will each provide another
$75,000. He said the project, to be headed by CSIRO, would
also involve Auspace Ltd, and Government Geological
Surveys.

"ARIES-1 is the most ambitious - and potentially the most
commercially rewarding - space project ever undertaken
in Australia. It will offer the most effective means of
mineral exploration anywhere in the world and will
dramatically improve on existing worldwide capabilities
for geological mapping, environmental monitoring, and
land use assessment. It will even have far-ranging defence
applications," Mr McGauran said.

"The level of involvement of the private sector, in
particular the high level of interests from foreign
investors, is to be applauded and encouraged.

"ARIES-1 will be the first Australian built and launched
low Earth orbit satellite and represents a major step
forward for the construction of high-technology systems in
Australia. The Howard Government has saved the
Australian space program from certain extinction - under
the direction of CSIRO it is now headed in a more-focussed
and more-responsible direction than under Labor," he
said.

The Coalition Government had earlier announced (Scitech,
Vol 16, No 9) plans to spend $2 million a year over five
years to design and build an Australian micro-satellite
which would be put into orbit in 2001.

A spokesman for Mr McGauran told Scitech the ARIES-1
venture was quite separate from the earlier
announcement.

The CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, said the
basic technology which would enable ARIES-1 to perform
its revolutionary range of tasks had been developed and
enhanced over the past 20 years. Earlier versions had
been carried in aircraft but the time had come to utilise
new developments in micro-technology to build these
capacities into a small satellite.

He said: "Two things about this project are new and special
- one is that we have been able to design such an
advanced piece of instrumentation and the other is that
we are doing the project on a commercial basis. The
traditional way of doing these things is to go to
Government and try to nip into the taxpayers' pockets to
the tune of $100 million or so.

"The Government's pockets are closed at the moment for
those sorts of things, so the choice was either to abandon it
or do it as a serious commercial venture. It is being done
as the latter and Australian companies are now
sufficiently mature and far-sighted as to handle the risks
and to see what benefits it would bring for them to put up
money, at least for the feasibility study.

"If all goes well we would then expect them to put up
money for the production and implementation phase and
Australia will have its first satellite for 20 or 30 years -
one which did little more than beep in the sky." Dr
McIntosh said.

RUSSIA'S 'DELICATE' SPACE DILEMMA

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Russian space officials - and their two Cosmonauts
currently aboard the Mir space station - are desperately
trying to develop an appropriate policy to overcome a
very fundamental problem with the spacecraft.

A combination of factors has meant its sewage storage
tanks are almost full and there is no immediate prospect
of them being emptied. (This task is normally undertaken
by service ships which regularly resupply the space
station and carry sewage and other wastes away for
dumping in space).Technical problems have prevented
regular services for some time and Mir is not equipped
with a dumping system of its own.

To compound the Russians' embarrassment, Mir is
currently playing host to a US Astronaut. And ground
experts have suggested the only short-term solution to the
problem is to physically stir the sewage tanks to lower
existing levels.

The Cosmonauts have so far resisted these suggestions in
deference to the sensibilities of their American visitor,
whom they fear may not have undergone the degree of
training they feel would be necessary to cope with the
smell.

According to Izvestia, the American visitor's "lifetime of
experience may not have prepared him for such
experiments"!

AUSTRALIA: LABOR: GOVT DESERTS INDUSTRY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Opposition has accused the Coalition
Government of having "abandoned manufacturing
industries" and thereby endangering Australia's economic
future.

The shadow Minister for Industry and Regional
Development, Mr Simon Crean said the new administration
in Canberra appeared prepared to sacrifice them on the
altar of market forces. He was speaking at a forum
organised by the Metal Trades Industry Association
(MTIA) in Canberra.

"It has become apparent that there is one overriding
philosophy driving the Coalition - they believe there is
no role for government in manufacturing and so many other
areas," Mr Crean said.

"The first Howard Budget saw a wholesale abandonment of
the government-industry partnership that Labor and
industry had so painstakingly built-up over the previous
13 years. DIFF, EMDG. the R&D tax concession, Austrade,
AusIndustry, the bounty on computers, ships, books and
robotics - measures put in place to help Australian
manufacturers adjust to lower tariff barriers - were axed.
But the most astonishing thing is the fact that the
Government has not even attempted to justify these
decisions, other than as a financial cut,'' he said.

Mr Crean said the Opposition recognised two things which
the Coalition did not: "there is a role for government in
industry policy and there is not a level playing field" He
said money spent on industry programs should be properly
seen as an investment in the nation's future prosperity,
and not merely as a budget cost.

The ALP was currently formulating an updated industry
policy which would include some crucial criteria:

* it must increase net exports in value-added products.

* it must be industry driven.

* it must involve building and maintaining infrastructure
(using Commonwealth and private sectors funds).

* it must involve a Government-industry partnership (to
ensure a proper balance between structural intervention
and market discipline).

* it must encourage an internationally competitive
environment which confronts the need for industry
support and entry barriers imposed by our trading
partners.

Mr Crean said the Opposition, against this background,
would continue to resist such Budget measures as
restrictions on R&D concessions and the abolition of
bounties.

AUSTRALIA: SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT CARD

Australia's first credit card for small and medium business
operations has been launched by the Commonwealth Bank.

Known as the Capital Business Card, it is claimed to offer
such companies easier and cheaper credit on a continuous
basis than other traditional forms of business borrowings.

Accounts, which operate along the same lines as personal
Bankcards, can be established by approved applicants on a
secured or an unsecured basis. Credit limits can range
between $2000 and $100,000.

A business must have been in operation for at least two
years, and be deemed creditworthy, to qualify. An
establishment fee is payable but, other than incurred
interest, there are no other account fees or charges.

The initial maximum interest rate has been set at 14
percent per annum for unsecured accounts. Secured
accounts may carry a lesser rate. The minimum monthly
repayment requirement is 2.5 percent of the outstanding
balance, with a minimum repayment of $75.

A spokesman for the bank said the new service had been
designed to suit the needs of sole traders and small firms.
He said a recent survey by the bank had found that 88
percent of small business proprietors questioned
purchased goods by telephone and 41 percent said they
paid bills by credit card over the telephone.

"The survey results show that many people in small
business use their personal credit cards for business
purposes, partly for the sake of convenience. Our new
business card is expected to prove very popular because it
offers the same degree of convenience while allowing
personal and business expenditure to be separated", the
spokesman said.

AUSTRALIA: COALITION DISAPPOINTS SMES

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A major economic survey of the reaction of small business
to the change of Government in Canberra has found that
86 percent feel things are worse - or have not improved -
since March.

The September Quarter Small Business Health Index study,
undertaken by AGB McNair on behalf of the Australian
Society of Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA),
checked the attitudes of 450 businesses across Australia.

Only 13 percent said economic conditions had improved
under the Coalition administration. This compared with 64
percent who felt there had been no change and 22 percent
who said the business environment had deteriorated.

Despite those results, 21 percent of firms said they
intended to take-on extra staff over the next 12 months
while only five percent indicated they would be cutting
staff numbers. The remaining 73 percent said there would
be no change to their staffing levels.

The quarterly survey, which has established a sound
reputation since its inception in June 1993, is a blow to the
Howard Government which has placed great emphasis on
the supposed speed and scope of its moves to assist small
business.

AUSTRALIA: $4.5M FOR EMR HEALTH STUDY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government has reversed its earlier stance
and announced a $4.5 million five-year study into the
health effects of mobile telephones and other
radiocommunications devices.

The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator
Richard Alston, and the Minister for Health, Dr Michael
Wooldridge, jointly announced the decision to thoroughly
examine all relevant issues, including the effects, if
any, of mobile telephone towers.

This follows a long campaign from community groups who
claim the rapid spread of mobile telephone technology
throughout Australia should be held in check until it is
proven to be no risk to community health.

The Ministers stressed they had no specific concerns about
the safety of the new technology - the study was merely
being undertaken to ensure that all relevant matters were
properly scrutinised. (Senator Alston subsequently
lampooned calls for the suspension of new tower
construction until the study findings were available).

The project, to be undertaken by the National Health and
Medical Research Council, will be funded through an
increase in radiocommunications license fees - to take
effect this month. The Ministers said individual projects
under the overall study would be contracted to
appropriately qualified Government and non-Government
agencies, such as CSIRO, universities, and major hospitals.

Soon after the local investigation was announced US
authorities released details of a three year study by 16
prominent scientists into more than 12,000 previous
research projects into EMR around the world. (The group
had reduced the original mass of studies down to a 'short
list' of the 500 deemed to be most relevant to their study).

It found that there was no conclusive evidence in any of
the international research efforts to directly link EMR with
any specific health risk.

Even in the case of childhood leukemia, which has been
indirectly linked to residential proximity to high tension
powerlines in a number of studies, the US experts found
no direct causal link. They said they had paid particular
attention to childhood leukemia in the course of their
investigations into EMR research because of the numerous
past suggestions that its incidence rose sharply among
children whose homes were adjacent to overhead
transmission lines.

But their review had found not only that there was no
direct link between the lines and leukemia but there were
several other "possible causes" of the incidence of the
disease among those children who lived near them - such
as the use of herbicides and insecticides to control
vegetation and insect pests along the powerline routes.
The childhood leukemia issue required more specific study
because none of the mass of studies done to date had
produced conclusive results which could explain the
connection.

The mass of EMR studies undertaken around the world is a
clear reflection of the level of scientific and community
interest and concern about the rapid spread of radiation-
emitting devices. Governments, power authorities, and
relevant manufacturers and transmission agencies are in
the invidious position of facing massive pressure to
introduce more and better technology while some critics
allege this (radiation emissions) poses enormous health
hazards to every section of the community.

Should researchers ever find conclusive proof of a major
EMR health hazard from the spread of modern technology,
the social, economic and legal ramifications are too vast
and too complex to contemplate.

AUSTRALIA: LOCAL COMPANY LEADS WORLD GIANTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A small Australian company, with only 16 staff, has
developed world-leading PC technology which it claims
has left competing multi-nationals at least two years
behind.

Amlab International, based in the Sydney suburb of Lane
Cove, has produced a virtual instrument - a multi-use
hardware and software package which can replace a wide
range of scientific measuring devices across a broad range
of activities (eg vibration, speed, temperature,
respiration).

The system won the inaugural Science Product Innovation
Award at the recent Science 2000 exhibition.

According to the company, the Amlab system, directed
through a Windows-based PC operating system, can
effectively replace traditional measuring devices in
situations ranging from training Olympic athletes to
testing advanced military aircraft. The system enables the
operator to customise the type of instrumentation
required at the click of a mouse. It is claimed to have
almost limitless applications.

Amlab is currently working on a Defence Department
contract as part of the design process for a new simulator
for the Army's Blackhawk helicopters. The system is
already in use with BHP Research, Hawker de Havilland,
Australian Flight Testing Centres, Queensland University of
Technology, Southern Cross University, Sydney University,
University of NSW, Westmead Hospital, the University of
Technology Sydney, and the Australian Materials Research
Laboratories.

Established only seven years ago, Amlab has until recently
concentrated its marketing efforts locally and, as a result,
the system is already installed at 170 sites across
Australia. Last month the company despatched its first
shipment to Japan for use in biomechanics research. The
companie's managing director, Mr David Rosenbaum, said
the Australian device was at least two years ahead of the
technology available from rival multinationals. Its greatest
advantage was its capacity to collect and process data in
real time, he said.

AUSTRALIA: MINISTER: HEED THE "2000 COMPUTER BOMB"

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australian industry needs to recognise the potential threat
of the "Year 2000 Computer Bomb" - and to take
advantage of the commercial opportunities it presents,
according to the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr
Peter McGauran.

Many computer users, mainly those in SMEs, were still in a
state of denial about the problem, or seemingly unaware
of it. Mr McGauran said: "Companies that refuse to
properly prepare for the new millennium are risking
financial ruin - it is estimated that up to 90 percent of
computer systems will fail, or revert back 100 years, come
January 1, 2000. This is because many current software
programs were not designed to accept the change in
calendar dates which the new century will bring. The
Government is actively examining the possible impact of
this problem on its systems and urges the IT industry to
help make the community aware of the situation".

He said although the potential ramifications were very
serious the "Computer Bomb" also posed a significant
business opportunity for companies which could develop
solutions and market them around the world.

AUSTRALIA: SMART CARD PRIVACY CONCERNS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Smart card technology will not achieve its full potential in
the Australian marketplace unless the privacy needs and
concerns of consumers are fully addressed, according to
the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter
McGauran.

He told a recent industry conference in Sydney the Federal
Government supported the new technology but was also
anxious to ensure proper privacy protection was in place.
This was necessary if the public was to have full trust in
the cards.

"The Asia-Pacific is potentially the world's biggest market
for smart card technology and Australia is well-placed
geographically and technologically to capitalise on this
revolutionary concept. But, to be successful, these
technical advancements will have to be balanced with
appropriate standards and consumer protection
mechanisms. The Government will soon release a code of
conduct for the industry - a world first for this technology
- which is based on the values and attitudes expressed to
us by the Australian community," Mr McGauran said.

GERMANY: WORLD'S FIRST SOLAR/DIESEL CAR

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A major breakthrough in motor vehicle technology - the
world's first hybrid solar/diesel production car - has been
announced by the German company, Audi. The concept is
based on using its pollution-free solar-powered electric
motor in city conditions, switching to an efficient low-
pollution diesel motor on long haul journeys in country
areas. The company claims the new vehicle, the Audi A4
Avant Duo III, will help reduce city air pollution problems,
help conserve dwindling world supplies of oil, and be
cheaper to run than a conventional car. Another element
to the package is a separate solar-powered recharging unit
which stores electricity during daylight hours for transfer
into the car's batteries at night. This unit can also be used
to divert excess power into the domestic electricity grid,
reducing domestic power bills and contributing to reduced
demand for future power station capacity.

AUSTRALIA: ACADEMY ATTACKS QUANTUM

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Australian Academy of Science has issued a statement
criticising two recent editions of the ABC television
program, Quantum, which were devoted "primarily to the
hazards of vaccination". It said a sister program on ABC
Radio, The Health Report, had given a balanced coverage of
the benefits and limited risks associated with vaccination.
The Academy said vaccination had proven itself over 200
years to be "the most cost-effective procedure in
medicine". Yet, "the main message of the Quantum
programs was that all vaccinations are potentially
dangerous". The Academy said smallpox had been
eliminated worldwide as a direct result of vaccination and
polio was expected to be wiped-out by 2000 if current
programs remained in place, closely followed by measles.
It said Quantum had raised claims about neurological
problems developing in some patients treated with
whooping cough vaccine and paralysis developing in some
after receiving Sabin polio vaccine. Official figures showed
the incidence of such problems was one case in 200,000
(whooping cough) and one case in between one million and
five million (polio), the Academy said.

BRITAIN: BAD NEWS ON MAD COW

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Exhaustive tests in Britain have apparently confirmed that
nation's worst fears - direct links between mad cow
disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy: BSE) - and a
new variant which has infected and killed humans.

To date a total of 12 Britons and one French national have
died. The tests were conducted by researchers at the
Imperial College School of Medicine, and their results
published in the journal, Nature.

They showed that a "corrupted" brain protein, prion, in the
human victims showed the same biochemical signature as
that found in cats, mice, and monkeys which had died
after contracting BSE.

The findings have huge ramifications for Britain's
population which seemingly was being sold BSE-
contaminated beef for many years while Government
authorities blocked vital information from being released
to the public, while giving assurances that the industry's
practices were "totally safe".

directly from the vessel into airfreight containers. Senator
Parer praised the company for its efforts in helping to
boost Australian fisheries into an export industry now
worth more than $1.3 billion a year. There was ample
scope for a substantial expansion in exports to Asian

AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT'S SHAMEFUL SILENCE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's response to Scitech's front page
story last month (Natural Heritage Trust a fraud: Coalition
senior advisor admits) underlines the accuracy of our
information.

Large sections of the article were read into the official
record in the Senate during questions directed to the
Government Leader in the Upper House, Senator Robert
Hill, but he made no attempt to deny any of the specific
allegations. This included the direct claim that the Trust
policy had been a "cynical political invention" of the
National Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb,
and that it had been "imposed" on Senator Hill.

It is traditional in Parliament for the ranks of any
Government to try to laugh-off any particularly difficult
accusations, with loud jeers, much shaking of heads and
mock bravado. This is particularly so if they have advance
warning that trouble is looming.

It was quite clear from the live television coverage on the
day that the Government had no advance warning of our
story - or the fact that it was to be raised in Question
Time.

When the matter was raised the entire Government team
in the Senate sat in stunned and squirming silence. Even
the Minister for Education, Senator Amanda Vanstone,
who regularly keeps up a running commentary throughout
Question Time, sat mute and stoney-faced. The Minister
for Communications, Senator Richard Alston, initially
looked startled by the questions, then cracked a nervous
smile and then turned and gave a very public wink (he
was centre screen at the precise moment) to some unseen
colleague.

Unusually for such a circumstance, the Government issued
no statement of denial or 'clarification' to try to defuse the
serious charges in our story and not one word of denial
has been uttered in subsequent relevant Senate debates
(Telstra {Dilution of Public Ownership} Bill/Natural
Heritage Trust Bill).

Despite its public silence, the Government's ranks were in
uproar behind the scenes because of a witch-hunt trying
to track-down the source of the story. Some innocent
people were wrongly accused of having committed the
'crime' of telling the public the truth about the
Government's phoney promotion of the Trust as a means
of attempting to sell-off Telstra.

Scitech has no dispute with the need for a major national
effort to rectify our national environmental problems.
What we attack is the Government's pretence that the
proposed Trust - with only $1 billion in funding over five
years - can substantially improve existing problems. We
also refuse to accept that the funding of the environmental
program can ONLY come from the sale of Telstra.

Does this mean that once Telstra has been fully sold-off
(Senator Alston has already exposed that objective) the
national environment must go forever without further
funding?

Would it not make more sense - as has already been
widely suggested - to retain all of Telstra and allocate $1
billion every year from its massive profits towards the
same national objective? This would result in five times
the Government's planned level of expenditure while
enabling the community to retain a degree of control over
the fast-changing world of IT&T in Australia.

Why not seek a range of other proposals for funding a
meaningful attack on the environment problems which
Senator Hill has publicly admitted are costing the nation a
minimum of $1.5 billion a year - or seven times the rate of
the proposed Trust spending?

The Government's real intention - to find some political
means to try to confuse or frighten the public into
accepting the sale of Telstra - is clearly exposed by its cuts
to environment spending in the Budget.

And anybody who still doubts what the Coalition is up to
should consider its flat refusal to consider any other
means of funding national environmental rectification.
They might also look at its overall record rather than its
claims of environmental concern.

The Coalition's gross deception over the Natural Heritage
Trust is a disgrace, as confirmed by the shameful and
ashamed silence of its Senators when our story was raised
in the Parliament.
