POVERTY REMAINS PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA

     According to a new report by the UN's Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), released in late
December, only a "handful" of countries in the region made any
sustained progress in cutting poverty during the first half of
the 1990s.  In fact, ECLAC reports that the fallout from
Mexico's financial crisis last year severely eroded even the
small gains in living standards that some countries had
previously achieved.
     In early 1993, ECLAC published an extensive survey on
poverty levels in the region that showed that the ranks of the
poor and indigent swelled dramatically during the 1980s.
According to that study, between 1980 and 1990 the number of
people living below the poverty line climbed by 60 million--
from 136 million to 196 million--thus raising the percentage
of the total population considered poor from 41% to 46%.  At
the same time, the number of people living in extreme poverty
grew from 62.4 million to 93.5 million, or from 19% to 22% of
the total regional population (see Chronicle, 09/22/94).
     ECLAC must yet carry out another comprehensive survey
such as the one released in 1993.  Nevertheless, preliminary
estimates made by ECLAC in October suggest that, during the
first half of the 1990s, the absolute number of people living
in poverty may have grown by another 34 million.  If
population growth during the period is taken into account,
that would mean that about 48% of the total population may now
be living below the poverty line (see NotiSur - Latin American
Political Affairs, 10/20/95).
     In its latest report in December, ECLAC did not offer any
new statistics on poverty.  Rather, the commission announced
that between 1990 and 1994 it was only able to identify six
countries that registered slightly reduced rates of poverty:
Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Uruguay.  And, even
in those countries, there was only a relative improvement at
best in general living standards.
     "Even in countries where economic liberalization programs
were judged a success, such as Chile, the problem of endemic
poverty remained a stubborn reality," reads the report.
     Moreover, ECLAC reports that in 1995 three countries--
Mexico, Costa Rica, and Argentina--appear to have "lost the
ground in the fight against poverty that they had gained in
the preceding years."   The economies of those countries were
the most seriously affected by the currency crisis that
exploded in Mexico in December 1994, leading to a sharp
decline in growth in all three nations last year (see
Chronicle, 11/16/95).
     In fact, ECLAC said that Mexico and Costa Rica
represented "worrisome cases" because poverty is now on the
rise again following years of decline in both countries.
     In general, ECLAC says that, even in the most successful
economies, growth in recent years has not generated enough
jobs to keep pace with population growth.  Unemployment rates
in Latin America seldom dip below 20%, and more often average
30% for the poorest sectors of the region's population,
according to the report.  Real incomes for middle- and lower-
income sectors have fallen in comparison with 1960 levels.
     "A new group of poor people is now emerging that is
creating novel characteristics among the impoverished masses
of Latin America," said ECLAC executive director Ruben
Kaztman.  "The newly poor are by and large educated people who
had previously enjoyed higher patterns of consumption and
access to basic services that they now lack.  The
traditionally poor groups had already been living in severe
poverty, but those who had previously belonged to the middle
classes are now also impoverished."
     According to ECLAC, poverty continues to grow much more
rapidly in Latin American cities than in the countryside,
largely because of the acceleration in rural to urban
migration in recent years.  In a separate study by ECLAC
released in November, the commission reported that about 351
million people--more than 73% of the total population--now
live in urban areas throughout Latin American and the
Caribbean, making the region's cities some of the most densely
populated in the world.
     According to ECLAC, of the world's 15 most populated
cities, four are in Latin America: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,
Mexico City, and Buenos Aires.  And, even though migration to
the largest cities has slowed somewhat in recent years, poor
campesinos continue to flood into medium- and small-sized
cities in search of better opportunities.  ECLAC predicts
that, if the present trend continues, within 30 years Latin
America's urban population will have swelled to 576 million
people, or 85% of the population, even after accounting for
the expected increase in the total number of inhabitants.
     As a result of the demographic explosion in urban areas--
which, for the first time, is making poverty in Latin America
an overwhelmingly urban phenomenon--infrastructure is being
stretched to the breaking point.  For example, in another
ECLAC study also released in late December, the commission
estimated that there is a shortage of 20 million living
quarters in urban areas throughout the region.  In addition,
of the estimated 93 million living quarters that do exist,
only about 56 million, or 60%, meet minimally acceptable
standards.  About 20 million are "damaged" and the remaining
17 million are in a "precarious" state.
     Notwithstanding the severity of ECLAC's estimates, some
regional experts offer even more dismal appraisals of poverty
levels and even graver predictions for the future.  According
to Bernardo Kliksberg, executive director of the Inter-
American Institute for Social Development--which was set up by
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)--as of 1990 at least
50% of the total regional population already lived in poverty.
And, Kliksberg estimates that by the year 2000, about 57% of
the population will have slipped below the poverty line.
     Kliksberg, who was the keynote speaker at a regional
conference on poverty held in Venezuela in mid-November, says
that at present about 1.5 million people die each year as a
result of poverty in Latin America.
     The rapid spread of poverty has begun to alarm even the
multilateral lending institutions, which now promise to
channel much more aid into social development projects in the
region.  In unusually candid terms, IDB president Enrique
Iglesias recently stated that the increase in poverty is
largely a result of the structural adjustment programs pushed
by the IDB, the World Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) since the early 1980s.
     "During the last decade, the central concerns were how to
overcome hyperinflation, survive economically, and maintain
payments on the foreign debt," said Iglesias in an interview
with the Uruguayan magazine Posdata, published in early
November.  "As a result, efforts to deal with the social
conditions of our citizens were postponed, and those
conditions grew worse.  Now that the economies of the region
have become more manageable, we must begin to focus on social
problems, especially the appearance of large groups of newly
poor who have emerged as a byproduct of structural adjustment
policies."
     Iglesias warned that governments must begin to deal with
social problems immediately, before those problems spin out of
control.
     "Marginalized social groups, whose problems have largely
been ignored, are making their presence known in stark forms
throughout Latin America, such as the uprising of Indian
communities in the Mexican state of Chiapas and the recent
popular revolts in some provinces in Argentina," said
Iglesias.  "Those episodes clearly demonstrate that there is
a growing social activism that can no longer be ignored."

CUBA: OFFICIALS PREDICT CONTINUED GROWTH IN TOURISM
AIDED BY EUROPEAN & LATIN AMERICAN INVESTMENT

     The Cuban tourism sector finished 1995 with a strong
showing in the number of travelers visiting the island.  Gross
receipts from tourism may soon become the country's most
important source of hard currency.
     Meanwhile, as the government concentrates on hotel
expansion and carefully planned cruise-ship projects with
European and Latin American investors, US travel executives
worry that the US economic embargo will shut them completely
out of the promising Cuban travel market.
     Economy and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
announced in November that the government expects earnings
from tourism to surpass sugar export earnings.  Poor sugar
harvests in the last three years have underlined the high cost
of dependence on sugar.  A sugar-for-oil barter deal with
Russia, signed Oct. 15, 1995, may prove disappointing because
of lower-than-expected results in the early stages of the
1995-1996 harvest, despite a US$200 million investment in
trucks, spare parts, and other harvesting inputs (see
Chronicle, 10/12/95).  As a result, planners now see tourism
as a more stable source of convertible currency.
     The Center for Cuban Economic Studies (Centro de Estudios
de la Economia Cubana) estimates that the planned development
of 67 tourist destinations on the island with a capacity to
accommodate 10 million tourists in 200,000 rooms will
eventually gross as much as US$15 billion annually.  While
this is a far cry from the US$1 billion predicted for 1996,
the Tourism Ministry (MINTUR) estimates that it will have
close to 50,000 rooms in place and will gross US$3.5 billion
annually in just four years.
     To finance such massive expansion, MINTUR is counting on
foreign investors covering much of the US$2.4 billion required
to develop the 67 resorts.  At present MINTUR is involved in
negotiations with over 200 prospective investors from 28
countries, and total foreign investment already secured
amounts to US$300 million.
     MINTUR predicts that 900,000 tourists will visit the
island in 1996.  This compares with an estimated 745,000 in
1995 and 630,000 in 1994.  Part of the increase in tourism
last year is explained by the gradual dissipation of the
negative public image that resulted from the August 1994
exodus of 30,000 Cubans who sailed for US waters in rafts.
     In addition, during the past two years, Cuba has improved
its tourism infrastructure with new hotel construction and
cruise-ship terminals.  On Dec. 2, 1995, Havana's new terminal
received its first ship, the 500-berth Costa Playa owned by
Italian cruise operator Costa Crociere.  The terminal is
housed in an 80-year old customs building renovated by Costa
Crociere as part of a US$12 million joint venture with the
Cuban government.  Costa Crociere has also renovated a
terminal in Santiago de Cuba in southeastern Cuba and plans to
build a third terminal in Mariel, west of Havana.
     It took Costa Crociere chairman Alfonso Lavarello two
yeise lines have
sent representatives to Cuba to negotiate cruise-ship
contracts, including the London-based P&O line and Kloster
Cruises Ltd., a subsidiary of the Norwegian Vard line.
     Nevertheless, Cuban tourism planners are moving slowly
into the cruise business.  Growth in the number of cruise
lines calling on Cuban ports will be controlled as part of an
integrated tourism strategy.
     Central to that strategy is hotel construction, while the
cruise-ship sector will be kept at between 4% and 5% of the
tourism industry's gross receipts.  Cuba now has 25,000 hotel
rooms, double the number it had in 1989, and new construction
financed by foreign investment is in the works.  For example,
the French hotel company Accord plans to build 1,330 hotel
rooms on Cayo Coco off the northern coast of Cuba.  The
Mexican Grupo Domos, which is heavily invested in Cuban
telecommunications, and the Canadian mining firm Sherritt are
both planning to expand into hotel and resort ventures.
     Thousands of additional rooms rented out by private
citizens for a fraction of the price charged by resort hotels
augment the industry's capacity.  In recent months the
government has taken steps to control dollar distribution and
to tax private services that have sprung up since late 1993,
when the economy was opened up to a degree of private
enterprise (see Chronicle, 10/26/95).  But rather than
clamping down on unauthorized room rental businesses, MINTUR
has begun to regulate them and has set up an agency called
Dulce Hogar to place tourists in private houses and
apartments.
     While European and Latin American investors move into the
growing Cuban travel market, their US counterparts are showing
increasing impatience with the 33-year old economic embargo
and restrictions on travel by US citizens to Cuba.
     In early December, a group of executives from US credit-
card companies, travel agencies, and other travel-related
businesses went to Havana to talk with MINTUR officials and to
visit hotels and other tourist facilities in and around Havana
and Santiago de Cuba.
     The visit was surrounded by some secrecy as the names and
affiliations of the visitors were not made available to the
media.  But Cuban officials said it was the largest group from
the US travel industry to come to Cuba since the triumph of
the revolution in 1959.  John Kavulich, president of the
US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which coordinated the
visit, said it was a "private, familiarization trip."
     But at a White House Conference on Travel and Tourism in
November, the subject of Cuba was not on the agenda.  However,
Darryl Hartley-Leonard, chairman of the Hyatt Hotels
corporation said, "Everybody discusses Cuba.  All the time."
     "I think we're losing it," Hartley-Leonard said.  "Have
we completely lost out?  No.  But we're losing an opportunity.
All of us encourage continual review of our policies toward
that country.  It's the next great international opportunity,
far more than the East bloc.  But Congress, in its wisdom,
chooses to reinforce the embargo."  (Sources: San Jose Mercury

By Dale Andrade

You never know where terrorists might turn up. They might
be anywhere, though we have a hard time believing that
they live among us. Sure, a few homegrown ones surface
here in the United States now and then, but how about the
international variety, particularly the ones who wreak
havoc throughout the Middle East?

Unless you followed the news very closely, you probably
missed the shocker of the year: the new head of Islamic
Jihad is a college professor from the University of
Florida in Tampa. That's right. As hard as it is to
believe that a high-ranking leader from one of the most
violent terrorist organizations in the Middle East might
be living here in the States, that is exactly what
happened.

Islamic Jihad is an Iranian-backed organization with a
sworn hatred of Israel and an intractable opposition to
the Middle East peace process. Its suicide bombers have
killed several Israeli soldiers and an American college
student. Although overshadowed by Hamas, during the past
few months Israeli intelligence has kept an especially
watchful eye on Islamic Jihad, which last October saw its
last leader, Fathi Shiqaqi, assassinated in Malta,
probably by Israeli agents.  While all this was
happening, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah quietly minded his
own business as a professor of Middle
Eastern studies at the University of South Florida.
Fellow faculty members and students remembered Shallah as
a scholar concerned about the image of Islam worldwide.
"He didn't
seem like a radical to me," one of Shallah's students
told the New York Times. Another said there was "never
any
indication that he had any sympathy with acts of terror
for anyone's cause."

Last June, Dr. Shallah left the United States saying he
needed to tend to his gravely ill father in Gaza. In
reality he went back to take the reins of Islamic Jihad.
With the
death of Shiqaqi, the mild-mannered professor tore off
his mask and declared Israel to be the implacable enemy
of Arabs in the Middle East and swore to destroy the
peace process. Shallah praised the assassination of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and promised a "hard
war" against Israel.

There's another twist to the story. While Shallah may
have fooled his academic colleagues, his cover roused the
suspicion of the most hardcore of Islamic fundamentalists
-- the mullahs in Iran. Immediately after word went out
that
Shallah was the new head of Islamic Jihad, Tehran let it
be known that he has had "suspicious contacts" with US
and
British intelligence. Both groups deny any ties, but note
that Iran thinks Shallah is too moderate for the job.

Why hole up in Tampa rather than Iran? According to the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the scenario fits
precisely with Islamic Jihad's new tactics. Beginning in
1988 the group began moving its leaders who were not
directly involved in terrorism to quiet spots overseas.
Modern technology in the form of faxes and the Internet
has allowed them to stay in touch and ready for action at
a
moment's notice. How many others might be under our
noses?
Unfortunately, CTS has not been able to unmask any other
"sleeping" terrorists, but we do have articles designed
to keep security professionals on top of the latest in
counterterrorism. Associate Editor Jack Plaxe profiles
the US State Department's "Rewards Program for Terrorism
Information," which promises $2 million for vital
information which prevents a terrorist act or leads to
the apprehension of wanted terrorists. In this issue we
also
propose new measures to enhance the security of civil
aviation, and look at how organized crime is threatening
the economic security of South Africa. Contributing
editor Tom Marks looks at the ongoing terrorism in Sri
Lanka, one of
the world's last bastions of Marxist insurgency. On the
practical side, learn about new techniques in crisis
management, plus what to do to prevent being kidnapped,
or if you are, how to survive the ordeal.

In short, there's something in this issue for everyone in
the security business.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part I

Your early morning flight from Los Angeles International
Airport to Washington, DC, has leveled off at 37,000
feet. As the plane crosses the Rocky Mountains, flight
attendants scurry up and down the aisles serving
breakfast. You settle back into your seat to watch the
movie.

Suddenly, without warning, your senses are overwhelmed by
a deafening bang and a billowing cloud of smoke. You
barely have time to scream before you find yourself
hurtling through the air, surrounded by passengers and
debris from the disintegrating aircraft. Deprived of
oxygen and suffering from shock, you black out as your
body accelerates toward the earth. You, along with 299
other passengers and crew, have died because of a
terrorist bomb hidden in luggage stowed in the jet's
belly.

Fortunately, most air travelers will never experience the
horror of being sucked out of an airplane following an
in-flight explosion. Yet this scenario is more than an
idle fantasy conjured by a fertile imagination. Since
1985 more than 1,000 passengers and crew have died
because terrorists penetrated security and smuggled a
bomb on board a civilian airliner. Airplanes of carriers
such as Pan Am, TWA, UTA, and Avianca have been bombed by
terrorists, with devastating consequences.

Aviation bombings are rare, but they represent a serious
threat that the aviation community is not yet prepared to
counter effectively and consistently, especially within
the continental United States. While security measures
are in place to reduce vulnerabilities to this threat, we
are still years away from deploying explosive detection
systems that are reliable, efficient, and cheap.

Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is
moving proactively to beef up domestic security and
eliminate the gap between international and domestic
procedures. This has sparked an outcry from airline
executives and airport operators--who have legitimate
concerns that they will be unable to bear the financial
cost estimated at over $2 billion dollars--of
implementing the newly mandated procedures.

Where is the US aviation security system headed? What are
actual threats facing civil aviation? What are the
implications of tougher domestic security measures for
airline and airport executives as well as the traveling
public? These questions have unleashed a highly
contentious process that will ultimately require both the
federal government and the airline industry to reassess
how aviation security should be organized, implemented,
and funded.
The Aviation Security System

Security for airline passengers currently is handled in
two arenas- one international and one national.
Internationally, security standards set by the
International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Annex
17, offers a least common denominator approach to
security. While accepted internationally, these standards
fall short of providing a tough set of measures that
protect air carriers targeted by terrorists. For
countries like the United States, however, Annex 17 is a
starting point for security rather than the final
destination.


The real action on security occurs at the national level.
By law and by tradition, a nation has the right to set
and enforce aviation security practices for their flag
carriers, regardless of where they operate, and for
foreign carriers that depart from its airports. In actual
operation, however, these rights are not exercised
equally. The United States, in particular, has been very
aggressive in setting the standards and practices used
for aviation security. Its influence is partly due to its
vast market--a huge number of passengers fly on US
carriers, and a large number of foreign carriers want to
fly to the United States.

Two US laws provide the legal foundation guiding how the
US carries out the aviation security mission,
particularly overseas: the Foreign Airport Security Act
of 1986 and the Aviation Security Improvement Act of
1990. Both laws recognize the principle that a
country--in this case the United States--has the
sovereign right to control who lands planes in its
territory. The United States can set standards for any
carrier that wants to land in the United States,
although foreign carriers are not required to use the
same security programs followed by US carriers. The legal
framework also requires the US government to assess
security at any foreign airport where US carriers
operate. In addition, the FAA monitors the overseas
performance of security procedures, such as adding
personnel to screen passengers prior to allowing them on
board a plane, or requiring passengers to be screened
with metal detectors before boarding a plane.

If the world consisted of only one nation, the task of
aviation security would be simple and straightforward. In
the multinational world, however, aviation security
involves more confusion and conflict than clarity. A US
carrier operating in Germany, for instance, must carry
out extraordinary procedures mandated by the FAA. Yet,
the same US air carrier's operations at Frankfurt's
international airport are controlled primarily by
Germany's federal government, and the Hessian State
Government in particular.  While the FAA can dictate the
procedures US carriers must follow and fine them for
lapses in security, its ability to monitor those
procedures falls under the jurisdiction and laws of
Germany. In addition, foreign carriers flying to the
United States claim that under Annex 17 the United
States cannot compel them to impose tighter security
procedures. The FAA can only require foreign carriers to
implement higher standards if they are departing from a
US airport.
For many years the demands of operating in an
international environment have generated friction between
the FAA and US air carriers. Prior to the bombing of Pan
Am 103, US air carriers complained regularly that they
were being held accountable by the US government for
implementing security procedures, but were on their own
in securing the permission of the host government.

In the aftermath of Pan Am 103 the U.S. Government
expanded its role in helping US-based air carriers
resolve disputes with foreign authorities over
implementing security procedures. For instance, US air
carriers operating in Great Britain and Germany in the
spring of 1992 were co-located at check-in counters with
Iran Air. Because of Iran's dubious status as a state
sponsor of terrorism, the carriers expressed fears that
the Iranian airline officials, by virtue of their
proximity, would gain knowledge about US mandated
security procedures. Agreeing that the carriers
had a legitimate concern, the US State Department,
working with the FAA, interceded with British and German
officials to provide a solution.

The FAA is doing a good job of protecting US airline
passengers, but its ability to do an even better job is
hampered by its second-class status within the federal
bureaucracy and internal conflicts resulting from
carrying out its other regulatory missions--e.g., flight
safety and airport operations. At the White House and the
National Security Council, for example, transportation
security issues in general, and aviation in particular,
are handled on an ad hoc basis. This has been the case
for both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Accordingly, the FAA must use a rather convoluted
bureaucratic chain of command to bring serious security
issues to the attention of the president. If the FAA's
Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security
decides punitive action is required against a country for
inadequate security, such as suspending flights, he would
first inform the FAA Administrator who in turn would
present the issue to the Secretary of Transportation. It
is the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation
to present the issue to the White House.

The FAA's regulatory missions also cloud its security
mission. Witness the recent effort, for example, to raise
security standards at airports around the country. This
has touched off an intensive behind-the-scenes lobbying
campaign by representatives of the air carriers and
airport operators who believe the FAA is going too far.
Many on the commercial side of the aviation industry
argue that the new measures threaten the economic
viability of the industry, and that in the absence of a
specific, credible threat, the additional procedures are
not being implemented in accordance with the criteria
specified in established contingency plans. Along with
industry complaints, some members of Congress have
weighed in on the debate, questioning the basis for the
recommendations of the FAA security experts.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part II

Assessing the Threat

Unfortunately, the wrong question is being asked. We
should be less concerned about whether or not security
officials are accurately evaluating new threat
information and focus instead on whether it is even
appropriate to base an aviation security system on our
ability to get accurate, predictive intelligence.
Traditionally, an increased threat has been the impetus
for installing new security procedures. This approach is
dangerous. Contrary to conventional wisdom, intelligence
agencies rarely get information that permits a policy
maker or security official to take preventative action or
predict what a terrorist will do. It is worth noting that
the vast majority of terrorist attacks against
aviation--most notably the bombings of Pan Am 103 and UTA
772--have occurred without advance warning. The recent
capture of Ramzi Yousef in the Philippines just before he
launched an attack against airliners flying across the
Pacific was a rare exception, and that happened mostly by
luck. Usually, accurately predicting the weather in
Oklahoma next year is far easier than accurately
predicting if there will be a terrorist attack in
Oklahoma City.

The inadequacy of intelligence as a foundation for
determining the appropriate security levels in the United
States has become more difficult because the groups now
responsible for most terrorist activity around the world
are not easily penetrated by traditional intelligence
methods. With the end of the Cold War the threat has
shifted away from national liberation movements to groups
affiliated with extremist religious organizations. We
need only recall the bombing of the World Trade Center,
the nerve gas attacks in the Tokyo subway, the bus
bombings In Israel, and the airplane hijacking in Algeria
to realize that the culprits are drawn from radical
religious sects rather than the more familiar Cold War
groups, such as the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigade.

Moreover, going after these groups poses some daunting
civil rights and legal issues. Is the United States
prepared to authorize the FBI or the CIA carte blanche to
spy on religious organizations? In the wake of Ruby Ridge
and Waco this appears to be an unlikely option. Yet as we
near the dawn of the 21st century, we are likely to see
more, not fewer, radical groups who believe that they are
agents of some deity to bring to pass a divine judgment
or retribution on a wicked world.

Instead of waiting for a spy to discover a terrorist plot
and pass this information on to the appropriate
authorities, the aviation security system should be
designed to prevent acts and deter threats. Failure to
implement such a system can have disastrous results. The
December 1994 hijacking of an Air France flight from
Algeria is a case in point. Anyone who has monitored the
front page of a major newspaper during 1994 would recall
that Algeria has been wracked for several years by a wave
of terrible terrorist violence. Much of this violence has
been carried out by radical Islamic groups bent on
ousting a secular government. Notwithstanding the
violence, the French adopted the traditional approach to
aviation security by relying on Algerian authorities to
maintain the appropriate level of security. This approach
left 170 passengers and crew vulnerable to the events
that ensued on December 24.

Four hijackers affiliated with the Armed Islamic Group
disguised themselves as airport security officials and
overwhelmed the Air France crew. After killing three
passengers, including a French citizen, the hijackers
were allowed to take off and subsequently land in
Marseilles, France, on December 26. As the situation
continued to deteriorate, French commandos stormed the
plane, rescued the passengers and crew, and killed the
hijackers. The world was aghast when it learned the
hijackers had placed explosives on board the plane,
intending to blow it up in the air over Paris. Only in
the aftermath of this narrowly averted aerial kamikaze
assault on Paris did French security officials tighten
security on flights between Algeria and France and assert
their right to monitor Algerian and the airline
compliance.

The world can no longer run the risk, as did France in
Algeria, of a security system hastily put together in
reaction to specific incidents. During the late 1960s and
early 1970s a surge aircraft hijackings within the United
States prompted the introduction of walk-through metal
detectors at US airports. Requiring pre-board security
screening led subsequently to a dramatic reduction of
domestic hijackings by individuals who had smuggled guns
on board aircraft. We did not see a similar decline in
international hijackings, at least initially, because
neither the United States nor the airlines could
unilaterally force other countries to adopt these
security measures.

Then in the wake of the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am 73,
which resulted in the deaths of 22 people and injuries to
more than 125, the FAA tightened security screening
procedures for US air carriers operating internationally.
Since 1986 no US air carriers have been hijacked because
a terrorist defeated the preboard passenger screening
process.

Coping With Today's Threat

Today we have a sound security system for defeating
hijackings that is rooted in technology--walk through
metal detectors and x-ray--and relies on human operators.
Although a number of systems are coming on the market
that try to automate this procedure or improve the
ability of the security personnel to locate a weapon in
carry-on baggage, the decisions of human beings still
play a large role in ensuring that weapons are not
carried on board an airplane. In the case of explosives
detection, however, the security advantage
evaporates--even in the presence of knowledgeable
security personnel. Unlike the systems to prevent
hijackings, there is no comparable technology presently
available for detecting explosives that meets three key
criteria: reasonably priced, reliable, and efficient.
Instead of solving the problem with technology, the
airline industry is forced to rely on assumptions about
human behavior--such as hoping that most people do not
have a death wish and will not wittingly carry a bomb on
board a plane.

When the FAA ordered airports and airlines in the United
States to implement new security measures in August of
this year they were acting preventively. This is another
sign of the improvements the FAA has made in security
operations since Pan Am 103. Instead of reacting to a
specific threat the FAA is taking into account a variety
of events. Topping the list was the fear of retaliation
from radical Islamic groups if a guilty verdict was
delivered in the conspiracy case against Egyptian cleric
Sheik Rahman. Another concern was the threat issued by
the radical Palestinian group Hamas, warning it would
attack the United States if one of its leaders was
extradited from to Israel. In addition, the FAA believes
the World Trade Center in New York City and the federal
building in Oklahoma City have dispelled the notion that
the United States is domestically immune to the threat of
terrorism. Accordingly, they have decided that there can
no longer be one level of security for international
flights and a lower level for domestic operations.

The implications of this decision are enormous and will
impose substantial economic costs on air carriers and
airports, which will be passed on to the traveling
public. But, in our professional judgment, the FAA's
action is warranted and appropriate for the times. The
major consequence of the FAA decision will be seen in the
area of positive passenger bag match (PPBM). Simply put,
PPBM is coming to America.

Positive passenger bag match ensures that no baggage will
be carried on a plane unless the passenger that checked
the bag is also on board. This system has proven
effective in deterring and preventing aircraft bombings
on international flights. It has not been used
domestically, however, because air carriers say that they
cannot implement the procedure and maintain the same
level of service. Part of the problem is the enormous
volume of domestic traffic and the short connecting time
between flights in the hub and spoke system in use today.
Keeping passengers and bags together is already a
difficult task. Most in the airline industry argue that
PPBM on domestic flights will force a dramatic cutback in
the number of flights and operational efficiency. Yet,
industry insiders also concede that if a bomb explodes on
board a domestic flight any opposition to PPBM will be
moot. Moving to PPBM will be costly. According to sources
in both the FAA and the aviation industry, a recent study
puts the first year cost of implementing PPBM at between
two and three billion dollars. While this is a lot of
money, it works out to roughly two dollars per passenger
per flight. Implementing PPBM would probably remove as
many as three banks of flights per day from the current
ten bank system. This will create inconveniences for
passengers and could bankrupt several of the weaker
carriers, according to industry officials.

Not taking action, however, would be even more costly.
Conservative estimates of the bombing of Pan Am 103 put
expenses at close to two billion dollars. The loss of Pan
Am 103 was a fatal blow to the carrier's viability as a
commercial entity. This financial loss does not include
the emotional suffering of those who lost loved ones.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part III

Next Steps to a Secure Future

We are entering a new era of aviation security that will
change how airlines and airports do business and how you
travel. While the adjustments may not be easy,
particularly in the beginning, the results will make
traveling by air more safe in the long run. The choice
before the US government is whether or not it wants to
strengthen its ability to prevent terrorist acts against
civil aviation. Because US aviation is a high profile
target of terrorist threats, and since commercial
aviation plays an important role in supporting national
defense, the federal government should treat aviation
security as part of a national defense strategy. American
carriers are targeted by terrorists because they have the
US flag on their tails. They are surrogate targets. And
US commercial air carriers play a key role in US military
operations, assisting in the transport of troops or
materiel during national crises. It is, therefore,
reasonable for the federal government to view protecting
commercial aviation as a national security issue.
Instituting this reform would require significant changes
at the Federal level. One approach would be moving the
security function currently performed by the FAA to the
Department of Defense. The responsibility for protecting
commercial airlines should be handled by an Assistant
Secretary for Transportation Security. This job would
have both international and domestic responsibilities. In
addition, the federal government should take on the job
of security at airports rather than leaving it up to
local governments or the private sector. Many foreign
governments successfully carry out aviation security
functions themselves rather than relying on private
industry, and the United States should do the same.

The second step towards better security is eliminating
the dichotomy between international and domestic security
procedures. The FAA deserves praise for moving in this
direction. Unwilling to wait for terrorists to bomb a
domestic airliner, the FAA is pursuing a course of
preventative action by requiring airports and air
carriers operating within the United States to use
security procedures comparable to those in place for
international flights. At the same time, the FAA is going
to need the muscle of the White House and the Secretary
of State to insist that other countries who fly to the
United States use the same kind of security program that
US carriers are required to use.

This issue--known colloquially as the level playing field
within the aviation industry--is very controversial. The
controversy pits US air carriers against the principle of
national sovereignty. The carriers argue that because
they must bear the cost of security requirements levied
by the federal government they are put at a competitive
disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign carriers, who do not have
to adopt the same practices. Yet the FAA alone does not
have the political clout to insist that all countries
coming to the United States must follow the same
procedures. If it tried to enforce this requirement the
FAA would find itself in the middle of a huge foreign
policy wrangle. In fact, several countries have warned
that they will prohibit the FAA from inspecting their
airports if such a law is passed. Without access to these
airports the FAA will be unable to certify whether or not
adequate security procedures are in place to protect US
passengers.

This brings us back to the relevance of treating aviation
security as a national security priority. Eliminating the
gap in security practices and achieving greater
uniformity in security standards requires stronger
federal leadership, starting with the president and the
Congress.

Finally, a critical element in achieving better aviation
security is technology. The mission for protecting
airliners is very simple: do not let unauthorized people
with weapons get on board planes, and do not allow bombs
on board planes. While there is a technological solution
for weapons--guns and knives--there is no similar
technological fix for detecting explosives.

The two best systems on the market for detecting
explosives at airports are dogs and the COX 5000. Mother
Nature still has the edge in explosives detection,
winning by a nose--a dog's nose. But while they are very
effective, dogs are not feasible for handling daily
responsibilities at a high volume airport such as
Chicago's O'Hare or Los Angeles International.

The other option is the CTX 5000, a third generation
x-ray computed tomographic (CT) scanner. Similar to
medical CAT scan technology, the CTX 5000 creates a cross
section image of luggage and analyzes it using
sophisticated software, which automatically identifies
explosives based on their known CT signatures. This is
the only system currently certified by the FAA as an
explosive detection system. One shortcoming of the CTX
5000 is its relatively slow processing speed for bags.
Efficiency could be improved dramatically by using these
units in combination with the airlines' computer
rservation systems to identify passengers whose luggage
needs more scrutiny. The FAA is funding the development
and testing of a computer reservations system that could
be used in conjunction with other security technologies.

Experts agree that presently there are no available
technologies that can be installed in airports that are
reasonably priced, efficient, and reliable. Achieving a
technological solution to the threat of explosives is
feasible but will require a refocused effort. The current
research program under the auspices of the FAA's
Technical Center is spending only $37 million annually to
find a single technology that can meet the operational
requirements of airlines and the security standards of
the FAA. Finding this silver bullet has been an elusive
prey and more difficult task than anyone imagined.

A study commissioned earlier this year by Congressmen
Benjamin Gilman and Lee Hamilton is being conducted by
the General Accounting Office and may provide answers or
recommendations on how to tackle this thorny issue. One
resource that has been ignored in this technological
quest is the national laboratory system. Labs such as
Sandia, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest are
staffed by scientists and engineers well suited to
looking for answers to these types of questions.
Unfortunately they have not yet been brought to bear on
this issue.

We are moving into a new era of better aviation security.
Because of hard lessons learned from previous terrorist
and criminal attacks the government and industry are
better prepared and in the best position ever to confront
the current threat. Yet the current system is flawed and
additional changes are needed. As the number of
commercial flights continue to expand, the number of
passengers increase, and the next generation of aircraft
are deployed, the vulnerability of the system to
explosives will increase rather than diminish if new
technology is not developed. During the waning years of
the twentieth century, finding a solution to the threat
of explosives will preoccupy government and airline
security officials. It is an area requiring far greater

"All Hazards" Crisis Management Planning by Geary W.
Sikich

Crisis! Mere mention of the word evokes dread. It seems
you can't turn on the television or pick up a newspaper
anymore without reading about a crisis somewhere. They
can happen anywhere, from faraway countries to the
business around the corner. Yet, crises can be avoided.
Those on the far side of the world may be beyond our
control, but if something happens to your business, it's
your responsibility to solve it. The key is to develop
and implement a well-defined crisis management program.
With one in place, business leaders can mitigate the
potentially disastrous effects of any incident.
Management is never put more strongly to the test than in
a crisis situation. The objectives are immediate and so
are the results. What you and those around you do--or
don't do--will have lasting implications. Today,
individuals responsible for the management of businesses
and public agencies must deal effectively with
increasingly complex laws and issues or face the
consequences.

What if...? You came to your office for the beginning of
your work week and because of some unforseen event there
were no employees, no working telephones, no functioning
computers, no utilities. You're the chief executive. What
would you do? Where would you start? Unquestionably this
is a crisis. Remember, you have access to almost none of
your regular business tools.

If this had been an actual incident, such as many
businesses experienced during the Chicago flood in April
1992, it would already have been too late to concern
yourself with developing a crisis management program!
You've got to have a program in place to ensure
continuity of operations. But, what kind of Crisis
Management Program? To answer this question you must
first define the crisis.

A crisis can be defined as any unplanned event,
occurrence or sequence of events that has a specific
undesirable consequence.

Natural disasters, financial manipulation, societal
disruption, pollution, and stringent regulations are but
a few examples of potential crisis situations. The
reasons for focusing on these issues may result from a
commitment to protect the public, your employees, to
comply with government regulations or to protect the firm
from possible liabilities and litigation. The
consequences for not focusing on these issues can be
disastrous.
Ask yourself why do we need a crisis management program
with an "all hazards" approach? Put simply, such a
program allows you to provide for:
* Effective coordination of activities among the
organizations having a management/response role

* Early warning and clear instructions to all concerned
if a crisis occurs * Continued assessment of actual and
potential consequences of the crisis
* Continuity of business operations during and
immediately after the crisis
A brief synopsis of the common weaknesses in crisis
management planning may prove helpful. As you read the
discussion on the four basic elements, keep these
weaknesses in mind. You may also want to assess your
current crisis management program against these
weaknesses. The most common weaknesses in crisis
management planning are:
* No systematic collection of planning information. This
includes such aspects as hazard analysis, organizational
information, regulatory guidance, company policy
procedures and location-specific data.

* No systematic dissemination of planning information.
You've assembled a wealth of information and have not
shared it with the effected population--those whose
responsibility it is to implement the plan.

* Failure to identify and establish an incident command
structure. This is a common pitfall as many planners try
to fit their organization into a standard incident
command system not designed around their particular
needs.

* Minimal coordination with effected entities. Poor
communications with the community, neighboring
industries, and identified support entities (fire,
police, hospitals, etc.) can lead to confusion and chaos
during an emergency. A simple oversight, such as failure
to designate a primary contact for offsite agencies
during an emergency, can cause major disruption during an
incident.

* Lack of, or poorly defined, organizational
responsibilities. Failure to provide clear, concise
procedures defining a person's functions, duties, and
tasks upon assuming their emergency organization
position. This weakness can lead to finger
pointing--"It's not my responsibility!"--"I thought it
was yours!"

* Once developed, the program is poorly maintained. Your
program was developed to meet a regulatory requirement.
Why should you test it? You're not planning on having any
accidents! Often, there is no provision for continued
evaluation and periodic update of the material.
Frequently, changed material, such as telephone numbers
are buried in various paragraphs throughout the plan.

* The material you developed is not user-friendly. Your
plan contains information--lots of it. Unfortunately, the
user has to be a brain surgeon to figure out his/her role
in its implementation. You did not provide simple,
easy-to-use supplemental materials that can be used as a
quick reference guide during an emergency. Worse yet, you
didn't train anyone on the plan and their role in its
implementation.

* You did not disseminate the plan to the proper
authorities. Failure to include appropriate parties on
the distribution list most often leads to failure on
their part to respond in the manner you had hoped for.

The Plan

You may think that it is too difficult and time consuming
to develop a cohesive crisis management program. However,
when broken down into its basic elements, a plan consists
of only four parts. These are:

*Compliance
*Preparedness
*Training
*Information Management

Although no two crisis management programs are exactly
alike, these are the critical aspects of any plan. We
will discuss each of these aspects briefly.
COMPLIANCE

How do you reduce the vulnerability posed by potential
crises? A system that will advise you of the initiatives
to be addressed is needed. This will allow you to act in
a responsible manner to fulfill the purpose and intent of
existing legislation.
It can also provide a framework for anticipating future
legislation. An effective system for compliance can be
developed only if you know what laws and regulations
pertain to your operation. In order to accomplish this
task, a survey of all operations should be undertaken.
The survey should include:

*General Administrative Information
*Management Awareness and Control Programs
*Identification of Hazards/Potential Crises
*Business Characterization

The ultimate benefits to be gained from this type of
survey are in terms of identifying areas in need of
attention, establishing a list of potential crisis
situations, determining what commitments you are
comfortable with, and documenting current efforts. Once
the survey program has been developed and implemented, it
must be evaluated and kept up-to-date. This can be
accomplished by reviewing actual responses, and by
conducting a detailed audit of each element of the
business.

The survey program is the initial step, toward reducing
vulnerability. Next, you must organize the operation. The
management chain is critical to this process. You must
ensure that all levels of management become part of the
program. This can be achieved in several ways:

* Make a senior manager directly responsible to top
management and the board of directors. The formal
assignment of a senior manager to the position of "Crisis
Management Programs, Director," or some other appropriate
title, can accomplish the initial portion of this item.
Additionally, you will want to establish within the
individual's job description some measurement standard to
evaluate performance. This goes both ways. Upper
management has to take responsibility for developing
measurable and attainable goals for the Program Director
to achieve.

* Set aside specific time for reports on crisis
management preparedness issues. This can be accomplished
by preparing an agenda for senior staff and board of
director meetings that includes a discussion of crisis
management preparedness as a mandatory item. You have to
give it more than lip service, though. Also, you must
make the discussion substantive. Provide more than the
dull and tiring statistics on reportable accidents, etc.
Include all levels of personnel in the presentation
process. This can be very effective and it gets the
message out to all personnel that your company is serious
about crisis management preparedness.

* Make crisis management planning issues part of the
strategic planning process. In one aspect, government
regulations are defining strategic implications for
companies. Additionally, for publicly held companies,
Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the section of
the annual report entitled, "Management Analysis and
Discussion," requires a discussion of potential
liabilities. Another perspective on this issue really
begets changing the "corporate culture," i.e., making
crisis management preparedness a part of the way you do
business.

* Communicate compliance through all levels of the
organization using company policy and procedures. This
can be accomplished through formal adoption of policy at
the highest levels of the company. Generally, this will
require the approval of the Board of Directors. It is
essential, however, that companies become more aware of
their responsibilities in these areas--and this is one
way to build the awareness.
This discussion is limited by the space available to a
brief highlight of some approaches that can be
undertaken. Each company will find its situation and
circumstances to be unique to its corporate culture.
Whatever the case, however, an in-depth analysis of your
company's operating environment should be undertaken
before developing a program or attempting to address the
above items.

PREPAREDNESS

Preparedness used in the broadest context means any and
all measures taken to prevent, prepare for, respond,
mitigate, and recover from a crisis. It's with this
perspective that we begin to breakdown the aspect of
preparedness. There are four critical aspects:
*Preparation and Prevention
*Detection and Classification
*Response and Mitigation
*Reentry and Recovery

*Preparation and Prevention: Any set of activities that
prevent a crisis, reduce the chance of a crisis
happening, or reduce the damaging effects of a crisis.
Preparation and prevention activities include, but are
not limited to:

* Development and implementation of the crisis management
program
* Development and implementation of crisis management
plan implementing procedures
* Development and implementation of crisis
management/response training
*Detection and Incident Classification: Actions taken to
identify, assess, and classify the severity of a crisis.
Detection and classification activities include, but are
not limited to:

* Activation of crisis management systems
* Activation of crisis management plan implementing
procedures * Activation of the crisis management/response
organization
*Response and Mitigation: Actions taken to save lives,
prevent further damage and reduce the effects of the
crisis. Response and mitigation activities include, but
are not limited to:

* Crisis management/response organization operations
* Affiliated crisis management/response organizations'
operations * Continuity of business operations

*Reentry and Recovery: Actions taken to return to a
normal or an even safer situation following the crisis.
Reentry and recovery activities include, but are not
limited to:
* Activation of the reentry and recovery organization
* Coordination with affiliated recovery organizations
* Activation of the reentry and recovery plan

TRAINING AND RETRAINING

Training of personnel is the third component of the "all
hazards" approach. The training of the crisis
management/response organization is one of the critical
success factors that must be addressed if an adequate
response is to be achieved. The development of the
compliance program, involvement of all levels of
management, and establishing preparedness is only part of
the overall process. To ensure an adequate response, a
trained organization is required. A "systems" approach to
preparing effective training programs should consist of:

Task Analysis: When designing an integrated training
program, first determine the skills, knowledge, and
procedures required for satisfactory performance of each
task.
Lesson Development: Learning objectives are defined from
the skills, knowledge, and procedures developed during
task analysis. Instructional plans are then prepared to
support the learning objectives.

Instruction: Lessons are systematically presented using
appropriate instructional methods. Instruction may
include lecture, self-paced or group-paced mediated
instruction, simulation, and team training.

Evaluation: Performance standards and evaluation criteria
are developed from the learning objectives. Each
trainee's performance is evaluated during the course and
during field performance testing.

In addition to the formal training program, a program of
proficiency demonstration is also needed. This can be
accomplished by establishing a program that supplements
the training with drills and exercises. The drill program
can vary in degree of complexity.
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

The need to establish and maintain an ongoing dynamic
crisis management program is essential. The crisis
management process doesn't end just because you finished
the crisis management plan, are in compliance, have
involved management, and trained the staff.
In order to facilitate planning requirements, a record of
all initiatives should be retained. These records serve
to document the accomplishments, requirements,
commitments, and reports relating to various program
requirements. The identification of commitments in the
areas of compliance, emergency preparedness, and training
is vital. The establishment of a defined information
management system structure will ensure that
documentation will be available when needed.

Senior management must be kept well-informed. Information
is a corporate asset. Information is expensive and it
must be shared and managed effectively. Information
management is also critical during a crisis. The need for
active systems to provide information on materials,
personnel, capabilities information on materials,
personnel, capabilities, and processes is essential. It
is extremely important to have a system (and adequate
back-up systems) in place that serves to identify,
catalog, set priorities, and track issues and commitments
relating to crisis management and response activities.
Conclusion

In almost every instance of successful response to a
crisis, management and response activities consisting of
sound operating execution, coupled with superior
communication, predominate. Operational response is
essential. It saves lives, property, and other assets.
The ability to communicate is no less important. It saves
the business.
The simple fact is: perception is reality. Public
perception of your company's reaction to a crisis is as
important as your operating response. Lessons learned in
crises ranging from Three Mile Island nuclear crisis to
the Exxon Valdez oil spill validate the need for a
dynamic crisis management program.

Trust and confidence in the abilities of middle level
management must be established. "How well have my people
prepared?" This question can only be answered
satisfactorily if you have established a level of trust
and confidence, can communicate risk, and are willing to
allow these managers to practice upward management--that
is to delegate up. They must have the ability to
recognize needs and have a process in place that allows
them to delegate up without fear of repercussions.

Few crises will be as dramatic as Three Mile Island or
the Valdez ... unless it is your own. When your crisis
occurs, the hardest part of dealing with it can involve
answering the public call for information--a call
personified by a television correspondent or newspaper
reporter who shows up at your doorstep or on your
telephone line to get the story. How well you respond
depends on how well you are prepared.

HEROES: The US Government's Counterterrorism Rewards
Program by Jack Plaxe

The United States government has many resources at its
disposal which can be used in the fight against
terrorism. Various political, military, and diplomatic
options first come to mind, but there is one that is more
successful--the Counterterrorism Rewards Program of the
Diplomatic Security Service of the US Department of
State. Over the years this program has resulted in the
prevention of numerous terrorist attacks as well as the
apprehension of some of the world's most infamous
terrorists.
The Counter-Terrorism Rewards Program was established in
1984 by the Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public
Law 98-533. In 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security
was legislatively mandated to administer the program
under Public Law 99-399, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security
and Anti-Terrorism Act. While the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security is responsible for the day to day operations of
the program, it does so with policy guidance from the
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism.
Under the Rewards Program, individuals approach the State
Department with information regarding planned terrorist
attacks or details about past incidents.  If a
determination is made that the information provided is
useful, the cooperating individual will be given a
monetary reward. Rewards totaling millions of dollars
have been paid in more than twenty cases. Innocent lives
have been saved and terrorists have been apprehended,
arrested, and put behind bars.

These rewards are substantial. While the program
initially offered rewards up to $500,000, the maximum has
since been increased to $2 million. The only exception to
this is in the case of information provided that prevents
an attack against US civil aviation. In this case,
matching gifts raise the rewards to as high as $4
million.
In addition to providing monetary rewards, the State
Department can also help the cooperating individuals and
their immediate family members relocate to a safe
country.  If the individuals choose to come to the United
States, they can be afforded protection by the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security or placed into the US Marshals
Service Federal Witness Security Program, depending on
the specific situation.
Interagency Rewards Committee

The Director of the Diplomatic Security Service chairs an
interagency committee that identifies reward candidates
and recommends rewards to the Secretary of State. This
committee, known as the Interagency Rewards Committee, is
comprised of representatives from the White House
National Security Council staff, the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
US Marshals Service Witness Security Program, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Department of Energy, and
the Department of State.

The Interagency Rewards Committee is tasked with
determining which terrorist incidents merit inclusion in
the Program and the amounts that will be paid for
specific information. The Counterterrorist Rewards
Program is currently offering rewards for information
leading to the apprehension or capture of terrorists who
are responsible for some of the most deadly terrorist
attacks against both America and the international
community. These attacks include:

*The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 - on December 21, 1988,
terrorists destroyed Pan American flight 103 while it was
overflying Lockerbie, Scotland. The aircraft carried 259
citizens from 30 nations, including 189 Americans.
Another 11 citizens of Lockerbie perished on the ground
from the falling debris.

*The bombing of the World Trade Center - on February 26,
1993, a terrorist vehicle bomb detonated under the World
Trade Center in New York City. This attack killed six
innocent people, injured over 1,000 others, and trapped
terrified school children in a smoke-filled elevator for
hours.

*The AK-47 assault at CIA Headquarters - on January 25,
1993, Mir Aimal Kansi allegedly murdered two people and
seriously injured three others by firing an AK-47 assault
rifle into cars waiting at a stoplight near a gate the
CIA headquarters in Virginia.
*The hijacking of TWA Flight 847 - on June 13, 1985
terrorists from Hizballah hijacked TWA Flight 847. During
a violent rampage against passengers and crew, they beat
Navy Seabee Robert Stethem to death, then dumped his dead
body onto the tarmac.
*The bombing of TWA Flight 840 - on April 2, 1986, a bomb
detonated inside the passenger cabin of TWA Flight 840,
killing nine-month-old Demetra Stylian Klug, giving her
the distinction of being one of the youngest victims of
international terrorism.
*The kidnapping and murder of Americans in Lebanon -
During the 1980s, kidnapped American citizens were held
hostage in various locations throughout Lebanon. For long
and painful years, they were chained in the dark, beaten,
and denied medical care. Three were murdered during their
captivity.

These incidents represent some of the worst terrorist
attacks directed against the United States and the
international community. As such, it is only fitting that
the Rewards Program be used to see that the parties
responsible for the attacks are brought to justice.
Rewards Program Successes: An Emphasis on Prevention

During the first four years of the program, the State
Department offered specific rewards for information
leading to the arrest or conviction of those responsible
for specific terrorist attacks. After the bombing of Pan
Am 103 in December 1988, however, new emphasis was placed
on provisions of the law which allowed for payment of
rewards in cases where information led to the
"prevention, frustration, or favorable resolution of
terrorist attacks against United States persons."

Specific reward amounts for particular terrorist
incidents were no longer announced.  Instead, the
Secretary of State was authorized to pay for information
regarding any past, present, or planned future act of
terrorism. This policy reaped benefits during Operation
Desert Storm, during which the Rewards Program was
heavily publicized.
At the start of the Persian Gulf War, an informant in an
East Asian country came forward with alarming information
about a series of terrorist attacks planned by the Iraqi
intelligence service. The terrorists had already surveyed
their intended targets and acquired automatic weapons,
grenades, and high explosives for the attack. The
assaults  were beyond the planning stage and about to be
carried out.
One of the attacks, a planned terrorist bombing and
machine-gunning of airline ticket counters at a major
airport, was scheduled to be carried out within 48 hours.
The cooperating individual provided information which was
essential in thwarting the attacks.  As a result of the
timely receipt of this intelligence information, the
terrorists were stopped by the efforts of US and host
nation authorities. Had the planned attacks proceeded as
planned, many Americans and citizens of our coalition
partners would certainly have been murdered.

The informant and immediate family were relocated to a
safe location within the United States and given a reward
of approximately $500,000 for coming forward and
providing information that saved lives.

Pan Am Flight 103 Investigation

In the course of the Pan Am 103 investigation, forensic
evidence came to light that indicated that Libya was
behind the attack. In November of 1991, indictments were
issued for two Libyans who allegedly routed the suitcase
containing the bomb through the baggage system in Malta.
The two suspects, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset
Al-Megrahi, were allegedly Libyan intelligence agents who
worked undercover for Libyan Arab Airlines at the airport
in Malta.

In 1990, a Libyan by the name of Abu Maged Jiacha
defected to the United States.  Jiacha claimed to work
with the two Pan Am 103 bombing suspects at the airport
in Malta. He claims to have had knowledge of their bomb
plans and is believed to have provided investigators with
Fhimah's diary which allegedly contains a handwritten
notation linking him to the attack.

While Jiacha has been said to have provided information
on the Pan Am 103 case to the US government, it is
unclear if this was done through the Rewards Program.
However, he is currently a government witness in the
Federal Witness Security Program. While the two Pan Am
103 bombing suspects remain in Libya, there is little
doubt that Jiacha will play an important role in any
future criminal trial. When that trial may occur is
anyone's guess.

World Trade Center Bombing

On February 26, 1993, international terrorists launched a
bombing attack in downtown Manhattan. A large improvised
explosive device concealed in a cargo van was detonated
in the subterranean garage of the 110-story World Trade
Center complex. It was later learned from one of the
captured terrorists that the intention of the bombing was
to collapse one or both of the twin towers with hopes of
killing tens of thousands of innocent people.

Fortunately, the terrorists did not succeed.  However,
the bomb did destroy the underground parking facility and
resulted in the death of six innocent people and injuries
to over 1,000 others.  Some of the victims in this attack
were young school children who had been visiting the
Trade Center on a class field trip. As smoke from the
explosion billowed upwards, the terrified children were
trapped in one of the tower's elevator for hours.

Some of the terrorists suspected of involvement of the
World Trade Center bombing were quickly apprehended but
others managed to avoid capture. Suspected terrorists
Abdul Rahman Yasin and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef fled the United
States following the bombing. After indictments were
issued for the two, the United States launched a massive
international manhunt for the fugitives. Wanted posters
offering up to $2 million rewards for information leading
to their capture were distributed in a variety of
languages. Multi-language leaflets containing the reward
offers were also sent throughout the world. Even
matchbooks containing photos of the fugitives were
distributed.
In early February, a South African student living in
Pakistan approached security officials at the US embassy
and told them that he knew where Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was
hiding. Yousef was immediately put under 24-hour
surveillance to ensure that he would not manage to escape
a second time. On February 8, 1995 American and Pakistani
authorities moved in on and arrested Yousef. He was
quickly extradited to the United States, where he is
currently awaiting trial in a New York City detention
facility.  It is believed that the student tipped off
American authorities after he had seen a Rewards Program
matchbook with Yousef's photo.

Before his arrest in Pakistan, Yousef was busy planning
and carrying out terrorist attacks in Asia. He is
allegedly responsible for the bombing of Philippine
Airlines flight 434 which resulted in the death of
26-year-old Japanese engineer Haruki Ikegama. This attack
was reportedly a trial run for a simultaneous bombing
attack on eleven American air carriers operating in the
Pacific Rim. Fortunately, Yousef was forced to flee the
Philippines before the attack could be carried out.

Four Million Reasons to prevent Terrorism

While the Counterterrorism Rewards Program has certainly
enjoyed a number of successes over the years, not all of
the details of these successes are publicly available.
The reason for this is that in order for the program to
remain successful, it must continue to attract people who
have a knowledge of the activities of the terrorist
underworld. In order for these people to come forward,
they must be assured of complete confidentiality to
prevent any possible retaliation against them or their
families.  The result of this necessary secrecy is that
the work of the security specialists who work on the
Counterterrorism Rewards Program often goes unnoticed.

According to Diplomatic Security Special Agent Brad
Smith, who administers the program, the lack of
recognition can sometimes be frustrating. However, he has
been  pleased with the public recognition that the
program has received.  In fact, Smith was recently
honored by Tom Brokaw for the work that he has done over
the years to build and nurture the Rewards Program.

In 1990, the State Department forged a unique
public-private partnership with the Air Transport
Association of America and the Air Line Pilots
Association, International. Each organization has agreed
to pledge up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2
million reward paid by the US government for information
that prevents a terrorist act against US civil aviation
or leads to the arrest and conviction of any person who
has committed such an act.  This has resulted in a
maximum reward of up to $4 million in such cases.

This supplemental program came about largely through the
joint efforts of Special Agent Brad Smith and former Pan
American Airline pilot Bruce Smith (no relation). Captain
Smith, whose wife Ingrid was killed in the Pan Am flight
103 bombing, decided to immediately accept Pan American's
settlement offer of $100,000. He tried to convince other
family members who lost loved ones to do likewise so that
they could pool their money to offer a substantial reward
for the capture of the responsible parties. Unfortunately
for Captain Smith, few families followed suit.
After this minor setback, Smith undertook efforts to
lobby the Bush administration and airline trade
organizations to strengthen the Rewards Program. Smith
approached the Air Line Pilot's Association and the Air
Transport Association and convinced them to each pledge
up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2 million
government reward. The reward of $4 million was to be
used in the Pan Am 103 case and other cases involving
terrorist attacks against civil aviation. This $4 million
reward level remains in effect today.

The US government's standing reward offer of up to $2
million applies in all cases not addressed by this unique
partnership agreement. However, Captain Smith and his
attorney Mark Zaid are currently undertaking efforts to
expand the government partnership with private sector
funding sources through the newly created, not-for-profit
Foundation to Combat International Terrorism. The
foundation's main goal would be to provide grants to
supplement the rewards distributed by the Rewards
Program. This would allow the $4 million award level to
be offered outside the sphere of civil aviation and
hopefully entice more people to come forward with useful
information.
According to Zaid, the foundation was created in order to
expand upon the current Rewards Program activities in a
number of areas. For instance, Zaid explained that the
Foundation could assist in publicizing the Rewards
Program in key countries and regions without some of the
political constraints that currently restrain US efforts.
In addition, the foundation would also assist by allowing
the program to provide rewards to those states which
cooperate by providing timely intelligence information to
the United States that prevents terrorist activity. At
the present, states are not eligible to receive rewards
for information under the Rewards Program.

However, the Foundation to Combat International Terrorism
has met with some resistance within certain offices of
the State Department. Elements within the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security support the concept and goals of the
Foundation and have actively supported the idea.
Opposition to the foundation has come primarily from the
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, headed by
Ambassador Philip Wilcox.
In a letter to Mark Zaid dated October 16, Ambassador
Wilcox and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security
Anthony Quainton wrote that the State Department has
decided not to work with the Foundation because of the
"possible appearance of conflict of interest."

However, this is merely an excuse given to de-emphasize
the real reason for State's decision not to become
involved in the Foundation's work. According to the
letter, Wilcox and Quainton explain that "even as a
separate legal entity the Foundation cannot effectively
be distinguished from your own activities." This is a
reference to Zaid's work to revise the Foreign Sovereign
Immunity law which currently protects state sponsors of
terrorism from legal action by individual United States
citizens. Zaid and others are trying to get changes to
the law which would allow for Americans who have been the
victim of state-sponsored terrorism to have recourse
through the US legal system. The State Department is not
in favor of such revisions to the Sovereign Immunity law
because it would effectively undermine State's ability to
manage foreign relations, a power which it jealously
guards.

Efforts to Publicize the Rewards Program

The State Department maintains an ongoing public affairs
campaign to promote greater awareness of the Rewards
Program. This campaign includes efforts to both inform
the American public about the Rewards Program as well as
to disseminate information regarding available rewards to
those who might have information. Towards these ends,
advertisements have been placed to promote the program in
a variety of media. Print ads in English, Arabic,
Spanish, French, German, and Russian have appeared in
publications as diverse as The New York Times, Al Hayat,
Paris Match, Die Welt, and Pravda. Additionally, public
service announcements featuring entertainment
personalities Charlton Heston, Charles Bronson, and
Charlie Sheen have been widely distributed.
Charlton Heston  "... Real life heroes are ordinary
people who do extraordinary things for their fellow
man--like warning of acts of political violence that
could endanger innocent lives!"

Charles Bronson "... Persons with information about an
act of terrorism can be a hero by saving innocent lives.
The US government, along with associations of pilots and
airlines, is offering up to $4 million dollars for such
information."
Charlie Sheen  "... Confidentiality and protection can be
assured for these heroic people. Are you the next hero?"

In 1994, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program also went
on the Internet. The global reach of the Internet is
ideal for distributing information about the Rewards
Program. According to Special Agent Smith, "several
thousand" messages from people from 68 countries have
been sent to the HEROES electronic mailbox. The address
for the Heroes electronic mailbox is: heroes@clark.net.

At around the same time, the Rewards Program also

New Terrorism: The Shape of Things to Come by Harvey W.
Kushner, Ph.D.

As we approach the twenty-first century, law-enforcement
authorities will face a number of complicated issues.
Among the most troublesome is the continuing threat of
Middle Eastern terrorism. Although overshadowed by the
blast at the Oklahoma City Federal Center, the World
Trade Center bombing illustrates the seriousness of the
problem. Unfortunately, it is no longer feasible to rely
on past experiences with terrorism as a guide to
implementing future policy. Recent world events have so
altered Middle Eastern terrorism that we now face a
potentially more dangerous adversary that requires us to
rethink and formulate new tactics and strategies.

Out with the Old

The breakup of the Soviet Union deprived the tightly
organized, centrally directed, and usually secular
networks of sophisticated Middle Eastern terrorists of
money, weapons, and safe-havens. Aid from Eastern Europe
dried up as well. Even Syria and Libya, also traditional
sources of money and weaponry, have been lying low
knowing that they can no longer get backing in any
confrontation with the United States from a Soviet Bloc
that no longer exists.

Yasser Arafat himself contributed to the decline in the
old terrorism by making the tactical mistake of siding
with Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. After the Iraqi
defeat, Arafat could no longer expect his Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) to be the recipient of a
form of protection money from the rich and vulnerable oil
states. Just at the same time the oil money stopped
flowing, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA) cut much-needed financial aid to Palestinian
refugees in the occupied territories. With financial
support on the decline, Arafat's competition, Hamas (the
violent wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement) stepped
up its campaign to discredit his leadership. It is even
arguable that Arafat's troubles moved him to the peace
table with Israel before any fall from power.

The Gulf War also crippled Iraq's worldwide network of
terrorist's activities. Add to this the demise of a
terrorist network run from Tripoli and coordinated by
so-called diplomats operating out of Libyan embassies
around the world. Cuba, Syria, and Algeria also withdrew
from openly encouraging and supporting terrorists. In
short, these traditional actors and sponsors of terrorism
are either so damaged that they have no alternative but
to withdraw from their activities or are trying to
cultivate a new, more diplomatic image.
Credit is also due to the efforts of American
intelligence agencies and other foreign groups in their
proactive counterterrorist activities. These agencies
were instrumental in curtailing the activities of many
terrorist groups like the Red Army faction in Germany and
the Red Brigades in Italy. These left-wing groups were
supportive of the PLO and other secular terrorist groups.

In With the New

A new support center for terrorism in Iran emerged after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini toppled the Shah in 1979.
Iran immediately set out to export and finance it's
militant fundamentalist message throughout the Muslim
world. It supported militant Islamic fundamentalist
movements in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Sudan.
The impoverished Sudan provided Iran with its first
success. Nearly a decade after the Iranian revolution a
group of military officers and mullahs seized power in
Sudan installing the first Sunni Muslim republic. Sheik
Hassan al-Turabi, the Sorbonne-educated spiritual leader
of Sudan's Sunni Muslims, offered an olive branch to the
Shiite Muslims of Iran. The charismatic Turabi is
committed to ending the bitter historic enmity that has
separated Sunni and Shiite since the seventh century. He
has already been successful in bringing to Khartoum a
series of summit-type meetings with a variety of militant
Islamic fundamentalist groups and terrorist leaders.
Together these leaders have endorsed a terrorist
manifesto containing Machiavellian prescripts for
advancing militant Islamic fundamentalism.

The Shiite Muslim republic of Iran and it's Sunni Muslim
allies in Sudan have pooled their resources. Together
they hope to "Islamize" the Muslim world while embarking
on a systematic campaign of sponsoring international
terrorism. The linchpin of this partnership is oil-rich
Iran which supplies the finances, arms, and trainers from
the Revolutionary Guards and the secret army unit known
as Quds Force. Sudan's contributions to the partnership
include sanctuaries for terrorists and a series of
terrorist camps maintained by Sudan's Popular Defense
Forces (a quasi-military body modeled after Iran's
Revolutionary Guards).

The New Terrorist

Typically, young, uneducated, and unskilled, the new
terrorists come to these Sudanese camps directly from a
life of poverty and repression. They enter with a strong
belief in Islam as the way out of their dismal social
situation. Their militant Islamic fundamentalism is
reinforced by Islamic radicals versed in Koranic studies
and terrorist tactics they learned when fighting
alongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan. Unfortunately,
the decade-long war against communism waged by the
mujaheddin in fighters turned Afghanistan into a boot
camp for terrorists. Many of the Islamic radicals who
went to do battle against the Soviets wound up experts in
bomb-making and other terrorist tactics. These
troublemakers are now training other Islamic recruits in
terrorist camps throughout Sudan.

Do not be misled into thinking that the absence of
sophisticated training places these students of terror at
a disadvantage. Rather, their religious zeal makes them
more dangerous than the secular, often Marxist-inspired,
Middle Eastern terrorists of the past. Harder to combat
as well. Why? Because they are able to carry out their
terror with more readily available and less-sophisticated
devices. They need not wait for the delivery of high-tech
explosives. They need only consult a number of anarchist
"cookbooks" for the proper ingredients which are in
supply in a wide variety of hardware stores. Look for a
mixture of nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil rather than
plastic explosives such as Semtex or C-4.

Less sophisticated also means less organized than their
secular predecessors, and consequently more difficult to
spot, track, and intercept. In the past, universities
were not only centers for recruiting terrorists but
places that provided sanctuary for networks of terrorists
to organize and spout their terrorist rhetoric. It is
much harder for today's law enforcement agencies to
infiltrate groups that are not organized in any
systematic way.
The new terrorists are easily inspired by religious
beliefs and the suggestions of their spiritual leaders.
The alleged involvement of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar
Abdel Rahman, in the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt and the World Trade Center explosion
illustrates the power that a spiritual leader can have on
the actions of these new terrorists. Sheik Rahman's
blindness contributes to his credibility since blind
reciters of the Koran are respected in Islamic societies
for their heightened sensitivity for memorization. It is
often the case that the loss of one sense is compensated
by an increase in another.

Inspiration can also lead to freelance terrorism that
occurs with regularity throughout the Middle East,
especially in Israel. We often read of how a Palestinian
with no history of terrorist activity or group
affiliation randomly stabs or axes an Israeli on the
streets of Tel Aviv. These freelance terrorists are
devoutly religious, highly impressionable, and given to
suggestion. Their acts are almost impossible to
predict--except that they are bound to occur given the
call to fanaticism that echoes through the impoverished
societies of the Middle East.

These new terrorists travel freely throughout the entire
Muslim world. They walk the streets of Pakistan and
congregate in the suburbs of Cairo. The World Trade
Center bombing and the aborted plot to bomb a number of
other landmarks in New York should tell us that they are
here with their well-documented penchant for taking
matters into their own hands. We can count on them to
take action--and we should understand that they will.

What to do?

The new world order has already impacted on our local
law-enforcement agency's ability to protect and serve.
Future occurrences in international politics will do the
same. Today's local law enforcement agencies must
constantly monitor a changing world for potential
terrorism and its likely impact on domestic security.
Today's militant Islamic fundamentalists cannot be
ignored; in fact, it would be wise for all of us to
become familiar with the aspirations of the more than one
billion Muslims worldwide. We have already witnessed a
veritable explosion in the number of individuals
subscribing to the Islamic faith right here in America.

The overwhelming majority of Muslims abhor terrorism.
Nevertheless, we must not be afraid to ask questions of
those who do not. But to make certain that the right
questions are asked, it makes sense to give our law
enforcement personnel cultural diversity training. That
way, there will be fewer problems stemming from any lack
of understanding. After all, there is no way to get
around the fact that millions of Muslims live in the
United States or have regular contacts here either
through family or business. Mutual understanding is the
first step toward countering terrorism.

Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils South
Africa's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part I

When Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa much
of the world breathed a sigh of relief. Here was a man
who promised a new future to a country long plagued by
racial strife and increasing instability. But there is
also a dark side to the bright future, for beneath South
Africa's youthful democratic face lurks a potentially
deadly disease: the specter of organized crime.

Of course, this is a scourge that afflicts much of the
world today. International crime organizations operate
relatively freely around the globe, reaping huge profits
from the proceeds of their illegal activities and taking
advantage of new technology to insert themselves covertly
into the machinery of national economies. The World Bank
reports that some of these "crime empires" are now worth
far more than the gross domestic products of all the
Middle Eastern and North African countries combined. The
opportunities being presented to international crime
organizations for worldwide illegal operations are
greater today than they have been since the end of World
War II. Over the past five years, international gangs
have greatly benefitted from the changes brought about by
the breakup of the Soviet Union, the introduction of
computerized international banking and finance, and the
general trend toward free trade.
In South Africa this trend is particularly apparent.
Hiding behind burgeoning local crime, South African
syndicates are growing larger all the time, a new
manifestation of the problems which have affected the
United States and the rest of the world in the post-Cold
War period.

Like South Africa, the United States has traditionally
felt that its oceans, great distances, and national
borders provide separation and safety from international
crime. However, the globalization of communications,
transportation, trade, and finance has globalized crime.
The same conditions and mechanisms that support the
expansion of free markets are just as well suited to
bolster the so-called "Four Horsemen of International
Crime"--four key criminal activities that have the
capability to wreak havoc with democratic countries.
These four corrosive factors are: organized crime, drugs,
illicit financial activity, and transportation crime.

In South Africa, the recent movement to political
pluralism, the development of a market economy, and the
end of Soviet and Cuban military intervention in
neighboring countries have provided a new source of hope
for the Southern African region, but it has also enticed
the world's criminal organizations to take advantage of
the opportunities that the new situations provide. From a
US perspective, South Africa's dramatic change and
progress over the past several years must not be given up
to the international gangs that are currently flocking to
southern Africa.

According to South African Police Services (SAPS)
sources, approximately 500 well-armed and financed
organized crime syndicates are now operating in South
Africa. These powerful gangs--some domestic, some from
neighboring African countries, and some from the well
known and powerful international criminal
organizations--are capable of buying and burrowing their
way into public institutions and terrorizing the public
and the South African business community.

The majority of South African gangs are involved in drug
trafficking (136), followed by vehicle theft (112), and
commercial crime (85). Police say that the activities of
the various gangs are closely linked. For example motor
vehicle theft, truck hijacking and robbery are linked to
the illegal arms trade in Mozambique, while drug
trafficking is connected with motor vehicle theft in
Zambia as well as to money laundering and check kiting
schemes.

The US government has important interests in South Africa
that will be adversely affected by the unchecked growth
of these international crime syndicates. American
interests are essentially based on promoting a
democratic, secure, and prosperous South Africa. South
Africa's success in dealing with the various syndicates
will depend partly on reinforcement by the United States
in countering the insidious actions of international
crime organizations--drug smuggling, money laundering,
and their illegal theft and trade activities.

International Criminal Organizations

The world's traditional criminal gangs and mafias are
groups whose primary objective is to gain money and power
by carrying out illegal activities. Organized crime
groups that used to operate only nationally in their own
domestic arena are now forging new global ties and moving
beyond traditional drugs, arms smuggling, and
prostitution into new areas such as trade in nuclear
technology, transport of illegal aliens, and money
laundering.

International gangs are estimated to turn over some $750
billion a year from drug smuggling and other illegal
activities. Organized crime and the financial frauds they
perpetrate are currently considered to be the most
pervasive and sophisticated threats that businesses must
face. A recent survey of top British executives showed
that 55 percent of respondents said they believe the risk
of syndicate fraud will increase in 1995, compared with
only 29 percent who predicted political instability will
increase.
What caused this? Largely the decline of border controls
in Europe and the removal of the severe travel
restrictions that once divided Europe between east and
west. Easy access has created opportunities for the
world's major organized crime syndicates in Italy,
Russia, and Asia to work with their colleagues in South
America and the United States to expand into new markets
and to evolve into truly international crime
corporations.
Russia. The breakdown of the old Soviet police system and
the lack of centralized control in the new Russia has
allowed over 5,000 criminal syndicates to flourish, often
combining their efforts with those of the international
mafia. Russian gangs are complex organizations with
international criminal connections around the world. The
danger posed by Russian gangsters has already reached the
United States. Russians are now frequently apprehended
and put on trial alongside their criminal
associates--members of the US and Italian mafia who,
among other crimes, import large amounts of heroin into
the United States.

FBI Director Louis Freeh agrees that Russian criminal
gangs are "becoming a formidable threat." The FBI has
identified some 220 Russian gangs now operating in 17 US
cities in 14 states. Russian gangs are also established
in 29 foreign countries and maintain contacts with an
estimated 100,000 criminal enterprises around the world.
These range from sophisticated technology smuggling to
illegal immigrant smuggling rings to child prostitution
rings in China and Southeast Asia. Banks with branches in
Cyprus are reported to be handling about $1 billion a
month in laundered Russian funds, according to the
Russian Central Bank.

Actually, the FBI considers that the arrival of Russian
gangs is directly related to much of the drug-related
violence in urban America. Most Russian gangs initiate
operations in the United States by entering the country
on normal business visas and then stay on illegally when
their visas expire. The number of Russians entering the
United States has risen dramatically. In 1988 only 8,000
Soviet citizens entered, but in 1994 the number rose to
140,000.

The FBI is concerned about these large numbers of
Russians entering the country because ongoing criminal
cases show that there is a lot of involvement in
organized crime, especially in working with the Italian
Mafia to import narcotics. Last year, FBI Director Freeh
and Russia's top law enforcement officials agreed on a
cooperative program to combat organized crime, swapping
information, training and law enforcement personnel--in
Freeh's words "a police-to-police bridge."
Art collectors, police, and insurers are also
increasingly blaming organized crime--especially the
Russians and Eastern European gangs--for the rapid growth
in fine art theft in Europe. Worldwide, some $3 billion
worth of art and valuable objects are currently missing,
and much of the cause can be placed on organized crime.
Frequently, US sting operations against organized crime
gangs recover stolen art among shipments of drugs,
contraband, and stolen art.

Chinese Triads. China's triads have developed a thriving
export business that includes trade in people. Chinese
gangs may make up to $3.5 billion annually from exporting
their compatriots searching for a better life at $35,000
per head. Chinese Triads have developed a complex
international network to smuggle their refugees into the
United States and Europe with major transit points in
Russia and Latin America. The Triads have set up
operations in South Africa, and its only a matter of time
until they expand their other activities there, including
an interest in South Africa's emerging casino industry.
The New Jersey state Casino Control Commission is
currently investigating the activities of members of
Asian organized crime syndicates and reports that there
is a distinct possibility that the Asian mobsters have
infiltrated the industry. In typical understatement,
police officials have said that Chinese Triad interests
in South Africa have "become more apparent."

Taiwan. Not all illegal activity takes place in mainland
China and Hong Kong. Some opposition leaders in Taiwan
say that while their organized crime problems are hardly
new, crime families have gained influence with the
blossoming of Taiwan's democracy. The Ministry of Justice
reported in late 1994 that one-third of Taiwan's 858
elected city and county councilors have criminal records.

Japanese Yakuza. The Yakuza, Japan's principal organized
crime syndicate, has shown a remarkable ability to
respond to changing circumstances. After World War II it
did what criminals do best--straight violence. In the
late 1950s, the Yakuza turned to debt collection, and in
its next phase, the Yakuza zeroed in on the public
officials who regulated them. The high-growth 1980s
launched the gangs on a fourth phase of corporate
operations, this time focused on manipulating the stock
market, bank fraud, and real estate swindles. This
current Yakuza campaign against the business world is
on-going today, and the gangs are growing more and more
clever.
Although the Yakuza prefer to operate in a low-key
manner, it is capable of violence, as shown by the 1994
murder of Kazufumi Hatanaka, head of the Nagoya branch of
Sumitomo Bank. The Sumitomo Bank had been accused of
cutting ethical corners, and there have been a number of
complex and questionable financing transactions between
Sumitomo and underworld organizations. The Japanese
government has been clamping down on the Yakuza through
the enforcement of the Organized Crime Law of 1992, but
the gangs have shown that they are extremely difficult to
put out of business.
Fraud and Money Laundering

Employee-related fraud in South Africa is on a par with
the worst countries in the world, according to risk
insurers with Lloyd's of London, and it is seen by
international observers as being as bad as in South
American countries, such as Colombia. The frequency and
size of fraud claims in South Africa has more than
doubled in the past three years. Some players in the
local financial markets will no longer provide fidelity
guarantee cover--insurance against employee fraud--for
financial institutions. The increase in fraud claims are
blamed on higher stock values, the growing sophistication
of criminal gangs, increased computerization, and
political uncertainty. In August 1995 there was a total
of $6 billion in fraud cases under investigation by SAPS,
and some risk managers say that this is just the tip of
the iceberg.

It is the sheer volume of money that ties together the
various forms of international crime and links them all
with legal business. The US Treasury Department estimates
there is an enormous, several trillion-dollar pool of
money that dashes around in what is effectively
international cyberspace, moving by computer in and out
of offshore banks and chasing profits in 24-hour markets,
all largely beyond the reach of government control. Of
this total amount, it is estimated that there is between
$100 billion and $300 billion of dirty money circling the
globe at any one time, looking for a home, looking to
merge into the legal economy, looking for deals that may
be legal, and some that are not legal.
South Africa's banking and financial system has a
reputation as one of the world's solid professional
operations--the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the
world's tenth largest. Yet the emergence of the new South
Africa and the transition from the previous government's
system of controls and operations has presented some
problems. As South African banks rejoined the
international business community, they arrived at a time
when illegal money laundering was at an all time high,
and crime syndicate money managers were on the lookout
for any easy opportunity to launder their cash.
Because there was no obligation for South African
financial institutions to report any suspicion of money
laundering, the banking community learned that it was a
prime target for the international crime organization's
financial networks. Banks quickly realized that this was
not a time for business as usual, and they had to react
swiftly to ensure the integrity and ethics of their
operations.

Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils South
Africa's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part II

Globalized money laundering is a profound challenge to
national sovereignty. Offshore banks and other means of
laundering allow businesses to evade taxes and national
regulations and provide the money to lubricate the
bribery and corruption that makes their activities
possible. This is a security threat that neither of the
traditional security responses--the legal system and
police operations--can really meet. Getting the money
laundering problem under control will require cross
border cooperation and an unprecedented degree of
cooperation between the government and the private
sector.
The US dollar is presently the currency of choice for an
increasingly powerful collection of drug lords and their
rogue financial advisors bent on manipulating the global
financial order. The financial managers for the top drug
cartels, especially the highly skilled money launderers
for the Colombian, Brazilian, and Mexican cartels, are
transferring huge quantities of funds each day around the
international banking system.
In the wake of tough US banking regulations, most drug
money laundering operations now generally involves one of
four methods: first by smuggling profits directly out of
the country by stashing them in industrial shipments or
appliances bound for Latin America where the Cali cartel
or their agent can get easy access to the cash. Second,
breaking down large amounts of cash into smaller
increments that need not be reported to federal
regulators. Third, many laundering operations set up
elaborate commercial fronts, washing the money through
complex layers of seemingly innocent transactions.
Finally, some laundering operations are unbelievably
unsophisticated as they take hundreds of thousands of
dollars to a friendly employee at the bank, fill out
deposit slips and deposit the cash. Recently a Citibank
assistant manager in New York was caught cooperating with
a worldwide group that has laundered hundreds of millions
in drug money back to Colombia.

The US government has been focusing on new technologies
and software programs that can track the flow of money in
and out of a country. For example, in the United States,
companies and banks must report cash transactions of
$10,000 or more. This information is used by the Treasury
Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FINCEN), a financial tracking organization that plays an
important role in combating money laundering crimes, as a
database to track transactions. Such anti-money
laundering operations are reported to have driven the
cost of laundering US drug proceeds from six percent in
the late 1980s to 26 percent of today's gross profits.
This has been borne out by some recent interviews with
captured drug kingpins who said that it was costing them
$260,000 to move each $1 million out of the United
States.
However, because the Treasury Department concluded that
some of the record-keeping and reporting rules in place
to stop money laundering were bureaucratic and
ineffective, and sharp cuts have been made in the
information that banks must keep on large ($10,000 and
above) cash transactions. This is not giving the
launderers a free ride, because at the same time they
removed much of the bureaucratic red tape, the Treasury
Department tightened the rules on the real problem
areas--those governing electronic money transfers among
currency exchanges, casinos, brokerage firms, and banks
to require the keeping of records about the sources and
recipients of the transfers.
Banks in other areas of the world are also improving
their oversight operations. For example, controls and
staff training has recently been introduced by the Hong
Kong Association of Banks to help its members combat
money laundering. Hong Kong is a prime target for hiding
sources of illicit funds because of its location, trading
policies and sophisticated markets.

Credit card fraud is also a serious organized crime
related problem in the United States--and it may also
become so in South Africa as that country takes on more
of the technological trappings of the Western world.
Credit card fraud losses for major card players in the
United States has increased to about $1 billion a year,
much of which is attributed to Nigerian gangs. As a
result, the credit card industry has taken drastic
measures to curb fraud and to wage war against organized
crime, which uses card fraud to finance illegal
activities. Countermeasures include use of
fraud-detection software to enable issuers to determine
if someone is making unauthorized transactions,
incorporating a unique secret code in the card's magnetic
stripe to detect altered data at the time of
authorization, new chip cards, and education on proper
card acceptance procedures.

The Drug Trade

The global drug trade's illegal income makes up the major
portion of the $750 billion taken in by the major
international crime organizations each year. Indications
are that South Africa, and in particular Johannesburg, is
rapidly becoming the southern anchor of an African drug
triangle involving Nigeria in the northwest and Sudan in
the northeast. South African customs officials are
concerned that Johannesburg International Airport (JAI)
is becoming a major distribution point for cocaine moving
to the European market.
The chief of the narcotics bureau at JAI, Colonel
Stefanus Smit, says that "the quantity of cocaine coming
through has increased at an incredible rate." Smit has
only a 13-man staff to monitor the 3,000 international
travelers per day at the airport. Police sources claim
that South American cartels are now using South African
drug couriers out of Johannesburg because they draw less
suspicion as they travel to Europe and the United States.
The South African couriers are flown to a Latin American
city, such as Rio de Janeiro, supplied with drugs, and
then flown to Nigeria or another West African country.
After a few days they travel into South Africa, taking
advantage of soft security at border crossing points.

The drug cartels operating in South Africa, like their
American counterparts, must be able to launder these
funds skillfully to pay their underlings, to run their
massive and intricate transportation systems, and to
distribute the extensive numbers of bribes required to
keep their system going.

Transportation Crime

Around the world, trade is growing twice as fast--and
foreign direct investment four times as fast--as national
economies. South Africa's transportation system is
presently in this high growth situation with increased
road traffic, increased rail shipments, and increased
maritime shipments. For example, the port of Capetown
forecasts an increase of over 50 percent in international
container shipments next year. International trade and
exports are a major factor in South Africa's economic
future. This intense competition for the growing volume
of money, goods, and services moving across borders and
through ports can place South African officials under
tremendous pressure to make sure they move the goods and
commerce swiftly, hence encouraging the relaxation of
bottlenecking regulations and controls internally and at
borders.
International crime syndicates love to work a busy
transportation system, where they can operate "in the
seams" with little chance of apprehension. We have
learned a lot about this in the United States where
international thieves have found cargo theft so
profitable and the likelihood of arrest so slight that
some gangs have switched from drug smuggling to cargo
crime. The United States has worked hard to combat cargo
theft, yet the total dollar loss from all modes of
transportation approaches $10 billion annually. If this
is the case in the United States, South Africa must take
care that its cargo operations do not become a sitting
duck for international cargo crime syndicates.
However, it appears that international crime syndicates
have already begun to focus on South Africa. Law
enforcement officials credit the increase in organized
crime in South Africa to the stricter laws and control
measures now in place at points of entry in Europe and
America, renewed international trade interest, South
Africa's strategic location astride the major Far
East-Middle East and Atlantic shipping routes, its first
world infrastructure, and its re-entry into the
international arena.
In the United States, some of the conditions that allow
international transportation crime to flourish have been
created by conscious choice. For example, at one of the
busiest Mexican border crossings, customs officials are
told to spend no more than one minute examining each
northbound tractor-trailer in order to prevent huge
12-hour traffic jams. This and other programs to speed
the cross border traffic, has been a bonanza for drug
smugglers.  Another problem is within the ranks of
transportation workers themselves. In the United States,
many instances of cargo theft involve insider cooperation
or information. In one major airport that had high theft
rates, it was discovered that at least 70 percent of the
staff that worked on the tarmac had previous arrest
records. In other areas strong unions in port areas with
high theft rates refuse to allow increased exit searches
and controls.

And while the volume of air freight is exploding, new
rules make the government liable for damage caused to
perishable goods--flowers, food, animals--by inspection
delays. So what could be more natural than to use these
same shipments, especially those moving through the
busiest airports, to smuggle drugs and other contraband?
The largest volume of air cargo in the United States
passes through busy Miami Airport. It is the gateway to
Latin America, and perishable air freight cargoes such as
flowers (82 percent of the flowers imported into the
United States originate in Colombia) pass through Miami
airport. Airport officials have had to deal with the
challenge of smuggling drug shipments in the flowers and
other cargos. Additionally, Miami is the largest port of
entry for the French perfume industry. Last year, theft
of expensive shipments of fragrances by organized crime
got so bad that an FBI Task Force had to be formed.
The US Department of Justice reported that Colombian
nationals, together with Peruvians, Ecuadoreans, and
Chileans, have formed large-scale cargo theft gangs.
Particularly with the Ecuadoreans, multi-million dollar
tractor trailer thefts of cargo were occurring at
numerous terminals all along the East Coast. When
apprehended and questioned, the thieves were found to be
members of drug cartels which switched from the illegal
drug business because they found stealing cargo safer and
easier than smuggling drugs.

Vehicle Hijacking and Theft

Because of the vacuum caused by police reorganization,
international organized crime has quickly moved into
South Africa's extensive vehicle theft operations.
According to Police Commissioner George Fivas, in 1994
over 80,000 vehicle were stolen, including a huge number
of commercial trucks and cargos. There have been 36
hijacking-related murders of drivers in the first half of
1995. The crime syndicates are currently managing to stay
one step ahead of the outgunned and undermanned police,
and are increasingly using the cross-border theft of
vehicles and cargo to finance drug shipments in a network
of criminal activity involving Lesotho, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Police have recently recovered
stolen South African vehicles as far away as Australia,
Portugal, Greece, and Cyprus.

There is some hope for the grim picture of rampant
transportation crime thanks to the determined efforts of
The Transportation Crime Sub-committee of South Africa's
National Crime Combatting Council, which was founded in
1994 to establish a partnership between the South African
police and all elements of the transportation business
sectors for the fight against transportation crime. The
American experience has shown that public and private
groups like this must have dedicated government support
if they are to be successful.

Solutions

Around the world, organized crime is rapidly expanding to
take advantage of post-Cold War opportunities.
International crime syndicates are adding to their
traditional illicit activities by using their vast
financial resources and sophisticated command of
technology to move huge amounts of ill-gotten, but
effectively laundered money around the world in seconds,
to steal sensitive proprietary information for unlawful
purposes, and to infiltrate legitimate businesses. It
appears that this trend will increase unless strong
cooperative international measures are taken.

South African police forces are currently out-gunned and
out-manned. A key factor why organized crime is
flourishing in South Africa may be because police forces
are too poorly paid and equipped to fight the
international criminal gangs taking up residence there or
to resist the corruption of overpowering financial
temptations and bribes. SAPS sources admit that they lack
the structure, resources, finances, and technical
resources to cope with large-scale organized crime. Some
organized crime groups already have state-of-the-art
equipment and communications systems, most of which puts
South African law enforcement technologies to shame.

The international criminal organizations are evolving
into a new breed of cyberspace crook.     Trends in South
Africa indicate that the top participants in future
criminal organizations will be educated, highly
sophisticated, computer-literate individuals who can
wield state-of-the-art information technology to the best
advantage, for themselves and their criminal
organizations. To be effective, law enforcement
organizations must recruit and train the same caliber of
individuals.
International economic and law enforcement organizations
are only now beginning to deal with the problem. Within
the last year a spate of international conferences on the
drug trade, bribery and official corruption have begun to
at least talk about the issues. The European Union is
setting up a Europe-wide police intelligence agency, and
the FBI has made international cooperation one of its
highest priorities. The next meeting of the Group of
Seven top industrial nations is scheduled to produce the
outline of a new economic architecture that can
collectively deal with terrorism, organized crime and
drug trafficking.

Affected countries like South Africa have begun top level
public-private efforts to combat international crime. In
South Africa, the Council of South African Bankers and
Business South Africa hosted "A Business Initiative
Against Corruption and Crime" in August 1995 that was
attended by President Nelson Mandela and most of the
top-ranking government, security, and business
executives. The conference has an ambitious action plan
which will provide a South African road map for guiding
the struggle against criminal elements.

The continuing fight against international crime
organizations will involve increased international
cooperation and new regulations to improve law
enforcement operations. Finally, countries must work
together to tighten their laws to prevent criminal
organizations from benefiting from international
loopholes. New laws should be introduced where necessary
to strengthen the hand of local law enforcers and ease
international coordination of operations against
international syndicates. States also should exchange
information and experience to increase the level of
international cooperation. South Africa is a prime
example of what can happen in other emerging democratic
countries with expanding economies.

Libya and the Pan Am 103 Bombing: The Department of
Justice Sends a Message  by Douglas Kash

On May 18, an American consultant for the nation of Libya
was arrested outside of a Washington, DC, hotel for
violating US sanctions against Libya. William Bodine was
charged for arranging meetings with executive branch
officials to help foster the normalization of relations
with the United States.

Libya refuses to release Abdel Basser Ali Al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhalmah, both suspected of planting the
explosives aboard Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988.
Economic and diplomatic sanctions against Libya,
initially imposed in 1986, were broadened after the
bombing, including a provision prohibiting normalization
of relations until the suspects are extradited to Great
Britain or the United States for prosecution. According
to a supporting affidavit by a US Customs Service agent,
Bodine met on June 16, 1992, with an unnamed employee of
the Bush administration's National Security Council to
discuss the sanctions. The affidavit specifies that
others were contacted, including National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former adviser Robert
McFarlane.

Bodine also allegedly arranged a meeting between Libyan
Treasury Minister Mohammed El Bukhari and a "Texas
businessman" who sources identify as real estate
executive Trammel Crow. Bukhari had hoped that, in
addition to a Dallas land deal, the Crow family influence
might lead the way to Washington.

Authorities allege that Bodine set up a branch of the New
York-based Investment Advisory Group in the British
Virgin Islands and opened a Swiss bank account to receive
$8 million per year in separate $460,000 payments to
"consult" on behalf of Libya. A search of the Dallas
office of Bodine's son-in-law, Henry Billingsley,
allegedly uncovered a roll of undeveloped film of Bodine
at a site in Libya bombed by the United States in 1986.

In a related development, on October 17, Libya abandoned
its candidacy for the "North Africa" seat on the United
Nations Security Council, claiming that the UN had become
a tool of the United States. Arguing that it would have
been unconscionable for a state presently under UN
sanction to fill a vacancy, the United States, Britain,
and France campaigned against Libya and gathered enough
votes to prevent Libya from obtaining the two-thirds
majority of the General Assembly required to win
election.

Senate Provides More Relief for Victims of Terrorism by
Douglas Kash

On June 6, the Senate passed legislation aimed at
increasing federal powers to prevent and combat
terrorism. In a 91-8 vote Senate bill S. 735--known as
the "Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995."
Title X of the bill, "Victims of terrorism Act of 1995,"
provides that the director of the FBI is entitled to make
grants to states in order to provide compensation and
assistance to residents of those states who, while
outside the territorial boundaries of the United States,
are victims of terrorism or mass violence, but are not
otherwise eligible for compensation under the Omnibus
Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (See,
"Where to turn? Compensating the Victims of Terrorism,"
Counterterrorism & Security, Spring 1995). They also
provided the same compensation and assistance package for
victims of domestic terrorism. The FBI director may also
provide funds to the US Attorney's office for use in
coordination with state victims compensation and
assistance efforts in providing emergency relief.
Even more recently the Senate Judiciary Committee and its
counterpart in the House offered their respective changes
to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976 to
enable victims of terrorism to sue the governments
responsible. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
generally prohibits lawsuits against a foreign country by
US citizens unless the injury is directly related to the
foreign government's business in the United States.

Distinct from the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995, the
Senate amendment to the FSIA limits the Act to countries
listed by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism
such as Libya, Iraq, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.
The House version would permit a suit against any country
whose legal system does not offer foreigners an adequate
legal remedy, such as Saudi Arabia. Under this remedy,
victims of terrorism could win damages in US courts if
they are unable to gain compensation in the courts of the
country involved.

Sri Lanka: Terrorism in Perspective by Tom Marks

A fine line separates terrorism from forms of violence
based upon mass mobilization. The problem for security
forces is that, early on, armed challenges to government
control appear more or less the same. Hence systemic
response to "terror," normally based upon force, more
often than not is inappropriate. Most commonly, abuse of
the populace creates a new dynamic which allows an
operationally astute terrorist organization to mobilize
additional support.

It is this process which makes the ongoing struggle in
Sri Lanka of more than passing interest. Prior to the
July 1983 explosion of communal violence which serves as
the starting point for the conflict's intense phase, best
evidence indicates that the number of Tamils actually
engaged in violence amounted to no more than 50-60
hardcore individuals who traveled freely between India
and Sri Lanka. These activists were assisted by a network
of informers throughout the north. Violence was limited
to the Jaffna area, the main base of Tamil resistance
situated on the island's northern tip.
July 1983's wholesale assault upon the Tamil populace by
enraged Sinhalese mobs, combined with the inability or
unwillingness of the security forces to protect them,
proved the turning point. What might have remained a
terrorist threat exploded into insurgency. In the months
that followed, the resistance movement underwent a
dramatic expansion in strength and areas of operation. By
mid-1984 total numbers of separatists were estimated at
2,500-5,000 personnel, with probably at least half armed
and equipped. Today, insurgent strength may go as high as
15,000, with a divided, amateurish resistance having been
replaced by the well-trained, disciplined, and armed
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), or "Tigers."

How much different would the situation have been had a
force and an approach been at hand to deal correctly with
the situation!

 Background to the Conflict

Ironically, as a democracy, Sri Lanka would have seemed
theoretically positioned to address popular grievances
adequately. But following independence from Britain in
1948, the new nation's highly centralized, unitary state
ensured domination of the polity by the nearly
four-fifths majority of Buddhist, Sinhala-speaking
Sinhalese (roughly a fifth of the population were
Tamil-speaking Hindus).

Several groups sprang up to press for redress of Tamil
grievances. In the center was the Tamil United Front
(TUF), formed in 1972 and calling autonomy. On the left
side of the political spectrum the Tamil Students
Federation (TSF) advocated more radical solutions, such
as independence. The most radical group came to be known
as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an armed
separatist group committed to insurgency.
In 1978 fighting erupted between the LTTE and the army,
causing the government to declare the group illegal on 19
May 1978. The government was also empowered to proscribe
any organization which advocated the use of violence and
which was directly or indirectly connected with any
unlawful activity.

But the military lacked a counterterror capability.
Indeed, its total ground strength was effectively
contained in five infantry battalions. The capability for
intelligence-gathering and surgical application of force,
in other words, was all but lacking at this time in Sri
Lanka. The advantage lay with the terrorists.

Violence escalated, and by the early 1980s terror
incidents by the Tamils unleashed spasms of communal
conflict -- one ambush in Jaffna, in which 13 soldiers
died, prompted widespread rioting and looting directed
against Tamils. At least 400 persons were killed and
100,000 left homeless; another 60,000 fled to India.
Police stood by, and in many cases members of the armed
forces participated in the reprisals.
The violence served to traumatize the Tamil community and
provided the Tigers with an influx of new manpower. Thus
the ascendancy of radical leadership in the struggle for
Tamil Eelam was complete. Both the militants and the
authorities recognized that, for the moment, the conflict
would take the form of a military test of strength. The
government reacted by improving coordination and
strategic direction through the formation in March 1984
of a Ministry of National Security, headed by Lalith
Athulathmudalai, in effect a command center for the
conduct of a counterinsurgency campaign. Expansion of
numbers and equipment for all of the security forces was
undertaken, as were steps to tighten discipline and to
halt abuses of the population.

The small size of the Sri Lankan security forces made
such steps imperative. Though Athulathmudalai clearly
intended to conduct a counterinsurgency in the British
mode, with military measures deriving direction from the
overall thrust of a political solution, the very size of
the emerging separatist armed threat made forceful
military measures inevitable. But without substantive
movement towards the framing of particulars in a
political option, there was a danger that military
suppression would become an end unto itself.

This is precisely what occurred. Even a police Special
Task Force (STF), formed in 1984 specifically for a
careful, nuanced approach to "counterinsurgency," quickly
became but another aggressive unit in a general
deployment to combat. Escalation of hostilities led to
conflict nationwide, eventual Indian intervention in July
1987, and the complete domination of the "liberation
struggle" by the LTTE, which proclaimed itself
Mrxist-Leninist.
Only with the election of a coalition headed by the Sri
Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in August 1994, followed by
the November presidential victory of SLFP leader
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga -- these polls ending
17 years of United National Party (UNP) power -- was
politics allowed to drive the military response to the
problem. A three-month cease-fire, during which Colombo
sought to frame a solution acceptable to all parties,
ended when the LTTE launched attacks on government
forces. These included use of underwater assets to
destroy navy ships, as well as introduction of SA-7
surface-to-air missiles into the conflict. The latter
were used to down several air force transports, later at
least one helicopter. Armor was already in use by both
sides. What had begun as a campaign by terrorists had
grown to conventional civil war.
Security Force Options

In mid-1995, therefore, the government held a series of
meetings designed to settle upon a national strategy for
ending the conflict. Incredibly, no such step had
hitherto been taken. These meetings, of which there were
at least three primary sessions, did not go well. The
government itself, as the meetings progressed,
articulated a plan for devolution which came close, in
all but name, to abandoning the unitary state in favor of
a federal system. Yet while all official bodies basically
agreed that the Tigers would have to be defeated
militarily in order for the political solution to be
implemented, there was disagreement on the plan of
operations.

On one side were those who saw no option but to end the
LTTE hold on Jaffna by direct assault. The principal
advocate of this approach was Anuruddha Ratwatte, a
presidential relative and, effectively, Minister of
Defense (he was actually the Deputy Minister, but the
President herself was the Minister, so Ratwatte ran the
security forces). He was joined by a body of military
officers who felt the effort had to be made. Opposed was
an equally distinguished and senior body of officers,
both active and retired, who demurred. They cited the
considerable success which had been achieved by the
systematic domination of areas using force to shield
restoration of government control. This approach, they
argued, while much slower, would be ever less costly in
lives and financial resources.

The former category was obvious, since any assault on
Jaffna would involve the taking of hardened,
well-defended positions. The latter point was equally
important, though, because by 1995 interest payments to
service government debt were of themselves 29.9 percent
of current expenditures, with a figure of close to 48
percent reached if amortization and interest payments
were included under debt service. High intensity
operations, regardless of purely military considerations,
were bound to worsen this financial situation.

So bitter became the debate that at least one key
commander, Brigadier Janaka Perera of the Reserve Strike
Force (RSF), was summarily relieved in consequence of the
tone and substance of his objections. He opted to accept
a brigade command in the extreme northeast rather than
retire. In all of this, the army commander, Lieutenant
General Gerry de Silva -- like Perera, a Sandhurst
graduate -- found himself very much in the middle. His
important contribution after assuming command on 1
January 1994 had been to rationalize the command and
control structure of a force grown to 76 infantry
battalions alone (drawn from three sources -- active,
reserves, and national guard). With his own staff divided
on the merits of a Jaffna assault, he was torn between
demands from above that he lead the charge and from below
that he back another course of action.
Perera's arguments were illustrative of the proposed
alternatives. He advocated continuing systematic
domination of areas while taking the battle directly to
the insurgents using special operations. These were the
tactics he had used successfully in the south during the
resurgence of a Sinhalese communist group, Janatha
Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, "People's Liberation Front"). A
previous effort by the JVP to seize power in 1971 had
been bloodily suppressed, but the group had gained new
life in the wake of India's July 1987 military
intervention in Sri Lanka as a "peacekeeping force."
Portraying itself as the representative of Sri Lankan
nationalism, the JVP convulsed the Sinhalese areas of the
country before being destroyed. Perera played a crucial
role in breaking the JVP by capturing a number of its key
personalities, to include its head, Rohana Wijeweera.

As his weapon, Perera made use of a special forces
brigade which grouped together units of the commandos and
special forces. These, like most of Sri Lanka's military
forces, had developed in step with the Tamil insurgency.

While the threat was still terrorism -- with attacks
including strikes against Colombo's commercial air links
-- a small commando force had been formed. It had but two
squadrons, one devoted to rapid response missions,
principally anti-hijacking, the other to VIP security. As
actual hostilities progressed, the commandos found
themselves active in counterguerrilla operations as well.

The shortage of such personnel led to the formation of a
separate Special Forces Regiment, primarily for jungle
operations. Leaving permutations aside, the end result
was that both the commandos and the special forces
eventually evolved into forces of two battalions each
(these with approximately 450 men rather than the
standard infantry 600 strength), brought together in a
special forces brigade.
During his four-year tenure as special forces brigade
commander, Perera expanded its operations into a variety
of unconventional areas, including airmobile assault and
undercover work. There was even one squadron which used
motorcycles during its operations.

When Gerry de Silva formed a reserve strike force in July
1994 as an integral part of his refining of the command
structure, Perera was picked to lead it. Under him were
not only the four battalions which had been in the
special forces brigade but also six infantry battalions,
mechanized and airmobile, and three armor battalions. As
such it was an elite strike force which could respond in
virtually any fashion to a threat anywhere in the theater
of operations. It was also the force Perera lost when his
blunt assessment of the planned Jaffna operation cost him
his job.

Exile, in any event, proved brief. When the actual
assault on Jaffna was launched in October of this year,
Perera was recalled to command the cutting edge of the
attack. Certainly his concerns, as well as those of
others who shared his opinion, had not changed, but all
were unwilling to sit on the sidelines as the security
forces locked horns in fierce battle with the LTTE.

The Future

Jaffna fell to government forces in early December,
bringing the conventional phase of combat to a close. But
the war is certainly not over. Problems remain --
problems that should have been addressed in the earliest
stages. From a lesson-learned perspective, the fighting
clearly illustrates how a terrorist threat of minor
proportions progressed to a multi-divisional assault upon
a heavily fortified built-up area, using all the arsenal
of conventional combat -- air power, artillery, and
armor, among others. The Tigers even have reportedly
employed homemade chemical weapons.

The ferocity that the struggle has gained over the years
cannot be understated. Many of the principal
personalities involved, to include both the presidents of
Sri Lanka and India, have fallen in the process.

Neither should the complexity of the task as it has
developed be underestimated. A Third World state has in a
dozen years been forced to create, support, and deploy a
force with nearly twice the infantry battalions available
to the likes to the United Kingdom. It has done so at
heavy human and financial cost. The rearming for the
present Jaffna offensive alone is estimated to have run
up a bill of some $500 million.
What is sobering, though, is that the security dynamic
has scarcely changed since battle was joined. The debate
within the Sri Lankan command concerning the attack on
Jaffna, for instance, was not on the necessity of taking
out that insurgent center but rather on the means and the
timing. Assessing its own political situation, as well as
that of its opponents, Colombo decided that it could not
adopt the long haul approach. It was well understood that
the attack would be costly and that insurgent elements
would certainly seek to relocate elsewhere in the country
to continue the fight.
Preparations were thus made to safeguard the gains made
in the east and "near north" (that area south of Jaffna),
those Tamil-populated areas which remain in contention,
as well as to secure the Sinhalese rear area itself.
These have been mostly successful, at least on the
surface, though Tiger attacks succeeded in destroying oil
stores in Colombo and in massacring a number of Sinhalese
villages.

Whether the cost of the Jaffna assault -- thousands of
casualties had already resulted at the time of this
writing -- proves commensurate with the results will
depend upon the government's follow-up. Among the many
ironies of the war is the fact that at no time has a
majority of Tamils lived in the so-called "Tamil
homelands." This has become even more the case as the
years have gone by.

The ceasefire and its subsequent violation by the Tigers
has served the useful purpose of exposing once again,
both domestically and internationally, the fact that
revolution as opposed to reform is the LTTE aim.
Consequently, not only has there been a decided shift in
international circles away from the sympathetic tilt of
many towards the Tigers, there has also been an upsurge
in numbers of Tamil civilians fleeing LTTE areas for
government lines.

In the key Vavuniya district, for instance, where
three-quarters of the area remains under LTTE control,
that precise proportion of the population lives on the
government side of the lines -- wherein there had been no
incidents during the year before the Jaffna attack. The
test will be whether the costly seizure of Jaffna serves
to facilitate further this domi- nation of the populace.

Certainly the struggle will continue. What is hoped in
Colombo is that the destruction of the insurgent head
will push the conflict back to the level at which it
should have remained had government response been more
appropriate and foreign intervention less disruptive
(India, now firmly on Colombo's side, was for much of the
conflict an ally of the insurgents; Tamil Nadu in
southern India continues to be used as a base and staging
area despite New Delhi's efforts).

Thus it can be dealt with using the techniques and forces
developed for special operations. Had these been
available from the start, combined with the greater
political and social sensitivity now evident in Colombo's
strategic approach, it is unlikely the story of the Tamil
insurgency would have grown to such gigantic proportions.

Louis: Chalice Press, 1995), 128 pp., $15.95.
The April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City was a pivotal event in
America's experience with terrorism. Although this was
not the first time that a vehicle bomb had been used
against a civilian target in the United States, it was
the first of such incidents to kill and injure hundreds
of people. For this and other reasons, April 19, 1995
will forever be remembered as a day of infamy.
A number of books have come out since the bombing to both
explain what happened and to pay tribute to those who
lost their lives on that day. Oklahoma Rescue, the first
book published on the bombing, was written by Oklahoma
City Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen. Hansen imparts a
moving personal account of the rescue effort, from the
moment that he heard the bomb blast to the recovery of
the final three bodes of the victims on May 29.

Two of the new books were compiled to remember those who
lost their lives and to commemorate the valiant efforts
of the rescue workers and volunteers. Requiem for the
Heartland is a photographic compilation that vividly
shows the devastation of the bombing and Oklahoma City's
efforts to carry on in the face of adversity. In their
Name, another pictorial work, is a collection of
first-hand accounts from the survivors of the bombing and
from the next of kin, the rescue workers and the citizens
of Oklahoma City who were trying to cope in the
aftermath. Both books contain powerful photos, many of
which will be familiar to those who followed the bombing
closely. Proceeds from these books will be donated to
charities involved in assisting the Oklahoma City bombing
victims. Both books are fitting tributes to those who
died and to those who selflessly gave of themselves to
help.

The final book on the bombing is very different from the
others. And the Angels Wept is a compilation of sermons
delivered at various religious institutions in Oklahoma
City in the aftermath of the bombing. It is a touching
tribute to those religious leaders who attempted to make
some sense out of this terrible tragedy. All of the
proceeds of this work will go to the Interfaith Disaster
Recovery of Greater Oklahoma City.

Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook, by John
Dermaut (International Network of Protection Specialists,
Global Security Complex, 1995), 200 pp., $19.95,
805-845-7011. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.

Sometimes, someone finds a new way to present
time-honored material in a different and more useful way.
That is the case with the new pocket-sized Protection
Specialist Survey and Checkbook, produced by the
International Network of Protection Specialists (INPS).
The INPS is a relatively new organization focusing on the
professional needs of those in the security fraternity
who are largely responsible for the personal protection
of others. John Dermaut, director of the INPS, has made a
significant contribution to the literature by packaging a
considerable amount of information into a compact format,
and by adding his own international perspective and
knowledge to the mix. The result is an extremely useful
guide and series of checklists that can be used
repeatedly when doing advance work and in providing
personal protection in any context.
The book is divided into two parts. The first deals with
buildings and transportation. It provides checklists and
reminders for dealing with residences, offices, hotels,
restaurants, hospitals, cars, planes, trains--and many
other aspects of personal protection in a wide range of
environments. The second part contains specific
information and checklists for doing advance work, route
surveys, and many other tasks. It also contains several
useful references for dealing with improvised explosive
devices and letter bombs, along with a conversion chart
for metric-English measurements, a listing of country and
area telephone codes, and some key dates for the
protection specialist to keep in mind (especially
important since many attacks are linked anniversaries of
events).
The Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook is an
extremely useful publication, and its compact, pocket
size makes it a reference that can easily be taken along
on any site survey or advance trip. Its many checklists
should ease the task of providing personal protection,
and its comprehensive coverage should ensure that nothing
is overlooked. This inexpensive book belongs in the
library of all protection specialists, although it won't
stay there gathering dust. Its sturdy cover may
eventually become dog-eared through use, but protection
specialists will certainly welcome its help.

The Seven Steps to Personal Safety, by Richard B. Isaacs
and Tim Powers  (New York: Varro Press, 1993), 170 pp.,
913-432-6399. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.

The past few years have seen a number of advisory books
intended to help people learn to protect themselves from
crime and other assorted evils of modern life. Most of
them concentrate either on avoiding dangerous situations
or on self-defense techniques to use when attacked. The
Seven Steps to Personal Safety is one of the few to
combine both aspects into a common-sense approach to
personal safety. The authors each have many years of
experience in law enforcement, criminal justice, and
self-defense training. Against this background they have
focused their presentation on awareness and avoidance,
while providing a continuum from awareness through
reaction and response to the aftermath of a violent
incident. In the jargon of the security manager, the
authors take a systems approach to personal defense and
safety, and the seven steps they propose flow from one to
the next.

The authors' seven steps to personal safety are: 1) being
aware of vulnerability, 2) mental commitment to doing
everything possible to remain safe, 3) being aware of the
environment and taking reasonable precautions, 4)
creating and maintaining distance to escape threatening
situations, 5) stopping an assault and escaping, 6)
immediate notification of the police, and 7) dealing with
post-incident stress. Each chapter focuses on one of
these steps, providing a wealth of useful information
that anyone can use.
Isaacs and Powers present a number of options that
individuals can choose from should they find themselves
exposed to danger. Recognizing that a major part of both
avoidance and response is mental, they repeatedly discuss
that aspect of personal safety--ranging from planning to
the decision about how to respond from an attack, and in
recovering from an attack's effects. They stress that
behavioral changes in attitudes toward life need not
result in paranoia, but in a feeling of being in control
and of feeling secure. The net result should be more
self-assurance and an increased ability to enjoy life.
The Seven Steps to Personal Safety also contains both
verbal and physical techniques that can be used in
various situations to either de-escalate tension or to
respond to an attack. These techniques are presented as
part of an overall programmatic approach to personal
safety. While not a replacement for a well-conceived
training program, this book provides an intelligent and
effective method of enhancing personal safety.

Plaxe.

An excellent collection of primary source documents from
a wide range of groups and individuals, Extremism in
America is an investigation into all facets of political
extremism. This work, written by a political science

scope and provides examples of extremism from both the
political right and left. Subjects covered include
communism, anti-communism, national socialism, white
supremacy, and black nationalism. It further categorizes
groups by special interests such as family, education,
gender, economics, taxes, alternative monetary systems,
and welfare. This book should be required reading for all
interested in the fringes of modern American political
thought.

Book Review: Religion and the Racist Right, by Michael
Barkun (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1994), 304 pp., $15.95, order line 800-848-6224. Reviewed
by Jack Plaxe.

This work by a political science professor at Syracuse
University provides a history of Christian Identity, a
movement that has provided the justification for and
fuels the hatred of many American far right racist and
anti-Semitic groups such as the Aryan Nations, the Order,
the Posse Comitatus, and elements of the Ku Klux Klan.
Christian Identity is a British theology of anti-Semitism
and racial holy war that has largely been adopted by
white supremacists in the United States. Barkun argues
that despite its small size and lack of public
prominence, Identity doctrine has become the single most
important religious position on the racist right.

Book Review: Comrade Criminal: Russia's New Mafia, by
Stephen Handelman (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University
Press, 1995), 383 pp., $27.50. Reviewed by Jack Plaxe.

Comrade Criminal is described as "the first comprehensive
investigation into the organized crime and corruption
that plague Russia today." The author, former Moscow
bureau chief of the Toronto Star, makes extensive use of
interviews to show how organized crime is hindering
Russia's transition to democracy. The breakup of the
Soviet Union has resulted in a virtual free-for-all for
bureaucrats and criminals. Smuggling and the black market
activity have become an integral part of the Russian
economy over the past 20 years. Along with this comes
criminal activity that manifests itself in gang-style
executions, kidnappings, and drugs and weapons
trafficking. Widespread corruption, bureaucratic red tape
and a high level of taxation make it difficult for
business to be conducted honestly. The current crime wave
is so vast and the Russian authorities so overwhelmed and
under funded that they are doomed to failure.

Book Review: Priority Mail, by Mark Winne (New York: Lisa
Drew, 1995), 317 pp., $23.00. Reviewed by Jack Plaxe.

This is the story of law enforcement efforts to identify
serial bomber Walter Leroy Moody, whose bombing campaign
targeted lawyers, officials of the NAACP, and judges on
the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Moody was
first convicted in 1972 of a mail bombing that targeted a
used car dealer who repossessed his car. After serving
time in prison, Moody was freed and filed an appeal. The
court's denial of a rehearing fueled Moody's terror
campaign, which began in December 1989 when Judge Robert
Vance was killed by a letter bomb sent to his home in
Birmingham, Alabama. The same tactic was used two days
later against a lawyer for the NAACP in Savannah,
Georgia. Fortunately for investigators, Moody's bombs
were so similar to the 1972 device that prosecutors were
able to obtain a conviction in spite of a lack of
fingerprints, witnesses or a paper trail linking him to
the 1989 bombings.

Perfection in the Palm of Your Hand

Glock introduces the Model 26 and Model 27--compact
pistols which combine Glock technology with firepower,
simplicity, interchangeability, and precision, all in a
package so compact and concealable that it fits in the
palm of your hand. The G26 is designed in 9mm, and the
G27 in .40 caliber. Those concerned about defending
themselves can walk down a dark street with confidence
knowing they have the power of a service caliber Glock
pistol on their side.

The concealability of these compact pistols are the main
selling point as a self-defense weapon, or as a backup
weapon. With a 6-inch slide and a height of only 4
inches, these pistols easily slip into an ankle holster
or handbag.

Another distinctive advantage is that the G26 accepts
magazines from the 9mm Glock models 17 and 19; the .40
caliber G27 accepts magazines from the models 22 and 23.
Both models have plenty of firepower, since the G26 holds
10 rounds and the G27 holds nine rounds. Law enforcement
officers who carry Glock pistols of the same caliber like
the concept that their duty magazines are compatible with
their backup or off-duty pistol.
Simple upkeep and training make these mini-pistols the
perfect choice for anyone desiring a compact for personal
safety. The same technology that made Glock known for
accuracy and ease of shooting still applies to these
compact packages. The recoil is lessened by the low
positioning of the slide and the unique double-recoil
spring, allowing each pistol to perform exactly like its
larger counterparts.

Anyone who can shoot a Glock can pick up the compact
version and expect the same function, accuracy, and
performance. Since the inner mechanisms are identical in
function and design with the other Glock pistols, field
stripping, cleaning, and servicing are as simple on the
G26 and G27 as on any other Glock.

also realizes most departments are on tight budgets, so
they have developed various innovative programs to
overcome some of the monetary concerns. For example, this
summer ITT Night Vision began a new Law Enforcement lease
program. The company is offering three standard lease
packages, but each can be modified to accommodate the
equipment chosen to lease. The minimum retail value of
equipment that can be leased is $10,000, with terms of 36
months with a $1 buy out at the end of the lease. All
equipment is leased at 10 percent below the retail value.

Hold on to Your Briefcase

A sophisticated version of the electrified briefcase has
just hit the market. The SB-100 Security Briefcase is

high-tech security and surveillance equipment since 1959.
CCS has outfitted a remote control high-voltage
briefcase--generating 100,000 volts--with a motion
detector and an audio alarm. If the briefcase is snatched
from the floor of an airport, on the train while you're
snoozing, or even in a hotel room while you're showering,
zap goes the power into the entire perimeter of the case,
not just the handle. At the same time, an ear-piercing
alarm will shriek to make sure you've been alerted. If
someone grabs the briefcase from your hand, simply press
the remote control (less than half the size of a
cigarette pack) to instantaneously activate both alarm
and voltage. This briefcase will protect your jewelry,
valuables, cash, and private papers--everything you need
while on the go.

Desktop Surveillance

Dedicated Micros, a leading provider of advanced
surveillance equipment and the developer of the first
CCTV video multiplexer, announced a new product line of
compact, full-featured digital video multiplexers that
make "desktop surveillance" a practical option for the
first time.
Dedicated Micros' new Sprite product line of six digital
video multiplexers are housed in identical cases. Each
Sprite has a footprint just over one square foot and 3
1/3 inches tall, and includes a built-in keyboard pitched
at a comfortable angle. The innovative design enables all
Sprites to sit unobtrusively on a desk.

Designed to meet a wide variety of user requirements, the
new Sprites are available in capacities ranging from four
to 16 cameras, color or monochrome operation, with
simplex and duplex models. The new multiplexers are the
Sprite SX 4C (four camera, simplex color with quad
capability), Sprite SX 9 (nine camera, simplex, mono),
Sprite DX 9 (nine camera, duplex, mono), and Sprite SX 9C
(nine camera, simplex, color), Sprite DX 16 (16 camera,
duplex, mono).

The multiplexers' attractive styling, compact size, ease
of installation and operation, many features, and low
cost-per-feature pricing are designed to open up the
emerging residential market and expand markets for small-
and medium-sized businesses, as well as large
organizations with CCTV requirements of up to 16 cameras.

Among the many features are true duplex operation,
activity detection with sensitivity settings, alarms
tagged to videotape for quick review, and flexible
multi-screen displays. Also, time and date is recorded
indelibly to the tape during recording--not during
playback--to assure evidentiary integrity.
The use of just four selection keys and color-coded menu
screens appearing on the monitor greatly simplifies
installation and operation of the entire Sprite product
line. The menus provide easy access to all options and
features. Preprogrammed function keys provide one-touch
movement between recording modes. There is also a
one-touch system status button. A scheduling function
permits automatic time-of-day recording mode changes.

Security Planters

California-based Dura Art Stone offers a complete line of
precast planters designed for security applications. With
today's heightened interest in preventing terrorist
attacks on all types of public buildings, these
components may be used to create economical,
attractive-looking yet highly effective buffer zones
between buildings and potential bombers.
Dura Art Stone offers more than 30 different designs,
each available in a wide selection of sizes, shapes,
colors, and finishes--providing hundreds of options from
which to choose. Any of the designs may be used in
conjunction with subterranean reinforcement to create a
barricade around a building, or to line a winding
driveway so as to slow down vehicles approaching a
guardhouse. When filled with plants or trees, these
planters provide a decorative look that is far more
aesthetic--and economical--than alternative barricades
such as steel fencing or troughs.

US Border Patrol Receives New Night Vision Gear

This fall, the US Border Patrol will begin using the
Long-Range Infrared Surveillance System (LORIS), made by
Inframetrics, Inc., to help detect the illegal entry of
aliens and contraband into the United States. At full
value, the contract is worth $17 million with options to
purchase up to 500 LORIS systems and accessories over a
five-year period.

Since most illegal border crossings occur at night and in
remote or relatively lightly traveled areas, the ability
to "see in the dark" is critical to the Border Patrol.
Unlike night vision goggles and other less sophisticated
IR scopes, infrared cameras like the LORIS system are
sensitive to body heat and can operate in total darkness
and under poor weather conditions.
The LORIS is a field-proven, all-weather unit designed
specifically for long-range surveillance with a detection
range of up to and beyond five miles. Used day or night,
the system produces high-quality thermal images for
display on standard video monitors. Weighing just 35
pounds, the sensor head is transportable and can be
mounted on a number of platforms including mobile
surveillance vehicles, communication towers, and other
fixed installations. In addition to border patrol
surveillance, LORIS systems are in use today in military,
drug interdiction, weapons testing and tracking, maritime
surveillance, and industrial security applications.

five tourists it kidnapped last month. The headless body
of Hans Christian Ostro, of Oslo, Norway, was discovered
in Seer, a village 30 miles south of the Himalayan region

police said. Ostro's head was found later in a different
spot in the village. "We have killed the hostage because
the government has failed to accept our demands," said a
note found in the victim's shirt pocket. It also demanded
that 15 jailed militants be released in 48 hours, or "the

Britain Condemned in IRA Killings

September 27: The European Court of Human Rights
condemned Britain for the 1988 slayings in Gibraltar of
three IRA members who were believed to be planning a car
bomb attack there. British officials argued that the SAS
commandos responsible for the killings acted properly
because they believed that the terrorists were armed and
about to detonate their explosives. As it later turned
out, the three were unarmed and were going through a dry
run of their planned bombing. The Strasbourg-based court
ruled in a 10 to 9 vote that the commandos' actions were
based on flawed intelligence and that British authorities
had shown a "lack of appropriate care in the control and
organization of the arrest operation." The British
government called the ruling "irresponsible."

Hamas Pledges to End Attacks Against Israel

October 6: According to Palestinian officials in the Gaza
Strip, the militant group Hamas tentatively agreed to
cease its terrorist attacks against Israel. The pledge is
part of a draft agreement between Hamas leaders in the
West Bank and Gaza and PLO leader Yasser Arafat. However,
experts note that Hamas leaders based in Jordan and Syria
hold a harder line against Israel than do their
counterparts in the West Bank and Gaza. Whether or not
they would back the no terrorism pledge remains to be
seen.

Amtrak Train Derailed

October 9: FBI officials suspect terrorism in the case of
a derailed Amtrak train in the western Arizona desert.
Two locomotives and four cars of the 12-car Sunset
Limited traveling between New Orleans and Los Angeles
were derailed when the train hit a section of torn track.
The saboteurs knew enough to disable a warning system
that alerts oncoming trains if any sections of track have
been disturbed. One crew member was killed and 78
passengers were injured. Officials said that two notes
were found near the scene of the crash train claiming
credit in the name of the "Sons of Gestapo," apparently
in revenge for the US government's handling of the Waco
and Ruby Ridge sieges.

Philippines calls for Joint Campaign Against Terrorism

October 24: During an interview at the United Nations'
50th anniversary celebrations in New York, Philippine
President Fidel Ramos proposed a counterterrorism
conference in Manila in February 1996. He asked that
experts from the United States, Asia, the Middle East,
and Europe attend. The United States accepted
immediately. Ramos said that his aim was "to establish a
closer and more effective network to exchange information
and take action on terrorist threats all over the world."
Ramos said the discovery of the plot to kill the pope in
Manila last January made such a conference imperative.

October 26: A bomb exploded in the crowded yard of the
Jules Verne school in Les Mureaux, 20 miles northwest of
Paris, while dozens of students were outside on a break.
Six students were treated for shock and earaches. The
homemade bomb was made from an iron tube packed with
explosives, police said. The force of the blast blew out
several window panes. School was let out early and
students were sent home. Earlier this month, authorities
discovered an empty gas canister on the steps of the town
hall in Les Mureaux. Gas canisters packed with nuts,
bolts, and nails have been used in the other bombings and
attempts.

Bomb Suspect Seized in France

November 2: After finding a bomb in the northern city of
Lille, French police arrested 15 suspects including
Boualen Bensaid, an Algerian suspected of being the
"pivotal figure" in the wave of attacks in France since
midsummer. Bensaid moved to France several months ago,
bolstering suspicions that the terrorist groups consist
of Islamic sympathizers recruited in the troubled French
suburbs where many unemployed immigrants live. According
to the Paris newspaper, Le Monde, both the attack and the
arrested suspects were similar to previous bombings:
canisters filled with explosives and shrapnel planted by
young Algerians with police records for minor offenses.

minute apart, injuring 11 Israelis in apparent
retaliation for the assassination of Islamic Jihad leader
Fathi Shaqaqi. The first bomb exploded near an
army-escorted bus carrying babysitters from Israel to the
Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements. The driver passed
the bus, ignoring warnings to pull over, and detonated
the bomb. The second bomb went off a half-mile away, near
where Israeli army vehicles waited to escort the bus
through PLO-controlled areas.

Iran Marks US Hostage Crisis

November 4: Iran marked the sixteenth anniversary of the
storming of the US embassy in Tehran with a large march
and the burning of American flags, while Tehran radio
stations broadcast school children chanting "Death to
America." Iran's state-run media reported that tens of
thousands of men and women, mostly university students,
marched through the streets with banners proclaiming
their "hatred toward the world-devouring United States
and Israel." This year's anniversary celebrations were
more vocal than in the past, probably because they follow
on the heels of tightened US sanctions against Iran
beginning last June.

Americans and one Saudi and wounding 30 others. The bomb
sheared off a wall of the three-story office building,
shattered nearby windows, and created a pillar of smoke

belonging to the Saudi National Guard, which receives
training from the US military and private contractors.
Two groups claimed responsibility for the blast, the

Libya's Role in International Terrorism by Jack Plaxe

Since the early 1970's, the Libyan government under Muammar
Qaddafi has both used and sponsored terrorism against the
enemies of the Libyan state.  The "enemies" that have been
attacked include the United States, Israel, neighboring
African states and outspoken Libyan dissidents who oppose the
Qaddafi regime.

Over the years, Qaddafi has provided support to such diverse
groups as the Palestine Liberation Front, the Provisional
Irish Republican Army and the Black Power movement in the
United States.  In the 1980's, Qaddafi's sponsorship and use
of terrorism greatly expanded.  Libya began to provide
operational support in the form of travel documents, weapons,
training, and safe haven to the Abu Nidal organization.
Libyan government agents also began to carry out terrorist
operations directly.  Some of the more notorious terrorist
incidents that Libya has been involved in include:

     The April 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco (3 killed,
  dozens injured)
     The December 1987 bombing of the USO lounge in Barcelona (1
  killed, 9 injured)
     The July 1988 machine gun and hand grenade assault on the
  Greek cruise ship 'The City of Poros' (9 killed, over 100
  injured)
     The December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 (270 killed)
     The September 1989 bombing of UTA flight 772 (171 killed)

  Despite these terrorist activities, many countries continue to
do business with and maintain diplomatic relations with Libya.
These links provide the Qaddafi government in Libya with
legitimacy which allows it to participate in international
organizations such as the United Nations, the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and INTERPOL.

The United States strategy vis a vis Libya has been to attempt
to isolate Libya through the imposition of unilateral economic
sanctions.  This strategy was revised in 1992 when the U.S.
led efforts at the United Nations to impose limited aviation
and diplomatic sanctions on Libya for its role in the Pan Am
103 bombing.  These sanctions have since been expanded to
include a variety of limited economic sanctions.  However, the
sanctions do not include an embargo on Libyan oil, the primary
source of Libyan hard currency revenues.

The result of these limited sanctions is that Libya has been
somewhat isolated yet they still participate in international
fora such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  If Libya is to be
truly isolated, all nations who condemn terrorism must work to
restrict Libyan participation in the these organizations.

There are some indications that this is underway.  The United
States, Great Britain and France recently led a successful
effort to deny Libya a seat on the UN Security Council.  In
addition, the Libyan delegation to the INTERPOL annual
terrorism conference was rebuked when the US delegation
presented information to the effect that they were seeking two
Libyan government agents for their role in the Pan Am 103
bombing.  The Libyan delegation was so humiliated by the US
presentation that they left the conference and did not return.

Despite these steps, additional efforts must be undertaken to
isolate Libya economically.  It is highly doubtful that
European and other countries will voluntarily stop doing
business with Qaddafi.  For this reason, the limited aviation,
diplomatic, and economic sanctions currently imposed on Libya
through the UN Security Council must be expanded to either
include a complete ban on Libyan oil sales (as was done
against Iraq after the Gulf War) or a total naval blockade of
Libya.  Either action will deny Libya the petrodollars that
prop up the Qaddafi government.

Efforts should also be taken to isolate Libya diplomatically
by denying them the right to participate in international fora
such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  A nation that has been
shown to both use and sponsor terrorism should not be a member
of an international police organization whose focus is
international cooperation to prevent criminal activity.  Nor
should Libya be allowed to participate in ICAO, particularly
in light of its involvement in the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772
bombings which resulted in over 400 deaths.

Terrorism has long been an important instrument of Libyan
foreign policy.  The international community must take
stronger steps to isolate Qaddafi both diplomatically and
economically.  If countries continue to provide the Libyan
government legitimacy through trade opportunities and
participation in international fora, the Qaddafi regime will
remain in power and continue to support terrorist activities
around the world.

boundaries or be truly home grown.  These incidents should not
have been any surprise, especially the homegrown one in
Oklahoma City.

On June 14,1995, the Washington, D.C. Chapter of  the American
Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) held its annual
Countering Terrorism Seminar.  Frank McGuire, a Bethesda, MD
security consultant, described an event in 1988 that should
have been a pointer to the damage even one man can do.  A
disgruntled tax payer rigged a homemade mortar in his pickup
truck that was designed to attack the building in West LA that
housed the IRS.  Fortunately, the chemicals involved had an
unintended reaction and the fire department was called for a
truck on fire. After extinguishing the fire, the fire fighters
noted a suspicious glow and called the bomb squad.  Several
city blocks were evacuated while the situation was resolved.
Had it gone off as planned, the IRS Building would have
suffered major damage with significant human losses.

McGuire was asked how to assess the potential risk created by
right-wing extremists.  He responded that, based on the West
LA scenario, and what we know about Oklahoma City, it is
conceivable for one deranged person to build a truck bomb.  It
would simply take longer than if he had help.  Using this
criteria, McGuire commented that if there are 1,000 people
nation-wide with these intentions and capabilities, that means
there could be 1,000 truck bombs.

Much media attention has been focused on militias and related
movements since the Oklahoma City bombing. At the ASIS Annual
Seminar in New Orleans, September 11-14, 1995, Daniel Donohue,
a security consultant based in Hallandale, Florida, discussed
"Domestic Terrorism and Right-Wing Extremist".  He began his
presentation by discussing the history of political violence
in America.  Most of us have forgotten our high school or
college U.S. history which covered labor organizing violence
in the late 19th  and early 20th centuries.  Violence by the
KKK against blacks, primarily in the South, resulted in many
lynchings in the 20s and 30s.  There was more racially related
violence in the 1960s and 70s during the civil rights
movement. The Vietnam War protesters sometimes became violent,
as at the Democratic Convention in Chicago.  This country has
not been immune from political violence, but most of us have
short memories.

Donohue believes that since the Oklahoma City bombing some
militia groups have disbanded and others have gone
underground.  He bases this observation on information
received from the Southern Poverty Law Center's Klanwatch
group, where he has done pro-bono work.

The Symposium, "Terrorism: Past, Present, and Future" was
sponsored by the University of Illinois at Chicago, Office of
International Criminal Justice, July 31-August 3, 1995.  Peter
Probst, a Defense Department international crime specialist
stated, "Ten years ago, most terrorist groups were politically
motivated...now you have a whole range of new groups."  He
suggested that cults, ethnic, and religious groups will not
hesitate to cause large numbers of civilian casualties while
political terrorists have avoided this to keep from losing
political support.

Steven Sloan's paper,  "Terrorism: How Vulnerable is the
United States?", was published by the Strategic Studies
Institute of the Army War College in May 1995.  Sloan points
out that threats from fundamentalists of all religious groups
cannot be ignored. He suggests that such groups might receive
support or be joined by domestic religious extremists.  These
groups might also obtain support from cultists, survivalists,
or neo-fascists who have their own reasons for rejecting the
existing social, economic, and political order, waiting
instead for their own Armageddons.

A unique aspect of Sloan's paper is his suggestion that the
role that could be played by  apolitical terrorists, who are
into violence and intimidation as an aspect of their criminal
activities.  Drug gangs and other criminal enterprises in
inner-city America could become the basis for such operations.
They could corrupt local government with their vast funds.
These groups could use their terrorist tactics to "shake down
the neighborhood" or blackmail the entire city.  Their
financial resources would enable them to acquire a significant
arsenal of weapons to challenge local law enforcement and
implement acts of violence on a level on previously seen in
the U.S.

Most of us think about terrorist attacks on buildings, planes,
and people.  However, Frederick Cohen in his recent book,
Protection and Security on Information Superhighway, discusses
the concept of  "infrastructure warriors" who would attack
electrical power grids or eliminate telecommunications
capabilities.  He cites an article in the July/August 1993
issue of Wired magazine which named the top 10 U.S.
infrastructure targets.  These include the Culpeper, VA
telephone switch that handles federal fund transfers and the
Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS).
Another example he gives is a paper presented to the Naval
Postgraduate School in August of 1993 which claims that 20
people and $1,000,000 can bring the U.S. to its knees.

We did not learn much from the West L.A. situation described
by Frank McGuire.  Those in the contingency planning field
know that the effect of the World Trade Center bombing lasted
only a few months. However, research published in Information
Week showed that nearly 40 percent of the businesses in the
World Trade Center when the bomb exploded are no longer in
business.

As we can see from the examples cited above, there are many
possibilities for how terrorism can be viewed in the near
future within the U. S.  We can review past incidents both
here an overseas to understand tactics used against specific
types of targets.  We can improve our intelligence gathering
to obtain a better understanding of potential threats.  We can
practice "target hardening" to encourage the adversary move
away from us to a weaker target.  Finally, we must be have our
crisis management, contingency, and business resumption plans
developed and tested - just in case.  Regardless of what the
future holds, these steps are reasonable and prudent.

CANADA
POLITICS

As the dust began to settle over the province of Quebec's
late-October referendum decision to remain within Canada, the leader
of the seperatist Bloc Quebecois (BQ), Lucien Bouchard, announced his
decision to quit federal politics in favor of taking over the
premiership of the province from Jaques Parizeau.

It was Parizeau who led the BQ's provincial sister party, the Party
Quibicois (PQ), to victory in the provincial elections in 1994.
Parizeau resigned following the narrow defeat sustained by the PQ in
the referendum on independence.

In announcing his decision, Bouchard that while he would await
constitutional offers from the federal government aimed at keeping
Quebec within the federation, he expects that any such proposals will
prove inadequate.  As a result of that, Bouchard said that he will be
likely to call another referendum, but that it would not take place
before April 1997.  He went on to predict that the next referendum
would result in success for Quebec's seperatist movement.  While the
accuracy of that prediction remains to be seen, it is true to say
that Bouchard's dynamic entry into the debate over separatism in the
run-up to the last referendum was largely responsible for the near
victory achieved by the PQ then.  With Bouchard at the helm
throughout, the possibility of a sovereign Quebec before the turn of
the millennium cannot be ruled out.

Meanwhile, Bouchard's major opponent during the Quebec affair,
Federal Prime Minister Jean Chritien, has come in for severe
criticism from within the country's ruling Liberal Party for his
handling of the issue.  Prior to the referendum, Chritien had assured
anglophone Canadians that there was nothing to worry about in Quibic
and that the province would not be leaving the federation as a result
of the referendum because the separatists had no chance of winning
it.  As it turns out, the separatists came within a whisker.  The
last week of campaigning saw Chritiin back-pedaling furiously to
offer several concessions to the seperatists in order to prevent a
government defeat.

Now that the federalists' panic has receded, the whispering campaign
has begun.  Reports suggest that some within Chritien's party feel
that he is no longer the best man to ensure that Quibec remains
within the federation.  With Bouchard in place as the province's
premier as of the beginning of 1996, this feeling may well increase
to proportions at which Chritien's 31 year-old career in politics
could be threatened.

CANADA
ECONOMY

The latest OECD report on Canada suggests that, while the economy is
likely to see some degree of recovery during 1996, high levels of
provincial and federal debt will continue to present considerable
problems to the country's ability to weather any further economic
downturn, and may result in greater volatility of the Canadian
dollar.

Real GDP growth is estimated to rise by 3.1% in 1996, with the bulk
of growth coming from a 4.5% expansion in the second half of the
year.  The organization sees this growth coming as a result of a
broadening of the base of economic activity from the largely
export-led recovery that has been seen to date.  Despite an expected
increase in the levels of private consumption and housing as a result
of wage increases  in the export sector, widespread wage increases
are not expected, keeping down the magnitude of such private
consumption rises.  Public sector consumption spending is expected,
and hoped, to remain weak as commitment to fiscal austerity
continues.  Inflation is forecast to be around the middle of the Bank
of Canada's target range of 1-3%.

Canada's ratio of public sector debt to GDP now stands at some 65%,
with interest payments exceeding government deficits.

CHILE
POLITICS

Former dictator, Augusto Pinochet celebrated his 80th birthday at the
end of November and signaled his determination to remain at the
center of Chilean politics until his constitutional term as commander
of the army expires in 1998.  Pinochet's remarks will not have been
lost on President Eduardo Frei, who has attempted to challenge the
"constitutional safeguards" put in place by Pinochet when he handed
over government to civilian rule after the 1989 election of Patricio
Aylwin Azocar.

Under the arrangements that Pinochet made, both he, and nine military
appointed Senators remain in place until 1998.  Frei wants
desperately to get rid of them because his ruling coalition is three
seats short of a majority in the upper House.  Doubtless Frei would
also like to see an end to the need to spend some 39% of the public
sector wage bill, equivalent to 2.8% of GDP on the armed forces.
Another of Pinochet's parting gifts was to ensure that legislation
was passed that meant that no one could interfere with the military's
budget.

In addition to his comments about staying on to what may well be a
bitter end in terms of his relationship with Frei, Pinochet has been
explaining that his 17 years in power were a "soft" dictatorship.  He
went on to defend officers of his regime who are now in prison for
human rights' abuses and suggested that they had been imprisoned
despite any proof of wrong-doing.  One cannot help but wonder how
such comments were received by the families of those hundreds of
people who disappeared under the former dictator's regime and will
never see an eightieth birthday.

They will at least have been cheered to hear that former torture
chief, Manuel Contreras, who was convicted of murder in June, has
recovered from the hernia that had made him so poorly that he had to
be detained in a Naval hospital.  In a move that Frei himself will
doubtless applaud, Contreras' recovery has resulted in him finally
being able to be transferred to prison to serve his sentence.  In a
last ditch attempt at avoiding such a fate and a final display of his
boundless bravery, Contreras, who is believed to have been
responsible for the torture and murder of many of those who
disappeared, staged a hunger strike in October.  It lasted two days.

CHILE
ECONOMY

After an initial delay in September, Codelco, the state-owned copper
corporation has announced that it is to go ahead with its plans for
the development of a fifth mine.  Radomiro Tomic will add will come
on stream in 1999 and add an initial 150,000 tonnes of copper a year
to the country's output.  Expansion to 225,000 tonnes is expected to
be swift, bringing Codelco's total output to 1.4 million tonnes by
the end of the decade.

The investment needed to develop the mine is estimated at some US$641
million and will be financed out of company cash flow, according to
Codelco's executive vice-president, Juan Villarzu.  The new venture
makes it highly unlikely that Codelco will go the way of other
parastatals in being privatized for the foreseeable future, and will
prove something of an acid test for the company in its attempts to
show that it can be as efficient and profitable as a privately owned
company.

NAFTA
With the US budget battle making it increasingly unlikely that
Chile's application for fast track entry into the North American Free
Trade Agreement will pass through the US legislature before it breaks
in mid-December, Canada and Mexico have indicated a willingness to
extend trade agreements of an equivalent nature to Chile in the
meantime.

The possibility of such a "bridging" arrangement should, according to
Canadian Trade Minister, Roy McLaren, be discussed by the three
countries in the near future.  Should such discussions prove
fruitful, Chile could see the arrangements come into force by
mid-1996.

COSTA RICA
POLITICS

The high levels of consensus that have traditionally marked Cost
Rican politics are beginning to wane as popularity for the government
of President Figueres and his National Liberation Party (PLN) has
fallen sharply.

Figueres and the PLN are approaching the mid point of their term in
office, which began in early 1994 when, in another almost
traditionally Costa Rican result, the incumbent Social Christian
Unity Party (PUSC) led by Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier were removed
from office.  Figueres and the PLN ran on a platform of blaming the
PUSC for implementing free market economic reforms that resulted in
higher unemployment and a host of other social problems.

Despite Figueres' stated opposition to free market policies and
IMF-sponsored structural adjustment programs, the recent decline in
what has been one of the region's richest economies has led him to
accept the need for reform.  This has been further underlined by the
country's high level of debt.  At an estimated US$4 billion, foreign
debt is equivalent to nearly 60% GDP and generates  a debt service
ratio of some 17%.  Internally, the PLN inherited a fiscal deficit of
8% from its predecessors.  Attempts to blame the outgoing Calderon
administration for the poor state of the country's finances, while
reasonably correct, have done little to calm the ire of the Costa
Rican people as the austerity measures put in place by the PLN have
bitten hard.

The hardships being faced by the population resulted in a wave of
strikes throughout 1995.  Public sector unions exercise considerable
strength within the political system of Costa Rica and such public
shows of dissent have, in the past, often resulted in changes in
government policy irrespective of which party has been in power.

It would seem that this is no longer the case, however.  Some 50,000
Costa Rican teachers held a month long strike toward the end of 1995,
denouncing both the government and the opposition for the handling of
economic policy and in particular the public sector layoffs that have
occurred and the increases in basic utility charges that have been
introduced.

Traditionally supporters of the NLP, the teachers have accused the
government of failing to meet its campaign pledges and has said that
the PLN now lacks credibility.  Unfortunately for the teachers, the
chances of a government turnaround appear slim.  The economic reforms
being put in place by the PLN are an integral part of the IMF standby
agreement sought by the government as part of the process of putting
the country's economic house in order.  The situation is likely to
get worse before it gets better.

CUBA
POLITICS

Determined to circumvent the efforts of some sections of the US
legislature to destroy the economy of his comparatively tiny country,
President Castro has been busy courting a wide variety of partners
for trade and cooperation during the last couple of months of 1995.
Increasingly it seems to be the USA rather than Cuba that is being
viewed as intransigent and unreasonable.

Perhaps in final recognition that a large section of the
international community looks none too kindly on the US stance on
Cuba, the American Senate passed a considerably watered-down version
of the Helms bill aimed at tightening the US embargo at the end of
October.  It was not watery enough, however, to prevent the passage
of a UN General Assembly resolution at the beginning of November
calling for an end to the US economic embargo.

Despite the resolution, some members of the US lower House are still
hoping to reintroduce some of the stiffer measures ditched by the
Senate when the two bills come up for reconciliation.  But with
Castro enjoying cordial relations in so many other places at present,
the effects of any such moves might well have been neutralized before
they can take place.

Meetings between Castro and the representatives of several other
countries including South Africa, Uruguay, Vietnam and Mongolia have
taken place recently.  All reported to have gone well and resulted
either in the signing of cooperation and/or trade agreements or have
gone some way toward such agreements.

In addition, Cuba and Russia have concluded a series of protocols
which the two countries describe as amounting to a new stage in trade
and financial relations between them.  Russia has agreed to a sugar
for oil deal which will ensure that what Castro has described as the
"Achilles' heel" of the Cuban economy will be protected to the tune
of 4.5 million tonnes of oil in return for 1.5 tonnes of sugar.  With
world sugar production expected to top the 120 million tonne mark for
the first time in 1995/96, Castro will be particularly satisfied to
have arranged a deal that takes Cuban sugar out of a potentially
falling market.

It should, however, be noted that neither country has yet completed
delivery of 1995's barter deal, which involved one million tons of
sugar for three million tons of oil.  Should things not work out,
however, a further source of oil is likely to be Angola, with whom
Cuba signed a cooperation accord at the end of October

In addition to the sugar deal, Russia has promised to give Cuba
enough money and technology to finish building a Soviet-era nuclear
reactor in the country.  Reportedly, Russia is to provide US$349
million and Cuba US$208 million towards the project.  A further
US$200 million is to be raised from an international consortium
including Latin American and Western countries.  Of the Latin
American contingent, Brazil will almost certainly be a part.  Recent
discussions between the two countries are believed to be likely to
result in the signing of a nuclear cooperation pact in the near
future.

Other recent negotiations have resulted in an investment agreement
being signed with Vietnam, the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Kenya and a deal in which Colombia has agreed to purchase
vaccines from Cuba.
Still more negotiations took place in November between Cuba and the
European Union (EU).  According to the EU these have a good chance of
leading to the signing of an economic and trade agreement, provided
that Castro is willing to accept some form of transition to
democracy.  So far, however, the Havana regime appears
unenthusiastic.  Alongside increased confidence of an economic
recovery in 1996, Castro's preparedness to spurn the double-handed
approach of the EU is perhaps as a result of a warming of relations
between Havana and Beijing.

The Cuban President made a reportedly highly successful trip to
China, again in November.  The visit coincided, strangely enough,
with a six day visit by general secretary of the Communist Party of
Vietnam.  Neither Cuba nor Vietnam have had particularly cordial
relations with China in the past, but the shrinking world of
communism seems to be uniting former adversaries in a struggle for
survival.

In his state of the nation speech in July last year, Castro said that
while he was prepared to go some way toward capitalism in order to
reform his country, he had no intention of giving up his ideology.
His visit to China has been seen as an exercise in learning how the
two may be combined.  While the discussions that took place in
Beijing remain largely unknown, the Chinese foreign ministry did say
that at wide range of bilateral issues were be dealt with and that
particular emphasis will be given to economic development.  The
possibility of a trilateral agreement between Cuba , China and
Vietnam was, however, ruled out.

CUBA
FINANCE

Much of Castro's confidence in dealing with the international
community stems from the fact that, despite all the odds being
stacked against it, the Cuban economy continues to grow.  Latest
figures released by the Planning Ministry suggest that GDP growth in
1995 will reach 2.5%, a significant advance on the 0.7% growth
recorded in 1994.

In a move aimed at re-starting talks with western creditors, the
government has released an astoundingly detailed report on the
country and its debt.  The report puts total debt at US$9.1 billion
at the end of 1994 and for the first time publishes balance of
payments' figures using IMF-recommended methods.  The data, which had
been specifically requested by creditors, shows an improvement in the
current account deficit from US$371.6 million in 1993 to US$81.3
million in 1994.  The decline in deficit is attributed to an increase
in exports and a rise in net current transfers, mostly from donations
and remittances from Cubans living abroad.

Cuba's parlous financial state means that it badly needs to gain
access to the medium and long term debt arrangements that have been
denied it since debt talks with the Paris Club of international
creditors stalled in 1986.  The release of this latest economic
report is the first step along that road, but there is still some
considerable distance to go.  The journey will be made that much more
difficult by the fact that Cuba is not a member of the IMF and the
chances of the USA allowing it to rejoin are slim.

In the meantime, not to be outdone, Castro has told the people of
Cuba that the "capitalist evil" of income tax will be falling upon
them again as of January 1996.  For the time being the tax will be
payable on hard currency earnings only, but the writing is on the
wall for taxation of the relatively low national state salaries.

In a further move aimed at easing the country's financial problems,
two more foreign banks, France's Societe Generale and Banco Sabadell
of Spain, have been authorized to open branches in Cuba.  These two
bring to 11 the number of foreign banks that have been granted
licenses to operate in Cuba over the last few months.

Credit and loan agreements have been signed with several of the
foreign banks now represented in the country and, although figures
have not been released, it is believed that the deals involve
financing for Cuba's sugar, nickel and rice production and for food
imports.

EL SALVADOR
POLITICS

Despite recent attempts by President Calderon, to assure the people
of El Salvador that all is well and a life of prosperity and laughter
awaits them, tanks took to the streets in November amid large scale
demonstrations and rumors of a military coup attempt.

Members of the National Civilian Police used rubber bullets and tear
gas to bring to an end a siege when former soldiers of the Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front (FLMN) occupied a building in the capital, San
Salvador.  The protesting soldiers held the inhabitants hostage for
three hours, demanding that the government fulfill the promises it
made under the Chapultepec peace agreement concerning job training
and the granting of loans.  This was the latest in a series of
demonstrations carried out by demobilized fighters demanding help
with their reintegration into society.

The incident, in which one of the former soldiers was killed, gave
rise to persistent rumors of an imminent coup attempt as armored
vehicles, troops and helicopters reportedly took up positions around
the city.  However, the threat of a coup was dismissed by Calderon,
who said that the rumors were of a plot to destabilize the country,
hatched by the FMLN and the working classes.  According to the
government, evidence of the plot had been uncovered and the heads of
metropolitan riot police and mobile units were given details in a
special memorandum.

The memorandum, which apparently details several planned activities
by labor organizations aimed at "paralyzing the country and provoking
insurrection", was condemned by FMLN leader, Leonel Gonzalez, as
untrue.  According to Gonzalez, the army and PNC intelligence
services are deliberately creating an atmosphere of mistrust in the
country in order that the government can justifiably carry out a
security clampdown to stifle opposition to its widely disliked
economic program.

However, FMLN deputy, Miguel Saenz Varela has suggested that the
military maneuvers were indeed indicative of a coup attempt in the
making.  According to Saenz, it is not the government seeking to
clamp down on its opposition that has resulted in the increased
tensions within the country, but unidentified forces who are intent
on discrediting the transition to democracy.

For its part, the army refutes suggestions it would be party to any
coup attempt.  Defense Minister General Humberto Corado said that the
military regretted the death that had accompanied the PNC action
against the former soldiers, but pointed out that the overriding
priority for authorities was the restoration of order.  Without that,
said Corado, "regretful consequences for the country" might ensue.
The deafeningly loud unspoken message seemed to be that such
regretful consequences would of course be avoided were the army to
establish military rule.

Despite Corado's insistence that that is not the army's aim, his
explanation of the military presence in the capital, which included
the "buzzing" of the Presidential Palace, seems a little thin.  He
claims the soldiers were there as part of a military sporting event.
He offered no explanation as to why those who, presumably, should
either have been spectators or competitors, were driving armored
trucks through the streets of San Salvador.  Given that no coup has
yet taken place, however,  it is perhaps reasonable to assume that
any, purely coincidental, messages that were given by the military's
actions have been taken on board by Calderon.

GUATEMALA
POLITICS

The people of Guatemala went to the polls on November 12 to elect a
new president from a field of no less than nineteen hopefuls.
Polling was said to have taken place without incident as guerrillas
of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) made good on
their promise of a unilateral two week cease-fire in order to allow
the election process to take place undisturbed.

In a somewhat rare show of reliability, opinion poll ratings that put
Alvaro Arzu of the right-wing National Advancement Party (PAN) and
Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front Party (FRG) as
the two front runners were proved correct.

Arzu, a popular former mayor of Guatemala City who comes from a
wealthy family and is heavily pro-business, took 36.5% of the vote.
Portillo, running as the front-man for FRG leader Efrain Rios Montt,
came in second with 22.1%.  The remainder of the vote was divided
amongst the confusing array of candidates that had never really stood
much chance.  These included a former defense minister who had been
found guilty of human rights abuses by a US court and an former
attorney-general who was remanded in custody under the last
government for swindling his aunt.

Despite winning the poll, Azru failed to gain the 50% of the vote
necessary to avoid a rerun.  This has been scheduled for January 7.
The likelihood is that Azru will be successful on that occasion.
While Portillo is a fellow conservative, he suffers from a degree of
guilt by association in that Montt is barred from standing in his own
right because of his 17 month long de facto rule in 1982-83.  That
period has been described by some as one of the most brutal periods
of Guatemalan history.

The relatively low turnout, at just 40% of the 3.7 million eligible
to vote was blamed in part on the large number of candidates causing
confusion amongst the electorate.  Hopefully, with the field a little
clearer for the January poll, there will be an increased interest in
what is only the country's third presidential election since it
gained independence in 1986.

At the time of this report, no agreement has been reached with the
URNG concerning an additional cease-fire to cover the run-off
election.  Despite pleas to extend the cease-fire past the November
13 cutoff, the URNG refused.  The guerrilla organization did,
however, say that it was ready to negotiate a permanent bilateral
truce with the government and that its commitment to achieving that
end was proven by the peaceful election period.  The organization has
said that it supports neither candidate in the run-off, but there is
little likelihood of disruption to voting.

The transitional government of current President Ramiro de Leon
Carpio will leave office on January 14 when the winner of the run-off
will take over for a four year term.

MEXICO
POLITICS

The problems being experienced by the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the wake of the late 1994 devaluation
crisis were underlined once again in October when Manuel Camacho,
former Mayor of Mexico City and once-upon-a-time likely candidate to
succeed President Zedillo, resigned from the party.

In explaining his resignation, Camacho said that he was not in favor
of cosmetic electoral reform intended to artificially prolong the
PRI's time in office.  Rather, said Camacho, he is interested in real
political change and the advancement of democracy.  He intends to
form a new coalition to achieve this out of what he sees as the
disaffected groups within both the PRI and the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD).

How successful he will be remains to be seen.  Despite suffering
severe criticism and several high profile gubernatorial election
defeats since the devaluation crisis, the PRI is still a fairly
cohesive unit.  The party responded to its poor electoral showings by
making several personnel changes in August 1995 in an attempt to
revitalize grassroots support.  Recent elections at the municipal
level suggest that while a resurgence in PRI support has not yet
arrived, the rot has perhaps been stopped.  While it is true to say
that the PRI is struggling to become more of a political party and
less of a tool of the President, it is not currently likely to break
down to the extent that would be necessary for Camacho to create a
realistic alternative.

The PRI does suffer from the fact that it has, in the past, been held
together more by power and patronage than by a common ideology.  This
has been underlined by the, almost meteoric, rise in popularity of
the National Action Party (PAN).  In common with many left-wing
parties over the last couple of years, the PRD has suffered something
of an identity crisis which has translated itself into poor electoral
results and caused a deal of internal division for the party.  The
lack of ideological direction on the part of the PRI has led a
fundamentally conservative electorate to move to the right, and into
the waiting arms of the PAN.  The PAN's capitalization on the right
wing mood of the population has further consolidated its ideological
position.  The PRD has seen its support dwindle, but it appears that
the party has rallied round its leaders in spite of the tensions that
this has brought.

Given that both the PRI and the PRD seem to be wrestling with their
problems but staying pretty much together, and that the popular
ground is being seized by the PAN, it is difficult to see just where
Camacho might find room to form a power base.  It is the PAN that has
stolen the governorships from the PRI and the likelihood is that,
come the congressional elections in 1997, it will be the PAN that
presents to biggest problem for the PRI.  How well the PRI stands up
to the challenge will depend, in large part, on how successful it is
in remodeling itself into a modern political party in the meantime.

MEXICO
ECONOMY

The government launched its Alliance for Economic Recovery at the
beginning of November in a bid to aid recovery and provide leeway for
increased social and investment spending while remaining within its
target of a balanced budget for 1996.

Under the plan, which was reached in conjunction with trade union and
business leaders, the minimum wage will be increased by 21% in two
installments.  The first took place in December 1995 and the second
is due in April this year.  In addition to the wage increase, higher
grants are to be given to the unemployed and further help will be
provided for the temporary jobs program.  Businesses will receive tax
incentives including a commitment to suspend asset taxes for small
and medium-sized business during 1996.  Tax on investment that is
over and above 1995 levels will be waived and tax credits will be
given to companies that take on new workers.

The government has also undertaken to help in the drive toward fiscal
stability by staggering price increases for gas and electricity, both
of which are still currently sold by parastatals.  The government
intends to make a 4.75% cut in real spending during 1996 and is
banking on the increased economic activity that will come as a result
of the Alliance providing the rise in tax revenues necessary to make
additional social spending measures feasible.

The plan has had a mixed reception with some economists worried about
the reliance on growth to ensure increased tax receipts.  According
to Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, the measures will mean a fiscal
relaxation of about 0.5% GDP which will not be enough to push the
government off its balanced budget target.  The plan is aimed at an
inflation rate on the year of 20% and growth of 3% of GDP.  Ortiz is
of the opinion that recovery will be export led and that this sector
will provide growth of 1.4 percentage points.  Given that the
government expects an export volume growth of 12% and a value growth
of 18% in US dollar terms, the peso is expected to strengthen.  No
figures for such a strengthening have been released, however.  The
government has simply said that the floating rate will continue.

Confidence in the currency's ability to achieve additional value and
survive a floating exchange rate system got off to a poor start.  The
peso plunged to its lowest ever level against the US dollar just
seven days after the government announced the Alliance.  A ten point
interest rate rise did nothing to strengthen the currency as it came
under increased pressure from speculators and the Central Bank was
force to intervene several times to defend it.  Even then, such
defense was unable to stop the currency losing close to one fifth of
its value against the US dollar in the space of two weeks.

Further distressing news for the government came toward the end of
November with figures being released that suggest that the Mexican
economy is continuing to contract at a worrying rate.  According to
the figures, GDP fell by 9.6% in the third quarter of 1995 compared
to 1994.  This followed a second quarter decline of 10.5%.  The
figures suggest that the government's estimate of a 5.5% contraction
for 1995 may prove to be optimistic.  Should that be the case, the
target figure for next year's recovery may slip beyond reach.

NICARAGUA
FINANCE

Finance Minister, Emilio Pereira, has announced that Nicaragua has no
chance of meeting its 1995 targets for an Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) operating under the IMF's stopgap loan
program.

The first of these targets was a reduction of the deficit in net
international reserves that was adjusted up to US$21,6 million.  Up
to October this year, however, these reserves were in deficit to the
tune of US$115.2 million.  According to Pereira, the situation is
better than it was last year, but he recognizes that the continuing
deficit in international reserves threatens the country's
macroeconomic stability.  The reason for the lack of progress in this
area is, according to Pereira, due to unspecified problems with the
Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute (Telcor).

Another indicator that the government will not be able to meet the
stopgap loan agreements is the fact that the net internal credit to
the non-financial public sector was not to exceed Nc308.4 million by
December 31.  However, reports issued by the Economic Studies
Management of the Central Bank registered credits to this sector of
Nc748.3 million up to November 9.  This put the government Nc439.9
million off target with more than a month to go to the deadline.

Finally, the National Development Bank was supposed to deposit US$30
million a month into the Central Bank from October.  The US$60
million that should, therefore, have arrived by the end of November
failed to do so.

The fact that these three goals have not been met makes it likely,
according to Pereira, that the IMF will withdraw its help at the
beginning of 1996.

PANAMA
POLITICS

The prospect of a continued US military presence in Panama after 1999
looks less certain after the postponement of talks between the two
countries aimed at coming to an agreement over the terms of an
extension.

Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed during former US president
Jimmy Carter's term of office, the US presence that the Hay-Buneau
Varilla Treaty granted in perpetuity in 1903 must come to an end in
the year 2000.  Talks aimed at an extension of this period began in
September 1995.  There was immediate confusion as to which side had
initiated the talks.  Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
insisted that it was the USA that broached the subject, but this is
widely believed to have been a face-saving exercise on his part as
pressure began to build over the imminent loss of one of the major
planks in the Panamanian economy.

Balladares has explained the postponement in terms of it being a bad
time for the USA to deal with the issue given the problems it is
having over the budget.  This again, however, is likely to be less
than the whole story.  In reality, it is more likely that Balladares
has asked for far too much of what he terms "clear economic benefits"
for Panama that are the prerequisite for him considering a continued
foreign military presence in his country.

Opinion polls suggest that 75% of Panamanians want the US troops to
stay.  The US military presence pumps around US$400 million into the
country's tiny economy each year and supports some 18,000 jobs.
Official unemployment is at 14% but the true figure is probably
double that.  In addition, the country's traditional sources of
income have come under threat over recent years.  Once a thriving
offshore banking center, international insistence that rules be
tightened to stem the flow of dirty money being laundered in the
country have put paid to much of that sector.  Meanwhile,
deregulation in the USA has damaged Panama's erstwhile equally
successful shipping and insurance sectors, while the entry of Sweden,
Finland and Austria into the European Union's controlled banana
market has reduced exports of what was the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner by 20% this year.  Balladares is not really in a
position to demand rent from the USA in return for allowing it to
continue to prop up the economy, but it would appear that demand it
he has.

In fairness, it is understandable that Balladares should want a
better deal for Panama.  It was, after all the USA which, first
through sanctions and then through its invasion to remove former
dictator Manuel Noriega, devastated the economy in the first place.
Estimates put the real cost to Panama at US$4-6 billion.  US economic
aid since the 1989 invasion totals a mere US$700 million in
comparison, and the situation has not been helped by Panamanian banks
losing a further US$2 billion during the Mexican devaluation crisis
of 1994.

However, there is a good chance that talks will resume and that some
compromise will be made because Panama has the Canal and that is of
considerable strategic importance to the USA.  About 13,000 ships use
the Canal each year and this figure is growing at an annual 2%.  With
President Clinton pushing for even greater levels of free trade
within the Americas, that figure is set to rise over the next decade.
Given that, the USA will almost certainly be back to talk to
Balladares, but for the meantime, it would appear that he has
overstepped the mark and the US administration has decided to give
him a little time to reflect on his country's situation.

JANUARY 1996

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
POLITICS

It would not be entirely undeserved for President Bill Clinton to
allow himself a smile of satisfaction in the privacy of the Oval
office over the events of the last two months.  He has received a
considerable boost to his opinion poll ratings ahead of next year's
presidential election; he is not, again according to latest opinion
poll results, being held responsible for the increasingly
dangerous-looking budget battle; He has brokered possibly the most
important peace deal in Europe since the end of the Second World War;
and secured an advance in the peace talks in Northern Ireland.  And,
last but not least, the only man who has so far looked remotely
likely to present a challenge to his continuation in office next year
has decided not to run for the Republican presidential nomination.

That is not, however, to say that problems do not remain.  Most
pressing of these is the battle between Clinton and the Republican
party over the 1996 budget and extension of the current federal debt
ceiling of US$4,900 billion.

A late November compromise between the protaganists has ensured that
government funding continued until mid-December, but it is
essentially superficial and agreement on the real issues that lie
behind opposing spending suggestions remains some way off.  Tension
over the budget stand-off increased substantially in mid-November
when some 800,000 federal employees were sent home.  This came as a
result of the failure of the two sides to reach agreement on a
compromise over the passage of appropriations bills, which contain
Republican spending cuts, to areas that Clinton is determined to
protect.  Visitors choosing to see the sights had picked a bad day,
as both the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty were closed to the
public.  Rather more importantly, staff responsible for ensuring the
payment of pensions and some other state benefits were laid off,
leaving many Americans in difficult financial circumstances.

In order to ease the situation, Clinton did sign some appropriations
bills for individual departments.  This resulted in some government
workers returning to their posts, but did nothing to end the impasse
over the "reconciliation" bill passed by the House of
Representatives.  That bill includes some US$245 billion in tax cuts
and reforms of the social security net, both of which Clinton
continues to refuse to sign.

The compromise that gave rise to a continuation of government funding
for all departments until December 15 was reached when Clinton agreed
to the signing of a non-binding Congressional resolution that the
federal budget be balanced by 2002.  This seven year period for the
removal of the budget deficit has been the central feature of
Republican budget proposals.  Clinton's apparent climb-down from his
earlier suggestion of a 10 year period for balancing the budget was,
in fact, something of a non-move in that the depth of cuts required
to achieve the seven year target depend quite heavily on which
economic growth figures for the period are used.  Congress insists on
using projections made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and
their spending cuts rely on these figures.  The Clinton
administration, however, has its own set of figures that are less
pessimistic than those of the CBO, and would, as a result, require
less damaging cuts than those proposed by the Republicans.

The agreement made by Clinton does not, however, give the last word
on these projections to the CBO.  Rather, Clinton has said that he is
prepared to balance the budget over seven years, but only in
conjunction with figures resulting from an administration and private
sector review of the CBO projections.  Given the 4.2% growth in GNP
in the last quarter of 1995, the projections resulting from such a
joint enterprise are likely to be a deal more optimistic than those
currently available from the CBO.  The difference is of great
importance in that some estimates suggest that it could result in a
reduction in planned Republican spending cuts of hundreds of billions
of dollars over the forecast period.

Further to that, the text of the agreement quite clearly includes
provision for the "protection of future generations" by means of
ensuring the solvency of Medicare, the adequate funding of Medicaid
and the promotion of "tax policies for the working poor".  This
latter is a reference to the Earned Income Tax Credit system which
Republicans want to get rid of.  Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker in
the Lower House and architect of the Republican spending cuts has
accepted that the agreement puts the centerpiece US$245 billion tax
cut policy very much back on the negotiating table.

Meanwhile, attempts to overcome the impasse over the raising of the
federal debt ceiling before the USA defaults on its international
obligations have met with less success.  This is the other area in
which Republicans have attempted to link, to Clinton, unpalatable
legislation to the debt extension bill in order to force through
their wishes.  Crisis was averted in November when Treasury
Secretary, Robert Rubin, converted US$61.3 billion worth of
non-marketable treasury bonds into cash and auctioned a further US$48
billion worth of Treasury bills in order to cover the US$102 billion
worth of debt that came due.  This situation cannot go on forever,
however.  Rubin remains confident that the Treasury can get through
December by such methods, but crunch time will arrive in mid-January.

The political fallout from these issues looks to be landing squarely
on the Republicans at present.  Opinion polls suggest that twice as
many Americans support Clinton's refusal to bow to Republican
pressure than disagree with it.

This is just one more indicator of the problems being faced by a
Republican party that seems increasingly to be wide of the mark of
public opinion.  Following the decision of General Colin Powell not
to stand for the Republican presidential nomination, the party looked
toward Gingrich as a possible candidate to consolidate the image of a
floundering opposition.  He too, however, has declined such
invitations.  Given his plummeting popularity ratings over the last
few weeks, the Republican party might now breathe a sigh of relief
that he has chosen not to spearhead their presidential bid.  Pressure
would appear to be getting to Gingrich.  His recent outbursts include
blaming the welfare state for a particularly horrific triple murder
and admitting to allowing perceived snubs on board the presidential
plane on route to the funeral of assassinated Israeli leader, Yitzhak
Rabin, to play a part in his decision to bring government to a
standstill.  Such respectively ludicrous and petulant behavior has
done little to endear him to a public which has already signaled its
distaste over his attacks on the most vulnerable within American
society.

In addition, Gingrich faces investigation over charges of violating
campaign finance laws filed against him by the Federal Election
Commission.  According to the FEC, an organization called the Grand
Old Party Action Committee (Gopac), chaired by Gingrich since 1986
and used by him as a vehicle for regenerating the party's grass roots
support, channeled some US$250,000 into Gingrich's campaign for
reelection as a congressman in Georgia in 1990.  This, says the FEC,
was illegal because Gopac did not formally register as a federal
political action committee.  If found guilty, Gingrich stands to be
fined a considerable amount, not to mention the damage to whatever
political standing he has remaining at that time.

So, with Gingrich out of the frame, the Republican party's only
obvious hope for the presidency now lies with Senator Robert Dole.
Dole himself, has suffered something of a setback recently though.
In a straw poll in Florida amongst 3,300 registered Republicans that
is widely regarded as the start of the nominations process, Dole took
an unconvincing 33% of the vote.  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas came in
second with 26% and former Tennessee governor, Lamar Alexander,
polled 22.5%.  The fact that Dole was unable to secure a greater
percentage lead over his supposedly little-hoper opponents can only
present further worries for the Republican party as a whole.

These worries must have been heightened yet further by the party's
poor showing in off-year elections throughout the country.  Despite
being convinced that for the first time since the civil war,
Republicans would control both chambers in the Virginia legislature,
the Democrats retained their 52-47 majority in the lower house and
drew 20-20 with the Republicans in the state senate.  The casting
vote in the senate goes, however, to a Democrat.  Similar results
were posted in several other polls, but the Republicans did hold on
to the governorship of Kirk Fordice in Mississippi.

All this is, of course, cheering news to Clinton.  Provided the
president is able to secure the welfare system protection he wants
while still reducing the period in which the deficit will be cleared
to seven years, both approved by the electorate, he will have
achieved an important compromise that could well ensure his return to
office.

Clinton is not unassailable, however. Implementation of the so-called
Dayton peace agreement signed between the Presidents of Bosnia,
Serbia and Croatia in Paris in mid December will require the presence
of some 20,000 US troops to be deployed in Bosnia.  This is
particularly contentious domestically.  A majority of Republicans,
and probably a majority of the American people, fear a re-ignition of
the war in Bosnia that will result in the deaths of many US
servicemen.

Clinton has achieved wide recognition for his part in the brokerage
of the deal, but his decision to send troops could well backfire
should considerable US casualties ensue.  While it is traditional for
the electorate to rally round a President in conflict situations, the
last thing Clinton will want to see in an election year is large
numbers of body-bags returning home.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ECONOMY

Discussion over the possibility of an interest rate cut surfaced
again in November following the release of economic indicator figures
that suggest that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing.

Industrial production fell in October, with output down by 0.3% to
register its first decline in six months.  Some 0.2% of this decrease
can be attributed to the strike at aircraft maker, Boeing, but
according to analysts, even with this taken into consideration, most
sectors were flat or slightly down.  Output of consumer goods,
business equipment and construction supplies were down by 0.5, 0.8,
and 0.6% respectively.  These figures were reflected in the
Purchasing Managers' Index of manufacturing activity which fell by
0.3% in November to 46.5%.  A figure of below 50% indicates a
contraction in manufacturing and the November figure is the sixth in
seven months to indicate a decline, taking the index closer to the
44.5% figure at which the economy as a whole is said to be in
contraction.

Consumer confidence figures as measured by the New York business
analysis group, The Conference Board, remain strong.  The Board's
figure for November rose to 101.4 as against 96.3 in October.
Readings of above 100 have traditionally been associated with periods
of rapid economic growth.  The apparent strength of confidence among
consumers is not, however, expected to translate itself into high
retail sales figures for Christmas.  The Commerce Department
registered a 0.2% decline in sales in October .  According to the
department, high levels of indebtedness will prevent consumer
confidence boosting this position for the time being.

As for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in
October as a result of sharp increases in the cost of housing, energy
and clothing.  The core CPI, which discounts food and energy prices,
also showed a 0.3% rise.  Despite most economists now believing that
the economy is slowing and will probably only post a quite moderate
2.4% GDP growth figure for 1996, the possibility of upward pressure
on inflation still makes imminent cuts in interest rates unlikely.
The Fed is not known for impulsive moves and, in our opinion,
decisions on whether or not to give the economy a moderate boost will
not take place until early next year.

Foreign Trade
Sluggish domestic demand has been held responsible for a second
consecutive fall in the US monthly trade deficit figures.  The
commerce department said that the deficit fell to US$8.3 billion in
September as against expectations that it would be as high as US$9.5
billion.  This comes on top of the fall in August to US$8.4 billion.

Within the figures lurks a decline in the bilateral deficit with
Japan, subject of much disagreement between the two countries of
late, from US$5.1 billion to US$4.3 billion, its lowest level in two
years.

Exports rose 1.6% between August and September to US$67.2 billion.
This more than offset the percentage rise, at 1.4%, of imports which
increased in value to US$75.6 billion.  Exports were 10.3% higher
than in the September 1994 and imports were up by 8.4% over the same
period.  The deficit was US$90 billion for the first nine months of
1995, up from US$78.7 billion over the same period in 1994.  A
deficit of US$136.8 billion in goods was partially offset by a
US$46.8 surplus on trade in services.

JANUARY 1996

CZECH REPUBLIC
POLITICS

With the next general election now scheduled for May 31 and June 1
this year, Prime Minister Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) has
moved to strengthen its position by merging with the Christian
Democratic Party (KDS).  The ODS was already the largest party in
parliament, but it remains to be seen how effective the merger will
be.

The problem is with the Club of Committed Non-Party Members (KAN),
which was closely allied to the KDS.  Although the leadership of the
KAN supported the merger with the ODS, the bulk of the membership did
not.  As a result, although the KDS members voted overwhelmingly for
the merger, 69 KAN members did not.  When the vote was carried the
KAN membership voted to abrogate the partnership agreement with the
KDS.  KAN chairman, Emil Dejmek, who supported the ODS-KDS merger,
was forced to resign, along with other members of the KAN leadership,
and was replaced by Pavel Holba.

On the left of the political spectrum, the Left Bloc (LB) has
announced that it intends to contest the election independently.
This means that three parties will now be competing to capture the
left vote in the elections - the LB, the Communist Party of Bohemia
and Moravia and the Czech Social Democratic Party.

According to LB chairman, Jaroslav Ortman, the party intends to spend
Ccr19 million (about US$731,000) in its election campaign.

Another complication for the political establishment is the decision
to transform the current unicameral legislature into a bicameral
system with an upper and lower chamber.  Under this amendment to the
constitution agreed by parliament last year, the existing single
chamber - the 200-member National Council - will become the lower
chamber and a new upper chamber, the Senate, will be created by
direct election.

However, the parties in the coalition government are unable to agree
on whether the Senate elections should be held simultaneously with or
separately from the lower chamber elections.   Josef Lux, the leader
of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party
(KDU-CSL) and Jan Kalvoda, the leader of the Civic Democratic
Alliance (ODA) have argued that the two elections should be held
separately, while Prime Minister Klaus and his ODS favor holding the
two elections simultaneously.

Relations between the ODS and the ODA have been poor through most of
the current governments' term, and it would appear that Klaus is
depending on the merger with the KDS to counteract any gains made by
the ODA in the upcoming election.

The current representation of the parties in parliament (with the
coalition parties indicated by an asterisk) is as follows: Civic
Democratic Party-Christian Democratic Party (ODS-KDS*), 84; Czech
People's Party-Christian Democratic Union (CSL-KDU)*, Civic
Democratic Alliance (ODA)*, Left Bloc (LB), 35; Czech Social
Democratic Party (CSSD), 16; Liberal Social Union (LSU), 13; 15; 14;
Movement for Self-Governing Democracy  in  Moravia and Silesia
(HSDMS), 9; Republican Party (SOR-RSC), 8; Liberal National Social
Party, 6.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Klaus has suggested that the government be
slimmed down after this year's election through the abolition of a
number of ministries, including the culture and economic ministries.
He argued that a culture ministry was not needed as the tasks it
carries out can easily be taken over by other ministries.  On the
economic side, he argues that a Privatization Ministry, Economy
Ministry, Industry and Trade Ministry and Ministry for Economic
Competition is excessive.  In his view at least two of these could
go.

Racial/Ethic Tensions
Last year, the Interior Ministry reported that racial persecution is
being directed to an ever greater extent against Romanies, or
Gypsies.

According to the ministry, attacks on Arabs or blacks are sporadic,
and there is no evidence of increasing racially motivated criminal
activity against Vietnamese or Jews.  However, attacks against
Romanies appears to be on the rise.

The ministry puts the responsibility for most of the racially
motivated attacks on members of the skinhead movement, which unites
around 1,500 young people.  However, the ministry is unable to
identify which of the numerous skinhead factions actually organizes
the attacks.

According to the ministry, the numerically strongest and most
important skinhead factions - the Patriot League, Bohemia Hammer
Skins, the National Socialist Movement and the National Fascist
Community - tend to restrain their activities to organizing meetings
and concerts or to publishing printed material that indirectly
prompts attacks on Romanies.

The most frequent occurrence of racially motivated activity has been
noted in Prague and northern Bohemia, while it has been falling in
southern Moravia and eastern Bohemia.  In 1994, police investigated
up to 160 racially motivated conflicts, of which 130 were criminal
offenses.

As a result of the sharp increase in racially motivated crimes, the
penal code was amended on September 1 last year to increase the
penalties available for racially motivated crimes.

Social Conditions
The government has increased the subsistence level by an average of
8% as from 1st January 1996.  Given that inflation is different in
various areas, the government reckons the amount "per individual"
will be increased by 7%, while the amount including expenditure on
joint household needs will be increased by 13%.

When fully implemented, the increase will cost Ccr3.2 billion (US$123
million) this year.  The last increase in the subsistence level was
at the beginning of 1995.

Meanwhile, the republic continues to enjoy one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the world.  There were 146,000 people
registered as unemployed at the end of October, equivalent to an
unemployment rate of just 2.8%.  Overall, there were 9,200 fewer
unemployed than in September and 31,000 fewer than in January 1995.

Of the total of 146,000 unemployed, 68,200 (46.7%) received
unemployment benefits worth Ccr1.35billion (US$52 million), 88,000
were women, 22,000 had limited work capabilities and 22,000 were
college graduates.  At the same time, there were over 94,000 job
vacancies.

The highest unemployment rate - 7% - was in the northern Bohemian
district of Most.  The districts of Karvina in northern Moravia and
other northern Bohemian districts of Teplice, Louny and Chomutov
recorded an unemployment rate of over 6%.

Population
The Czech Republic's birth rate was lower than its mortality rate in
1994 for the first time in the republic's history.  According to the
Czech Statistical Office, the social and economic changes wrought by
the transformation process have substantially changed the
reproductive behavior of the people and brought demographic changes
in the Czech Republic into line with those in West European
countries.

One positive feature of this development has been the reduced number
of abortions.  In comparison with 1992, the number of abortions has
dropped by 38.3% last year.  The average marrying age for the Czechs
is also higher, while the divorce rate remains virtually unchanged.

CZECH REPUBLIC
ECONOMY

The Czech Republic became a member of the OECD on November 28 last
year - the first of the post-communist countries to do so.  Although
membership will not bring any direct increase in   economic
assistance it does set a massive seal of approval on the government's
management of the economy since the establishment of the state in
January 19xx and confirms Republic's lead among the former European
members of Comecon.

In line with the OECD stamp of approval, the credit rating agency
Standard & Poor's upgraded its foreign currency debt ratings for the
Czech National Bank and the City of Prague by two points from BBB+ to
A, raising the outlook for both institutions from "positive" to
"stable".

The latest estimates put last year's GDP growth at 4.1%, compared
with 2.6% in 1994 and a forecast 5% plus this year.

Industrial output growth accelerated to 7.8% in the fist nine months
of last year, compared with an annual growth of 2.1% in 1994. The
overall growth rate for 1995 is estimated at 7-7.5%, but a slight
slowdown to 5.5-7% is expected this year.

While the 8% growth rate in construction forecast for 1995 will be
half a percentage point higher than in 1994, a slight fall to 7-8% is
expected this year.  Labor productivity growth has been greatest in
industry and the construction, rising by 8-9% last year.

Domestic demand in real terms grew by 5.1% in the first half of 1995
while external demand grew by 4.4%.  The rate of investment in the
first half of last year was 23.6% in current prices.  The estimate
for the whole year is around 30%.  The rate of engineering
investments was twice that of the rate of investment in construction.
Household savings have been stable at 10-11% of disposable incomes.
No major change is expected in this sector this year.

Inflation
Inflation remains a pressing concern.  As Prime Minister Klaus
pointed out last year, the transformation "cushion" set up in 1991
and which allowed real wages to grow by more than the GDP is no
longer sustainable.  The cushion was created by the liberalization of
prices and trade and the devaluation of the currency, but the room
for maneuver they provided has now been exhausted.

That means, said Klaus, that henceforth real wages must not be
allowed to grow at a greater rate than the GDP if domestic price
rises are to be kept in line with foreign prices.  He pointed out
that up to now the government had consciously set the level of
devaluation, but that too little control had been exercised over
prices.  As a result they had soared.  The rise in prices which began
in the second quarter of 1990 and accelerated after price
liberalization in January 1991 pushed real wages down in the second
quarter of 1991 to 69% of their levels at the beginning of 1990.
This year, said Klaus, real wages should approach the levels of early
1990, while inflation should be around 7.5%.

According to the Czech Statistics Office, inflation in retail prices
is slowing, but only modestly when compared to the acceleration of
economic growth.

After a 10% rise in retail prices in 1994, the rise was a little
slower at 9.7% in the first six months of last year. Prices of food
and public catering rose more than 14% in the first half of last
year, while prices of services rose by 8.3% and prices of other goods
by 6.9%.  The increase in food prices was primarily influenced by the
rising prices of potatoes, meat products and coffee.  The prices of
services were affected by adjustments to government regulated prices
during the first half of the year, including prices for heat,
postage, telephone service, railway fares, energy and gas.

Nevertheless, the moderation in the annual inflation rate continued
through the year with a rate of 9.5% recorded in the first nine
months.  The overall projection for 1995 is an inflation rate of
around 9.5%.

Agriculture
A slight growth in gross agricultural production is expected last
year, following several years of decline.  According to the hectare
yields and crops assessment from the end of October last, basic grain
crops should reach 6.7 million tonnes, a drop of 0.9 % on 1994.  The
wheat yields will be 4.1% higher, but the yields of rye, barley and
oats will be lower than in 1994.

The production of potatoes is expected to be 1.4 million tonnes, an
increase of 14.3% compared with 1994.  The rape crop is expected to
reach 664,000 tonnes, some 46% higher, while sugar beet production
for industrial purposes is estimated to reach 3.5 million, an
increase of 9% on 1994.

Livestock production was slightly lower last year.  It is estimated
that the numbers of cattle fell by 2% and the number of pigs by 0.5%.
The milk yield increased by 4.3% to 11.3 liters per day in the first
half of 1995 compared to the same period of 1994.  According to the
annual estimate, the sale of milk will decline by 3.5% and the sale
of eggs by 0.4%.

Inward Investment
A package of agreements was signed in November enabling foreign oil
companies a stake in Czech refineries.  The International Oil
Consortium (IOC), comprising Agip of Italy, Royal Dutch/Shell of the
Netherlands and Conoco of the USA, signed up to the deal with the
Czech state-owned Unipetrol joint-stock company to acquire a 49%
stake in the Czech Refinery Company (CRS).

The CRS was formed out of a merger of the refining operations of
Czech refinery giants Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov.  The
remaining 51% share in the CRS stays in the hands of Unipetrol, which
in turn is wholly owned by the National Property Fund.

Banking Sector
The Republic's three largest banks reported high profit growth in the
first nine months of 1995.  Komercni Banka, which declared gross
earnings of Ccr6.8 billion, compared with Ccr2.6 billion for all of
last year, recorded the highest profit growth, followed by Ceska
Sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank) with a net profit of Ccr1,194
million, a growth of almost 22% 1994.

The net profit of the third bank, Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB),
was Ccr712 million, 70% of the projected Ccr1 billion in earnings for
this year.  During the same period last year, IPB achieved a net
profit of Ccr584 million while the total for the whole year amounted
to Ccr752 million.

All three banks recorded an equal growth in granted loans and
consequently in reserves.

CZECH REPUBLIC
FINANCE

The state budget ended the first ten months of 1995 with a surplus of
Ccr12.3 billion.  Revenues totaled more than Ccr355 billion and
overall expenditure reached Ccr343.4 billion.  Finance Minister Ivan
Kocarnik said the figures showed the government's overall projections
for the 1995 budget were realistic.  It meant that the prognosis for
the end of the year situation, based on the October figures, was that
revenues to the budget should be met with a possible variation of
plus or minus Ccr1-2 billion.

In November last, the parliamentary budget committee recommended
approval of the proposed state debt of Ccr155.7 billion for 1996.
Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said the debt's nominal value
will remain the same as in 1995 but its share of the GDP would
decrease from the 13% to 11.2%.  The major tendencies in
administering the state debt are to convert the passive trade balance
with foreign countries into a domestic passive balance and to convert
direct loans to securities, Havel said.

He said the state will buy its receivables in foreign countries and
finance it by issuing bonds and treasury bills at a total value of
Ccr40 billion, which will reduce the amount of foreign debt in the
overall debt from 44% in 1993 to 23% in 1996.  For the first time
since 1993 the state debt will not be financed by the government's
National Property Fund.

The state debt totaled Ccr162.8 billion at the beginning of 1993
(17.3% of GDP).  By the end of 1994, the debt had totaled Ccr157.3
billion.  In 1995, Ccr1.6 billion was paid off from the surplus in
the 1994 state budget, bringing it down to Ccr155.7 billion (13% of
GDP).  If the debts of municipalities, funds and other independent
state institutions are added to the debt, the total share of the GDP
would reach 18%.

Havel claimed that the proposal to issue state securities worth Ccr40
billion this year will not influence the behavior of investors on the
Czech capital market.  At the time of this report, parliament had yet
to discuss the budget committee's recommendation.

Foreign Trade
The foreign trade deficit for January-October 1995 stood at Ccr77.4
billion, according to Statistical Office figures.  This is an
increase of Ccr9.2 billion on the January-September period.   Exports
totaled Ccr446.5 billion and imports Ccr369 billion.  In the same
period of 1994, the foreign trade deficit amounted to Ccr8.9 billion.
In October 1995 alone, the deficit stood at Ccr11.9 billion compared
to the deficit of Ccr1.5 billion in October 1994.

Imports grew by 30.2% between January and October 1995 compared to
the same period last year, while exports rose by 10.5%.  Imports of
machines and transport equipment grew by 33.3%, accounting for 35.1%
of total imports.  Passenger cars accounted for 7.5% of total exports
of machines and transport equipment.  Semi-finished products made a
significant contribution to the increase in imports, accounting for
18% of the total.  The volume of imports in this area jumped by 43%
compared with the same period of last year.  Chemical imports
recorded an increase of 33.6%, a share of 13.6% of total imports.

Exports of semi-finished products increased by 19.5% in the
January-October period and accounted for 33% of total exports.
Exports of chemicals rose by 15.9% and accounted for 10.5% of the
total.  Exports of machines and transport vehicles grew 9.9% and made
up 25.6% of all exports.

Overall exports were hit by a drop in exports of industrial products,
mainly consumer goods, which accounted for 12.7% of total exports.
They dropped by 2.7% between January and October 1995 compared to the
same period of 1994.

The volume of foreign trade in agricultural produce increased by 16%
in the January-October period.  However, the Czech Republic's deficit
in this trade amounted to Ccr12 billion, a year-on-year increase of
33%.

Trade with European Union (EU) countries showed a deficit of
Ccr11billion and that there was a Ccr6 billion deficit in trade with
developing countries.  In trade with Slovakia Czech imports rose by
21.1% in the 10-month period to Ccr59.4 billion against exports of
Ccr59.7 billion, to produce a surplus of Ccr300 million, an increase
of 8.6%.  The republic also recorded a surplus with Central European
Free Trade Agreement countries as a whole.

Trade with Russia in the first nine months of 1995 was more than 21%
up on the same period of 1994 and totaled Ccr47billion, according to
preliminary data from the State Statistical Office. Imports from
Russia were worth Ccr36.3billion, a rise of 30%, while exports fell
by 3.4% to Ccr10.6 billion.  Fossil fuels and lubricants accounted
for 77% of the imports.

Exchange Controls
Despite the burgeoning trade deficit, the Czech Republic became the
first of the former European Comecon members to partly liberalize its
capital account transactions on October 1 last year when it
introduced a new foreign exchange act.  The act, which also
introduced full convertibility of the currency for current account
transactions, does not affect the central bank's managed exchange
rate policy.  The value of the crown will continue to be tied to a
currency basket made up of a 65% weighting to the German mark and a
35% weighting to the US dollar. Under this system, the crown is
allowed to fluctuate by 0.5% either side of the set parity.

Under the act, the Ccr100,000 ceiling on the amount of foreign
currency citizens can buy is removed.  In addition, the purchase of
foreign real estate is permitted, companies are allowed to accept
credit from non-resident banks, and some restrictions on direct
investment are eased.  However, other restrictions, such as the ban
on investing in foreign stock markets, remain.  The National Bank's
goal is to achieve full capital account convertibility by the year
2000.

National Bank
The Czech National Bank's (CNB) balance sheet stood at
Ccr530,824,300,000 at the end of October last. The greatest
contribution to the increase in the bank's assets are the greater
outstanding claims on foreign countries, which have increased to
Ccr70,146,800,000.  In addition, receivables from local banks grew
have risen to Ccr72,343,800,000.

Czech National Bank deposits in foreign banks, including securities,
amounted to Ccr258,861,300,000, while other assets amounted to Ccr
5,742,300,000.  Obligations to local banks increased to Ccr
124,613,700,000.  Securities issues were also up at Ccr92,153,000,000
crowns and the volume of obligations for the state budget were also
up at Ccr12,277,300,000 crowns.

Obligations to foreign banks were down at Ccr25,888,600,000 and the
value of issued currency dropped stood at Ccr109,753,300,000.

HUNGARY
POLITICS

The unity of the Socialist led coalition government has been badly
bruised over the last few months.  On the one hand, two ministers
have resigned over their opposition to elements of the tough economic
stabilization plan, while on the other, Finance Minister Lajos Bokros
has threatened to resign over a ruling by the Constitutional Court
that other elements of the recovery plan are unconstitutional.

The first minister to resign, on October 6, was the Labor Minister,
Magda Kovacs Kosa, one of Prime Minster Horn's most experienced
ministers.  Clearly loath to see her go, Horn initially refused to
accept her resignation and pleaded with her to stay on.  However,
Kosa, a former trade union leader in the communist era, was adamant.
In particular she opposed the cuts in sick pay provision put forward
in the restructuring program.

Prime Minister Horn finally accepted the unavoidable on November 28
and replaced Kosa with Peter Kiss, a 36-year old mechanical engineer,
and Socialist Party deputy.  Kiss held senior posts in the Communist
Youth Union (CYU)  and was a founding member of the Progressive Youth
Association (PYU), which was set up when the CYU was wound up in
1989.  He was chairman of the PYU from 1992 to 1995.  He has been a
Socialist member of parliament since 1992.

In the meantime, Education Minister Gabor Fodor resigned on November
24, although he agreed to stay on until the 1996 budget is settled.
On making the announcement, Fodor said he was leaving because he did
not agree with a number of decisions made by the government and
because he did not receive enough support from the prime minister.
He was particularly unhappy that the 1996 budget allocation for
public education is to be cut by Hf7 billion and that further
redundancies are planned in higher education. Fodor is a member of
the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDZS), the junior member of the
coalition.  He is likely to be replaced by another SZDZS member.

However, what could be the hardest blow for Prime Minister Horn's
hopes of pressing ahead with his recovery program came on November 22
when Finance Minister Lajos Bokros offered his resignation.  Bokros's
move, clearly one of exasperation, came after the Constitutional
Court ruled that his move to increase housing loan rates from 15% to
25% was unlawful.  This was the fourth time the Constitutional Court
had ruled that certain measures in the economic stabilization package
are unconstitutional.

Prime Minister Horn refused to accept Bokros' resignation.  Bokros
responded by putting a set of conditions for his continuation as
finance minister and said that whether or not he stays on depends on
the extent to which these demands are met.  In particular he wants
the parliamentary groups of the two government parties the means by
which he can manage the economy without continually running foul of
the constitution.  That means, he said, that the role of every basic
institution has to be reassessed, including interest coordination.
He also wants a compulsory declaration of assets, as he believes
financial savings should be encouraged, while the accumulation of
real estate as a form of investment should not

In essence, Bokros' demands can only be met through fundamental
amendments to the constitution.  That a new constitution is needed
has been long recognized, but little has been done to address the
problem so far.  However, Bokros' latest intervention has reawakened
the debate, with Prime Minister Horn saying it is vital that
preparatory work for a new constitution should start at the beginning
of this year at the latest.

Not surprisingly, the harsh effects of the recovery package has split
the Socialist Party, with its more left-wing members arguing for a
softening of the measures.  So far, however, Horn has remained
adamant that the policy must be kept on track.  This division between
the two wings of the party led to the resignation of Sandor
Czintalan, the executive deputy chairman of the party on November 24,
with effect from this year.

Social Conditions
In November last year, the Central Statistical Office (KSH) published
its first detailed statistical analysis on the economic transition
process.  The study shows that the GDP shrank by one quarter between
1990 and 1994.

Between 1990 and 1995, Hungary received the largest share (US$9.2
billion) of the working capital invested in the transition economies
in Eastern Europe and obtained the largest proportion of joint
ventures.  In the summer of 1995, more than 800,000 private
entrepreneurs were registered in the country, 15% of the active
population.  However, the KSH estimates that 30-40% of private
businesses were set up purely for "tax alleviation".

The age structure of the population is out of balance.  Some 24.8% of
the population is 55 or older, and 34% is below the age of 24.
However, while the middle age group, which makes up only 28.3% of the
population, has to carry the bulk of the taxation and expenditure
burden, it also suffers the highest unemployment and death rates.

Average life expectancy at birth is also falling.  In the case of men
this was 65.9 years in 1960, but only 64.5 years in 1994.  The life
expectancy of women is better at 73.8 years.

Over the 1990-1994 period, the number of people in registered
employment fell by 1.4 million, about 25%. The unemployment rate last
year was 10-11%.  Unemployment is highest among young people at the
beginning of their careers: 23% among women and 31% among men.
Economic activity is overall is 57% (62.6% in the case of men and
51.8% among women).  The employment proportions are distorted by the
fact that, between 1990 and 1995, the number of pensioners working
part or full time decreased by 60% while the number of people in
early retirement or retirement due to disability increased by 15%.

The real income of the population decreased gradually from 1990 to
1993, at which time it stood at 93.3% of the 1985 level.  Real
incomes rose by 3.7% in 1994, but are estimated to have fallen by 11%
in real terms last year.

Inflation, the decrease of real incomes, the increased number of
dependents and falling consumption show a large degree of
differentiation in incomes.  The difference between the smallest and
highest average incomes is more than seven-fold.  In 1994, 45.9% of a
household's income came from the main place of employment.  This
indicates that in an "average family", welfare and illegal incomes
have become dominant.  According to the household panel surveys, some
25% of the population lived below subsistence level in 1994.  People
on low income spent 35.6% of their total spending on food and around
20% on housing.  The proportions are believed to have continued to
deteriorate last year.

However, the data also indicate that from a "quality of life"
viewpoint, the housing situation, telephone supply, the general
possibility to use infrastructural services, the number of cars per
family, and the construction of holiday homes have significantly
improved in the past five years.

The population's health has deteriorated; the proportion of smokers
and alcoholics has soared; and the proportion of people having to
rely on various welfare provisions has increased.   Public safety has
also deteriorated continually since 1990, and the proportion of
violent acts and economic crimes has been increasing among criminal
acts.

HUNGARY
ECONOMY

Despite the considerable pain being inflicted, the austerity package,
introduced in March last year, is bearing fruit.  The GDP is
estimated to have grown by around 2.5% last year, with improvements
in the budget, trade, and current account deficits.  However, there
are indications that the sharp improvements seen in the first half of
the year, started to slow in the second half.

After 8.3% growth in the first half of 1995, industrial production
increased by 7.4 % in July, 2.7% in August and 2.4% in September,
compared with the same periods in 1994.  Both small and large-scale
enterprises increased their output.  As a result, the volume of
industrial production in the first nine months of 1995 exceeded that
of the same period of 1994 by 6.8%.

Industrial production in September was the equivalent of 78.8% of
industrial production achieved in 1994.  At the same time, the volume
of production in September, based on the index containing all the
enterprises and the seasonal adjustments, was 2.6% lower than that
calculated in August.  With the exception of the chemical industry,
the major processing industry sectors registered a fall in
production.  The biggest drop was registered in metallurgy and metal
processing, where production dropped by 14.3%, but the engineering
industry also registered a considerable drop of 8.3%.

Food, beverages, and tobacco production dropped by 4.6%, compared
with August, while chemical industry production increased by 12%.
Production of the mining industry in September 1995 dropped by 8.5%
compared with September 1994, while electric energy, gas, thermal and
water production registered an increase of 10.1%.

Inflation
In November, the government produced an inflation forecast of "only"
19% this year provided the trade unions accepted pay rises averaging
17-18%.  The government also proposed that the social insurance
contribution to be paid by employees this year should be 12% compared
with 10% last year.  Companies, however, should only have to pay a
40- 41% social insurance contribution, as opposed to the current rate
of 44%.

Also in November, the government and unions reached agreement on a
new tax regime.  Employers, however, are unhappy with the deal
because they consider the top tax rate of 48% on the top band of over
Hf900,000 as excessive.  The tax rate on the bottom band, up to
Hf185,000, is 2%.

Foreign Trade
Helped by a 9% devaluation of the forint and an 8% import surcharge,
introduced as part of the recovery package, exports grew by 40% in
the first nine months of last year against a 29% rise in imports.
Nevertheless, with imports totaling to Hf1,367.4 billion and exports
Hf1,076.8 billion at current prices, the trade deficit for the period
was still Hf1.8 billion more than in 1994 at Hf290.6 billion.

According to the National Bank of Hungary (MNB), imports fell by 3%
and exports rose by 4% in comparative prices against the
corresponding period of 1994.  On its figures, in US dollar terms,
exports in the nine-month period were worth US$9.01 billion, up from
US$5.23 billion in the same period of 1994, while imports increased
to US$11.06 billion, compared with US$7.76 billion.  As a result, the
trade deficit fell from US$2.5 billion in the first nine months of
1994 to US$2.05 billion in the first nine months of 1995.

Yugoslav Embargo
Following the decision of the United Nations' embargo committee to
lift its sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the
Hungarian government lifted its compliant restrictions on November
23.  With effect from that date, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV)
announced that was now prepared to transport goods to and from
Yugoslavia and to allow transit shipments to and from Yugoslavia on
its lines.

At the same time, the Hungarian Oil and Gas Rt (MOL) increased the
amount of Russian natural gas transported to Serbia via the transit
station at Kiskundorozsma in southern Hungary to its pre-embargo
level of 186.5 million cubic meters a month.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade estimates that the embargo imposed
on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) on June
3, 1992, has cost Hungary over US$2.2 billion in lost trade.  The
greatest loss, some US$1 billion, was suffered in 1993.  In 1994
Hungary's embargo-related losses amounted to only US$571 million,
while in the first nine months of 1995 they reached some US$300
million.

The losses have been caused partly by a fall in export markets, extra
costs stemming from re-diversion of exports, hindrances to supplies
and cancellation of transit shipments.  A one-off state subsidy of
US$2 million in 1994, issued in a bid to partially compensate firms
for damages caused by the embargo, increased government losses
further.

HUNGARY
FINANCE

In October, the central bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) said
that both Hungary's external payments position and its reserves had
improved significantly, with reserves standing at around US$9.1-9.2
billion.  On that basis the NBH said it had decided to repay US$620
million of its debt to the IMF in November.  Repayment was not due
until the end of 1998.

NBH President Gyoergy Suranyi said the step would improve the
country's debt service ratio and cut interest payments in the coming
years.  As a result of earlier repayment, Hungary's current debt of
slightly more than US$1 billion will fall to US$400 million, which
will be due in and after 1999.  The NBH took up these loans in 1990
and 1991.

The budget deficit picture looks rather less rosy, however.  Under
the austerity package, the budget deficit was supposed to fall to
Hf150 billion last year, equivalent to 6.5% of GDP against 9.5% of
GDP in 1994.  Budget revenue reached a total of Hf1,149.3 billion at
the end of October, and expenditure Hf1,344.9 billion, to produce a
deficit of Hf 195.6 billion.  With the deficit in November and
December expected to be around Hf100-110 billion, the total deficit
for the year could rise to around Hf300-310 billion.

1996 Budget
Finance Minister Bokros presented the draft 1996 budget to parliament
on November 7, with another harsh message for the people.  It was
essential, he said, that there be no rise in the standard of living
this year and that there was a further decrease in incomes in real
terms.  This further belt-tightening was needed, he said, to achieve
the three main aims of the budget - improving the balance of
payments, cutting the budget deficit and public expenditure, and
bringing down inflation.

He said the first economic policy goal is to halt the increase in the
external net debt.  This will require a significant decrease in the
deficit of the balance of payments on the current account, from about
US$2.8 billion in 1995 to less than US$2 billion.  Second, the growth
of internal debts must be slowed significantly.  The budget deficit
target for this year is 4% of GDP.

Exchange Controls
The new foreign exchange regime came into force in January 1, making
the forint a convertible currency as defined by the IMF.  As the
forint was already convertible as far as companies' financial
transfers are concerned, the main effect of the new law will be
enabling private individuals to use the forint for the purchase of
services and commodities abroad.

From January 1, Hungarian citizens holding forint cards or registered
savings deposits will have free access to foreign currency abroad.
However, the tourist allowance of US$800 a year remains unchanged.
Hungarian companies and businesses are now able to found companies or
acquire stakes in existing ones without any limitation.  The stake of
the Hungarian investor, however, should always exceed 10% of the
assets of the foreign venture.  Also, the company to be founded or
acquired should be based in an OECD member state, with which Hungary
has concluded a mutual investment protection agreement.

Hungarian private individuals and businesses wishing to invest in
securities issued abroad will still require a foreign exchange
license.

POLAND
POLITICS

The most interesting feature of the presidential elections on
November 5 and November 19, is not that a former communist
functionary is now the President of Poland, but that Lech Walesa very
nearly secured a second successive term.  When one thinks of quite
how bad he has been as a president - in his five years he engineered
the downfall of seven prime ministers and almost as many governments
while showing an alarming tendency towards authoritarianism -  and
the low esteem in which he has been held by the majority of Poles
over the latter part of his term, that was no mean achievement.

However, that narrow failure was achieved by the same means that
Walesa employed during his presidency - spite, bullying, character
assassination and, last but not least, the unswerving support of the
Catholic church.  It has to be admitted, however, that the eventual
victor, Aleksander Kwasniewski, more than played into Walesa's hands
by being less than candid about his educational background - a silly
pretense in a competition against a man qualified only as a shipyard
electrician, and perhaps an indicator of a suppressed vanity.

Knowing that Kwasniewski was his main challenger, Walesa based his
campaign on one single theme - the threat of a return to communism.
The "reds under the beds" tune was eagerly taken up by the Church,
with priests in every parish lecturing the faithful on the dangers
that stood before them if they were foolish enough to vote the wrong
way.

In the first round of voting on September 27  Kwasniewski gained
35.11% of the vote and Lech Walesa 33.11%.  The other candidates were
Jacek Kuron with 9.22%, Jan Olszewski with 6.86%, Waldemar Pawlak
with 4.31%, Tadeusz Zielinski with 3.53%, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz
with 2.76%, and Janusz Korwin-Mikke with 2.40%.

From then on the heat was turned up under Kwasniewski, who suddenly
found himself being required to account for his personal finances and
the posts he filled in the communist era. Aged 41 and married with
one daughter, Kwasniewski was an activist in the communist Socialist
Union of Polish Students (SZSP) and joined the communist party, the
Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in 1977.  In 1980-81 he was made
a member of the executive committee of the SZSP main council.

From November 1981 to November 1985 he was editor-in-chief of the ITD
weekly and later the Sztandar Mlodych daily.  He then moved into
government in October 1985 as minister and head of the committee for
youth and physical culture under Prime Minister Zbigiew Messner, and
stayed there through to June 1990 under prime ministers Miczyslaw
Rakowski and Tadeusz Mazowiecki.  From October 1988 to September 1989
he chaired the cabinet's socio-political committee.

After the dissolution of the PZPR he became a member of its
successor, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).  He became a member of
parliament and head of the SLD caucus in October 1991 and has been
head of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly since
November 1993.

However, despite all this high profile activity, the Walesa camp was
quite unable to come up with any dirt.  Moreover, the "the Reds are
coming" message was undermined both by Kwasniewski's consistent
campaign message that he was committed to maintaining the thrust of
the free-market reforms and the fact that the SLD/PSL (Polish Peasant
Party) government, also former communists, have not been making a bad
job of running the country.

This reduced the Walesa campaign, finally, to complaining about
Kwasniewski's educational qualifications, or lack of them.

Rather stupidly, Kwasniewski had put it about that he had a master's
degree from Gdansk university.  Diligent digging by the Walesa
campaign team proved that he had in fact failed to complete his
course with a masters' thesis and that no degree had been awarded.

But it was too little, too late.  In the run off election on November
19 and with a turnout of 68.23%, Kwasniewski won 9,704,439 votes, or
51.72% of the votes cast.  Lech Walesa came second with 9,058,176, or
48.28%.

Lech Walesa's reaction to his defeat was consistent with the manner
in which he had conducted his presidency - mean-minded and
vindictive.  This man was a hero.  It was Walesa who called the
strike in a Gdansk shipyard 15 years ago which spread nationwide,
created the Solidarity movement, and started the beginning of the end
of the communist dictatorship in Poland.  It was Walesa who proved
the greater man when martial law was invoked in 1981 to crush
Solidarity.  For his courage and foresight in helping to avoid
bloodshed he was rightly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1983, an
award he refused to accept in person while his colleagues remained in
prison.

Despite the failures of his term as president, that background meant
that Walesa could have departed with dignity and able to regain the
"father of the nation" status that was previously his.  Instead, he
mounted an immediate campaign to have the election result set aside
on the grounds that Kwasniewski had lied about his education
qualifications.  Realizing that this appeared a bit weak, they threw
in the spurious allegation of electoral fraud and claimed that
Kwasniewski had suppressed information about his family's shares in
the Poisa insurance company.

At the time of writing, the Supreme Court had received some 600,000
petitions that the presidential elections be annulled on the basis of
one or all of these grounds.  Given that the Walesa camp has yet to
produce any actual evidence of fraud. the pettiness of the
educational qualifications question, for which Kwasniewski had
already apologized, and the fact that Kwasniewski did produce a full
breakdown of his finances, it seems unlikely to us that the Supreme
Court will rule the election illegal.  In that case Aleksander
Kwasniewski should be Poland's next president.

That will give Poland a left-wing president as well as a left-wing
government.  Some Western commentators look upon such a development
with alarm.  We don't share it.  Quite simply, countries like Poland
now have no alternative but to follow the reformist path.  Even the
most backward-looking former communist knows that any retreat would
lead to the political, social and economic chaos that is Russia.
Moreover, all their economic plans, and therefore hope of progress,
are inextricably tied to Western political and financial institutions
such as the IMF, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.  Quite simply, there is no way back.

Rather, we see Kwasniewski's success as positive.  With a like-minded
president, prime minister and government Poland has much better
prospects of achieving harmony in political decision-making than was
ever possible Lech Walesa's presidency.  The key early test of
Kwasniewski's ability to work with Prime Minister Oleksy will be the
way he handles the so-called presidential ministers.

The incumbents of these posts - Andrzej Milczanowski of internal
affairs, Wladyslaw Bartoszewski of foreign affairs, and Zbigniew
Okonski of national defense all tendered their resignations with
effect from December 20.

Religion in Politics
Lech Walesa's defeat in the presidential election was also a defeat
for the Catholic Church, which conducted an all-embracing campaign in
his favor.  Like Walesa, the Church has also been less than
magnanimous in defeat, with the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, calling Kwasniewski a liar in all but name.  Referring to the
fuss over Kwasniewski's educational achievements, the Cardinal
declared that the one thing known about him was that he "publicly
bore false witness".

This was par for the course.  When he cast his own vote in the second
round, Cardinal Glemp said the election was a "choice between a
system of Christian values and a system of neo-pagan values".  After
the election he commented that a society which chose a presidential
candidate who did not represent Christian values was morally sick.
Other priests reportedly said that anyone who voted for Kwasniewski
was committing a sin.

When the electorate decided that "morally sick" or not, it was
plumping for a "system of neo-pagan values", the Church swung into
action behind the campaign to get the elections annulled.  Priests
berated their congregations and dished out protest forms for the
Supreme Court, printed by Lech Walesa's provincial headquarters in
Poznan.

In order to get the message across to those who did not manage to
make it to mass, the Church's own radio station, Radio Marya,
broadcast appeals to the faithful to send in demands to the Supreme
Court that the election be annulled on the basis of Kwasniewski's
"falsification" of personal details.  This was so blatant, that the
National Radio and Television Boradcasting Council was forced to
intervene on the grounds that the radio station was contravening the
terms of its franchise by involving itself in political protest.

Meanwhile, a new political party was registered on November 21.
Called the "Movement for Poland's Reconstruction" it comprises the
former election committee of Jan Olszewski, who gained 6.8% of the
vote in the first round of the presidential election.

Social Conditions
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) estimates that more than one
million Poles work unregistered in the gray, semi-illegal, economy.
GUS concludes from this that the true level of unemployment is
significantly lower than the official figures suggest.  Just under 7%
of the total number of people registered as employed also register a
second job.  However, GUS believes that the true percentage is much
greater than this and that more than two million people were employed
in the gray economy last year.

Men worked unregistered more often than women; urban dwellers did it
more often than the rural population.  It also emerged that one young
person in eleven was employed in the gray economy which employed not
only people with poor qualifications but specialists as well,
although the latter's work in the gray economy was not their main
job.

Rather surprisingly, the GUS study found that horticulture and
agriculture were the largest employers in the gray economy.  Work in
the service sector came second.  Households were the main employers
of gray economy workers, followed by private firms.

The situation on the labor market did improve last year, with the
number of people in work rising by 1.7% up in October 1995 compared
with October 1994, bringing the number of employed to 15,720,000.
However, this is 2,500,000 than in 1990.

The unemployment rate stood at 14.7%, down from 16.2% at the same
time in 1994.  This translates into some 2,600,000 people officially
registered as having no job.  However, if all the unemployed are
counted, including pensioners, the figure rises to 11,600,000, an
increase of 5,00,000 since 1990.  According to demographic forecasts,
the number of people able to work will increase by 680,000 by the end
of this century.

Salaries in the industrial sector grew and after three quarters of
1995, the wages in the economy were 1.6% higher than in
January-September 1994.  However, public sector wages fell 1.5%.  The
Central Statistical Office (CUP) estimates that after the fourth
quarter indexation of pensions, the purchasing power of the benefits
will have risen by 2.8% in the whole of 1995.

POLAND
ECONOMY

The GDP grew by around 6.5% last year, with industrial production
rising by 10%, construction and assembly by 11%, and agricultural
production by 7-9%.  On the downside, inflation was higher than
predicted, while high unemployment, especially among young people, a
continuing crisis in housing, and growing economic disproportion's
between households continued to hold down expectations.

Industrial output rose by 11% in the first 10 months of last year,
compared with corresponding period of 1994.  In the construction
sector, production was 15.5% higher.  However, the number of
completed flats was 20.7% lower than in January-October 1994.

The inflation rate for the month of October was 1.8%.  With hopes of
the monthly rate moderating to an average of 1.5% in the last two
months of the year, the projected annual rate for 1995 was 28% - well
above the 22.7% rate forecast in the 1995 state budget law.

Exports grew by 28.9% in September, compared with a growth of 37.6%
in the first eight months of the year.  Imports also rose rapidly,
however, and at the end of September the deficit in the balance of
payment of commodities amounted to US$930 million.

The state budget deficit stood at ZL6.02 billion in October,
equivalent 68.1% of the figure forecast for the whole year.  Revenues
of over ZL66 billion were collected in the first 10 months of the
year, while the expenditures over this period stood at ZL72.08
billion.

Privatization
The sale to the population of special share certificates in 15
National Investment Funds (NFI), controlling more than 500 state-run
companies, was ceremonially launched on November 22. Polish citizens
were eligible to buy the share certificates at a fee of ZL20 (some
US$8.09) and later exchange units made up of these certificates for
shares in each of the 15 NFI.

On November 27, it was reported that more than 250,000 people had
bought NFI share certificates in the first three days of their
distribution.

Also in November, the Polish Privatization Ministry said that a total
of 914 state enterprises were transformed into State Treasury-owned
joint-stock companies in the period between July 1990 and October
1995.  This accounts for 26.8% of the 3,412 enterprises subject to
this process.  However, only around 150 of the State Treasury-owned
joint-stock companies have been privatized so far.  A total of 1,160
enterprises were wound down under the privatization process and the
liquidation of 1,338 enterprises, which were in poor financial
condition, has begun.

A new version of the privatization bill was due to be submitted to
parliament in the middle of January 1996.  According to privatization
minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, parliament would be able to speed up the
legislative process by suing the deputies' bill already submitted to
the parliamentary speaker.  However, the Constitutional Tribunal has
already ruled that some of the provisions of the deputies' bill
contravene the constitution.  These include the provision making the
privatization of strategic industries dependent on the consent of
parliament.

Another commitment made by the government before the presidential
election was that the privatization of the State Airline LOT would be
ready by the end of this year.  Under the privatization scheme being
prepared by a ministerial committee, the state treasury will retain a
51% stake in LOT and another 20% would be sold on "easy terms" to LOT
employees.

LOT's fleet currently comprises four Boeing 767, 10 Boeing 737 and
seven ATR-72 aircraft.  In 1994, the company carried 1,583,000
passengers, 14% more than in 1993.

Unemployment
In an effort to tackle the unemployment time bomb (see Social
Conditions above), the government approved a draft program for job
creation last November, which unlike the current program, focuses on
eliminating the sources of unemployment, rather than alleviating its
effects.  Its overall aim is to achieve an unemployment rate of 8% by
the year 2000.

Funding for the new program is put at ZL9,000 billion this year,
ZL3,000 billion more than last year.  The additional funds will come
from cutting expenditure on unemployment benefits, which at used up
about 88% of the Labor Fund in 1995.  It is expected unemployment
benefit this year will be linked to minimum pay, rather than to
average pay as has been the case up to now.  The actual level will be
around 88% of minimum pay.

The new program also proposes, for the first time, that unemployment
benefit will be withheld or reduced when an unemployed person refuses
the offer of a job for which he or she is qualified.  Under the
existing system, an unemployed person can refuse up to two job offers
without giving any reason.  From this year school leavers will
receive scholarships for active job seeking and training rather than
automatic benefits.

In order to help in job creation, state support will be given to set
up special economic zones with concessions for investors and
entrepreneurs.  Favorable terms will apply for people starting up new
businesses.  The budget will also help finance regional restructuring
programs and investment projects in areas with high structural
unemployment.

Mining Restructuring
In November last, the government promised there would no mass layoffs
as a result of its plan to restructure the coal mining industry.  The
plan provides for reducing employment by 90,000 miners in the years
1996 through to 2000.  However, miners were assured that 56,000 of
these jobs would disappear through the normal process of retirement,
while the remaining redundancies would be cushioned.

The five-year restructuring plan is designed to put the industry on a
sound economic footing by cutting costs and improving productivity.

Meanwhile, the government has stressed that lignite and hard coal
will remain Poland's main energy sources until the year 2010 despite
the planned increase in the share of gas in energy production.  At
present 43% of energy is produced from lignite, the cheapest source
of energy with prices of up to ZL25 (about US$10) per tonne.  Lignite
resources are estimated at 228 billion tonnes with an annual
extraction rate of 100 million tonnes.

POLAND
FINANCE

Deputy prime minister and finance minister, Grzegorz Kolodko,
prsented the budget bill to parliament on November 22.  This is the
third draft budget to take account of the government's "Strategy for
Poland" program.  The declared aim of the budget is to maintain a
high rate of economic growth, curb inflation, improve living
conditions, increase individual incomes and improve the efficiency of
public services.

Budget funds are increased in real terms, but are not sufficient to
cover all the needs.  Thus, certain areas are prioritized. - public
security, education , restructuring of the countryside, the reform of
the health service, housing construction and culture.

According to the draft budget, the deficit is not to exceed 2.8% of
GDP, while inflation is targeted to fall to 17%.

Japanese Guarantees
In November, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and
Industry announced that Japan has resumed granting guarantees for
exports and investments to Poland.  The decision was made because
Poland has started to fulfill the three conditions for restoring the
guarantees: regular repayment of interests on debts, maintaining good
relations with creditor countries and the International Monetary
Fund; and stabilizing its economic situation.

Japan suspended commercial guarantees for Poland in April 1991
because of the country's growing foreign debt.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
POLITICS

Prime Minister Meciar's vendetta against President Kovac continues
apace.  So far, however, and to the increasing irritation of the
premier, the president remains in place.  The problem for Meciar is
that he is running out of ammunition.  He has managed to get a
no-confidence vote in the president passed in parliament by virtue of
the simple majority held by his coalition.  However, this still falls
short of the majority required, as all the opposition parties support
Kovac's continuation in office. President Kovac can only be dismissed
by three-fifths of the votes in parliament, i.e. 90 out of the 150
seats.  The government coalition does not have that number.

Confounded in that direction, Meciar has also tried to bring Kovac
down by establishing a parliamentary commission to investigate his
role in bringing down his government in March 1994.  With the
commission packed with his own supporters, it could be counted on to
bring in a damaging enough critique of the president for his
impeachment to be sought.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled in November that such
commissions are unconstitutional on the grounds that the 1989 law
under which commissions are empowered prevents them from starting a
criminal prosecution or obliging people to give evidence at public
hearings.

This is a major blow to the Meciar government, which has set up three
parliamentary commissions, the first, established on  November 3,
1994, the day after Meciar was returned to power, was to look into
President Kovac's role on the earlier dismissal of the Meciar
government; the second was to look into the election lists of the
opposition Democratic Union (DU), whose creation precipitated the
fall of that government, with the aim of excluding it from
parliament; the third, also designed to embarrass the opposition, was
to look at the sale of army pontoons to India; and the fourth, an
investigation into in the car crash in which Alexander Dubcek was
killed in 1992.

All will now have to be wound up.

There has also been the curious case of the kidnapping of the
president's son, Michal Kovac junior.  Although little is currently
known of the detail of this case, it is not beyond the realms of
possibility that this too was part of a plot to discredit Kovac
senior.

The bare bones are as follows: In 1994, Peter Krylov, a Slovak who
had become a German national and who headed a Slovak company called
Technopol was found guilty of fraudulently removing US$2.3 million
from it.  On August 31 last year, Michal Kovac junior was abducted
and taken to Vienna, Austria.  After his arrival, Krylov claimed that
Kovac junior was a partner to the fraud.  Although he made no mention
of Kovac during his trial in 1994, Krylov said that the fraud arose
when Kovac, representing his own company, called Sycko, presented
Technopol with a fraudulent trade deal.

Kovac junior, now released by his captors, but remaining safely in
Vienna, has refuted all the allegations and has claimed that he had
never met Krylov and never discussed any deal with him.  It then
transpired that one of the men involved in his kidnapping was an
agent of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS), known publicly only
by the name, Oskar F.  The man ultimately in charge of the SIS is, of
course, Prime Minister Meciar.  Despite the weight of evidence
against Oskar F., President Kovac pardoned him from all criminal
charges on November 29.  Was this in return for Oskar F. Disclosing
the full background to the kidnapping?  If so, some very interesting
information may be about to unfold.

With all these various avenues of bringing down the president
apparently blocked or stalled, Prime Minister Meciar is being forced
to consider the final arrow in his quiver - his long-standing threat
to call a referendum on Michal Kovac's fitness to be president.  But
this remains fraught with risk for the premier.  Despite all he has
done to denigrate the president, weaken his powers and diminish his
office - government formulated cut-backs in budget allocations to the
president's office have already forced the sacking of over 40
presidential staff - the people of Slovakia stubbornly continue to
give a higher approval rating to their president than to their
premier.  If Meciar were to call a referendum and lose, his position
would become near untenable.

Racial/Ethnic Tension
Meanwhile, the government has managed to create yet another
confrontation with the European Union and the USA, as well as with
Hungary and part of its own opposition, over its attitude to
Slovakia's Hungarian minority.  The specific point of issue was the
passing by parliament on November 15 of the long debated Language
Law.  A total of 108 of the 142 parliamentary deputies voted in favor
of the law.  All 17 of the deputies belonging to the Hungarian
Coalition voted against, while 17 deputies - all deputies of the
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), plus Lubomir Ftacnik of the
Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) and Viliam Vaskovic of the
Democratic Union - abstained.

At the same time, parliament notably failed to approve the
Slovak-Hungarian basic treaty, which is supposed to form the basis
for good relations and cooperation between the two states.

The Language Law stipulates that Slovak is the only state language in
the republic and orders all state employees to speak Slovak and that
all newspapers and periodicals must be published in the state
language.  Also, all public ceremonies, except weddings, must be
conducted exclusively in the Slovak language. That part of the law
stipulating these obligations came into force on January 1, 1996,
while the section of the law regarding fines and other sanctions for
failure to meet the obligations will become effective on January 1,
1997.

Slovakia's Hungarian minority, which has been campaigning against the
law throughout 1995, sees it as a direct attack on its status and
culture.  However, during the months of national debate on the issue,
the government did promise that the Language Law would be accompanied
by additional legislation guaranteeing support for minority languages
and determining their use in official contacts.  Significantly, this
accompanying legislation was not presented to parliament with the
basic Language Law.

Hungary withdrew its ambassador in protest and raised the matter at
the 47th plenary assembly of the permanent Council of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  On
November 16 the EU parliament passed a resolution condemning the
legislation and warned Slovakia that it must show greater respect for
human rights and democracy or EU aid may have to be suspended.  The
USA issued a note to similar effect.

One would have thought that having provoked earnest criticism both
inside and outside the country, the government would have taken a
conciliatory and assuring tone.  Not a bit of it.  Referring to the
EU resolution as a "demarche" of the kind used by Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union against its neighbors, Prime Minister Meciar said
that Slovakia would never succumb to such threats and that businesses
would be compensated for any losses should the EU's PHARE program to
Slovakia be canceled.

To add even more heat to the fire, SNS deputy Vitazoslav Moric said
that political parties specifically representing Hungarian interests
should be banned and that the Language Law should be used to
counteract the "disproportionate" number of Hungarian schools in the
south of the country.  When asked what would happen to the Hungarian
press from January 1 this year - when all publications are supposed
to be in Slovak - Moric said "there will be no Hungarian press".

Corruption in Government
Meanwhile, the opposition has gone onto the attack, accusing members
of the government of corrupt practices in the implementation of its
privatization program.  One of the first acts of the Meciar
government was to throw out the privatization program produced by its
predecessor and replace it with one of its own.  It then allegedly
packed the Privatization Ministry, the National Property Fund and the
Supreme Supervisory Bureau - the bodies responsible for the program -
with people belonging to or supporting the three coalition parties,
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Association
of Slovak Workers (ZRS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS).

At the end of November, Mikulas Dzurinda, the deputy chairman of
opposition the Christian-Democratic Movement (KDH), accused ZRS
leader, Jan Luptak, of exercising undue influence on the
privatization process in order to enrich himself and his family, and
other government ministers and their families.  He also accused the
government of selling off state assets to family and friends at a
fraction of their real value.

Dzurinda claimed, for example, that the new private sector owners of
Slovnaft paid down only 1.56% of the company's shares nominal value,
2.35% for Duslo Sala (a chemical plant), 2.75% for the Vysne Ruzbachy
spa, and 0.06% in the privatization of the Zvolen Meat Processing
Plant.  The new owners, said Dzurinda, are now able to sell the
companies abroad and divide the profits on a 50:50 basis - one half
to partial sponsors and one half to their own pockets.

The same cry has been taken up by Peter Weiss, chairman of the
opposition Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), who accused the
government of creating a "privatization sleaze".  He said it was a
scandal that only nine men at the Natinal Property Fund (FNM) are
responsible for privatization decisions and that there is clear
evidence that state assets are being sold off at below market value.
Moreover, he added, privatization is benefiting literally only a few
hundred people.  As a result, a "clientist" political system is being
created in which economic and political power are being welded
together.

At the same time, the opposition parties have demanded an
investigation into whether the former SNS deputy chairman and present
director of Slovenska Poistovna (the Slovak Insurance Company), Peter
Sokol, also has a 25% share in the company which seeking to acquire
it under the privatization program. If so, he would make a clear
profit of Scr5 million (US$170,000) in dividends from the deal.  They
have also asked for an investigation into the high monthly income of
the SNS chairman, Jan Slota.

Questions have also been raised about ministers leaving government to
step straight in to top jobs in state companies on the privatization
list.  In November Marian Mojzis, the State Secretary in the Economy
Ministry, became director-general of the Petrimex joint-stock
company.  He was replaced as Secretary by his adviser, Pavol Hrmo.

Social Conditions
Prime Minister Meciar's peculiar method of governance is clearly
having an impact on the people's perceptions of democracy in action
as opposed to their counterparts in the Czech Republic, according to
a survey conducted in the middle of last year by the Sociological
Institute of the Czech Academy of Science and the Center of Empirical
Researches (STEM).

In answer to the question, "Were people like you better off before
1989?", (i.e. under communism) only 47% of Czechs answered yes,
compared with 73% of Slovaks.  In addition, of the respondents, 75%
of  Czechs believe that the freedom of the individual has increased
since 1989, while the figure for Slovaks was only 54%.  The Czechs
also tend to hold the view that at present they are given better
opportunities to upgrade their standard of living, while Slovaks tend
to believe that these opportunities were better before 1989.

The overall atmosphere in society was valued negatively by 60% of
Czechs and 70% of Slovaks.  More than 90% of those polled in both
countries have noticed deepening social inequalities.

An average Czech has an almost casual approach to unemployment,
believing that sooner or later he or she will be able to get a job
near home.  By contrast, unemployed Slovaks are willing to move to
find a job.  While the unemployment rate slipped under 3% in the
Czech Republic in September, the figure for Slovakia stood at around
13%.

Political Party Developments
At the end of November, Peter Weiss, the chairman of the Party of the
Democratic Left (SLD), which he formed out of the old Communist
Party, announced that he would not seek re-election as chairman, but
would continue to aid the party in a private capacity.

The party only just managed to get into parliament at the last
election and Weiss's leadership has come under a good deal of
internal criticism.

Meanwhile, Jan Langos was elected chairman of the Democratic Party
(DS) at the party's Congress on November 18 with 167 of the 221
votes.  His opponent, the former chairman, Peter Osusky, received 46
votes.

New Borders
The negotiation of new border agreements with the country's
neighbors, necessitated by the separation from the Czech Republic on
January 1, 1993, are nearing completion.  The only borders to undergo
actual changes are with the Czech Republic and Hungary, and involve
452 and 209 hectares respectively.  The changes in the course of the
Slovak-Hungarian border are due to the beds of the Ipel, Slana and
Roznava rivers gradually changing their course since 1965.  The
Slovak-Hungarian agreement is apparently ready for approval.

Under the new agreements, Slovakia's borders measure 1,714.61
kilometers.  The longest section is the Hungarian border (678
kilometers), followed by Poland (547.1 kilometers), Austria (109 km),
and Ukraine (98.5 km)  The Slovak-Czech border is 285 km long, but
will be 33.21 kilometers less  after the new agreement is passed.

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
ECONOMY

Industrial output in September 1995 was 13.2% higher than in
September 1994, according to data from the Slovak Statistical Office.
In the first nine months of the year, the total output of Slovakia's
manufacturing industry, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was
8.4% higher than in the same period of 1994 and amounted to Scr362.2
billion.

The construction industry's output in September 1995 was up by 1.7%
on September 1994.  In the first nine months of 1995 the construction
industry's output rose by about 3.9% on the same period of 1994 and
the industry's projects were worth about Scr36.3 billion.

Farming enterprises' turnover in September 1995, calculated at
current prices without corn for seed and seedlings, was 7.9% down on
the same period of 1994.  In the nine-month period, farmers earned
Scr21.6 billion, excluding corn for seed and seedlings, and their
sales were 3% up on the same period of 1994.  Although there was a
1.4% decline in crop production, this was offset by a 5.2% growth in
the sale of animal products.

Retail trade, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was 16.6%
higher in September 1995 than in September 1994.  In the first nine
months, retail sales amounted to Scr199.4 billion, a rise of 19.9% on
the same period of 1994.  The retail trade annual rise, calculated at
inflation-adjusted prices, amounted to 8.1%.

Private businesses accounted for 63.7% of the manufacturing industry
output and for 80.6% of the
construction industry output.

The draft budget for 1996 (see FINANCE section below) projects a GDP
growth this year of at least 5%, with inflation falling to 6-8%.

Unemployment
Unemployment remains a pressing concern.  The unemployment rate did
fall to 12.8% in October last, the first time it had been below 13%
since the end of 1994.  In the month there were 82,472 unemployed
people receiving state support in the month, 1,942 less than in
September.  Of the unemployed people 53.1% were women, 7.7% people
with limited ability to work and 18.3% school leavers.  There were
325,490 registered job seekers in the month.

Although the current unemployment rate compares favorably with the
majority of the other former Comecon countries in Eastern Europe, it
is embarrassingly high compared with the Czech Republic, the only
comparison that counts for most Slovaks.  In an attempt to ensure
that the rate continues to move downward through 1996, the government
is to introduce a new system of unemployment benefits this year.

The old system of a single benefit scheme for all registered
unemployed people has been replaced by a two-tier system to
distinguish between those who are not to blame for losing their jobs
and who want to work and those who do not want to work.  This will be
coupled with a change in social policy through the introduction of a
"poverty" level in addition to the existing "subsistence" level.  The
poverty level will be considerably lower than the subsistence level
and will be applied to those who refuse to accept a job.

Inward Investment
The total volume of foreign investments in Slovak companies had
reached Scr19.8 billion (US$660.8 million) by the end of September
1995, a 12.8% increase since the end of July.  Foreign capital was
invested in 8,469 companies, with the largest volumes going to
industry, trade, financing and insurance companies.

The most important investors, investing over Scr1 billion, were from
the following countries (ranked according to volume of investment):
Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, France and Great
Britain.  The situation in foreign investments during the third
quarter of 1995 was influenced by the establishment of three branches
of foreign banks in Bratislava, the Austrian Bank Austria (name as
received), the Czech Komercni Banka and the US Citibank, with
contributions of British capital.

Gas Pipeline
It was agreed in November that the new pipeline to carry gas from the
Yamal deposit in northern Russia via Belarus and Poland to Germany
will incorporate a branch line to Slovakia.  The line, which will run
for 233 kilometers from Poland will probably be built by a
Slovak-Russian joint venture.

The Russian gas company involved, GAO Gazprom, also showed interest
in extending the current transit gas pipeline from Slovakia via
Hungary and Slovenia to Italy.  Slovakia will buy 5.1 million tonnes
of Russian crude oil next year.  In addition, Russia has reportedly
agreed to supply Slovakia with natural gas from Turkmenistan through
its gas system.

Coal Industry Privatization
Prime Minister Meciar said in November that the coal mining and the
coal engineering industry in
Slovakia's most important coal region, Horne Ponitrie (the Upper
Nitra region), will be privatized.  He said that in line with
election promises, mine employees and Prievidza citizens would be
able to purchase the region's collieries for a nominal one Slovak
crown.

The mine employees and the citizens of Prievidza will receive state
privatization bonds which they will be able to exchange shares.  The
privatization of the region's engineering industry, due to be
implemented concurrently with the privatization of coal mining, will
be treated separately and with a different legal method.

The Horne Ponitrie region is suffering from an overall decline in
production due to the slow transformation and decline in the coal
mining industry.  As a result unemployment in the region has soared
and now stands at around 9,240.

State Railway
The state-owned Slovak Railways is expected to have incurred a loss
of around Scr3 billion last year from its passenger services.  The
government will only cover up to Scr1.73 billion of this loss due to
limited resources in the state budget.  Slovak Railways expect that a
similar situation will also arise this year when the costs of
operating passenger transport will be Scr5.051 billion, while sales
will only reach Scr1.63 billion.   However, the state is committed to
covering only Scr2.03 billion of the expected Scr3.42 billion loss,
according to the proposed budget for 1996.

Railway passengers in Slovakia now only pay 43% of the real cost of
transport.  The real cost per person per kilometer is Scr1.16, but
passengers pay only Scr0.50.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
FINANCE

Finance minister Sergej Kozlik has predicted that the budget deficit
for 1995 will be much lower than forecast.  In late November the
deficit stood at Scr7 billion, compared with a target figure of Scr27
billion for the year as a whole.  Kozlik said that the reason for the
lower budget deficit was the fact that only 86% of the planned
budgetary expenditure had been used and that 93% of the planned
revenues had been collected.

1996 Budget
The draft budget for 1996 approved by the government in November
projects a deficit of Scr27 billion, with revenues put at Scr162.4
billion and expenditures at Scr189.4 billion. that debt repayment
spending will be Scr19 billion this year, the fiscal position of the
state budget means a deficit of 1.5% of GDP.

The budget makes no provision for rent, fuel or energy price rises
this year as part of the government's policy of bearing down on
inflation.  The inflation rate has followed a downward trend of late,
falling from 9.8% year-on-year in August to 7.9% year-on-year in
October.

As part of the inflation strategy, parliament approved a new price
law in November, which gives the Finance Ministry and local
authorities at district and regional levels the right to regulate the
prices of goods and commodities.  The new law enables state officials
to regulate prices in cases of "economically justified" costs or
"adequate profits".

Critics claim that the law could lead to a situation where the state
would be in charge of price setting.  The opposition argued that the
law was only just within the bounds of the market economy system
because it empowered state officials to decide on the "adequacy" of
prices, costs and profits.

However, spending on the intelligence service (SIS) is to rise by 50%
to Scr760 million (US$29 million).  The money allotted to the
government will more than double, from Scr150 million in 1995 (US$5.8
million) to Scr414 million (Scr15.9 million).

On the other hand, the President's Office will again receive less,
Scr97 million (US$3.7 million) as against Scr121 million (US$4.65
million) in 1995.  All part of Prime Minister Meciar's strategy to
curtail and diminish the presidency by whatever means available.

Foreign Trade
A surplus of Scr3.5 billion was recorded on the balance of foreign
trade in the first 10 months of last year.  Exports were worth
Scr210.7 billion, an increase of Scr37.6 billion or 21.7% on the same
period of 1994.  Imports were worth Scr207.2 billion, an increase of
Scr35.8 billion or 20.9% on the same period of 1994.

The largest share of exports went to the Czech Republic (35.4%),
Germany (18.9%), Austria (5%), Italy (4.7%), Hungary (4.6%), Poland
(4.4%), the Russian Federation (3.6%), Ukraine (2.1%), France (2%)
and the Netherlands (1.7%).

Exports to the EU countries went up by Scr18.5 billion (30.5%) and
made up 37.6% of total exports.  Exports to the OECD countries were
up Scr18.5 billion (27.4%) compared with the same period last year
and constituted 40.9% of total exports.

Imports mainly came from the Czech Republic (28.1%), the Russian
Federation (16.8%), Germany (14.3%), Austria (5.2%), Italy (4.5%),
Poland (2.9%), the USA and France (each 2.3%), Hungary (2.2%), the
Netherlands (1.7%) and Ukraine (1.5%).

A total of 34.5% of Slovak imports came from EU countries, which is
Scr15.2 billion (27%) more than in the first 10 months of 1994.  The
share of imports from OECD countries stood at 40.9%, an increase of
Scr18 billion (26.9%) compared with the same period of 1994.

Reserves
The Slovak National Bank's currency reserves stood at nearly US$3
billion at the end of October, US$900 million of which had been
accumulated during the first half of 1995.

The hard currency reserves of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)
amounted to US$3,045 million on November 20, an increase of US$1.3
billion compared to the reserves held on January 1, 1995.

The sum total of hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia
amounted to US$4.55 billion on November 20, of which all commercial
banks in Slovakia held US$1.55 billion.  According to the 1994 Annual
Report of the NBS, at the end of December 1994 the NBS's hard
currency reserves stood at US$1,745 million.  The sum total of the
hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia amounted to
US$3,093 million, of which all commercial banks held US$1,348
million.

Banking sector
The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) announced last year that almost
half of all loans extended by Slovak banks will not be repaid in
their full nominal value.  The total volume of the loans extended by
Slovak banks by the end of August last year amounted to Scr276.2
billion.  About Scr130 billion of this sum or 47% are presumed to be
doubtful loans, which are unlikely to be repaid in full, while some
Scr86 billion of these loans are considered as bad or
"irrecoverable".

If these estimates are correct, the total volume of doubtful loans is
almost as big as the state budget revenues or nearly 30% of
Slovakia's annual GDP.  The three biggest Slovak banks, which jointly
hold about 70% of all loans, also hold 90% of doubtful and bad loans.
These are:  Vseobecna Uverova Banka (the General Credit Bank),
Slovenska Sporitelna (the Slovak Savings Bank), and Investicna a
Rozvojova Banka (the Investment and Development Bank).

According to an NBS analysis, the assets of the biggest Slovak banks
are Scr19 billion below the level required to cover their risks.  The
Finance Ministry believes that the current high interest margins and
the new income tax law, due to give a boost to the process of risk
assets creation, should help the banks accumulate more risk assets.

Although banking sector representatives accept this argument, they
say that other legislative steps will have to follow that would
address the companies' problems as well as the bad loans problem.

EBRD Credit
In November, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) and the Slovak commercial bank Istrobanka have signed an
agreement on the opening of a DM30 million credit line for
Istrobanka, making it Slovak commercial bank, after Tatra Banka and
Polnobanka, to be selected by EBRD as its partner for providing
investment loans.

The money drawn from this credit line will be used for private sector
projects.  Istrobanka's clients will have a chance of receiving a
credit ranging from DM0.5- 8 million per project on the estimated
repayment period between seven and eight years.

IRAN
POLITICS

Attention is now concentrated on the parliamentary (Majlis) elections
set for March 8, 1996.  This has already led to some concerted
criticism of the power of the clergy in politics and, in early
October, to student demonstrations in Tehran university.  Details of
the incident, or incidents, are patchy, but it appears that students
sympathetic to the Hezbollahi staged some sort of demonstration in a
lecture hall, which then got out of hand.

In any event, this election will be a critical one for President
Rafsanjani and his reformist government.  Parliamentary elections in
Iran are complicated by the fact that the country has had no
nationally organized political parties since 1987.  This gives rise
to a large number of candidates standing as independents - typically
some 1,500 candidates compete for the 270 parliamentary seats.  With
Islam being the most pervasive national organization, this system
tends to favor religious candidates with strong local support.

Without the discipline of party ideology or membership, such
candidates are likely to be far more responsive to clerical or
popular opinion than they are to the government.  As a result, the
government's parliamentary support can become extremely fragile.

And that is the problem now.  With the massive contraction in
economic growth and high inflation, Rafsanjani's popularity is on a
long downward track.  This was shown in the last presidential
election in 1993, when support for Rafsanjani fell sharply.  However,
Rafsanjani's government was still fairly safe as its supporters
formed the largest bloc in the Majlis after the April 1992
parliamentary election with around 110 seats.  With the remaining
seats split between the antipathetic religious and, for want of a
better description, left-of-center candidates, the government has
been able to get support for its legislation  by playing one group
off against the other.

This time around there appears to be a real risk that religious
candidates will make significant advances at the expense of those
candidates supporting the government.  This, perhaps, is the real
reason behind the recent attacks on "politicized" clerics and
President Rafsanjani's call in a radio and television interview in
November for the formation of political parties rather than the
current "interest" groups that contest elections.

Rafsanjani argued that "serious" nationally based political parties
are essential in a political system that employs an electoral system
and that if any single party obtained a majority in parliament it
should form the government.  The statement was generally welcomed,
though many have also pointed out that this is not the first time a
call for the formation of political parties has been made since the
Islamic Republic Party stopped functioning in 1987.

To the surprise of many, the death sentence imposed on Fazel Khodadad
for his part in the Ir1,230 billion embezzlement at Bank Saderat was
carried out on November 22.  In all 20 people were arrested on the
embezzlement charges in the summer, but it was thought that Khodadad
was too highly placed to suffer the punishment meted out by the
court.  Two others were sentenced to life imprisonment and six to
long-term jail terms and cash fines.

Tehran Oil Conference
The successful holding of the international oil and gas conference in
November was hailed by the government as the decisive indicator of
the failure of the US oil trade embargo. The aim of the conference
was to brief foreign companies interested in taking part in the 11
projects being opened to foreign investment in the current five year
plan period.

Representatives from 123 international oil companies and 20 Iranian
companies attended the conference.  The size of the foreign
attendance has been taken by the government as the strongest possible
indicator that non-US oil companies will tender for the projects on a
buy-back basis and that its planned development of its oil and gas
sector will not be pushed off track by the US embargo.

Of the 11 projects, five are offshore.  They comprise the development
of the South Pars gas field, a the injection of gas into the Dorud
oil field, the development of the Khaf gas reservoir in the Salman
field, the development of the new Belal oil field, and the
reconstruction of installations and enhancement of the Sorush oil
field.

The on shore projects comprise a gas condensate refinery in Bandar
Abbas, a project for the Shiraz refinery, the construction of a gas
condensate recovery system at Lavan island, the construction of gas
and liquefied natural gas plants in southern Iran, and a project for
the collection of oil field gases in the south.

Foreign Relations
Pakistan
Although an official visit to Tehran by Prime Minister Bhutto has
served to put a stamp on the increasingly close relations between
Pakistan and Iran, a potential source of discord is beginning to
appear.  It seems that the two countries are supporting opposing
sides in the conflict in Afghanistan.  Relations between Pakistan and
the government of Afghanistan are already under pressure following
Afghani government allegations that Prime Minister Bhutto's
government is supporting the Taleban forces ranged against it.  This
has been denied by Pakistan and was denied again by Prime Minister
Bhutto during her visit to Iran.

However, Iran has consistently supported the government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.  Moreover, shortly before Prime Minister
Bhutto's visit, the Taleban forces officially complained that Iran
was training Afghan government troops in Iran.  Iran has also been
accused of allowing Afghan government forces to operate from Iranian
territory to launch operations aimed at liberating the town of Herat.
This has been denied by Iran, but the fact that the sympathies of the
two new partners clearly lie with opposing factions could prove to be
a problem in the future.

Iraq
Iranian involvement in Iraqi Kurdistan is growing, to anger of the
Iraqi government and exasperation of the USA.  After the failure of
the peace conference between the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions -
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) -  in Dublin, Iran hosted another meeting between the two in
Tehran in October, and achieved at least a partial agreement.

To make matters worse, reports surfaced in November that Iran had
armed and dispatched units of Iraqi Shi'is to the Kurdish-inhabited
areas of Iraq in order to launch attacks against the Baghdad
government with the backing of the Iraqi National Congress. The units
are reportedly from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade, and have
been deployed around Sulaymaniyah. (For further details see the Iraq
report in this issue.)

United Arab Emirates
Four day long talks between expert teams from Iran and the UAE in
Doha, UAE, over competing territorial claims ended in failure in
November.  The dispute between the two countries centers around the
Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands
(Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra).

The islands are claimed by Iran, particularly Abu Musa, which was
occupied by Britain when it was the colonial power in the region.
However, when Britain left the island in 1971 it did not hand it over
to Iran but to the UAE.  The meeting apparently broke down when the
two sides failed even to agree on its agenda - Iran wanted to discuss
the administration of Abu Musa, while the UAE wanted to press its
sovereignty claim.

Iran has invited the UAE to hold to next round of talks in Tehran.
Currently, the UAE is resisting this and no announcement has been
made as to when the next round of talks will be held.

Turkmenistan
Iran and Tukmenistan have agreed on a series of military cooperation
measures, including joint exercises, following the first visit to
Turkmenistan by an Iranian military delegation in November.
Agreement has also been reached on Iranian and Turkmen border guards
working together to prevent violations of the common border

Japan
Iran is concerned over US pressure on Japan not to make payment of
the second installment of a loan agreed in April 1991.  Under the
terms of the deal, Japan undertook to contribute N150 trillion in
loans for construction f the Karun-4 dam in Iran's southern province
of Khuzestan.  In May 1993, Japan made a first installment of N38.6
billion (US$400 million) on the project.  However, it has not yet
paid the remainder.

Pressure is now on Iran as it needs the remainder of the loan to be
paid now if it is to complete the project by the target date of 2000.
Iran believes that the USA is putting strong pressure on Japan not to
pay the second installment and to cut back its trade with Iran.

IRAN
FINANCE

President Rafsanjani presented the budget for the year March 21,
1996-March 20, 1997 on November 26.  This second annual budget in the
second five-year development plan (1995-1999) totals Ir138,133.4
billion, an increase of 43.8% on the 1995/96 budget.  However, with
inflation running at over 50%, the budget represents a cut back in
spending in real terms.

The government's general budget was put at Ir60,742.3 billion, a
30.9% increase on 1995/96.

The budget for state-owned companies, profit-making institutes
affiliated to the government and banks is forecast at Ir90,248.4
billion, up 41% on 1995/96.  Of this figure, Ir79,928.4 billion
belonged to state-owned companies, Ir1,935.7 billion to profit-making
institutions affiliated to the government, and Ir8,384.3 billion to
banks.

Total revenues are put at Ir54,369.3 billion, an increase of 28.5%.
Some 51.5% of the total comes from oil income, 19.6% from tax income,
and 28.9% from other revenue sources.

Of the total revenue for the government, 25.5% will come from taxes
on oil and gas, electricity, posts and telecommunications services,
29.2% from hard currency sales, 34% from income-expenditure items and
11.3% from other items.

The increase in tax incomes is mainly due to a rise in taxes levied
on non-governmental companies, on jobs and on imports, which will
accrue through the improvement in the country's economy and the
expansion of trade and manufacturing in the domestic economy.

Crude oil production capacity is targeted to reach 4,250,000 b/d, and
gas production by 110 million cu.m/day.  The capacity of Bandar Abbas
refinery is to be raised to 232,000 b/d.  The oil price has been set
at US$15.5/bbl in the budget to produce a total government revenue of
some US$15.5 billion.  However, as the current oil price is around
US$16/bbl, there is a likelihood that actual revenue will be above
the budget figure.

Current expenditure is put at Ir31,934.7 billion, up by 15%. Rises in
the salaries of civil servants, transfer payments and grants amount
to Ir10.950 billion and account for 20% of the government's total
general budget.

Current expenditures on defense, education and training, health care,
and social security have risen sharply.  Defense expenditure is
slated to increase by 30.7%, from this year, to Ir5,900 billion,
while spending on education and training is to rise by 41.7% to
Ir5,256 billion and spending on health care by 11.2% to Ir18,965
billion.  On the other hand, current expenditures for importing oil
products have been cut by 27.8% due to the success of consumption
reduction policies.

Development credits are to rise by 53% to Ir22,684 billion in the
next financial year.  This will bring the ratio of development
expenditures to the government's total general budget to 42% from
34.8% in the current budget.

A number of industrial projects are due to go on stream next year,
including eight food and pharmaceutical plants with 50,000 ton
capacity, chemical plants with a total capacity of 342,000 tons,
metallurgical plants with 20,000 tons capacity, a lamp manufacturing
plant, two automobile spare parts plants, and six non-metals plants
with an annual capacity of 4.7 million tons.

On infrastructure, 2,300 kilometers of roads and 800 kilometers of
railway will be brought into service, including the 165 kilometer
Mashhad-Sarakhs line designed to link the Iranian railway to the
Central Asian network.  Cargo transportation volume is expected to
reach 25.5 million tons compared with 23 million tons this year.
A total of 450,000 new telephone lines are to be installed to bring
the number of villages connected to the national telephone network to
2,220.  Mobile telephone usage is also expected to increase.

In the cooperatives sector, the government is to help set up 3,600
cooperatives with a membership of 319,600 to bring 850 projects into
operation, creating 45,460 new jobs with an investment of Ir3,356
billion, which in turn will enable the building of 70,000 residential
houses.

In the farming sector red meat production is forecast to rise to
685,000 tons, poultry to 660,000 tons, fish to 450,000 tons, milk to
4.7 million tons and total protein from livestock and fisheries to
7.17 million tons.

The budget for state companies, banks and profit-making institutions
affiliated to the government is put at Ir90,284 billion, accounting
for 65.3% of the total budget.

To cater for the needs of the poor, the budgets of organizations
responsible for supporting this group have been increased from
Ir1,243 billion to Ir1,656 billion.  With the rise in the budget set
aside to support the poor, some 1.3 million families consisting of
4.5 million people will come under the government's support.  Of the
funds allocated to elimination of deprivation, Ir76 billion will be
spent on implementing self-employment projects.

Credits allocated to provinces for the year will be Ir2,492.2
billion, 16.2% up.  This money will be spent on education, health
care and infrastructure needs in such as road building, supply of
electricity and drinking water, and production facilities for rural
areas.

Credits earmarked to the deprived regions are increased by 22% to
Ir600 billion. A total of 77% of the figure comes from the provincial
credits and the remaining 23% from the national budget.

Some Ir700 billion has been allocated to reconstruction projects and
compensation payments. Once this money is disbursed 85% of all
reconstruction projects will be completed.

On housing, the government is to provide 31 million sq.m of land for
building 93,000 residential units and will pay a part of the banking
charges on loans granted for buying houses as well as offering
banking subsidies to teachers.  The government will also boost
investment in housing through the formation of credit cooperatives
and housing investment companies.

IRAQ
POLITICS

The most intriguing feature of the national referendum on Saddam
Hussein' presidency on October 15 was not the 99.96% who voted in
favor, but the 0.04% who did not.  The regime says that 8,357,560
voted, of which 8,348,700 plumped for seven more years of Saddam
Hussein's leadership.  That means that 8,860 people either spoiled
their ballot papers or, heaven forfend, voted against.

When asked by a reporter who these dissenters might be an election
official ventured the opinion that they might be either mentally ill
or of criminal intent.  Well, mad or bad, they are certainly brave.
It is popularly said it only takes one brave man to make a
difference: Iraq seems to have at least over 8,000 of them.

Clearly buoyed up by the success of the referendum exercise,
President Hussein has announced that elections to the National
Assembly will be held early next year, possibly in February or March,
and carried out a limited reshuffle of his government on November 6.
Education Minister Hikmat Abdullah al-Bazzaz was made adviser at the
presidency and replaced as education minister by Abd al-Jabbar Tawfiq
Muhammad. Irrigation Minister Nizar Mum'ah was replaced by Housing
and Reconstruction Minister, Mahmud Dhiyab al-Ahmad, and Abd al-Ilah
Hamid Muhammad Salih was appointed minister of agriculture.

Finally, just to confirm that the people's love of President Hussein
is diminished only in so far as they also idolize his son, Uday
Saddam Hussein was unanimously reconfirmed as president of the
executive council of the National Union of Iraqi Students on November
29 and given the powers of the Union's general assembly.

In an "Alice in Wonderland" message to senior state officials on
November 5, President Hussein said that all people were equal before
the law, whether or not they were members of the Ba'th party and that
those who abused their positions to gain favors for their own or
their families' benefit were unfit to hold positions of
responsibility.

It would appear that the message was prompted by the fact that under
the UN sanctions corruption is getting out of control - out of the
control of the Hussein family that is.  In fact, corruption,
particularly in diverting humanitarian aid, had become so blatant
that the government was forced to cut down on the number of fingers
in the till.

The problem was that an investigation a few months ago not only
unearthed evidence of the activities of one particular group of
officials, but also, inadvertently, implicated two high-ranking
officials Major-General Najm al-din al-Naqshabandi, the former senior
undersecretary at the Ministry of Interior, and Major-General Hatim
Ali Khalaf, another former senior Interior Ministry official, as well
as a number of lesser mortals.

The problem for the regime in this is that the two generals are both
closely associated with it, particularly with President Saddam's son,
Uday.  Given that the group had set up a network of foreign agents to
help them launder the moneys gained from diverting funds, intended
for humanitarian purposes, from various international agencies, it
was presumably feared that if they were made to suffer in any way,
the foreign agents working for the two men might release information
that would not only implicate close members of the ruling family, but
also impede their continued personal access to such funds.

Against this background it came as no real surprise that the case
against the two generals never came to court.  In late November the
National Assembly, in a special vote, acquitted both of all charges.
Their less well-placed confederates, however, have all been sent to
trial on charges of illegal acquisition of land, cars and funds.
They are Major-General Hashim Muhammad Faraj, Major-General Wa'd
Mahmud Sulayman and Dr Majid Khurshid.

But the referendum, the promise of parliamentary elections and
fulminations against corruption change nothing.  The UN sanctions
remain in place and the regime is only able to hang on to power
through the its ruthless imposition of a police state and the
constant weeding out of anyone though to present even the slightest
risk.  This combination of privation due to sanctions and fear of
falling suspect produces a continuing stream of defections from the
army to the Kurdish zone in the north.

A group of high-ranking officers reportedly defected to northern Iraq
shortly before the presidential referendum.  It included one
brigadier-general, two colonels and a major.  One of the defectors is
Colonel Yusuf Khalaf Khaffaji, the commander of the Second Battalion
of Brigade 116.

Iraqi Kurdistan
The three northern provinces of Sulaymaniya, Arbil and Dohuk, which
form Iraqi Kurdistan and have been under UN protection in the form of
a no-fly zone since the 1991 Gulf war, continues to be riven by
feuding between the Kurds themselves.  However, just as the two main
Iraqi Kurdish groups - the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) - are inching towards settling their
differences, heavy fighting has broken out between the KDP and the
militant Turkish Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

KDP versus PUK
The KDP, which is led Mas'ud Barzani, occupies the western part of
Kurdistan and leans towards Turkey, while the PUK, which is led by
Jalal Talabani and occupies the southern part of the territory comes
under the influence of Iran.  The KDP is headquartered in the
hill-top town of Salahuddin, while the PUK has occupied the "capital"
of Kurdistan, Arbil.

The two groups have been fighting each other since 1994 when their
innate rivalry became uncontainable.  Its effect has been to destroy
the dream that the internationally observed elections in the region
in 1992 would lead to the establishment of a parliamentary democracy
in the region.  Instead it has only served to exacerbate the tribal,
linguistic and regional differences that Saddam Hussein exploited to
such effect in his efforts to break the back of Kurdish resistance.
Indeed, the KDP's West Kurdistan and the PUK's South Kurdistan have
virtually the same boundaries now as the old Kurdish principalities.

The fighting reached a peak in July, just before the two sides
attended US-sponsored peace talks in Dublin, when each launched
massive tit-for-tat attacks on the other's headquarters.  Hundreds
died for absolutely no gain.
However, the talks in Dublin, Ireland in August and September broke
down.  This failure opened the door for Iranian mediation, which led
to the holding of peace talks in Tehran between October 5-9.

To the USA's exasperation, these talks did actually produce a partial
agreement.  Most notably the PUK and KDP agreed to a cease-fire and,
in principle, set May 4, 1996 as the date for new elections.  Both
sides also agreed to accept the results of the election
unconditionally.

However, Iranian involvement went much further than this.   First,
the cease-fire is to be monitored by the Iranian controlled Supreme
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI).  Second, it was
also agreed Iraqi Shi'is located in Iran should participate in
Kurdish operations against Saddam Hussein's forces.  To this end,
Iran dispatched armed units of Iraqi Shi'is to Iraqi Kurdistan in
November.  According to an announcement from the Iraqi National
Congress, the units fare from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade,
and have been deployed around Sulaymaniyah.

The hand of Iran is also seen in the car bombing of the offices of
the main Iranian opposition group, the Mojahedin-e Khalq, in central
Baghdad on November 27.  The explosion damaged buildings and shops in
the area but caused no casualties.  The organization blamed the
Iranian embassy in Baghdad of being responsible for the explosion,
the 36th to target the center since 1993.

All this is anathema to the USA, which desperately wants to keep Iran
out of an increasingly fractious situation.  In an attempt to regain
the initiative it dispatched a delegation to Iraqi Kurdistan in
November under the leadership of Robert Deutsch, head of the northern
Persian Gulf desk at the US State Department.  Deutsch held separate
talks with both Barzani and Talabani, but it is not clear that any
concrete progress, over and above that already made in Tehran, was
achieved.

However, there are intimations that Deutsch found a more sympathetic
reception from Talabani than from Barzani.  If true, this could
complicate matters further as Talabani's PUK depends heavily on Iran,
while the KDP, at least for the moment, is more closely allied to the
West, in the form of Turkey, due to its ongoing battles with the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).  The difficulty for US mediation
efforts is that it is committed to maintaining the territorial
integrity of Iraq, while most Kurds, in both the KDP and PUK, want to
establish Iraqi Kurdistan as an independent sovereign state.

KDP versus PKK
To add to these troubles a virtual war has now sprung up between the
PKK and the KDP on the Iraqi Kurdistan side of the Iraqi-Turkish
border.  Conflict between the two organizations flared up after
Turkey's second cross-border assault on PKK positions in July.  The
PKK believes that the Turkish army received at least tacit support
from the KDP, which relies on Turkish government goodwill to for
maintaining its cross-border supplies.

When the Turkish troops withdrew, the PKK launched a series of
attacks on KDP positions.  The KDP counter-attacked in force in
September.  In the initial assaults it claimed to have killed or
injured more than 1,000 PKK members out of a force of 2,500 in one
area.

The KDP kept up its attacks on the PKK through October and November.
It its reports are to be believed the PKK has suffered heavy damage,
both in men and materiel.  Turkey has officially offered its
assistance to the KDP in its fight with the PKK.  The KDP maintains
that it has not accepted such support.  Whether or not this is true,
relations between the KDP and the Turkish government are, to say the
least, cordial.  The same cannot be said of the PUK which has
steadfastly refused to become what it calls a Turkish gendarmerie to
fight the PKK.

The leader of the PKK, Anbdullah Ocalan, who is based in Syria and
Jordan called for a cease-fire in early November, but when the KDP
called on his to surrender the fighting continued.

Jordan
Although political relations may have been strained by the defection
of Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother in August, it appears King
Hussein is not prepared to take risk with his economy by downgrading
trade links with Iraq, particularly with regard to oil.  On September
11, representatives of the two countries signed a memorandum of
understanding on oil issues in Baghdad, which will ensure that trade
relations between Jordan and Iraq will remain as tight as ever.

The memorandum not only contains an agreement to establish an
Iraqi-Jordanian company for oil studies and development, but
additional agreements to build a Jordanian-Iraqi refinery in Aqaba
and to construct an Iraqi pipeline to the Zarqa refinery in Jordan.

The Aqaba refinery is to have an initial capacity of 140,000 barrels
per day (b/d) with the option to increase this to 250,000 refined
b/d.  The projected capacity of the 600-km pipeline is put at an
initial 100,000 b/d, with the option to increase to 350,000 b/d in
the second stage.  The objective of the pipeline is to replace the
current system of road tanker transportation.  Currently the shipment
of Iraqi oil from Baghdad to the port of Aqaba employs 1,500 tanker
trucks.

In addition to these oil sector projects, discussions are also
underway on boosting cooperation in electricity generation and
distribution and in industrial cooperation in such sectors as
pharmaceuticals, canning and packaging, and engineering in general.

IRAQ
ECONOMY

The UN decision to maintain sanctions against Iraq despite the wealth
of new information on its various programs for "weapons of mass
destruction" handed over after the defection of the Kamel brothers
and the referendum of Saddam Hussein's presidency in October, is
extremely bad news for the people of Iran.

The impoverishment of the country already underway as a result of the
eight-year war with Iran, has accelerated under the UN sanctions.
While the GDP per head has plummeted, inflation has soared.  A kebab
which cost Id2 in 1990 now costs Id800.

According to the UN's World Food program in Baghdad, four million
people in the country are now short of food, while the rate of child
malnutrition in central and southern Iraq is now higher than in
Sudan.  Infant mortality has reportedly increased by more than 25% a
year.

However, with no progress in sight on Iraq being able to meet the
conditions for lifting the sanctions the UN aid agencies are finding
it increasingly difficult to get the donor countries to keep coughing
up the funds to maintain the population in its present parlous state.
In October the UN launched an appeal for US$183.3 million t fund
humanitarian programs in the country.  Although the sum asked for is
lower than previous requests the total has still not been met and
only 30% of the UN's funding requests have been raised since 1991.
The USA gives no aid to Iraq as a whole, but channels all that it
does give exclusively to the Kurdish controlled north.

So far Saddam Hussein has resisted taking the opt-out of UN
resolution 986 of April of this year, which allows Iraq to sell US$2
billion worth of oil over six months exclusively for humanitarian
purposes.  The regime has refused to take up the option on the
grounds that the close monitoring involved is an affront to its
sovereignty.  There must, however, be a question as to how much
longer the resistance can be maintained.

ON the other hand, if Iraq does decide to take advantage of
Resolution 986 it could cause sever problems for other oil producers,
particularly neighboring Gulf countries which are counting on the
recent firming of international oil prices to get their economies
back in shape.  At their recent meeting OPEC members decided to
maintain the current output limits in order to maintain prices at
their current level.

However, the input of Iraqi oil in the market could upset the
delicate price stability that has been achieved and drive prices
down.  As the Resolution is concerned with revenue rather than
quantity, any fall in prices would force Iraq to increase sales in
order to reach the target figure of US$1 billion every three months.
The increased output would have a further knock-on effect on prices
and could produce a downward price spiral.  While that would be good
news for the consumer countries - those most concerned with
maintaining the sanctions - it could have a disastrous effect on the
other oil producing countries in the region.

Meanwhile, the government is trying to make up for a shortage of
household gas in the coming winter.  In the first and second quarters
of 1995 production of domestic gas was around 3,400 tonnes a day.
The aim is to raise this to 4,600 tons a day in the final quarter of
the year.

But production is only part of the problem.  The gas has to be
transported to the gas bottle filling stations in the towns.  As a
result of the sanctions - with spare parts like tires and batteries
in short supply, transportation costs have soared.

ISRAEL
POLITICS

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Labor Party prime minister
only since 1992, was shot on the evening of November 4 while
attending a peace rally in Tel Aviv.  He died a short while later in
hospital.  His murderer was an Israeli Jew, Yigal Amir, a 27-year old
law student at Bar Ilan University and a member of Eyal, a militant
nationalist/religious group opposed to the peace process.

The murder of their prime minister by another Jew was not only a
physical blow against the governance of the state, but also a massive
psychological blow against the people at large.  In this single act,
Yigal Amir forced the Israeli people to admit that they too have been
as subverted by the struggle to retain the occupied territories as
have the Palestinian people in their effort to retrieve them.

This subversion probably began with the disastrous invasion of
Lebanon in June 1982, was compounded by the massive increase in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the same Likud government,
and reached its final expression in the massacre of Palestinians at
prayer in the mosque of the Cave of the Patriarchs by an American
immigrant settler, Baruch Goldstein, in February 1994.

What was palpably obvious, but never before admitted, was that the
militant Israeli groups that sprung up among the West Bank settlers
and their supporters in Israel proper was that they had the backing,
direct and indirect, of the Israeli government.  In confrontations
between the settlers and their Palestinian neighbors, the Israeli
security forces and government could always be counted on to be
partisan.

After the Cave of the Patriarchs atrocity, the organization to which
Goldstein belonged, Kakh, was declared illegal.  However, its members
were then absorbed by two other groups Eyal, led by Avishay Raviv,
and Kahana Hay, led by Binyamin Kahana.  The connection between these
groups and Kakh is underlined by the fact that the man responsible
for securing funds for Kakh, Herbert Sunshein, is also responsible
for securing funds for the other two groups.  And yet, the
authorities made no moves against either Eyal or Kahana Hay.  On the
contrary, it appears to have been deeply involved in both.

It now appears that members of the Israeli internal intelligence
service Shabak (formerly Shin Bet) were deeply involved in Eyal and
were aware on a day-to-day basis of its activities, including alleged
fatal attacks on Palestinian civilians.  This could be seen as proper
infiltration of a militant group by the authorities.  But if it was
merely infiltration in order to secure intelligence, why did it fail
to secure any information that could be used against the
organization's claimed attacks on Palestinians, let alone the murder
of Rabin?  One conclusion must be that the security forces were
supporting and encouraging Eyal's anti-Palestinian activities.

It never seems to have occurred to the Israeli people at large, and
particularly to the main political parties and the security services,
that they were breeding vipers in their breast, vipers that would one
day turn and bite their mentors. Hence the shock when a member of one
of those groups did exactly that by assassinating Rabin.

Thus it was that while security around Rabin was extra-high during
the peace rally, his bodyguards were looking only for Arab assassins,
particularly after the murder by the Israeli secret services of the
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shkaki outside his hotel in Malta, only a
few days previously.

It also appears that the mass militarization of the people worked
against society in that Amir put into practice the skills gained
during his compulsory military service.  It has been reported that
Amir was employed by Shabak in 1992 and that he used the techniques
he learnt then to carry out the assassination.

The response of Eyal's fund-raiser, Sunshein, to Rabin's murder was
to say his death "proves that God is in the world...On November 4
when Rabin was shot, at the same time, on the Western calendar, Meir
Kahana was assassinated."

The New Government
The murder of Rabin threw the right-wing Likud into disarray.  On the
death of the prime minister the deputy prime minister, foreign
minister Shimon Peres automatically became caretaker.  If there is
one man the Likud leadership views with even greater distaste than it
viewed Yitzhak Rabin, that man is Shimon Peres, regarded by many on
the right in Israeli politics as the real architect of the peace plan
and therefore the arch traitor to the nation.

But with Rabin slaughtered, as Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu put
it, by another Jew, the party could not in conscience oppose Peres'
forming a new government as Israel's next prime minister.  Again in
the words of Netanyahu, "political murder must not disrupt the
continuity of government in a democratic republic".   As a result,
Likud abstained in the parliamentary vote on the new government
despite having "no confidence in the path of the new government, just
as we had no confidence in its predecessor's path".

Although some parties like the Moledet insisted that they would still
vote against him, Likud's abstention from the upcoming parliamentary
vote removed the only real obstacle to Peres forming a new government
under his leadership.

The assassination brought a closing of ranks in the Labor Party, with
two defectors - Shmuel Avital and Amir Peretz of the New Life
Movement - returning to the fold.  However, Peres wanted more than
that.

Immediately on assuming the role of caretaker, Peres attempted to
broaden the coalition he had inherited from Rabin through the
inclusion of one or more of the religious parties such as the
National Religious Party (NRP), United Torah Jewry, Tzomet and the
Torah Observing Sephardim (Shas).  To this end he intimated he would
accept some of their demands on religious issues.

This upset his existing coalition partner, the secular Meretz party,
which threatened to leave the government if the NRP was brought in.
This forced Peres to change tack and seek instead to secure the
support of the religious parties in parliament, without including
them in the coalition, by agreeing a "document of understanding" with
them.  However, he insisted that while Meretz would still be in the
coalition it would have no right of veto over negotiations with other
parties.

Some of these parties would appear to make unlikely bedfellows.  Only
a few days after Rabin's murder, the Tzomet chairman and member of
parliament (MP), Refael Eytan, quoted to high school students Article
29 of the Penal Code, which he claimed stipulated that anyone who
hands over lands belonging to the state risks the death penalty.
The clear inference was that Rabin had committed such a crime.

The same article is used by the militant groups to justify their
actions.  In fact, the article refers only to acts of treason, such
as espionage, as determined by a court of law.  Moreover, it cannot
be applied to occupied territories as they are just that, occupied
territories and not legally part of the sovereign state of Israel.

In any event, Peres still had to retreat further to secure the
continued support of Meretz.  On November 21, Labor agreed with
Meretz that all new religious laws would require an a priori
agreement by all members of the coalition.  In other words, Meretz
has got its veto.

With that matter settled the new government was formed on November 22
as follows:

Shimon Peres - prime minister and defense minister (Labor)
Shulamit Aloni - minister of communications, science and the arts
(Meretz)
Yosi Beilin - minister in the prime minister's office (Labor)
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer - construction and housing minister (Labor)
Uzi Baram - minister of tourism (Labor)
Ehud Baraq - foreign minister (Labor)
Mikha Harish - industry and trade minister (Labor)
David Libai - justice minister (Labor)
Ora Namir - labor and welfare minister (Labor)
Efrayim Sne - health minister (Labor)
Rabbi Yehuda Amital - minister without portfolio (Independent/Meimad)
Yair Tzaban - immigrant absorption minister (Meretz)
Ya'aqov Tzur - agriculture and rural development minister (Labor)
Yisrael Qeysar - transport minister (Labor)
Anon Rubinstein - education, culture and sports minister (Meretz)
Haim Ramon - interior minister (Labor)
Gonen Segev - energy and infrastructure minister (Yiud)
Avraham Shohat - finance minister (Labor)
Moshe Shahal - minister of internal security (Labor)
Shimon Shetrit - minister of religious affairs (Labor)
Yosi Sarid - environment minister (Meretz)

The first major surprise in the line-up was Peres' decision to take
on the defense portfolio, appointing Ori Or as his deputy.  The
second was his shake-up of the foreign ministry.  As Peres's
elevation to the premiership had left the foreign portfolio vacant,
it was natural enough for it to be filled, as it was by Ehud Baraq,
the former chief of staff.  However, Peres went much further by
appointing the former deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, to his
own office and transferring responsibility for negotiations with
Syria from Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington, to
the director-general of the Foreign Ministry Uri Savir, who is
already responsible for negotiations with the Palestinians.

The third surprise was the creation of a new Ministry of Internal
Security, under the former Police Affairs minister, Moshe Shahal,
made up of three commands - the police, the prisons service and the
Home Front Command.  The creation of this ministry now leaves the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) (i.e. the military services) on
concentrating its efforts on external threats to state security.

The effect of these three measures is to massively increase the
powers of the prime minister's office in three critical areas -
defense, the peace negotiations and internal security.

There is little doubt that Rabin's assassination has been a setback
for the right, particularly for the main party opposing the peace
plan - Likud.  Nevertheless, the forces ranged against any further
moves remain large and, if the various splits are ignored, there is
still a possible majority against the peace process.

Thankfully, however, the right continues to fissure.  Yet another new
hard-line right-wing party was officially registered on November 14.
Named the Yamin Yisrael (Israel's Right) it plans to contest the next
general election.  Appeals were lodged against its registration on
the basis that it is a racist party representing illegal positions,
but these were rejected by the party registrar.

Yamin Yisrael was established by MP Shaul Gutman, who split from
Moledet, and Miryam Lapid from Qiryat Arba, the settlement that
produced Baruch Goldstein.  It advocates the expulsion of Arabs and
insists that any partition of Eretz Yisrael (i.e. Israel plus the
West Bank, or Judea and Samaria) be prohibited by law.  It also calls
for the building of a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount.  The number
two in the party is Rahamin Kohen, a former Kakh movement executive.

Peace Process
The Oslo B agreement, singed by prime Minister Rabin and PLO leader
Yasser Arafat in Taba on September 28, was approved by the Israeli
parliament on October 6 by 61 votes to 59, with all 120 members of
parliament attending.  The Labor members Qahalani and Zismann voted
against.  It was the third agreement concluded between Israel and the
Palestinians in the occupied territories, the first being the
Declaration of Principles singed on September 13, 1993 in Washington,
and the second, the so-called Cairo Agreement signed on May 4, 1994.

Overall, the agreement covers the withdrawal of Israeli control from
further areas of the occupied West Bank and its replacement by
Palestinian control, and the holding of elections in the Palestinian
areas in January 1996.  Once that is achieved further talks will be
held to secure another agreement on the vacation by Israel of further
areas.

However, such further withdrawal is to be severely limited.  In
presenting the Taba agreement to parliament Rabin insisted Israel
will not return to the 1967 borders.  Instead, the security border
for the state of Israel will be situated in Jordan Rift Valley "along
the broadest possible interpretation of that term".  As a result, the
Etyzyon Bloc, Efrat, Betar and other settlements, mostly situated
east of the pre-Six-Day-War Green line will become an integral part
of the state of Israel.  In addition, Israel intends to keep the
whole of Jerusalem, including Ma'ale Adumim and Givat Ze'ev, as the
undivided capital of the state of Israel.

The aim of all this, said Rabin, is to create an internationally
recognized sovereign state of Israel and a Palestinian "entity",
which will "manage the lives of the Palestinians under its
jurisdiction", will be "less than a state".

To say that this is contentious hardly addresses the issues raised.
The Palestinians have conceded much, i.e. their country, with the aim
of achieving their own state with Jerusalem as its capital. However,
here is the Israeli government stating categorically that neither of
those aims will never be achieved.  Prime Minister Peres has repeated
all of Prime Minister's Rabin's statement.

If that is Israel's stance, what will there be to discuss on the
fourth round?  There certainly will be no point in the Palestinians
attempting to negotiate on the issues.  In his first public
appearance as foreign minister on November 23, Ehud Baraq told Labor
party members that Israel would secure all of these demands "because
we are stronger".

This seems to us to be a recipe for disaster ahead and a guarantee
that terrorism will continue.

Meanwhile, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the additional areas
outlined in the Taba agreement have proceeded to plan.  Under this,
Israel was due to vacate the Jenin area during the period October 25
through November 19, the Tulkarm region by December 10, Nablus and
Qalqilyah by December 17, Bethlehem by December 20 and Ramallah on
December 31.  Withdrawal from Hebron is to be completed in March.

The Palestine National Authority (PNA) took control of Jenin on
November 13, taking authority over transport, communications and
meteorological responsibilities.  The process of vacating Nablus and
Tulkarm began at around the same time and the vacation of Bethlehem
and Hebron on November 15.  On November 28, 15 Palestinian officers
arrived in the city of Qalqilyah to coordinate the takeover of the
city by the PNA on December 18-26.

It has not been an entirely peaceful affair, however.  There were
violent clashes in Nablus between youths and the Israeli occupation
forces at the end of November. Youths blocked the streets with
barricades and burning tires and pelted Israeli patrols with stones.
Soldiers responded by firing shots and rubber bullets and throwing
percussion grenades.  A total of 23 people were injured.  After calm
was restored two Israeli Border Police were abducted in Jenin.  In
addition, the Israeli security forces killed a wanted Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement) member south of Hebron on November 28.  He was
Muhammad Nasir Musalimah.  The house in which he was hiding was first
surrounded and then shelled with antitank rockets.  The house, with
the body of Musalimah still inside, was then bulldozed to the ground.
In reiterating Prime Minister Rabin's minimum territorial demands,
Prime Minister Peres said that the negotiations about the permanent
arrangement, due to last three years, will start in May 1996, and
said that he did not believe that anything significant pertaining to
the permanent arrangement would be decided before the parliamentary
elections in October next year.

Elections in the Palestinian areas are due to be held on January 20.
The election date was set by the Palestinian National Authority on
November 4 - the day Rabin was murdered.  Registration of voters
started on November 12.  There will be 66 European observers..

PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS
In September, the PNA reached an agreement with the World Bank
whereby international aid would henceforth be transferred directly to
the PNA, and not to the Palestinian Economic Committee on Development
and Reconstruction (PECDAR).  The PLO set up PECDAR, headed by Abu
Ala (Ahmad Quray), as the official address for international aid to
the PNA soon after signing the Oslo accord.

The PNA's various offices competed to take over responsibility for
the aid funds, including Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Planning and
International Cooperation Ministry, and to Abu Ala, who is also the
head of the Ministry of Economy.  However, it was agreed that the
bulk of the funds will go to the Finance Ministry headed by Muhammad
al-Nashashibi.

This is not only a blow to Sha'th and Abu Ala, but, as Nashashibi is
very close to Yasser Arafat, but also ensures that Arafat will be
able to control the distribution of the funds.  This will provide
enormous political benefits and will enhance his powers of patronage
even further.

Unemployment
Israel has imposed further restrictions on Palestinian workers in
Israel despite reopening the border on October 17.  On the eve of the
closure, some 35,000 Palestinians were employed in Israel.  However,
on lifting the closure Israel allowed entry to only 26,600, making
another 8,400 unemployed.

As of the opening only men of 35 years and older are allowed into
Israel from Gaza.  Before the closure, the minimum age was 30.  The
minimum age for Palestinian workers from the West Bank was raised
from 28 to 30.  In both cases, only married men are allowed to work
in Israel.

The civilian work force in the West Bank stands at 250,000 of whom
190,000 are employed in the region.  According to Civil
Administration data, the unemployment rate stands at 10%, some 25,000
people.  Some 60,000 Palestinians are employed in the self-rule area,
while some 14,000 work in Israel and the Eretz area.  The PNA claims
that the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is almost 50% of the
work force.

Dr. Fu'ad Bsisu, governor of the PNA fiscal authority, has warned
that unemployment might reach 32% in the West Bank and Gaza by the
beginning of this year.  He said that after 28 years of occupation
the restructuring of the Palestinian economy requires a strong
banking sector.

Finance & Aid
In this respect, a banking study prepared by the Palestinian fiscal
authority has reported that total deposits in the banks operating in
Palestine reached US$975 million at the end of May 1995, reflecting a
US$387 million, 65%, increase on the end of December 1994.  Total
client deposits in the PNA areas reached US$538 million at the end of
May, reflecting a US$286 million increase, or 48%.  In the West Bank,
total deposits up to the end of May reached US$437 million, an
increase of 30% on the end of December 1994.

According to the study, Gaza and Jericho are the major contributors
to bank deposits in Palestine, contributing 55%.  Judging by the
demographic structure, Gaza inhabitants represent 38% of the
population and account for 25% of the GNP. The study notes that
Gaza's share of commercial bank deposits is 55% of the total deposits
in Palestine.  This indicates relative political and economic
stability in the PNA areas.

Foreign Aid
A European Union delegation, headed by Spanish Foreign Minister
Javier Solana, now the new head of NATO, signed an agreement for the
provision of US$300 million in soft loans to the PNA on October 27.
The sum is part of the 1993 grant of US$600 million offered by the EU
in 1993.  The money will be used to set up large-scale water,
electricity and commercial projects.

In November, the PNA's donor group recommended offering US$75 million
to cover the deficit in the Palestinian budget and US$600 million to
finance investment and social projects.  The sums were due to be
approved during the donor countries' ministerial meeting in Paris on
December 9.

Israeli Settlement Expansion
Also in October the Peace Now settlement monitoring team claimed that
the construction of 1,400 new housing units had started in the Jewish
settlements of the West Bank since the start of this year.  Peace Now
also claimed that some 6,000 apartments are currently in various
stages of construction in the territories.  When they are inhabited,
the apartments will provide a significant boost to the population of
the Israeli settlements.  In the organization's view this will
seriously harm the political process.

It further claims that overall some 3,800 housing units have been
completed this year in the area dubbed Greater Jerusalem after the
work was approved by the special ministerial committee.  Another
3,900 apartments will be built over the next year or so in the area
between Ma'ale Adumim, the Etyzon Bloc and Giv'at Ze'ev.

Peace Now surveyed each Israeli settlement individually.  It claims
that the total number of apartments under construction last year is
the largest number since the Likud government.  If all the apartments
currently being built are inhabited, some 25,000 additional settlers
will be moving in.

However, the government rejected the organization's claims.
According to the then housing and construction minister, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, the ministerial committee charged with approving
construction projects in the occupied territories had approved the
construction of only 500 housing units in Ma'ale Adumim, the
continued construction of some 500 housing units in Betar, and work
on privately-owned land in Giv'at Ze'ev, which had not yet started.

As for Tel Aviv, the minister did admit that some 95,000 housing
units are being built, with a further 1,100 housing units in Psigat
Ze'ev in Greater Jerusalem.

LEBANON
The continuing state of tension in the Israeli security zone in
southern Lebanon rose by several more degrees in October when six
Israeli soldiers were killed by a booby-trap bomb in the eastern
sector.  The deaths provoked a massive Israeli reaction of targeted
air attacks over the next several weeks.  Each of which was met with
retaliatory action from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) and Hezbollah.

In mid-November Israel intensified its bombardment of southern areas
and carried out a massive air attack against PFLP-GC positions in the
Na'mah hills, inflicting a large number of fatalities.  Following the
attack, the PFLP-GC reportedly began dismantling its bases in Na'mah
as a precautionary measure against further strikes.

As for the bombardment, attacks on alleged Hezbollah villages on
November 27 reportedly killed a number of ranking members of the
organization.  Hezbollah claimed that Israel used nail and
fragmentation bombs in the attack and said it had it had no honorable
alternative but to respond with the weapons it has to hand, namely
the Katyusha rockets.

The next day Hezbollah fired a "relatively large number" of Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel in two salvos.  The missiles struck the
area around Qiryat Shimona in the Galilee but there were no reported
fatalities.

The attack produced fury in Israel, with Prime Minister stating that
the attack was a blatant breach of the understanding reached after
the Israeli operation in Lebanon n 1993.  He went on to assign full
responsibility to the Lebanese and Syrian governments.  In
particular, he noted that Syria had to be held responsible for the
actions of Hezbollah because it has a military deployment in the
country.

Backing up the prime minister, deputy defense minister Ori Or said
Israel will make Hezbollah, Lebanon and Syria "pay the price" for the
attacks.  However, the military had already issued a statement that
Syria had nothing to do with the attacks.  Israel is also limited in
its response by its need to keep the peace process on track.  After
all this is the fifth time Israel has vowed to retaliate after
Katyushas have been fired into northern Israel, and it has not done
so yet.

So, the result has been more of the same. On November 28 a member of
Hezbollah's security committee in Jibshit was killed when his car was
blown up, either form a bomb or a rocket fired by an Israeli plane.
On November 30 Israeli warplanes carried out three air raids on the
ridges located between Mashgharah and Ayn al-Tinah firing 500 and
1,000-pound air-to-ground missiles.

Israel is also still enforcing its restriction on maritime traffic
inside Lebanese territorial waters. In Late October it was reported
that Israel had stepped up its patrols all along the coast between
Naqurah and Sarafand, imposing a tight blockade on the ports from
which Lebanese fishermen operate.  Fishing boats also claim to have
been subjected to machine-gun fire along the coast south of Tyre.

On November 19, Israeli gunboats detained two Lebanese fishermen.
They were released the next day with a map stipulating that fishing
is only allowed in a one-kilometer area off Tyre's northern beaches.
On November 30, Israeli gunboats seized two ships with a cargo of
cars heading for Tyre.

ISRAEL
ECONOMY

In addition to saying that he would hold the Rabin line on the peace
process, Prime Minister Peres also committed himself to pursuing the
same general thrust in economic policy.  That, however, is a line he
may find difficult to hold.

Certainly, the past few years have been the best ever in Israel's
socioeconomic history with GDP growth averaging nearly 5.6% over from
1991 through 1994.  However inflation has been stubbornly resistant
to the government's tight monetary policy.  Although the rate fell to
around 9% last year from 12.3% in 1994, growth started to pick up
rapidly in the second half of the year, stoking up inflationary
pressures.   Growth last year could well have been as high as 6.8%.
This year Finance Minister Avraham Shohat has forecast a GDP growth
of 6.8% and there is a strong possibility that inflation will rise
again.

This is alarming.  Interest rates are already very high.  In October
last the central bank raised its key lending rate charged to
commercial banks 13.7% to 14.2%.  This brought a sharp halt to a
gradual fall in  the rate from a high of 17% in November 1994.

Moreover, the budget deficit situation is also worsening.  According
to the latest forecasts, the fiscal deficit is expected to turn out
at 3.6% of GDP in 1995, compared with 0.9% in 1994 and well in excess
of the government target of 2.75%.

European Union
Israel and the EU signed an economic agreement at the EU's Council of
Ministers in Brussels on November 20.  This is the largest and most
important international economic agreement signed by Israel.  It
replaces the agreement signed about 20 years ago and includes
elements that will improve and enhance the ties between Israel and
the EU countries.

JORDAN
POLITICS

Concern is rising both in the government and abroad over the
heightened level of opposition to the peace agreement with Israel.
The problem was brought into focus by a recent debate on the peace
process in parliament in which a number of deputies opposed the
government line.  The opposition was led by the Islamic Action Front,
but supported by more than 13 nationalist, leftist and even centrist
deputies.

This was followed by the rejection of the government's normalization
of relations with Israel by the trade unions.  The government was
also discomfited when in a democratic election the Islamists and
leftists who oppose the it scored a landslide victory in the branch
elections of the Jordan Engineers' Association.

This has led some observers to claim the country is teetering on the
brink of a bloody confrontation between proponents and opponents of
the peace.  Their argument is that this fundamental political
division in the country is exacerbated by Jordan's purely domestic
problems such as the high level of unemployment which is officially
put at 18% of the workforce, growing poverty and hardship, and the
widespread corruption in the government and bureaucracy.

This mix is made worse, they contend, by Jordan's open door policy on
immigration.  Thus, Islamic militants have moved into Jordan from
other countries in the region with the express intent of fomenting
trouble.  Finally, there is the continuous external pressure
generated by the continued UN sanctions against Iraq and the
suffering of its people to the east and the stand-off between Syria
and Israel to the north.

This does at least appear to have the USA worried.  According to the
Jordanian newspaper Akhbar al-Usbu, the USA has been involved in
secret discussion with exiled Jordanian opposition groups and some
opposition groups inside the country.

Also, the government's move in October and November to cut the number
of foreign workers in the country cannot be entirely unconnected with
these concerns.  According to Labor Minister Nader Abu el-Shaer, the
foreign workforce of around 250,000 was cut by 70,000 in October
alone.  The hope is that this action will both cut down on the number
of potential foreign agitators and help to ease the unemployment
situation for low-paid workers.

Saudi Arabia
To King Hussein's enormous relief, normal relations have been
restored with Saudi Arabia and ambassadors exchanged.  The Saudi
ambassador arrived in Amman on November 11.  King Hussein is expected
to make a visit to Saudi Arabia soon.

It was also announced that the defunct pipeline, which used to carry
40,000 barrels of Saudi oil to Jordan daily, is to be repaired and
put back into operation.

Iraq
Despite the improvement in relations with Saudi Arabia, King Hussein
is still treading a political tightrope in his relations with Iraq.
So far his condemnation of the regime has been in non-specific terms
and he has taken care not to criticize Saddam Hussein personally.
This has been essential in that Jordan is still economically
dependent on Iraq (for details of the recent trade agreement see the
Iraq report in this issue) and that the majority of the Jordanian
people are sympathetic to the political message emanating from
Baghdad.

At the same time, however, he cannot afford to alienate either Saudi
Arabia or Kuwait.  To this end, King Hussein reportedly made contacts
with some Iraqi opposition groups during his private visit to London
recently.  This, however, brought criticism from a rather unusual
quarter, the pretender to the Iraqi throne, Sharif Ali Bin
al-Hussein.  In late November Sharif Ali, who is a member of the
Hashemite family to which King Hussein belongs, said such contacts
constituted a threat to the integrity of Iraq.

Apparently, Sharif Ali, who heads an organization called the Iraqi
Constitutional Monarchy Movement and hopes to have himself installed
as a constitutional monarch in Iraq after Saddam Hussein is brought
down, fears that Iraq in its present divided state is ripe for
break-up and sees the threat of a confederation between Jordan and
the rump of Iraq should the Kurds succeed in breaking away.

Israel
Despite the domestic protests, however, relations with Israel
continue to forge ahead.  On October 25 the two countries singed a
trade deal which is expected to led to a rapid increase in trade
between them.  Under it Israel has granted Jordan 20-50% exemptions
from customs on most Jordanian industrial products, including cement,
furniture, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and toys.  For its part Jordan
has agreed to reduce its tariffs by 10% on a wide range of Israeli
products, including plywood, tires, foodstuffs, electronic
components, medical and communications equipment and pharmaceuticals.

The agreement takes account of the difference between the Israeli and
Jordanian economies: per capita income in Jordan is less than a
quarter of the level in Israel.  The agreement will be in effect for
three years, after which the terms will be renegotiated.

JORDAN
FINANCE

Jordan finally got its second debt write-off deal with the USA on
September 25.  Under the first deal US$220 million was canceled,
while the second deal removed a further US$400 or so to bring the
total amount of debt canceled to around US$640 million, around 10% of
the country's total foreign debt.

Also in September Japan announced its intention to extend
grants-in-aid totaling N1.12 billion to Jordan.  The aid consists of
N547 million to finance a project aimed at combating oil spill in the
north of the Gulf of Aqaba, N550 million to help the country purchase
agricultural machinery to boost food production, and N24 million
cultural grant-in-aid to help Jordan's radio and TV corporation
purchase educational TV programs.

In late October Japan also announced that it is to provide US$215
million aid package, including a US$135 million loan from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan, to help alleviate Jordan's foreign
exchange shortage.

Last but not least, the European Union is to provide a grant of 20
million European Currency Units (Ecu) to help the kingdom implement
its economic reform program.  The money will be used to finance
projects in the fields of health, education, social development and
water.

In October Moody's Investors Service assigned a Ba3 long term rating
to Jordan's foreign currency debt, while and Standard & Poor's
assigned a B+ rating for the country's foreign currency debt and a
BBB rating for local currency debt.

The country has been discomfited by the call by the United Arab

Yemen.

Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers decided on November 29 to grant a
maximum grace period of one year for those who have not yet managed
to prove their Kuwaiti nationality since the 1965 census.  The aim of
the ruling is to set an absolute deadline on the nationality
registration process. The cabinet also approved the use of DNA

KUWAIT
ECONOMY

Privatization
The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) said in November that it now
expects the privatization program to be completed before the target
date of end 1998 as a result of the increasing demand from investors
for shares in the parastatals due to be hived off.

Up to the end of October, the KIA - the body charged by the
government with executing the privatization program - had sold shares
worth Kd310 million (approximately US$1 billion).  Up to that date,
some 15,000 people had subscribed to the shares sold and the monthly
share trading figure had increased from an average of Kd45.3 million
in the first half of 1994 to Kd248.7 million in the first half of
1995.

Private deposits increased from Kd5.5 billion in June 1994 to Kd6.1
billion in August 1995.  In addition the central bank had registered
a decrease in the amount of transfers abroad.

The increase in average share prices in the stock market has led to
similar increases in the value of the portfolio of local shares held
by the state through the KIA.  The value of this portfolio has
increased by more than Kd300 million since July 1994.

The KIA holds more than 10% of the equity of 28 companies.  This
stake is worth around Kd9.24 billion.  Approximately 34.5% of this
total is in the banking sector, some 20.6% in the manufacturing
sector and around 20.5% in the service sector.

Oil Sector
Meanwhile, Oil Minister, Dr. Abd al-Muhsin al-Mid'ij, said in
September that the level of investment the private sector could
contribute to the oil industry after 1997 could be as much as US$10
million.

He said that the Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is planning to
increase its oil production to three million barrels per day (b/d) by
the beginning of the next century and to around 3.5 million b/d by
the year 2005.  As for the refining sector, the plans are to increase
the volume of oil refined by Kuwait refineries from 800,000 b/d to
around one million b/d by the year 2000.

Prior to the November meeting of OPEC oil and energy ministers in
November, Mid'ij appeared to be urging his partners to raise Kuwait's
production ceiling from 2.0 million b/d to 2.2 million b/d.  However,
Mid'ij also talked of wanting to raise the oil price to US$21/bbl.
Given the excess capacity in the market and an oil price at the time
of around US$16/bbl, the two aims were clearly incompatible.

In the event the OPEC meeting decided to keep the organization's
overall production ceiling at 24.52 million b/d up to the end of June
this year.  As a result, the production ceilings of all member
countries, including Kuwait, will remain the same.  By maintaining
total output against a forecast rise n global demand of 1.4 million
b/d this year, OPEC is hoping that the oil price will rise
significantly towards the US$21/bbl figure this year.

It was announced in October that a new oil deposit has been
discovered in the Kira al-Maru, in western Kuwait.  Outflow from the
new discovery started on October 19.  The outflow is of light oil ,
the first time such oil has been discovered in the area.

The Kuwait Oil Company's exploration at Kira al-Maru began in June
1990, but was halted by the Iraqi invasion.  Work resumed in February
1994.  Preliminary estimates indicate that deposits in the new field
amount to 300-400 million barrels.

Foreign Economic Relations
The Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) signed a memorandum of
understanding with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in September on the
setting up of a joint oil refinery with an estimated annual capacity
of about six million tonnes - which could be increased to 10 million
tonnes - at a cost of more than US$1 billion.

The project is to be set up and operated in the state of Orissa in
northeast India by a new joint company.  The KPC and IOC will each
hold 26% of the shares of the joint company, while the remaining
shares, 48%, will be offered to individuals and institutions in
India.

The financing of the project depends on the use of the paid capital
and foreign loans.

MOROCCO
POLITICS

Despite the current economic difficulties, the kingdom retains its
moderate political risk.  However, in that King Hassan, by virtue of
his near absolute powers, is the key to political stability there
were some anxious moments in late October when his was taken ill in
New York in the USA.

The king apparently caught influenza which then deteriorated into an
acute respiratory infection.  Although he has apparently recovered
fully and has returned home, he has been advised to take several
weeks recuperation.

Corruption
Meanwhile, the government's latest attempt to cut back on the blatant
corruption in the country resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000
people in mid November.  The arrests resulted from the latest
anti-corruption measures and most of the detentions - 826 - were made
in and around the port city of Casablanca, while the center-north
came second with 423.  Most of those arrested were charged with
attempting to bribe policemen.

The number of arrests sounds impressive but in reality can barely be
described as even the tip of the iceberg.  The whole of the
bureaucracy in Morocco is riven with bribery and "baksheesh", in
which paying policemen to turn a blind eye to parking offenses and
traffic violations is but a minor part.  It is virtually impossible
for a citizen to obtain a building permit, birth certificate, death
certificate or any other official document without money changing
hands under the counter.

Political Terrorism
Although Morocco has no domestic problem with political terrorism,
proof positive has emerged that some of its citizens are taking
advantage of the terrorist activity in neighboring Algeria with the
arrest of a group of arms' smugglers on the Moroccan side of the
border.

Although the arrests were made in mid-September, they were not
announced until mid-October.  There were 17 members in the group, 12
Moroccans and five Algerians.  According to the government, the
Moroccans were either small traders or unemployed, aged between 25
and 40.  The Algerians are believed to be members of the Algerian
terrorist group Groupe Armi Islamique (GIA).  They face prison
sentences of 5-20 years.

Western Sahara
The registration process of voters in the referendum on the future
status of the territory, scheduled for January 1996, continues at a
snail's pace.  In July, the Moroccan government suddenly presented a
further 100,000 application forms for Moroccans its claims originated
from Western Sahara.  This has snarled up the registration process to
such an extent that in November the President of the self-styled
Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Mohamed Abdelaziz, wrote to
the UN secretary-general warning that the whole process was on the
point of impasse.

Meanwhile, the first elected Saharan National Assembly was installed
at the refugee camps in Tindouf on October 12, to coincide with the
20th anniversary of the proclamation of the SADR. The Assembly
consists of 101 members.

In November, the SADR's armed wing, the Polisario Front released 186
Moroccan prisoners of war.  These men had been released in 1989, but
the Moroccan government refused to receive them on the grounds that
there were no Moroccan POWs.

Relations between the SADR and the Moroccan government also came
under further strain in August, when Morocco opened talks with Russia
on renewing the three-year fishing accord that permits Russian ships
to fish off the Western Saharan coast.

The SADR has always regarded the accord, which was signed in August
1992 as, a deliberate provocation that runs counter to the
UN-brokered peace plan signed by both sides in August 1988.  It also
regards the accord as being part of Morocco's policy of establishing
international legitimacy to its claim of sovereignty over the region
in advance of the referendum.  The accord was the first signed by
Morocco which was limited exclusively to the Western Sahara.

European Union
The long-running dispute with the European Union (EU) over fishing
rights was finally brought to a conclusion on November 15 last as
part of a new partnership agreement.  The EU had hoped to get the
fishing treaty out of the way before the trade accord was dealt with.
However, Morocco, realizing the leverage the fishing deal gave it in
negotiations on the accord hung on until the EU was forced to
consider both together.  The overall result is that Morocco has
secured both agreements under arguably better terms than it would
have done.

It has been a tough negotiation.  When Morocco refused to renew the
existing fisheries agreement when it expired on April 30 last year,
relations between Morocco and the EU, particularly Spain, plunged.
With its fishing vessels barred from Moroccan waters, Spain faced the
loss of around 40,000 jobs in its fishing industry.

Pressure was also on the EU in general as it wanted the partnership
agreement drawn up before the Euro-Mediterranean conference which was
held in Barcelona on November 27/28.  It was also important in that
the EU sees partnership agreements with the countries of the Maghreb
as an essential contributor to stability on its southern flank.

The new fisheries agreement, which comes into effect on September 1,
1996, is for a non-renewable four years.  During this period Morocco
will modernize its fishing fleet, expand its structure and ports,
train seamen and prepare a scientific research program to manage its
fish resources.  For its part, the EU will provide financial aid to
fund these tasks and has undertaken to restructure its fleet and
gradually reduce its use of Moroccan territorial waters.  To this
end, the EU's financial contribution of Ecu102 million is to be
raised by 20-30%.

Over the period of the agreement, has agreed to cut its catch of
molluscs by 40% and of crustaceans by 34%.  The catch of other
species is also to be reduced.  At the same time, EU vessels are
obliged to land 30% of their catches in Moroccan ports.   Moroccan
waters on condition that there is a gradual reduction of the volume
of fishing over the coming four years at a rate of 40% for molluscs
and 34% for crustaceans and a percentage of the EU ships' cargoes are
unloaded at Moroccan ports.  EU fishermen have also committed
themselves to respecting the biological rest period to allow stocks
to recover and to employing one or more Moroccan sailors per vessel.

The partnership agreement provides improved access to the EU markets
for Morocco's agricultural produce and is a key element in the EU's
strategy to create a Euro-Med free trade zone by 2010.

MOROCCO
ECONOMY

Following a government report in September that economic growth will
slow, and that unemployment, the budget deficit and inflation will
climb if current policies are not changed, King Hassan announced in
October that Morocco is to introduce a series of five-year plans, the
first covering the period from 1995 until 2000.

Addressing the House of Representatives on the opening of the new
parliamentary term on October 13, the king said he had asked the
World Bank in June to carry out analyses of three areas of concern to
him:  education, administrative reforms and Morocco's future policy
on economic, financial and trade issues.  He said the World Bank's
reports on the first two subjects, which he had recently received,
had made "painful" reading.

On that basis, said the king, he had reached the conclusion that the
problems and the challenges are so great that they must be tackled
through a "full and comprehensive" national debate.  In particular,
the king pointed out that the year of drought had put enormous
pressure on the country and that it faced some difficult debt
repayment hurdles in 1997 and 1998.

The September report forecast that the drought will cut agricultural
output by around 56% this year, with a concomitant fall in the GDP of
4-5%.   As the 1995 budget had forecast a growth of 2.5%, it appears
that the country will suffer a negative growth in real terms.

Foreign Trade
The foreign trade turnover increased by 3.4% in the first six months
of 1995. Exports totaled Md53,886 million in the period, compared
Md52,113 million in the same period of 1994.

The export of food products increased by 14.1% to Md5,367 million,
from Md4,703 million in the same period of 1994.  Exports of energy
products rose from Md13,000 million in 1994 to Md14,326 million,
while phosphate exports increased by 14%, or Md94 million, to Md769
million from Md675 million in 1994.

Overall, imports declined.  However, there was a sharp 8.1% increase
in the import of food products, mainly cereals, as a result of the
drought.  The trade deficit in the period was reduced by 6.9% to
Md15,889 million.

SAUDI ARABIA
POLITICS

Concerns about the health of 74-year old King Fahd rose again when he
was admitted to the King Faysal specialist hospital in Riyadh on
November 29.  Official statements said that he entered hospital for a
routine medical check up and that he is fit and well.  However, King
Fahd is beleived to be terminally ill with advanced kidney failure.
As a result, he frequently loses consciousness and has to receive
blood transfusions to compensate for the occasional heavy bleeding
resulting from his condition.

Under those circumtances, it is not surprising that the rumor flew
around the Middle East that the king had actually suffered a minor
stroke.  The idea that the visit was indeed more than routine was
given further credence by the flurry of goodwill and get well
messages from other Arab leaders.  After all, if he hadn't been ill,
what was the point?

Terrorism
But while concerns over the health of the king have been around for
some time now, concerns over terrorist activity in the kingdom have
not.  That nonchalance was rapidly expelled in October and November
when first a mosque and then the a US military installation were
bombed.

No organization has claimed responsibility for the first attack, on a
mosque in Quba in the Bishah region in late October.  From the scant
details available, it appears a Saudi threw a bomb into the mosque
while people were at prayer. Six people were killed and 101 injured
in the explosion.  The bomber escaped the scene but was hunted down
and cornered in a mountainous area in the province of Namas.  There
was apparently an exchange of gunfire in which one policeman was
killed.  The man then blew himself up.

There is, as yet, no evidence to connect this to the second incident
on November 13 when a car bomb was detonated outside a US military
communications center in the capital Riyadh.  Six people were killed
and over 60 injured.   Part of the three-story building collapsed and
buildings were damaged up to half a kilometer away.  The bombers
escaped without detection.

A few days later, the government denied that there had also been
unsuccessful attempts to blow up the offices of the Defense Ministry
and the Petromin (General Petroleum and Minerals Organization).

The bombing in Riyadh, in particular, is a serious warning that even
a state as rigidly controlled as Saudi Arabia is not immune to the
forces of militant Islam that are wreaking such havoc elsewhere in
the Middle East and appears to be in line with a growing radicalism
in the kingdom.  First came the establishment and subsequent crushing
of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) in May
1993 and the roundup of hundreds of clerics and dissident academics
in the north-western province of Qasim last year.  This year,
leaflets have been circulated in Riyadh warning foreigners to desist
from involving themselves in Saudi affairs.

It appears that general dissatisfactions, domestically because of the
two-year recession, and abroad because of what is seen by the public
as the poor deal meted out to the Palestinians in the peace agreement
with Israel, have coalesced into an opposition to the presence in the
kingdom of not only foreign, but non-Arab and non-Muslim forces.
There is another problem.  At least 5,000 Saudi youths received
combat training in Afghanistan.  Some estimate the number could be as
high as 10,000.  The presence of such a large number of experienced
fundamentalist fighters outside of the government's control.  The
three groups that have claimed responsibility for the Riyadh bombing
have almost certainly been drawn from their ranks.

According to Dr Muhammad al-Mas'ari, the official spokesman of the
exiled CDLR, now based in London, England, these groups have carried
out no actions up to now because they could not obtain a fatwa to
carry out an armed attack on foreign forces in the kingdom.  The
basis they used to request such a fatwa is a religious ruling which
stipulates that no non-Islamic force, armed or not, should be present
in the Arabian Peninsula.  This ruling applies to the whole Islamic
world and precludes Muslims everywhere from seeking help from
non-Muslims in the Arabian peninsula.

However, requests for a fatwa have been consistently rejected by such
distinguished clerics and leaders such as Safar al-Hawali, Salman
al-Awdah and others.  The presumption by many is that a fatwa has now
been secured from a leading cleric outside of the kingdom.

The organizations that have claimed responsibility for the bombing
are the Tigers of the Gulf, the Partisans of God, , and the Jihad
Wing of the Islamic Movement for Change.  Only the last of these
groups is known.   However all previous statements from the Jihad
Wing, demanding that all foreign forces leave the Arabian peninsula,
have been made in writing.  All of the claims of responsibility for
the Riyadh bombing have been made by telephone.

Although the attack automatically increases the political terrorism
threat component in our assessment of Saudi Arabia's political risk,
we do not see the threat as great on current evidence.

Finally, and to the intense embarrassment of all concerned, it became
known in November that the US security forces had arrested one of its
servicemen, a Lt-Col Michael Schwart, in September on suspicion of
spying for Saudi Arabia.  Schwart was serving in the US naval
intelligence base in Riyadh when he was arrested.

However, Schwart has not been charged with espionage and betraying
his country.  This treatment stands in sharp contrast to that of
another US citizen, Jonathan Pollard, who has spent 10 years in jail
for spying for Israel.  In recognition of his work, the Israeli
government granted Pollard Israeli citizenship in late November.

Government Changes
After only three months in the job, Dr. Sulaymani Bin Abd al-Aziz
al-Salim resigned as finance and national economy minister on October
9.  The official reason given for his sudden departure is the state
of his health.  Given that he has a history of heart trouble and has
been treated for the same in London, there is no obvious reason to
presume ulterior reasons.

He was replaced on the same day by Dr Abd al-Aziz bin Abdullah
al-Khuwaytir.  Al-Khuwaytir had been education minister since 1975,
but was appointed minister without portfolio in the August reshuffle
that put Al-Salim into finance.

There are considerable differences between the two men.  Al-Salim
could be regarded as a technocrat, despite his long experience in
government (he had been commerce minister for 20 years before his
appointment to finance).  Despite this long service, Al-Salim is
still only 54 years old and is held in high regard in the USA as well
as Saudi Arabia.

Al-Khuwaytir, on the other hand is considerably older at 68 and much
more of an insider, being much more of a trusted retainer to the king
than just a minister.  Thus while Al-Salim's appointment could be
seen as a signal that King Fahd had finally decided to allow decisive
new action to be taken in the management of the economy, his
replacement gives the impression of a "steady-as-she-goes" approach,
with little prospect of fundamental change.

This difference between the two men is so stark that most
commentators believe that Al-Khuwaytir's appointment is only
temporary and that he will soon be replaced by another, younger
financial or economic technician.  The top names currently touted are
Hamad Al-Sayari, the 54-year old governor of the Saudi central bank
and Ahmad Abdul Latif, the 60-year old president of the Arab Banking
Corporation.

However, there is always the possibility that Al-Salim's resignation
had more to do with the way he was running his portfolio than his
health, and that King Fahd did not like the proposed changes of
direction.  If that is the case, then the appointment of
Al-Khuwaytir, who can be relied on to have much the same mind set as
the king, could be a great deal more permanent than is presumed.  It
would also indicate that reforms, if any, will be conducted at a much
slower pace.

SAUDI ARABIA
ECONOMY

An indicator that King Fahd may be backtracking on his commitment to
reform is the government's claim in November that it has now managed
to overcome its financial difficulties and that these were anyway
exaggerated by the foreign media.

In particular, the government statement claimed that the financial
deficit in the first half of 1995 had been reduced to 2% of GDP,
compared with a deficit of about 9% in 1994.  The deficit in the
foreign current account in the period was also reduced to 2% of GDP,
from 8% in 1994.

The problem is that this improvement is almost entirely due to the
strengthening of international oil prices last year.  The reform
process began last year with an austerity budget designed to cut
spending by 6% to US$40 billion in order to pull the budget deficit
down to US$4 billion.  This compares with deficits of US$37.62
billion in 1991, US$-11.13 billion in 1992, US$9.53 billion in 1993,
and US$10.68 billion in 1994.

However, the oil revenue projections in the budget were based on an
oil price of only US$14/bbl.  However, oil prices averaged
US$15.50/bbl through most of last year.  This extra income, probably
somewhere in excess of US$3 billion, has been the major contributor
to the country's improved financial situation.

However, the real imbalances in the economy, such as the growing
unemployment among the educated young, the sharp rise in inflation
(up to 6% from 1-2%), and government payment arrears of US$405
billion, are still there.  Complacency now could be disastrous.

YEMEN
POLITICS

Although there has been a significant improvement n the overall
security situation since the civil war, crimes against property are
rife, particularly in Aden.  There is also a good deal of fraud being
perpetrated over land contracts.

There has also been some attempted terrorism of late.  A group of
what the government called "sabotage elements" were arrested at the
end of September in Aden and another group in mid-November.  They are
not believed to be related to the militant Islamic groups in Egypt,
but to the defeated Yemeni Socialist Party, whose leadership was
forced to flee the country after its defeat in the civil war in 1994.

The government admits that yet other groups could still be at large
and the possibility of at least isolated acts of terrorism cannot be
discounted.  In an effort to reduce the risk, the government has
deported some 4,000 Algerian, Libyan, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals
in October and November.  According to Prime Minister al-Ghani, the
aim of the deportation program was to prevent Aden being used as a
base for terrorist activities against its neighbors.  Particular
effort has been made to locate and detain any Egyptian nationals
believed to be conspiring against the Egyptian state.

A new minister for expatriate affairs, Fadl Muhammad bin Aydarut
al-Afifi, was appointed on November 11.

Foreign Relations
The rapprochement with Saudi Arabia appears to be continuing
according to plan.  The third Saudi-Yemeni joint committee for border
demarcation held its third session in San'a during November 5-9 in a
reportedly friendly and cooperative atmosphere.  Agreement was
reached to start implementing the time table of the technical field
work of border demarcation.  The fourth session is due to begin on
December 25.

Although relations with Saudi Arabia are clearly on an improving
track, relations with Kuwait remain sticky.  Deputy prime minister
and foreign minister Abnd al-Karim al-Iryani went some way towards
allaying Kuwaiti concerns in late October when he said that Yemen had
never adopted a policy supporting or entrenching the occupation of
Kuwait and that claims to the contrary were a falsification of
Yemen's position.

However, the effect of this was rather spoilt when Yemen later
supported the call by the United Arab Emirates for the UN sanctions
against Iraq to be lifted.

Eritrea
Yemen has also managed to blunder into a territorial dispute with
Eritrea over three Red Sea islands - Hunaysh al-Kubra, Zukar and
Hunaysh al-Sughrah.  The islands have been occupied by Yemen, which
is hoping to develop them as tourist centers.

In mid-November Eritrean naval patrols attempted to land on one of
the islands when it appeared that tourists facilities were under
construction there.  Yemeni military units on the island prevented
the Eritreans from landing.  In response Eritrea warned Yemeni
military units and fishermen to evacuate the island on the basis that
it is disputed territory.

In an effort to cool the situation the two sides have agreed to a
series of talks on the status of the islands.  The first of these
meetings took place in San'a on November 22.

YEMEN
ECONOMY

This year is to be the first in a new five-year plan extending to the
year 2000 aimed at establishing the primary development projects in
order to provide a base for the future development of the economy.
The government says the plan will be carried out in line with the
commitments it has already made to maintain its economic reform
programs, combat financial and administrative corruption, improve
production, and encourage investment, exports, trade exchange and
competition.  Apart from oil and gas developments, particular
attention is to be paid to agriculture, tourism and fishery
resources.

The key to Yemen's future economic development is oil and gas.  In
this respect, a major step forward was achieved in September with the
signing of the final agreement on a project to liquefy and export
natural gas with the French company Total.  Negotiations are under
way with the US companies Hunt and Exxon with the aim of having them
participate in the project as well.  South Korea has already put
itself forward as a potential buyer of Yemeni gas.

Overall, the US$3 billion project is forecast to produce five million
tonnes of natural gas a year for 25 years.  This will produce an
annual revenues of about US$600, the bulk of which will be earmarked
to boost agricultural and industrial development, and improve
services.

Another major project is the development and modernization of the
Aden refinery.  Bids for the work have been tendered by foreign
companies and are currently being studied.  The project should get
underway this year.

Currently, oil production is concentrated in two areas - Sector No.
18 in Ma'rib and Jawf and Sector No. 14 in the Masilah area in
Hadhramawt Governorate - which jointly produce about 350,000 barrels
per day (b/d).  Crude oil production from these fields is expected to
increase this year due to the continued drilling of development wells
and to the coming on stream of new fields in the Jannah area, known
as Sector No. 5.  This should add around 25,000 b/d to next year's
output total.  Also due to come into operation soon are the Farid and
Atud fields in the eastern part of Shabwah, known as Sector No. 10.
Initial production from these fields is expected to be 12,000 b/d.

Overall, some 26 international companies are carrying out surveys or
exploratory drilling operations in the country and the potential for
further major discoveries appears high.  Total has already been
discovered oil in commercial quantities at Qaribah and Hisn
al-Karadis in eastern Shabwah.  On that basis the government is
expecting to increase its overall oil production by up to 60,000 b/d
this year.  Following the completion of oil pipeline projects, output
should rise to 500,000 b/d.  Natural gas output is expected to reach
six million tonnes a year and should be able to be increased to seven
million tonnes.

BOTSWANA
POLITICS

Ethnic and regionally based tensions within the ruling Botswana
Democratic Party (BDP) look set to heighten over the coming year
following recent changes to the party's constitution that will limit
a president to two successive terms in office.

The new restriction is borne out of a dispute that has raged between
the northern-based Merahfe and primarily southern Kwelagobe factions
of the BDP since mid-1994.  During the last presidential and
legislative elections - held in October 1994 - the Merahfe gained
control of a larger number of seats in the 40-seat National Assembly
than the Kwelagobe faction.  This led to calls from the Merahfe for
changes to the constitution that would ensure all tribes would be
given equal status.  However, these calls were rejected by the
Kwelagobe, which enjoys the support of President Masire, and has,
since the country's independence from the UK in 1966, been the
faction from which the ruling elite has predominantly been drawn.

Masire's continued support of the Kwelagobe position caused a good
deal of anger amongst the Merahfe.  The ensuing row resulted in the
Merahfe collaborating with the opposition Botswana National Front
(BNF) to install Moutlakgola Nwako, a long-time opponent of Masire,
as speaker of the House.  The subsequent limiting of presidential
terms is a result of both the renewed vigor of the Merahfe in
pursuing their aim and a recognition on the part of Masire that,
despite the next elections being some four years off, without some
degree of internal reconciliation, the BDP faces the possibility of a
split so damaging that it would end its 29 year-old hold on power.

Just how far the recent change will go in lessening the Merahfe's
belief that it is treated as a second class faction within the BDP is
unclear.  Any hopes that they may have had that Masire, who has held
office since 1980, far in excess of two terms, would resign in order
that a new, Merahfe, president could take over, were quickly dampened
when Masire said that changes to the constitution were not meant for
an individual and that he retained the right to resign when he
pleased.

Masire's position was underlined by BDP chairman, Ponatshego
Kedikilwe, when he responded to a press report in The Botswana
Gazette that suggested that Masire would leave office at the end of
this term as a result of the constitutional change.  According to
Kedikilwe, the two term restriction will only apply from the 1999
elections and will not be retrospective.  Neither does the resolution
prevent someone who has been president before continuing for the two
term period.  This leaves the Merahfe facing the prospect of Masire
remaining in office until 2009 should the BDP continue to maintain
electoral success.

Given that prospect, and the growing resentment in the
Merahfe-controlled north of the country that the bulk of the
Botswana's impressive GDP growth over the last ten years has
benefited a tiny proportion of the population that happen to live in
and around the southern capital, Gabarone, the possibility of a
formal split along regional and ethnic lines remains very much alive.

The danger to the BDP as it now is, is compounded by the growth in
popularity of the opposition BNF.  The BNF quadrupled its support in
the 1994 elections to come out holding 13 of the 40 available seats
in the National Assembly.  Of the remaining 27 seats, the majority
are held by the Merahfe.  Should that faction decide to leave what
looks increasingly more like an uneasy coalition than a unified
party, the 1999 elections could prove to be wide open.

BOTSWANA
ECONOMY

Many of the political problems faced by Masire's government are the
result of problems with the economy.  Despite GDP growth of around 6%
a year for the last five years and, at US$2,600, a relatively high
annual GDP per head, the figures mask vast inequalities in the
distribution of both wealth and jobs.  Some 75% of the population
live in impoverished rural areas and are dependent on the subsistence
agriculture and cattle farming that tends to be omitted from economic
performance figures.  Botswana's geography is particularly
unforgiving to farmers in that much of the countryside is made up of
the sandy lands of the Kalahari desert.

The modern sector of Botswana's economy suffers from the fact that it
is highly dependent on its minerals sector.  The country is the
world's leading producer of top quality diamonds and also exports
copper-nickel ore, coal and soda ash.  This dependence on mining
leaves the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for its
commodities.  Such fluctuations were responsible for the downturn in
growth experienced during 1992/93.

While development of the mining sector has been responsible for the
country's impressive GDP figures, distribution of that growth in
wealth has been restricted by the fact that the mining sector only
employs some 4% of the labor force.  In addition, the country's three
largest mines are in private, South African, ownership.

In the modern sector of the economy as a whole, unemployment runs at
around 25%.  In an attempt to keep the lid on the situation, the
government has become the country's largest employer, taking up some
30% of the modern sector workforce.  This has resulted in an
inefficient collection of parastatals which, according to a recent
report from the auditor general's office, are losing millions of pula
a year.  The report says that the Botswana Agricultural Marketing
Board has lost some Bp4 million this year alone and is unlikely to
continue trading without continued government support.

Attempts by the government to draw foreign investors into sectors
other than mining in order to diversify the economy and reduce its
vulnerability to commodity price changes have met with little
success.  Manufacturing still accounts for less than 10% of exports.

In addition to creating employment in the public sector and trying to
draw in foreign investment, the government actively encourages
workers to find jobs abroad.  Estimates suggest that some 40,000
Botswanans follow this path every year.  The vast majority find work
in neighboring South Africa, source of some 85% of Botswana's
imports.

While a modest rise in the price of diamonds on the world markets
this year has helped Botswana to some extent, the government fears
that if diversification does not come quickly, a possible saturation
of the market by Russian diamond sales may do considerable harm to
both the economic and political stability of the country.  Should
that turn out to be the case, the likelihood of foreign investors
moving in to the country will diminish.

COTE D'IVOIRE
POLITICS

Coming hard on the heels of  President Konan Bedie's controversial
presidential reelection of October 22, the ruling Democratic Party of
Cote d'Iviore - African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA) is sure to have
maintained, albeit at a slightly reduced level, its hold on power
following the November 26 parliamentary polls.

Unlike the presidential elections, which were subject to a boycott by
the country's two main opposition parties, both the Ivorian Popular
Front (IFP) and the Rally of Republicans (RDR) took part in the
legislative poll.  With counting completed for 151 of the 172
contested, the PDCI-RDA had secured 133 with both the IFP and RDR
claiming nine each.  The figure of 172 seats is three short of the
full National Assembly complement of 175 seats.  The three remaining
seats were not contested during the election because of the high
levels of violence that have taken place in them since the October
presidential poll.  Elections in these constituencies are to be held
at a later date.

All three of the postponed constituencies lie in the Gagnoa region,
stronghold of the IFP, and as a result of the postponements, IFP
leader Laurent Gbagbo was effectively prevented from taking part in
the elections.  According to government sources, the violence in
Gagnoa has resulted in dozens of deaths and thousands of displaced
persons.  Of the four constituencies within Gagnoa, the only one
deemed by the government to be stable enough for elections to take
place was, by coincidence, the only one in which the PDCI-RDA was
victorious in the 1990 parliamentary elections.

However, the government's success was not repeated there this time
round and the seat was won by the IFP.  Gbagbo, whose IFP joined the
RDR in a boycott of the presidential elections, described
postponements in the other constituencies as a cynical move to
prevent him from being present in the National Assembly when the
Speaker was elected.  In rejecting these claims, Interior Minister
Emile Bombet said that some 18.6% of Gagnoa voters had fled the
region as a result of the violence and, as such, were unable to vote
until peace returned there.  Be that as it may, weight was added to
the allegations of a government conspiracy against leading opposition
members by the earlier decision, by the Constitutional Council, not
to allow RDR secretary, Djeny Kobina, to stand as a candidate in the
elections.

Just days before the elections were due to take place, Kobina was
denied candidacy by the Interior Ministry on the grounds that his
parents were Ghanaian and that he could not produce a certificate of
Ivorian citizenship.  Despite his claims that the government had
deliberately lost his citizenship paperwork in an attempt to throw
the opposition into disarray, the Court upheld the government
decision and Kobina was barred from standing.  This was a similar
move to that which was used to prevent Alassane Ouattara from
standing as RDR presidential candidate against Bedie.  It was that
decision that led to the violence in Gagnoa and other regions.

Possible manipulations aside, the opposition parties were further
hindered by their inability to decide on joint candidates for the
parliamentary poll.  This left many seats with both an IFP and an RDR
candidate in the contest.  To what degree this split the opposition
vote is not clear, but it may well have had a bearing on the final
results.

Within those results, initial analysis would tend to suggest that
both the opposition parties' support remains localized.  The RDR
appears to be essentially entrenched in the north while the IFP is
best established in the center-west region of the Adzope enclave,
which includes Gagnoa.  The PDCI-RDA took all seats in the western
and south-western regions and were predominant in the central region.

Of the five PDCI ministers that stood for election only one, Alphonse
Djedje Mady, was defeated.  Francis Wodie, leader of the Ivorian
Workers Party and sole opponent of Bedie in the presidential poll,
was defeated by the PDCI candidate in the Cocody electoral district
of Abidjan.

Voting was said, by government sources, to have taken place with few
incidents, although independent reports on levels of fraud and/or
violence have, at the time of writing,  yet to be released.  It
cannot be ruled out, however, that in the light of the results,  the
opposition stance toward the government will harden and with that
will come increased , if generally localized, levels of violence.
Should that prove to be the case, a security clampdown may well
result.

Meanwhile, the December 17 municipal elections look set to be
postponed as a result of insufficient time in which to process
candidacies.

GABON
POLITICS

After 28 years as the ruling party, President Omar Bongo's Gabonese
Democratic Party (PDG) look to be increasingly at risk of losing
control of government in the forthcoming March legislative elections.

Much will now depend on whether Bongo and his party make good on
their stated commitment to ensure free and fair elections or follow
the same path as in 1990 when, in the country's first multi-party
elections, the opposition were denied victory by vote rigging and
fraud.  The ensuing hostilities between government and opposition
resulted in several changes to the country's political structure.

The Movement of National Recovery (MORENA), led by Mba Abessole and,
in 1990, the major threat to Bongo and the PDG, split into several
factions following differences of opinion over how to deal with
Bongo's devious behavior.  Abessole carried the bulk of MORENA's
support with him to his new National Assemblage of Woodcutters (RNB)
party.  The remainder followed two other factions known as MORENA and
MORENA-Originel.

Aside from the opposition split, the 1990 result also gave rise to a
series of measures aimed at reducing the Bongo's power.  Most
important of these was the move toward a new constitution that would
enshrine the necessary checks and balances to avoid a rerun of the
1990 electoral fraud.  Despite apparent agreement between the
government and opposition over the so-called Paris Accord, Bongo
continued to dispute opposition claims that the National Assembly was
the country's de facto government until the new Senate, provided for
under the French-brokered agreement, came into being.

Bongo lost his case before the Constitutional Court in mid-1995.  The
Court's decision, however, prevented the National Assembly from
ratifying the Paris Accord without a referendum.  This was duly held
and resulted in a 95% vote for ratification.  A further result of the
Court's ruling was the extension of the current period of office of
the National Assembly by six months, putting the date of elections
back until March 1996.

Going in to these elections, the PDG has 66 seats in the 120 seat
National Assembly.  The opposition Gabonese Progress Party (PGP),
headed by Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe, has 19 seats and the RNB, 17.
The remainder are taken up by minority opposition parties.

Despite the RNB's apparent position of third, it must be remembered
that the results of the 1990 elections that determined this pattern
are widely believed to bear little resemblance to the voting that
actually took place.  The fact that the socialist and secular PGP
holds the main opposition position is more to do with the PDG
tampering less with its voting figures than a genuine lead over the
RNB.

The PGP draws most of its support from the Myere ethnic group and
urban workers.  Since the 1990 elections, the Myere have become less
important electorally as high levels of urbanization have left them
as minority groupings.  In addition, many of the urban workers upon
whom the PGP has depended for support are from the Nbazi ethnic
group.  There is some evidence from the 1993 presidential elections
that this group have undergone a shift in support toward Bongo.
Although the figures for the presidential election, in which Abessole
did not take part and Bongo was returned to office, are probably as
unreliable as those of the 1990 elections, the fact that Agondjo
received little support as a presidential candidate tend to support
the theory that the PGP can no longer rely as heavily on the urban
worker vote.

Far more worrying for the PDG than the loss of support for the PGP is
the fact that much of the shift toward urban areas has been
undertaken by the Fang ethnic group which broadly supports Abessole
and the RNB.  The broad conclusion to be drawn from these factors
would tend toward being that, provided the March elections are free
from the shenanigans of 1990, the RNB should see a considerable rise
in its support, possibly even enough to force the PDG in to a
position of minority within the National Assembly.  In addition to
the Fang, the RNB also draws support from the Bapunu ethnic group and
the urban middle classes.  Unlike the PGP, whose support is largely
regional and based around Port Gentil, the RNB is nationally
organized.

The PDG's problems are compounded by the possibility of an alliance
between the RNB and Bongo's son, Ali.  Although he has not openly
criticized his father, Ali Bongo, is known to be in favor of seeing
fair elections this time round and would like to see a shedding of
the old style PDG loyalists in favor of younger technocrats.  Ali
held discussions with Abessole in the aftermath of the 1993
presidential elections and it is believed that he is not averse to
seeing his father replaced if such an event would further his own
ambitions.

Further important dimensions to Gabonese politics come in the form of
the military and the (former colonial) French government.  Both these
actors have given strong support to Bongo in the past.  While the
French government has been critical of the lack of democracy in the
country, it was not above sending military support to the President
to help in the putting down of widespread demonstrations against the
regime in 1990.  France also trains and equips the Presidential Guard
(PG) which has been responsible for violent repression of the
opposition culminating in the destruction of Abessole' home and the
MORENA radio station Liberte in late 1994.

Despite former French President Mitterrand announcing a policy of
tying development aid to democratization in 1990, no French
government has yet implemented such a policy.  Relations between
Gabon and its former colonial power have improved considerably since
the May 1995 election of French President Jacques Chirac.  So far, it
is unclear to what degree the current French government is committed
to the Paris Accord brokered by its predecessor.

Coincidentally, Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company owned largely by the
French government continues to enjoy preferential treatment at the
hands of the Gabonese government.  In yet another coincidence, French
criticism of Bongo's administration has tended to become more muted
when rumors of the loss of Elf-Aquitaine's leases have surfaced.

Should the March elections suffer from the same irregularities as
their predecessors, it remains to be seen whether the French
government will turn a blind eye, or even exercise its moral
responsibility in aiding the Gabonese security forces in restoring
stability on the streets once more.  What is equally unclear,
however, is the degree to which the military would be prepared to
subdue the opposition as a matter of course.

On balance, the outlook for the PDG and Bongo is not good.  Attempts
by the regime to construct a more broadly-based government which
includes Fang members have done little to soften opposition desires
to rid the country of PDG rule.  If the results are again tampered
with, it is next to impossible, even with French help, to see how a
period of considerable political unrest could be avoided.

GABON
ECONOMY

Unfortunately for Bongo and the PDG, Gabon's economic position leaves
little room for maneuver.  The country suffers from an overly heavy
dependence on the oil sector and high levels of imported labor,
expertise and investment.  The falling price of oil since the mid
1980's coupled with excessive government spending has left the
country in a position in which it is heavily reliant on international
lenders such as the IMF.  Adjustment programs sponsored by the IMF
have met with little success in the past as attempts to implement
austerity measures have resulted in widespread popular protests.

The latest in a series of structural adjustment programs was
negotiated with the donor organization in 1994 following a
devaluation of the CFA franc.  The effect of the devaluation has been
to push prices up by some 40% since the beginning of 1994, but the
government's hands are tied in trying to offset this by wage
increases because of the terms of the agreements made with the IMF.
The problem of inflation as a result of devaluation is brought into
sharp focus by the fact that Gabon is dependent on imports for some
85% of its food needs.

In addition to the devaluation problem, siphoning funds off to
feather the nests of the ruling classes during the boom times of the
early 1980's has resulted in a crumbling infrastructure and growing
difficulties in supplying basic health, education and housing
services to the population.  These problems, in particular the
deteriorating road links needed to maintain the supply and export of
food and agricultural produce, have resulted in a large population
shift toward urban areas.  This has, in turn compounded the problems
already faced in urban centers and has given rise to unemployment
rates of some 12%.  This latter is of acute importance socially in a
country where the average wage earner supports ten people.

The one relatively bright spot for the economy is that the timber
industry is gaining ground as a result of Asian countries restricting
excessive logging and dangerous deforestation.  Wood and wood
products are second only to crude petroleum in terms of export
earnings.

1996 Budget
The cabinet recently adopted a budget of CFAfr817 billion for 1996.
This figure represents a 5% increase on the 1995 budget of CFAfr780
billion and conforms to the three year program signed with the IMF.
Given that inflation is currently running at an annualized 15% and
GDP growth is unlikely to exceed around 1.5%, it is difficult to see
how such a budget target can be met without considerable spending
cuts taking place.

Suspicion surrounded two major fires that took place at the Queen's
Palace and Finance Ministry in Antananarivo in mid-November.  The
fire at the Palace left the building razed to the ground, and the
loss of what was an historical landmark has been described as a
national tragedy.

Perhaps more immediately significant, however, are the rumors that
the Palace fire was set deliberately to divert attention from another
fire which started in offices within the Finance Ministry.  These
were not just any old offices, but the rooms which contained files on
tax and customs investigations, as well as highly sensitive cases of
embezzlement involving several well known figures.

Four of these are alleged to have been close associates of the
outgoing prime minister, Francisque Ravony, including the finance
minister in the first Ravony cabinet.  This was the time at which
Ravony was still very much involved in the business of "parallel
financing".  The subsequent row between Ravony and President Albert
Zafy  over an end to the practice led to the former's eventual
resignation.  Another alleged subject of the files was the former
President, Didier Ratsiraka.

The Finance Ministry issued a statement following the fire to the
effect that tax and customs files had not been damaged.  Rumors are
rife, however, that the most important of these documents have
disappeared.  Several senior luminaries in Antananarivo are said to
be breathing a collective sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who replaced Ravony
following the latter's defeat in a nationwide referendum on
presidential powers in October, announced his new cabinet on November
10.

Rakotovahiny kept many of the central figures of Ravony's Cabinet in
place in what he described as a Cabinet aimed at continuity and
reconciliation.  The full Cabinet is as follows:

Interior, Decentralization and Territorial Security - Charles Severin
(retained post);
Civil Service, Administrative Reform and Labor - Henri Rakotovololona
(retained post);
Budget, Finance and Planning - Jean-Claude Raherimanjato (not in any

MALI
POLITICS

The peace that descended in the north of Mali following the August
decision of the Azaouad (Arab) Islamic Front (FIAA) to unilaterally
end hostilities with the government appears to be holding.

The FIAA was the last of the Arab Tuareg groups to be involved in
fighting the government since hostilities between the two sides broke
out in 1990.  Estimates suggest that during the intervening period,
some 50,000 Mali citizens have fled the country and sought safety in
neighboring Algeria and Mauritania.  Most recent reports suggest that
these refugees are now returning to Mali in large numbers, some
20,000 alone in the first two weeks of November.

In response to the improving security situation in the country,
President Konare, has signaled that conditions for the implementation
of the agreements made as part of the National Pact signed between
the government and Tuareg groups in 1992 are now in place.  The
return of Mali's refugees was central to the national pact and now
that this process would appear to be taking place, Konare has been
commenting on the means by which the remainder of the pact might be
instituted.

In addition to the return of the refugees, the 1992 agreements
envisaged a large degree of decentralization of powers and the
forming of autonomous Tuareg regions in the north of the country.
According to Konare, however, the government has decided that, in
order to facilitate the formation of these regions and achieve the
goal of widespread devolution, provincial boundary changes will need
to be made.

Konare has also been at pains to point out that such decentralization
will not be a quick process and has urged that dialogue on the issue
be continued for some time to come.  In addition, Konare sees the
overriding priority at the present time to be the rebuilding of the
infrastructure in the north of the country and the resumption of
basic services that have been impossible to provide during the
conflict.

The potential problem within Konare's suggestion of redefined
boundaries is that the original National Pact made no mention of
them.  Konare's response to this has been to say that fresh
boundaries are central to the task of decentralization and that the
new regions will be delineated in such a way as to allow the people
to unite along ethnic, cultural and historical bases.  What Konare
also concedes, however, is that the line-drawing operation will not
be without a mind toward the economic consequences for the country as
a whole.

So far, the FIAA have made no comment on Konare's proposals, but
should the redefined boundaries be such that the new regions are
denied access to means of economic production that the Tuareg feel
are rightly theirs to operate, there is a definite potential for a
return to conflict.  Whether this potential becomes realized or not
will depend, to a large extent, on the attitude to the changes of the
Libyan regime of Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi.  It was Qhadafi, reportedly,
who was behind the FIAA's decision to cease hostilities and recent
visits to Konare by the Libyan security minister suggest that there
is a high level of cooperation between the Mali government and the
ideological mentors of the Tuareg rebels.  Provided that this
cooperation continues, there must be a reasonable chance that the
peace in Mali will hold.

MALI
ECONOMY

Despite being offset to some extent by the end of hostilities, the
return of so many refugees to Mali will undoubtedly put pressure on
the government's coffers.  This will be of particular importance as
Mali is halfway through an IMF/World Bank sponsored structural
adjustment program (SAP).

The SAP has already caused considerable anxiety in the country, which
resulted in anti-government demonstrations throughout 1995.  The
depth of feeling about the austerity measures that have been put in
place have percolated through to the National Assembly.  This was
underlined during the adoption of the 1996 budget at the beginning of
December.  At the beginning of the year, the budget for 1995 was
passed unopposed but with one abstention.  Eleven months on, the 1996
budget still passed, but was subject to seven No votes and eleven
abstentions.

Overall spending for the financial year to end 1997 was placed at CFA
Fr380.327 billion.  Revenues are projected at CFA Fr333.853 billion,
leaving a budget deficit of CFA Fr46.486 billion.  The deficit, down
from CFA Fr54.127 billion in 1995, is to be financed from external
assistance and the mobilization of domestic savings.  The government
points out that earnings projections now show a CFA Fr524 million
surplus in relation to the 1993-1997 financial program.

While encouraging, this relatively small figure will almost certainly
be swallowed up by the government's stated intentions of rebuilding
the north of the country.  Spending to offset the effects of the SAP
in areas such as health and education has already fallen from CFA
Fr13 billion in 1994/95 through CFA Fr10 billion in 1995/96 to CFA
Fr8 billion in 1996/97.  Given the added expenditure required to
ensure a successful transition to peace, the government's chances of
staying within its target deficit must be seen as slim.

MOZAMBIQUE
POLITICS

Hostile rhetoric and equally hostile actions have marked the
relationship between President Joaquim Chissano and Mozambique
National Resistance (Renamo) leader, Afonso Dhlakama, ever since the
former's victory in Mozambique's first multi-party elections in 1994.

Over the past few months, however, the situation has deteriorated
still further.  The gap between Mozambique's two main political
protagonists has widened to chasm proportions that make the outlook
for an already fragile peace continuing through 1996 less likely than
at any time since the end of the country's 16 year long civil war.

The chances of a return to an all out civil war remain slim because
of Renamo's lack of external funding or over-border base camps, but
there is a distinct possibility that Dhlakama is moving toward making
good on his February 1995 threat to split the country by establishing
Renamo control in the five central provinces in which the party won
electoral victory.

Mid-October saw Nobre Meque, district Administrator of Maringue in
Sofala province, abandon his office and the district capital after
reportedly being mistreated by Renamo members.  Meque was originally
nominated by Renamo and appointed by the government, but has
subsequently been accused by the former rebel group of collusion with
the ruling Frelimo party.  In addition to Meque, it has been reported
that several other Maringue district officials have also been forced
to flee.

Other reports, some of which have been supported by independent
verification, have surfaced of Frelimo officials being beaten and
arrested by Renamo members in Gorongosa district (also in Sofala
province) and Dombe.  The violence committed against these officials
suggests that at least some Renamo members have chosen to forego
continued political argument over the government's decision to place
Frelimo officials into previously Renamo-controlled areas in favor of
direct action to remove them.

If so, a deal of significance can be given to Dhlakama's recent
admission that there are indeed arms caches still hidden throughout
the country and that the process of demobilization of former rebels
remains incomplete.

Despite continuing to refute suggestions that Renamo is considering a
return to war, these latest admissions contradict earlier statements
by Dhlakama which denied the presence of hidden arms.  In dealing
with this contradiction, Dhlakama now says that he would like to see
the arms caches that do exist collected and destroyed.  Given that,
it would seem reasonable to assume that Dhlakama could institute such
a process, but there appears to be some confusion over who has
control of these loose weapons.

Dhlakama claims that they are caches that belonged to the former
Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM), but gives no
suggestion as to who is in control of them now.  The State
Information and Security Service (SISE), on the other hand, says that
they are in the control of Renamo units which are unwilling to give
them up.  Just who is telling the truth is unclear.  What does seem
clear, however, is that there are arms available and, increasingly,
there is the possibility that they may again see active service.
As if to raise the temperature still further, rumors of an alleged
coup attempt by former Renamo soldiers now serving in the Mozambique
Defense Armed Forces (FADM) were rife during November.  The rumors
were denied to have any substance by both Prime Minister Pascoal
Mucumbi and FADM General and former Renamo rebel, David Mongero.
According to Mongero, the FADM was concerned by the rumors and did
not want the image of former Renamo soldiers now serving with FADM to
be tarnished by suggestions that they would take part in any such
action.

For his part, Dhlakama went much further in his denial of an alleged
coup plot, accusing the government of putting the rumors about in
order to justify the security clampdown he says is taking place in
the country.  Much of the violence that has recently taken place is,
according to him, the result of provocation by members of the Frelimo
controlled Mozambique Police Force as opposed to being spontaneous
acts of aggression by Renamo supporters.  He does however, concede
that in his visits around the country he is constantly being asked
why, when Renamo won majorities in the central and northern provinces
of Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Tete, the government has
insisted on putting Frelimo governors into office.

There is no suggestion on Dhlakama's part that the frustrations
caused by this situation have led Renamo members to switch from
political lobbying to direct action.  The fact that the question is
being asked, however, does underline the feelings amongst rank and
file Renamo members that they are being denied a voice in the
supposedly democratic system they expected in return for laying down
their weapons.

These feelings have been accentuated by the government's continued
refusal to allow nationwide local elections.  Despite the government
claiming, with some justification, that it has no money to hold such
elections, Renamo members suspect a thoroughly different motivation.
As far as Renamo and Dhlakama are concerned, the government is simply
plain scared to hold nationwide elections for fear of being badly
defeated by Renamo.

Given the startling success of Renamo in capturing 112 of the 250
legislative seats in the October 1994 polls, there would appear to be
some justification for this theory.  Renamo further sees the policy
of installing Frelimo officials in important provincial positions in
the disputed provinces as a means by which the government is
attempting to extend its influence prior to eventual local elections.
In this manner, goes the argument, the government hopes to limit the
damage done to Frelimo when the local elections do come.

How realistic this assessment is remains to be seen, but the
situation looks set to worsen following the government's decision to
withdraw the local election bills from parliament in response to what
it described as a "lack of consensus" within the National Assembly.
According to the announcement which accompanied the decision, the
Assembly will now establish a working committee which will, in
cooperation with the government, set new dates for the elections.

This does not mean, however, that the elections will necessarily now
take place simultaneously throughout the country as demanded by
Renamo.  The government has made clear its preference for a staggered
approach to the elections and is unlikely to permit deviation from
that.  In addition, the likelihood is that they will not now take
place as scheduled during 1996, leaving an even longer period before
frustrated Renamo supporters have the opportunity to test their
theory of a local government landslide.  Dhlakama has asked the
international community to give Mozambique financial help in order to
speed the electoral process along.

The success of such a plea will depend in large part on what happens
in the meantime.  If attacks on Frelimo officials continue, Chissano
has warned that there are (unidentified) voices within the government
that are calling for a tough line to be taken.  A possible descent to
a state of emergency cannot be ruled out.

Commonwealth Membership
Meanwhile, a fresh row has broken out between the government and
Renamo over Mozambique's admission to the Commonwealth.  Mozambique
was admitted as a "special case" to the organization in mid-November
despite being neither a former British colony, nor an anglophone
country.  Commonwealth secretary-general, Emeka Anyaoku, explained
the decision to accept Mozambique's application for membership when
he pointed out that the country has had associations with the
Commonwealth since 1975 when it joined in sanctions against the
minority white government of the then Rhodesia.

Reactions to Mozambique's admission were swift.  Renamo led the
condemnation on the grounds that it was not consulted over the
decision to apply.  According to Renamo member of parliament (MP)
Jafar Gulamo, given that Mozambique has no anglophone tradition the
country's admission posed a fundamental question and, as such, should
have been subject to wide public discussion and possibly a
referendum.

Gulamo went on to say that Renamo would, however, give its full
support to the formation of a lusophone (Portuguese-speaking)
commonwealth because the Portuguese language was one of the few
binding factors within an otherwise varied country.   He criticized
the former colonial power, somewhat unfairly, for its lack of
cooperation with Mozambique to date and called on the new Portuguese
government to do all in its power to neutralize the effects of the
new membership.

Opposition ire aside, Mozambique's membership of the Commonwealth
should bring much needed economic rewards, especially given that many
of its neighbors are former British colonies and, as such, already
long standing members.  In addition to advantages in terms of trade,
the country should also benefit from technical assistance through the
Commonwealth fund for technical cooperation.

Work has now begun on refurbishment of the Cabora Bassa hydroelectric
scheme in Mozambique.  The scheme, operated by a joint committee with
members from Portugal, South Africa and Mozambique, has now secured
the necessary funding from both committee members and the European
Community.  No date has yet been set for the completion of the work,
but when finished, the scheme is expected to produce some 2,000 MW
which will be supplied to countries throughout the southern African
region.

Meanwhile, higher import costs as a result of devaluation of the
metical have been blamed by the Mineral Resources Ministry for the
18% rise in fuel prices over the last quarter of 1995.  As a result
of the increases, the first since June 1995, diesel will cost
MM3,500/liter, paraffin MM2,690/liter and gasoline MM5750/liter.
News of the changes will come as a disappointment to the country's
industrial sector which, according to Industry Minister, Oldemiro
Baloi, is on line to outperform target growth for 1995 by some 1.5%.
The original estimate for the sector's growth has been revised from
2.5% to 4.0%.

Banking Sector
President Chissano inaugurated the Mozambique International Bank at
the beginning of November.  The bank has an initial capital of US$10
million and shareholders include Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues
- Banco Portugues do Atlantico group with 50%, the Mozambican
government with 32.5% and the Mozambican Insurance Enterprise with
12.5%.  The remaining 5% is taken up by the Community Development
Fund.

The new bank will have its headquarters in Maputo and will open two
branches, one in the capital and one in the city of Beira -
incidentally in Sofala province.  Former Prime Minister, Mario
Machungo is the bank's chairman.

TANZANIA
POLITICS

Tanzania's first multi-party presidential elections finally came to a
close on November 19 with the reruns of the earlier faulty elections
in Dar es Salaam.  Opposition attempts to have the entire electoral
process nationwide declared null and void were rejected by the High
Court and in a result which came as no surprise to anyone, Benjamin
Mkapa of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) was deemed to have won
the presidency with 61.8% of the valid votes cast.

Prior to the Dar es Salaam polls, nearly all opposition parties
declared a boycott in response to the elections throughout the
remainder of the country, which are now widely accepted as having
been riven by fraud.  This boycott was subsequently declared illegal
by the National Electoral Commission on the grounds that the
opposition candidates could not boycott elections in 3% of their
constituencies after having competed in the remaining 97%.

Be that as it may, opposition leaders and parties went on to boycott
the new parliament and the inauguration of the new president.  So
strong were the indications of widespread vote tampering that many
foreign diplomats joined the opposition in failing to attend the
inauguration ceremony.

While individual diplomats may have succeeded in sending a message of
discontent over the proceedings to the CCM, the community of
international donors at large has not taken any action against the
ruling party's apparent willingness to cheat in order to protect its
30-year long reign in power.

A joint statement issued by Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany,
Ireland, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, the USA and UK following the
election results said that the donors believed that the result was in
line with the wishes of the people of Tanzania.  Given the sheer
amount of substantial evidence suggesting that the result bore
little, if any, resemblance to the actual voting that took place, it
is difficult to determine how these countries can be sure of such an
assertion.

Equally ineffectual was the statement released by the UN, which
provided the umbrella under which some 450 observers oversaw the
elections.  The organization recommended to the authorities that they
"correct anomalies" that had been found to be present.

It would be unfair in the extreme to suggest that international donor
and observer countries have an easy task in these situations.  The
end of the one party state is proving problematic throughout
sub-Saharan Africa.  It is questionable, however, whether it makes
long-term sense for those who promote democracy then to abdicate the
responsibility they have taken on.

The message that appears to be being sent to African countries in the
throes of forming democratic systems is that provided they "go
through the motions" of a democratic election, whether or not it is
actually democratic doesn't really matter.  This is a dangerous
message in a continent where the hope and belief in democracy is so
young and fragile.

The eventual outcome of smiling ruefully as if at some wayward
youngster is more likely to be the death of democracy in Africa than
its promotion.  Too many countries teeter on the brink of a return to
civil war for the international community to blithely disregard the
undermining of democracy.  If democracy is perceived to be a sham,
what realistic alternative is there for former rebel groups such as
Mozambique's Renamo, or Angola's Unita, other than a return to arms?

So far, Tanzania's international donors, who provide some 70% of the
country's national budget, have given little indication as to any
financial penalties that may ensue from the election irregularities.
The only government yet to break the silence has been the Dutch.
They have decided to resume balance of payments support suspended as
a result of CCM corruption in 1994.  Another resounding victory for
democracy.

The New Government
To some extent, all this is now academic.  Mkapa and the CCM are in
office for the next five years.  Shortly after his inauguration on
November 23, the new president announced that, given the CCM's
overwhelming victory in the general elections, he saw no requirement
to include members of the opposition in his government.

In line with this and his earlier pledge to slim down the Cabinet
from 29 to 22 ministers by merging some ministries, the new Cabinet
was announced at the end of November.

The vice-president is Omar Ali Juma and the Prime Minister, Frederick
Sumaye.

Under the President's office there are two Ministers of State, Mateo
Karesi and Danile Yona, the latter of which is responsible for
planning.

The vice president's office has one Minister of State, Mohammed Seif
Khatib and the Prime Minister's office has two, Bakari Mbonde and
Juma Mkangaa.  The remaining Ministers are as follows:

Home Affairs - Ali Amer Mohammed; Finance - Simon Mbilinyi (former
principal secretary to the Ministry of Finance);  Industries and
Trade - Abdalla Kigoda;  Communications and Transport - William
Kusila;  Agriculture and Cooperatives - Paul Kimiti; Health - Zakia
Meghji (who retains her position); Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation - Jakaya Kikwete (formerly minister for finance);

William Shija (former information minister); Water and Livestock
Development - Pius Ng'wandu; Natural resources and Tourism - Juma
Ngasonga; Lands, Housing and Urban Development - Gideon Cheyo;

Anna Abdalla (former Minister of State in the vice-president's
office); Labor and Youth Development - Sebastian Kinyondo; Community
Development and Women's Affairs - Mary Nagu; Justice and
Constitutional Affairs - Bakari Mwapachu and Defense - Edgar Maokola
(a former deputy minister).

TOGO
POLITICS

The opposition Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) reacted with dismay
to Prime Minister Edem Kodjo's early December reshuffle.  The CAR's
Yao Agboyibo described the reshuffle, in which the number of cabinet
ministers was increased from 21 to 23,as a massive entrance into
government of the barons of the country's former sole ruling party,
the Rally of the Togolese People.

Agboyibo went on to say that the reshuffle came at a particularly
difficult time as the National Assembly is set to begin debates on
the formation of a National Electoral Commission and Constitutional
Court.

It would appear that, in making the cabinet changes, Kodjo has caved
in to pressure from President Gnassingbe Eyadema to install as many
of his cronies as possible prior to the formation of bodies that will
oversee the development of democracy in the country.  The new cabinet
is as follows:

Foreign Affairs and Cooperation - Barry Moussa Barque;

UGANDA
POLITICS

Despite reports of talks between President Yoweri Museveni and Libyan
leader, Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi, on ending the dispute between Uganda and
neighboring Sudan, tension around the border region looks to be
returning to the levels experienced at the end of 1994.  This latest
worsening of relations began in early November when, according to the
Sudanese government, Ugandan troops took part in a military attack on
the southern border areas in collusion with the Sudanese rebel
organization, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).

Sudan has made similar claims in the past, which have been matched in
frequency by Ugandan accusations of cross-border attacks into its
territory by the Sudan-based rebel forces of Joseph Kony's Lord
Resistance Army (LRA).  The situation plunged to alarming depths at
the end of 1994 when Sudanese aircraft bombed a village in the north
of Uganda.  Qhadafi intervened at that time as well, and the
so-called Tripoli Declaration was signed by both governments.  Under
the terms of the declaration, both countries agreed to stop aiding
the other's rebel forces, but the agreement fell apart following a
further massacre inside the Ugandan border by soldiers of the LRA.
Although Sudan denied involvement, Museveni unilaterally broke off
diplomatic relations.

Since the two countries pulled back from the brink of war, Sudanese
government forces' have experienced considerable successes in
advancing into areas formerly controlled by the SPLA and its splinter
group, The South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM).  These Sudanese
advances have virtually wiped out the SSIM, but completing the
mopping up operation against the SPLA is proving more difficult than
Sudan's President Omar Beshir would like.  Ending Sudan's civil war
in the south was one of Beshir's pledges when he ousted the former
Sudanese government in a coup in 1989.  His signal failure to do so
has caused considerable political pressure on him at home and he
would dearly love to see a resolution to the problem.

In the SPLA, the Sudanese forces have met an enemy that, despite
being overwhelming outnumbered and having suffered some stinging
defeats over the past two years, refuses to lie down and die.  The
reason the SPLA has been able to string things out so long, according
to Sudan, is that Uganda is providing the rebels with arms and
technical assistance.

According to Sudan, the latest attacks inside its territory were
carried out by the Fourth Ugandan Division aided by tank crews from
Eritrea, which President Museveni requested during Eritrean
President, Isayas Aferwerki's, recent visit to Uganda.  Eritrea broke
off diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1994 after accusing the Sudan
regime of training Islamic fundamentalists to destabilize the
country. The evidence of Ugandan and Eritrean involvement in the
latest attacks is said to have come from prisoners captured by
Sudanese forces. Museveni, however, denies the involvement of Ugandan
troops and maintains that Ugandan interest in the Sudan's civil war
is limited to observation only

Ominously, President Beshir has said that having overcome this latest
attack by the SPLA/Ugandan forces, the Sudanese army is now intent on
"repaying the visit of those who visited".  A further deterioration
in the situation cannot be ruled out.

ZAIRE
POLITICS

A date for the elections that will bring to an end the country's five
years of transitional government is still not set.  It would now
appear, however, that such elections may be held sooner than was
expected after the government's August decision to extend the period
of transition by a further two years.

That decision caused widespread dismay among opponents of President
Sese Mobutu who want to see a return to the premiership of Etienne
Tshisekedi, the prime minister ditched by Mobutu in 1994.  In
response to the decision members of the Sacred Union of the Radical
Opposition and Allies (SUR), which has Tshisekedi at its head,
carried out a series of ghost-town operations in the country aimed at
forcing a government rethink.

Such actions appear to have borne fruit.  The Electoral Commission
responsible for the organization of the elections was presented to
the Transitional Parliament at the end of November.  The Commission
consists of 44 members, half of whom are drawn from the Political
Forces of the Enclave (FPC) which supports Mobutu and the remaining
half from SUR.  According to government sources, the Commission would
have been ready for presentation earlier had it not been for the SUR
squabbling over who should sit on it.  The SUR is divided into two
main factions, that which supports a return of Tshisekedi and that
which supports Frederic Kibassa-Maliba.

Now that the Commission is in place, there is a reasonable chance
that the elections, originally scheduled for July 1995, will take
place within the two year extension period.  This view is supported
by the allocation of funds to do just that in the 1996 draft budget.

Mobutu claims to see this as good news.  According to him, he is the
only politician in Zaire who has been pressing for early elections.
Those within the SUR that have cast him as a dictator who is
deliberately stalling the path toward democracy are apparently
misguided.  Nothing could be further from the truth in fact.  Mobutu
welcomes the prospect of international observers for the elections
and believes that it is the opposition, not he, that is afraid of the
eventual outcome of the polls.  Just how long this new-found
enthusiasm will last remains to be seen, but Mobutu is doubtless
aware that the divisions within the opposition do, indeed, enhance
the likelihood of him retaining power after the elections.

Meanwhile, Zaire's budget estimates for 1996 were submitted to the
transitional parliament in mid-November.  The draft projects a
balanced budget of Zz5,700 billion.  To achieve the 70% rise in
revenue in real terms to meet the budget target, Zz1,428 billion
would be raised by an 88% increase in customs and excise duties and a
further Zz1,350.4 billion by way of a 107% hike in local taxes.  Oil
revenue is expected to grow by 53% to Zz698.2 billion and earnings
from the General Quarries and Mines and Bakwanga Mines Companies is
expected to reach ZZ678.3 billion despite a slowdown in diamond
production.

Expenditure is set to rise by 54% in real terms.  Interestingly, the
expenditure figures include a Zz606.9 billion package for the holding
of elections.  This is expected to be supplemented by external
assistance.  Other major expenditures within the draft budget include
Zz178.1 billion in capital expenditure and Zz1,178.1 billion in
public debt payments.

JANUARY 1996

BANGLADESH
POLITICS

Prime Minister Zia finally succumbed to the pressure of the
opposition parties and handed in her government's resignation on
November 24.  The battle with the opposition parties - Awami League,
Jatiya and Jamaat-e-Islami - began in December 1994 when, led by the
Awami League, they refused to participate in a by-election, accusing
the government of blatant corruption, of winning the 1991 general
election by fraud and of perpetrating the same practice in an earlier
by-election in which the ruling Bangladesh National Party (BNP) was
victorious in a known Awami League stronghold.  All 142 opposition
members then withdrew from parliament and started a campaign of
"rolling" strikes or hartal in order to force the government's
resignation, the installation of a neutral caretaker government, and
the calling of a fresh general election.

But Prime Minister Zia has not gone down without fighting.  Despite
the economic disruption, and violence, of the hartals, she has kept
her government in office with only her own 138 BNP party members
sitting in parliament.  As a result, although she has finally been
forced to call an early general election, she has still managed to
serve out almost all of her term of office which was due to end in
March of this year anyway.  Moreover, although President Biswas
accepted her government's resignation he has not given way to
opposition demands for a caretaker prime minister.  Instead he has
asked Ms. Zia to stay on as caretaker through to the new election.

The end game in the struggle between government and opposition began
in late September when the hartal program was stepped up with a call
for a 48-hour strike on October 7 in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong,
Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, to be followed by a four-day
nationwide shutdown from October 16.  There was the usual violence.
At least one person was killed and more than 40 injured in the
general strike.

In an attempt to regain the initiative, Prime Minister Zia carried
out a minor reshuffle of her cabinet on October 18.  She then
announced by-elections for all 145 vacant opposition seats in
parliament to be held on December 15 and invited the opposition
parties to demonstrate their commitment to democracy by contesting
for their own seats.

The opposition response was to call for a countrywide blockade of
road, rail and water transport on November 6 to be followed by a
12-hour general strike across the country on six consecutive days
from November 11.

The transportation blockade brought the country to a virtual
standstill and at least 200 people, police and demonstrators, were
injured in numerous clashes in which the police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets.  The security situation deteriorated further when the
general strike began on November 11.  As far as is known there were
no fatalities.  However a number of grenades and home made bombs were
thrown and at least 50 people were injured, including the leader of
the Awami League, Motia Chowdhury and his wife.

Presumably recognizing that any attempt to hold by-elections for the
opposition seats would almost certainly even more widespread
violence, with the danger that security could break down completely,
Prime Minister Zia handed in her resignation saying she looked
forward to free and fair elections in which the opposition parties
would play a full part.

She argued that the whole electoral process had been cleaned up under
her administration.  The election laws have been extensively amended
and the electoral Commission strengthened to prevent any government
or other force from illegally influencing the election process.  In
addition, she said, her government had made provision to set up a
committee of judges for immediate arbitration if a party, individual,
or candidate is accused of violating the election law or rules.  New
electoral lists has been formulated to check rigging and identity
cards are to be used to verify the registration of voters.

The prime minister also stressed the difference between the
constitutional governance of the country at the last general election
and this.  In 1990, Bangladesh had an executive presidency under
which an unelected person could be appointed vice-president.  Under
such circumstances it was within the realms of possibility for a
person with no popular mandate to become the executive head of state.
Now, as a result of the 12th amendment to the constitution approved
by parliament and referendum in 1991, the executive presidency had
been replaced by a parliamentary system in which the prime minister
was head of government and only an elected member of parliament could
occupy the post of prime minister.

The fundamental difference between her and the opposition parties,
she claimed, was that she supported the current system of governance,
while they wanted to return to the executive presidency system, an
impossibility under the current constitution.

The response of the opposition parties to all this is not yet known.
Neither is the election date.  Both are critical.  The opposition
parties will clearly be cheered by the fact that the prime minister
has finally caved in, but will still be anxious that she remains head
of government and, in their view, still able to exercise a malign
role in the election process.  With that in mind they will be looking
for the election to be held sooner rather than later.  Prime Minister
Zia on the other hand will probably want to delay as long as
possible.

At the moment the outcome is impossible to predict, but we would not
be surprised if President Zip's BNP still emerged as the largest
party in the new parliament.

Expulsions
Dhaka has responded angrily to Pakistan's November expulsion of
Bangla speakers to Bangladesh, rejecting Islamabad's claim that they
are Bangladeshi nationals.  The Pakistani move hits at the heart of a
long-running sore in Bangladeshi-Pakistani relations - the status of
the Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh.

Under an agreement made in 1974, Pakistan undertook to accept as
Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims who were still resident
in the former East Pakistan and who did not accept the newly
established Bangladesh as their country.  Under the agreement
Pakistan did allow an initial  150,000 Biharis, who had blood
relations in Pakistan, to immigrate.  However, no Bihari Muslims have
been allowed into Pakistan since 1974, leaving some 250,000 stranded
in Bangladesh.

During an official visit to Pakistan in April last year, Prime
Minister Zia reminded her hosts of the 1974 commitment.  In addition,
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds
for the rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis, asked Pakistan to let
the stranded Biharis come back.  This was probably the background to
the arrival of some 700 Bangladeshi immigrants in Pakistan in
October.

However, these people were immediately ejected.  Then, on October 31,
Pakistani interior minister, Nasirullah Babar, told the National
Assembly that the government intended to "throw out" all illegal
immigrants.  As for the OIC's appeal to take back the stranded
Biharis, he said "Let the Arabs take the Biharis" as there is plenty
of land to settle them in the UAE, Iraq or elsewhere in West Asia.

The reasons for Pakistan's reluctance to accept any more Bihari
Muslims and its ejection of those already resident in the country
probably have far more to do with the troubles in Karachi and Sind
province generally than with fears of overpopulation.  A large number
of the Bangla-speaking Pakistanis are sympathetic to the Mohajir
Qaumi Movement (MQM) in urban Sind.  Getting rid of them reduces the
size of the MQM's support base.

BANGLADESH
ECONOMY

Although Prime Minister Zia has done her best to pump up an economic
success story, an election could hardly have come at a less
propitious time in economic terms.  While, the free-market policy she
launched four years ago did have some striking early successes, it
has run out of steam of late, forcing a reversal of many of the
original policy initiatives.

Thus, while the prime minister boasted in October last that the GDP
per head had risen from US$170 in 1991 to some US$236 in the current
financial year, she omitted to mention that his had been undermined
by a huge jump in the inflation rate from 1.8% in 1993/94 to over 6%
currently.  Moreover, the blanket inflation figure masks even greater
rises in prices of essential commodities, which hit harder on the
poor, and the poor make up the greater part of the population.

One major cause of the sharp rise in inflation has been an enormous
jump in the money supply as a direct result of the free market
policy, or, rather, its inadequate management.

When the free market program was instituted, interest rates were cut,
the system of Letter of Credit margins for imports was withdrawn, and
the maximum ceiling on project loans was abolished.  The overall aim
of these measures was to encourage investment, by making borrowing
cheaper, which would in turn create new large employment
opportunities.  The overall effect would be to bring a new dynamism
into the economy.

Between June 1991 and April 1994, the bank rate was reduced nine
times, from 9.75% to 5.5%.  Over the same period the interest rate on
savings accounts, which ranged between 8% and 11.5%, was reduced to
4.5%.  The interest rate on fixed deposits, which ranged between 10%
and 13.75%, was reduced to 5%.

The package was well received by the international community.  The
mobilization of domestic resources was increased, the foreign
exchange rate stabilized, foreign exchange reserves increased, the
deficit in foreign transactions reduced, and domestic savings
increased.  Against this background the annual GDP growth averaged
4.4% between 1991/92 and 1993/94 while the inflation rate was brought
down from 9% to under 2%.

But now things have started to go wrong.  The government was right
that lower interest rates would encourage borrowing.  The problem is
it had no means of exercising control over how the borrowed money was
to be used.  Over the four years of the economic plan BT145 billion
has been withdrawn from the country's banks and financial
institutions in the form of loans.  In 1994/95 alone these loans
amounted to BT85 billion.

However, neither the government nor the central bank has any reliable
means of measuring where this money has gone.  For example, imports
have risen from Bt135 billion in 1991/92 to Bt270 billion in 1994/95,
but the central bank has virtually no information on the pattern of
this growth.  It does not know which sectors of the economy are
responsible for the increase or why. The effects, however, are clear
- foreign exchange reserves fell by US$900 million in the first four
months of the current financial year.

What is known is that the growth in the money supply - up from 10% to
18% over the four year period - has outstripped the increase in the
volume of trade and investment.  The obvious conclusion is that the
money taken in loans from the banks has been spent on consumption
goods rather than invested in the productive sectors of the economy.

Now, in order to cut back on the money supply and rein in inflation,
almost all the free-market reforms have been reversed.  The currency
has been devalued twice, the interbank rate raised three times from
4.5% to 6.5% with consequent rises in the interest rates on savings
accounts and fixed deposits in banks, a 25% margin rate for Letters
of Credit has been reimposed, and a maximum loan limit of Bt250
million has been imposed on all large industrial projects.

The problem for the central bank is that a strategy of using interest
rates alone to solve the crisis may not be enough.  Up to 40% of the
bank loans already made must be regarded as non-performing or lost.
On top of that the upcoming general election will inevitably mean an
increase in spending, further boosting the money supply and inflation
rate.

INDIA
POLITICS

At a federal level, the political classes are now entirely consumed
with the upcoming general election to the lower house of parliament,
the Lok Sabha, with the Bharaiya Janata Party (BJP), in particular
confident that it can make major inroads into Congress Party support.
The BJP formally re-elected L.K. Advani as its leader for a second
successive term on October 21 last.  Advani was unopposed.

The term of the present parliament expires on July 8, which makes
June the last possible month for the election.  At the time of
writing no election date has been fixed, but it appears that most the
opposition parties - the BJP, communist Party of India (CPI),
communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), Janata Dal and the Samata
Party - favor a date in February, immediately after the fasting month
of Ramadan, with elections for some assemblies to be completed by
March 10.  However, with its prospects uncertain, Congress (I) wants
to hold out as long as possible.  With that in mind, an election
sometime in the second half of April looks the most likely outcome.

Although the parties differ on the date of the election, there is an
apparent consensus for a single-day poll in states and for polls for
the federal parliament to be held over a maximum of three days.

Jammu and Kashmir
The government's elections plans have been thrown into dome disarray
by the decision of the Electoral commission on November 10 not to go
ahead with elections in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir.

President's rule in the state was due to expire on January 17.  It
was a principal part of the government's overall strategy to have
elections held in the state and a new state government installed well
before then.  It was a multi-target strategy.  First, the holding of
the elections would have demonstrated, both at home and abroad, that
the central government was sufficiently on top of the security
situation to conduct the elections.  Second, it would have undermined
growing international pressure on India by providing a democratically
elected state government that was not committed to full independence
or absorption by Pakistan.  Third, it would have provided a
tremendous boost to the government's authority just ahead of the
federal elections.

Despite the continuing widespread violence and terrorism in the
state, hopes that an election would be held were raised on October 25
when the National Conference party (NC), which formed the state
government until President's rule was imposed on January 19, 1990,
held its first public meeting for six years.  Over 2,000 people
turned up for the meeting which was held in the apple township of
Sopore, until recently a militant stronghold.

Prime Minister Rao immediately initiated talks with the NC leader and
former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, with
the aim of securing his agreement to the government's election and
devolution plans.  However, the talks broke down on November 2, with
Farooq sticking to his demand for a return to pre-1953 status for the
state.  This conferred residuary sovereignty on Jammu and Kashmir in
respect of all matters except defense, foreign affairs and
communications.  Rao's devolution package, on the other hand,
specifies that the status of the state should be worked out after the
election in consultation with the election state parliament.

After the talks deadlock, Dr. Farooq said the NC would boycott the
"the election farce", With that he put himself in line with virtually
every other political party in India, both inside and outside Jammu
and Kashmir, except Congress (I).  Despite this near unanimous
opposition and a frightening security situation, Prime Minister Rao
was determined to press ahead and announced that elections would be
held in the state in mid-December.

He appeared not to have reckoned on the three-man Electoral
Commission, however.  After visiting the state, the Commission
unanimously declared that "the sum total of factors in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir are not consistent with the conduct of a fair and
free election".  Rao had gambled, and lost.

This leaves the government with precious little room for maneuver in
the state.  The daily murder toll is at alarming proportions in the
border areas; Pakistan has succeeded in internationalizing the issue
with India coming under increasing foreign criticism for its handling
of the situation and its alleged abuses of human rights; and, last
but not least, there is now increasingly hard evidence of direct
Pakistani involvement in the fighting.  This is exactly the mix that
brought Pakistan and India to war in 1965 and 1971.

In the meantime, the government has embarked on the massive task of
building a barbed wire security fence along its entire border with
Pakistan.  The fence has already been completed in the Punjab and the
fencing of the 1,035 kilometer border between Rajasthan state and
Pakistan  is planned to be completed by March 1996.  Fencing of the
190-kilometer Kashmir border will then be undertaken.  According to
the government, the border fence in the Punjab has already been
effective in deterring infiltrators.

Despite the precarious security situation in the state, the federal
government claims that the agricultural and allied sectors in Jammu
and Kashmir have recorded strong growth over the past six years.
According to official figures, foodgrain production rose to 1.95
million tonnes during 1994 from 1.45 million tonnes in 1991/92.  Over
the same period, rice production in the state increased from 550,000
tonnes in 1991/92 to 807,000 tonnes; and fertilizer production from
68,000 tonnes to 73,000 tonnes.   Fruit production also rose during
the period.  Apple production has risen from 79,200 tonnes to 1,900
tonnes, while the area under apple orchards has expanded from 46,000
hectares  in 1974/75 to 83,000 hectares in 1993/94.  The per hectare
yield of applies, the main fruit grown in the Kashmir Valley, has
risen from 1.12 tonnes in 1974-75 to 10.04 tonnes in 1993-94.

In addition, the state is to have its first-ever industrial growth
center, to be located in Ompura.  Also, the Small Scale Industries
Institute relocated from Srinagar to Jammu due to militancy is to be
moved back to Srinagar.

Civil Disorder
Civil disorder, frequently descending to the level of political
terrorism, continue to make parts of India, particularly in the
north, extremely dangerous places in which to live.  On October 31, a
mass demonstration by Sikhs in the capital, New Delhi, resulted in
some 200 arrests.  The demonstration was called to protest against
the federal government's apparent inaction in punishing anyone of
significance for inciting the riots against Sikhs in 1984, following
the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh guard.

In particular, the demonstrators demanded the arrest of the Congress
(I) member of parliament from Outer Delhi, Sajjan Kumar, and former
federal minister H.K.L. Bhagat, for their alleged roles in the riots.
On November 10, a bomb blast in the capital injured an estimated 19
people.

On November 13, Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East-West
Airlines, India's first private carrier, was shot dead by
unidentified persons in Bombay.   on November 13.  Wahid was shot
outside his office and was dead on arrival at hospital.  He started
the airline in 1992.

As for violence elsewhere in the country:

Manipur
In November, suspected activists of the underground People's
Liberation Army (PLA) shot dead a the district manage of the
government's Food Corporation of India in the state capital, Imphal.
After his death, police found a threatening letter in his office from
the Revolutionary People's Front, the political wing of the PLA for
not paying Ir500,000 to the group.

Tripura
Insurgents, believed to belong to the National Liberation Front of
Tripura (NLFT) killed six people in separate incidents in the first
two days of October.  On October 3, four policemen were killed in an
ambush.  On October 4, five people, including three members of the
ruling CPI-M were killed in separate incidents and at the end of the
month there were three more murders in separate incidents.

However, in November, the government claimed that "all 157 rebels of
an another, unnamed, "military movement" surrendered to the
authorities in after an appeal from the state government.  The
rebels, led by a Captain Murari Mohant Saha, turned in their weapons
and ammunition.

Gujarat
There were violent demonstrations in Gujarat in early October
following a split in the BJP when Shankar Sinh Vaghela, the leader of
a dissident BJP faction allied himself and 48 of his supporters with
Madhya Pradesh.  More than 5,000 BJP activists, reportedly led by BJP
parliament member A.K. Patel and state Health Minister Nalin Patel,
attacked the building where the dissidents were staying, kidnapping
one of them.

Assam
Bodo tribal militants, operating under the banners of the Bodo
Security Force (BSF) and the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)
killed at least 22 people - security personnel and civilians -  in
October and November in sporadic attacks.

Uttar Pradesh.
Governance in the state was thrown into chaos in October, just ahead
of municipal elections scheduled for November, when the BJP withdrew
its support for the four-and-a-half month old Bahujan Samaj Party
government.  The BJP move appeared to have been prompted by the
murder of its leader in the state, Babu Ram Gupta, by unknown
assailants in Muzaffarnagar on October 8.

The withdrawal of the BJP forced the resignation of the state's chief
minister, Ms Mayawati, on October 18.  With no party in the state
able to command a majority, president's rule was imposed on October
18.

As usual, violence ensued.  On October 24, about 34 people suffered
minor injures when a bomb exploded at a market near Allahabad, and in
November two people, including a police officer, were killed in an
explosion in Jhansi.

However, the municipal elections went ahead as planned, with the BJP
emerging as the clear winner.  Also in November, the federal
government confirmed that it is willing to grant autonomous region
status to Uttarakhand.  There were violent incidents in the Garhwal
mountain region in early October during a strike to press demands for
Uttarakhand to be granted separate statehood.

Anti-foreigner Sentiment
So far there have been no reported attacks on foreigners, outside of
Jammu and Kashmir, but there is a rising tide of resentment against
"Westerners" among militant Hindu groups.  In late October, the New
Delhi unit of the militant Hindu Shiv Sena group has threatened
"direct action" against the recently opened Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet in the city if it does not leave the country immediately.  The
organization alleges that the multinational food chain is hurting the
religious sentiments of the Hindu people by indulging in the sale of
beef products.

This was followed up at the beginning of November by a conference,
organized by the Karnataka state farmers' association, which called
for multinational companies to be "driven out" of India.  Criticizing
the government's "globalizaton" policy, the conference speakers
claimed the multinationals were "exploiters" who would displace the
local people and aggravate the unemployment problem.  There was also
a call for a national movement to pursue the fight against them.

Against that background, the November decision by the state
government in Maharashtra to renegotiate the US$2.8 billion Dabhol
power project contract with Enron produced an enormous sigh of relief
from both the federal government and foreign investor community
alike.

State Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena-BJP government
unilaterally canceled the agreement with Enron Development
Corporation (EDC) in August last, after they succeeded the Congress
(I) government that negotiated the deal.

The decision dented confidence in federal government's ability to
pursue its energy sector development program, in which foreign
investment was supposed to play a major role, particularly as
neighboring Rajasthan then canceled its talks with Enron over a major
solar power project.  Enron's response to the Maharashtra decision
was to seek redress in law by opening arbitration proceedings against
the state to achieve either a declaration from the government that it
would meet its contractual obligations or pay damages to the project
partners.

INDIA
ECONOMY

India's GDP grew by an estimated 6.2% in the financial year 1994/95,
to an estimated IR2,474.89 billion, against a growth of 5.3% to
IR2,453.06 billion in 1993/94.

The latest forecast for the Industry Ministry puts industrial sector
growth in the 1995/96 year at over 10%.  Industrial growth recovered
to 6% in 1993/94 and rose to 8.2% in 1994/95.  This year's impetus is
coming principally from strong export growth.  Currently the
industrial sector is contributing around 75% to total exports, which,
in turn, are growing at an estimated 20%.

In its 'World Economic Output' report, released on October 4, the IMF
said that recovery in India was now well established with increased
supply responses from structural reforms.  The report said that by
tightening monetary policy early this year inflation had been brought
down to single-digit levels.  It also remarked favorably on the
supply response to structural reforms and capital growth.

It forecast that the GDP could rise by 5.5% this year, with exports
continuing to grow at double-digit rates and private investment
remaining robust.  However, the IMF also advised that stronger action
be taken to reduce the fiscal deficit further and that structural
reforms be speeded up to reduce the risk of a renewed rise in
inflationary pressures.  So far, the fiscal deficit has been reduced
from 8.8% of GDP in 1992/93 to a projected 5.6% in the current year.

Privatization
The federal government accepted 167 bids for shares in four top
public sector undertakings (PSUs) - Container Corporation of India,
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL),
and the oil giant ONGC at the beginning of November.  The companies
form the first round of disinvestment of PSU shares in the current
financial year.

All valid bids which had quoted at prices equal to or above the
reserve price for each PSU were considered and the offers were
accepted in descending order of the price offered.

Inward Investment
USA
The USA is the largest foreign investor in India.  US investment
proposals increased from US$0.35 billion during the years 1975 to
1991 to US$1.7 billion during the two subsequent years and the first
quarter of 1994.

The bulk of the investment proposals were approved during 1993 and
the first half of 1994.  During this period, investment proposals
worth US$1.3 billion were approved.  In 1991-93, 804 collaborations
with the USA were approved.  However, the pace of investment appears
to be slowing.  In the first half of the current financial year, US
investments touched US$1 billion, compared with US$1.2 billion in the
same period of the 1994/95 year.  Bilateral trade this year is
expected to exceed US$8 billion.

According to a report by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce last
year, US companies intending to invest in India in the current year
include ICMC Power Consortium Inc. a joint venture comprising
Westinghouse Electric Corp. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. and Sergeant
and Lundi.  The consortium plans to set up a power project and a
harbor complex at Cuddalore to facilitate coal imports for the power
sector.

Areas identified for potential Indo-US collaboration are
telecommunications, power, biotechnology, chemicals and allied
products, computer hardware and software, electrical and electronics
equipment, food processing, food products for children, health care
products, hybrid seeds, information technology, natural food products
with low cholesterol, petrochemicals, power generation,
semi-conductors and transport equipment.

The USA also has the highest number of technical collaborations in
India.  From the period July 1991 to July 1993, the USA accounted for
352 technical collaborations out of the total of 1719, i.e. 20% of
the total.

Meanwhile the government has said it is actively considering opening
up the insurance sector to foreign investors.  A regulatory authority
has already been set up to oversee the operations of insurance
companies and the decision on when to open the insurance sector is
expected to be finalized soon.

Legislation was passed last year to allow 49% private equity capital
in public sector banks, with the government retaining the controlling
51%.  Several public sector banks, including the State Bank of India,
have floated shares to raise capital from the public market.

Japan
Last November Japan announced its intention to participate in a
venture capital fund, the South Asia Regional Apex fund (SARA), to
help nurture local small businesses in India.  Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) will join forces in the fund with
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an arm of the World
Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  Both OECF and the IFC
will each put N7.5 billion into the fund, while the ADB's
contribution will be N4.5 billion.

The SARA fund expects to invest an average N20 million in small
business projects through 10 state-level funds to create 100,000 jobs
over a 15-year period.  The money will go mainly to venture companies
planning stock listing.  The fund will recover its investment by
selling stock in the firms when they go public.

India and Japan have also agreed to set up a mechanism to resolve
outstanding bilateral trade issues.  It is hoped this will lead to an
acceleration in Japanese investment in India.

Non-Resident Indian Investments
Over the past four years, NRIs have made direct investment of around
US$1 billion.  In the first five months of 1995/96, NRIs have placed
about US$232million worth of foreign direct investment in India,
three times the amount during the whole of 1992/93.

So far, approvals for NRI direct investments total US$4 billion, 30%
of total foreign direct investment approvals of US$13.6 billion.
Total NRI deposits so far are in the region of US$17.5 billion and
have been coming in at the rate of US$1.7billion a year since
1992/93.  To date US$4.4 billion are invested in India under the NRI
scheme launched in 1970 and US$6.3 billion under the FCNR (A) scheme
of 1975, which will terminate by August 1997.  The new FCNR (B)
scheme has attracted US$4.04 billion and the non-resident
non-repatriable (NRNR) scheme has brought in US$2.7 billion.

In order to boost NRI investment in the services sector, the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI - the central bank) has granted general permission
to NRIs to subscribe to company memoranda and articles of association
and to take up shares of Indian companies up to the amount of
Ir10,000 with effect from November 1, last year.  The permission
applies if the proposed venture pertains to any activity except
agriculture and plantations.  Previously, this general permission was
available only for NRI investments in industrial activities.

Tourism
Tourism currently ranks third - after the gems, jewelry and
ready-made garments sectors - in terms of foreign exchange earnings.
A total of 1.91million foreign tourists visited India in 1994/95, a
growth of 2.14% over 1993-94.  Foreign exchange earnings from tourism
in the whole country grew by 13.16% from Ir65.09 billion in 1993/94
to Ir73.6561 billion in 1994/95.

As a result, the India Tourism Development Corp. (ITDC) has surpassed
all previous achievements with an 80% increase in profits before tax,
grossing Ir430.17 million during 1994/95.  ITDC earned Ir280.37
million after tax, an increase of 132% on the figure for the previous
year.  The company has declared a dividend of Ir50.67 million for
1994/95 - the highest dividend it has ever paid.  Turnover increased
by 25% from 1993/94 to Ir2.36 billion.

The Corporation attributes the bulk of the improvement to its hotels
division - the Ashok Group - which had an increased turnover of
Ir11.45 billion and net profits of Ir220.71 million.

The violence in the Kashmir Valley has had an effect, costing the
sector an estimated 25% of its revenue.  However, the government is
hoping that this will be compensated for by a rise in tourism in the
other northern states.  Despite continuing sporadic violence in
Assam, Tripura and Mehalaya, the government has withdrawn the
Restricted Area designation from them.

INDIA
FINANCE

Despite the uplift in exports, India's trade deficit jumped to
US$1.976 billion in the April-August period last year, from a deficit
of US$798.53 million in the same period of 1994. Imports in August
are estimated at US$2.924 billion, compared with US$2.24 billion in
August 1994.  The import growth during the month was 30.53%.  The
increase in petroleum, oil and lubricant (POL) imports was 2.54%.
Non-oil import growth was 38.99% in the month.

Exports in the April-August period are estimated at US$12.302 billion
compared with US$9.613 in April-August 1994 - a growth of 27.97%.
The level of exports in August 1995, at US$2.452 billion, is the
highest is the highest monthly figure so far in the current financial
year.  It is also 20% higher than exports of US$2.106 billion in
August 1994.  Imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at
US$14.278 billion as against US$10.411 billion in the corresponding
period of 1994.

POL imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at US$2.762
billion compared with US$2.263 billion during April-August 1994.  POL
imports increased by 17% during this period.

Reserves
The nation's foreign exchange reserves, excluding gold and special
drawing rights (SDRs), fell sharply for the second month in a row at
the end of October last by US$3.052 billion to US$17.757 billion.
The foreign exchange reserves stood at US$20.809 billion at the end
of the 1994/95 financial year.

The slow accretion in foreign exchange or the down slide in reserves
is mainly accounted for by increased imports under the liberalized
regime, according to the Finance Ministry.

Meanwhile, Russia agreed to settle about 900 Indian claims amounting
to Ir800 million, during a meeting between the two sides in Moscow at
the end of October.  The claims relate to export contracts,
non-exports, including personal savings with Soviet banks, pensions,
fees and third country contracts.  They have been pending since
December 1992 when the former Soviet Union collapsed.

Exchange Rate
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was forced to intervene again on
October 26 to halt the slide of the rupee against the US dollar.  The
dollar opened at Ir35.50 and gradually went up to a high of Ir35 on
the interbank foreign exchange market.

At this stage, the RBI intervened by selling dollar at a rate lower
than the prevailing market price.  After the intervention, the rupee
firmed up and closed at Ir35.50/US$.

Banking sources attributed the fall in the rupee value to short-term
economic conditions arising out of a rise in imports and government's
debt payments.  As a result of demand-supply gap, market forces are
pushing the dollar upwards.

PAKISTAN
POLITICS

Prime Minister Bhutto's policy of encouraging members of the former
international Islamic fundamentalist Mujaheddin that fought the
Russians in Afghanistan to use Pakistan as a base to wage an intifada
(her expression) against India's "occupation" of Kashmir, is possible
coming back to haunt her.

Not only is the violence in Karachi - almost certainly fueled by arms
and expertise gathered in the Afghan conflict - continuing unabated,
but the government's near "open-door" policy to militant
fundamentalists from the Islamic world undoubtedly contributed to the
ease with which Arab terrorists were able to mount their devastating
attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad on November 19.

The embassy was wrecked by two explosions, which killed a total of 18
people and injured 60.  Three Egyptian militant groups in Cairo
claimed responsibility for the attack and the evidence so far is that
it was carried out mainly, if not completely by foreign nationals.
Talk in Islamabad is of a team of eight, mostly Egyptians, belonging
to an extremist Islamic organization, Takfir wal-Hirjah.  However,
there has been talk of Sudanese, Jordanians and Afghans being
involved as well.

The group is believed to have entered Pakistan via Afghanistan and
may have had internal logistical support inside Pakistan from either
the immigrant Arab community in Peshawar or from the International
Islamic University in Islamabad.  After the bombing Interior Minister
Nasirullah Khan Babar said that the University had become a "hideout
of terrorists".  President Leghari, however, dismissed the statement
saying there was no evidence of University people taking part in the
bombing.

Expulsions
The government did come to a belated recognition of the dangers of
giving house-room to so many potential fanatics just before the
embassy bombing, with Babar announcing a crackdown on illegal
immigrants in October.  However, the move was weighted entirely on
those immigrants who might add to the security collapse in Karachi
and Sind province generally. Those groups who support or engage in
the struggle against Indian forces in Kashmir remained untouched as
did the religious seminaries, packed with Arab students, that
fulminate against the West and preach a doctrine of Islam
unadulterated by 1,500 years of history.

It was only after the bombing that the government ordered the
expulsion of all Arabs without legal documents.

The 600-700 immigrants expelled by the government in October were all
Bangladeshis.  Interior Minister Babar said they had been expelled
because they had fake documents.

The more probable reason is that the government believes that the
majority of them are at best sympathetic to, and at worst actual
supporters of, the ethnic Indian Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) that is
wrecking such havoc in urban Sind.  According to the government there
are some two million illegal immigrants in Karachi.

The move is also a slap in the a face to Bangladesh over the
contentious issue of the Bihari Muslims.  In 1974, Pakistan agreed to
accept as Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh
who did not accept the new country as theirs.

Between then and 1992, Pakistan did admit around 150,000 Biharis, who
had blood relations in Pakistan, into the country.  However, it has
not officially admitted any more since then, leaving some 250,000
Biharis stranded in Bangladesh..

During her state visit to Pakistan earlier last year, Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia Rahman asked her hosts to make good on
their 1974 commitment.  In this she was backed up by the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds for the
rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis.

The Prime Minister and the OIC got there reply in October when
Interior Minister Babar said that if they were so concerned the Arab
countries should take the Biharis as there was plenty of room for
them in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and elsewhere in West Asia.

Military in Politics
The role of the military in the governance of the country has come to
the fore again with the announcement that the government had foiled
an alleged coup attempt by a group of military officers.

The significance of the coup bid, which was reportedly discovered in
September and announced in November, was to be carried out by a group
calling itself Amirul Momineen (leaders of the faithful).  It was led
by Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, a former defense attachi in
the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi where he was expelled as a
spy, and Brigadier Mustansar Billa.  They led a group of officers,
including three colonels, and civilians, reportedly numbering around
30 in all.  The group is also believed to have links with ex-generals
and right-wing politicians.

It has been claimed that the plotters were caught by chance at a
meeting on September 28 when they were putting the finishing touches
to their plans to "eliminate all senior commanders of the Pakistan
Army, before taking over key government installations.

The army and government have attempted to play down the seriousness
of the coup attempt.  However, it is significant, not only in that it
was apparently thwarted purely by chance, but also in that it
highlights a growing dissatisfaction in the military with Prime
Minister Bhutto's government (many senior officers much prefer her
predecessor Nawaz Sharif).  It also indicates a division in the
senior ranks of the military between those who are prepared to put up
with an elected civilian government so long as they and theirs are
taken care of, and those who want the army to return to its near
traditional role as direct political master.

The message for Prime Minister Bhutto seems fairly clear.  If she
wants to keep the premiership, and possibly her head, she will have
to pander to the military to an even greater extent than she has
already.  That could mean even greater direct involvement in Kashmir,
with all the dangers of an all-out war with India that such an
escalation would bring.

Political Terrorism
With talks between the government and the MQM still stalled, the
situation in the city remains as murderous as ever with tit-for-tat
killings by MQM-Altaf group activists and the security forces taking
place on a daily basis.

The more notable atrocities include the killing of four MQM prisoners
while in police custody in October; the murder of Syed Ehsan Ali
Shah, a brother of the Sind Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah, with
two other people on November 23; and the killing of 15 members of the
same family in a separate incident on the same day.

Fourteen people were sentenced to death  for terrorist acts on
November 27.

Political murder is not, however confined to Karachi, or even to Sind
province overall. Ali Ahmed Soomro, a former member of the ruling
Pakistan people's Party who had fallen out of favor was gunned down
outside his home in October (Prime Minister Bhutto's brother-in-law,
Nasir Hussain was questioned by police over the incident and
released).  In November, the provincial minister of Balochistan, Ayub
Buledi, the provincial election commissioner Faratullaha and their
driver were all shot dead in Turbat.

Political Corruption
The campaign to "get" former prime minister and opposition Pakistan
Muslim League (PML) leader Nawaz Sharif continues apace.  After
getting out from under a treason charge in September last year,
Sharif is now being undermined by the arrest of his brother, Shahbaz
Sharif, and a new pile of fraud allegations against his family.  In
order to ensure that the public at large recognizes the solidity of
the case being made, Interior Minister Babar outlined the allegations
on television on November 23.

According to Babar, the Sharif family fraudulently acquired a total
of Pr6.16 billion from 31 banks and financial institutions through
the use of political pressure during the period 1983-1993.

The government's case is that the money had been pressured out of
Pakistani banks and financial institutions by 19 companies owned by
the Sharif family.  A particular case in point is the family owned
Ittefaq Foundry (IF).  Records of the New York Branch of the National
Bank of Pakistan apparently show that IF opened letters of credit
with a number of nationalized banks in order to finance the import of
scrap metal worth US$17.84 million.

Not only did IF never meet any of its obligations on the letters of
credit, it also used political pressure to force the banks to adjust
the amount of the letters of credit by securing loans from the banks.
The scrap was sold on at a profit and none of the loans have ever
been repaid.

It is also claimed that during 1990-1993, IF sold machinery to 11
sugar mills for a total of Pr1,334 million.  The banks that financed
the deal were never repaid.  Moreover, political pressure was used to
force the sugar mills to buy machinery from IF and to force the banks
to make loans only to those mills that did agree to buy machinery
from IF.

Other scams allegedly indulged in by the family include the illegal
purchase of travelers' checks.  According to Babar, the family had
arranged the purchase of US$1.13 million worth of travelers' checks,
which were used as collateral "in a dubious manner" for securing
heavy loans.  Shahbaz Sharif is also accused of taking loans from
banks by forging signatures of other partners in his companies, like
Mian Khalid Diraj.

The problem for Nawaz Sharif in all this is that if his brother goes
down, Nawaz will almost certainly follow suit.

Afghanistan
The breakdown in relations with the regime of President Borhanoddin
Rabbani remains as deep as ever.  On November 22, the Pakistani
government stopped issuing permits for the transport of goods and
foodstuffs to Afghanistan until further notice and on November 28 it
expelled two representatives of the Hezb-e Wahdat faction, which is
allied to the Rabbani government.  These latest expulsions bring the
total of those expelled since the sacking of the Pakistani embassy in
Kabul in September to 19 Afghan diplomats and 11 officials, plus
Masud Khalili, the Afghan president's special representative in
Islamabad.

PAKISTAN
ECONOMY

The government has dismissed as baseless the general chorus of alarm
which greeted its decision to devalue the Pakistani rupee by 7% at
the end of October.  The decision was not, she argued, forced on the
government by the domestic economic situation, but by the fact that
both Bangladesh and India had devalued their currencies.  Given the
competing nature of these economies, vis-`-vis Pakistan, Pakistan had
no alternative but to follow suit in order to maintain its
competitive edge in world markets.

Whatever the reason for devaluation were in these countries, she
argued, the fact that Pakistan needed to devalue by only 7% was an
indicator of its relative economic strength.  Indeed, she claimed,
rather than experiencing an economic decline, as some domestic
observers maintained, the economy was actually going from strength to
strength, recording a consistent rise in the GDP over the past two
years.

Any damage to the economy, she said, was being done by the media,
whose reports were responsible for more than US$300 million in
capital being withdrawn from the banks and stock exchanges prior to
the devaluation.  This capital flight, she said, also reflected the
evil intentions of the vested interests who have no concern about the
national interest, but will do anything to serve their own interests.

For its part the government said the media had seized on the fact
that the 6.9% GDP growth target for 1994/95 had not been met (GDP
growth in the year was actually 4.7%, compared with 3.8% in 1993/94)
and had blown it up out of all proportion.  This failure, it
intimated, was a minor, almost technical matter, due to the cotton
sector failing to meet its production target, as it has for the past
three years, to some other crops had been damaged by rains and
floods, and to problems in the textile sector.  Despite all this,
industrial output grew by 5% in 1994/95 against 4.5% in 1993/94.

A rather more accurate summation of the situation was given by
President Leghari in an address to parliament on October 29.
Although he too dismissed all talk of an economic crisis, he did
admit that economic performance in 1994/95 was "mixed".  On the
positive side inflation remains under control, the GDP is expanding,
and fiscal and monetary policy should enable the inflation rate to
less than 10% in the 1995/96 year.  In addition, the rapid growth in
exports had resulted in a substantial increase in foreign exchange
reserves.

On the downside, the president admitted that reserves had begun to
decline, but that the most pressing problem was the fiscal deficit.
This stands somewhat at odds with the government's claim of success
in bringing the deficit down from 8% of GDP in November 1994 to 5.5%
of GDP in 1994/95.  The deficit is forecast to fall to 5% in 1995/96,
with the GDP expanding by 6.5%.

According to the government, its borrowing on the domestic market had
been reduced to Pr30 billion from Pr60 billion in 1994, and it has
repaid foreign loans of US$200 million, for the first time.  With
the privatization of the Kot Addu power plant, the repayment of
another US$700 million in foreign debt will be repaid.  The total
foreign debt now stands at around US$30 billion.

In November, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (EEC)
announced a number of initiatives to promote growth.  The support
price of wheat was increased from Pr160 to Pr165 per 40 kg to help
boost to agricultural growth.  In addition, the limit on loans
without collateral was raised fromPr50,000 to Pr100,000 to help the
development of the small business sector.  Action was also taken to
boost the industrial output of some products that suffer from
smuggling.

Inward Investment
Foreign investment rose by US$0.65 billion in the 1994/95 year to
US$1.53 billion. The main investing countries are the USA, Canada,
the UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

As for the current, 1995/96, year, the flow of foreign investment
more than doubled in the first three months (July-September 1995)
compared with the first quarter of 1994/95, to US$250 million,
despite an "erratic" stock market.  Of the total investment, more
than US$220 million was in direct investment as compared with US$106
million in the first quarter of last year.

According to the Board of Investment, the private foreign investment
flow in 1994/995 amounted to over US$1.5 billion, compared with
US$640 million in 1993/94..

SRI LANKA
POLITICS

The government launched its second and final offensive - Operation
Rivieresa (Sunshine) - against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in the Jaffna peninsula on October 1.  In announcing the
attack the deputy defense minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said the
government had no intention of slowing or aborting the war, but
intend to press on to finish it by the end of the year.  The actual
result has been less decisive than the government had hoped..

In terms of conventional military confrontation, the offensive has
been highly successful. Outnumbering the LTTE in men and materiel, as
well as in training and tactics, the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), made
steady advance towards the city of Jaffna throughout October, tough
its progress did slow significantly as it drew nearer to its target
and LTTE defense became more and more desperate.  Well over 1,000
LTTE fighters were killed in the operation and the SLA finally
entered Jaffna proper on the morning of November 20.

However, the LTTE has refused to surrender or to negotiate.  Despite
the loss of the city which formed the capital of the LTTE's Tamil
Eelam, the organization's leader, Veluppillai Prabhakaran, has
dispersed part of his forces to the eastern coastal area with the aim
of continuing a guerrilla war against the state, while in Jaffna
proper up to 1,000 still continue to engage the SLA.

The LTTE's ability to wreak havoc well outside of Jaffna was
demonstrated, again, even during the SLA's offensive.  On October 20
it launched an attack on the strategic Kolonnawa and Urogodawatte oil
installations.  Fortunately for the government, the terrorists missed
their main target, the gasoline tanks in zone two of the 95 acre
site, and set fire to two kerosene tanks and a diesel tank instead.
On November 11, LTTE suicide bombers set off two explosions near the
SLA's headquarters in the capital, Colombo, killing at least 20
civilians and injuring 30 others.

The fact that a crushing military defeat for the LTTE in Jaffna will
not necessarily mean the end of its guerrilla and terror operations,
has always been recognized by the government.  Its hope, however, is
that establishing its control in the Jaffna peninsula will enable it
to install a democratically elected provincial Tamil  government in
the area.  This coupled with generous development aid, should, it is
hoped, undercut popular support for the LTTE.  Without extensive
grassroots support, the LTTE will find it increasingly difficult to
mount its guerrilla and terror operations.

To the government's credit it has gone out of its way to secure the
support of the democratic Tamil parties for this program.  In their
turn, these parties, particularly the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front (EPRLF) and the Eelam people's Democratic Party
(EPDP).  The EPDP, in particular, has suffered a great deal at the
hands of the LTTE.  In October, the EPDP claimed that the LTTE had
killed more than 3,000 Tamil political activists since 1986.  Of
these, 1,700 were members of the EPDP, while most of the remainder
belonged to the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO).  Those
killed included the leader of TELO, Sri Sabaratnam, the former leader
of the opposition A. Amirthalingam, and the human rights' lawyer Sam
Thambimuthu.  The LTTE stepped up its offensive against its rivals in
1987 after the Indo-Sri Lanka pact was signed.

Despite its confident progress on the military front, the government
very nearly suffered a major political embarrassment at the beginning
of November when the ubiquitous Doctor G.L. Peiris handed in his
resignation.  As deputy prime minister, deputy finance minister,
justice minister and constitutional affairs minister. Peiris's loss
could well have thrown the government into turmoil.

The cause of the upset was a row between Peiris and the Secretary to
the Treasury A.S. Jayewardene over the settlement of a long-pending
controversy over a hotel.  Not surprisingly, President Kumaratunga
refused to accept Peiris's resignation, and the matter was settled
when Jayewardene resigned instead.

With the LTTE resolved to continue to prosecute a guerrilla war, the
government has looked again at the organization's financing.  This
was brought into sharp relief in early November when two Catholic
priests - Saverimuttu Jebanason, secretary to the Bishop in Jaffna,
and Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius of the Faxel Center of the Catholic
Church in nearby Kilinochchi - were stopped on their way to Jaffna
and found to be smuggling large amounts of cash and possible
bomb-making equipment.

The Revered Saverimuttu Jebanason was found to be carrying Sr11.27
million, while the Reverend Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius had Sr2.2
million.  The money, together with copper wire and batteries, was
found in the false bottoms of their suitcases.

Subsequent police investigation found that the two men had a total of
Sr24 million (Jebanason Sr19 million and Pius Sr5 million) in various
bank accounts.  This money, the police allege, was the result of a
laundering operation to channel funds from various organizations to
the LTTE. Part of the money found in the bank accounts, Sr1.5
million, appears to have originated from a series of bank robberies
carried out by an LTTE member, Kuttimani, in the early 1980s.
Kuttimani was killed while in detention during the prison riots in
Colombo in 1983.  However, it now appears that before his death he
entrusted at least Sr1.5 million of the money he stole to the priests
to be invested in a finance company.

The authorities also believe that members of the Catholic clergy in
are involved in a multi-million rupee foreign exchange racket to
channel funds to the LTTE.  They have now asked for Interpol
assistance to pursue the investigation.

According to government sources, around US$8 million and Sr10 million
was collected from various foreign and local individuals and
organizations for the LTTE over the past few years.  They also claim
that another important source of income for the LTTE is drug
trafficking in the USA Europe and Asia.  According to the Foreign
Ministry, about 481,000 Sri Lankans went abroad after 1983, the
majority of them Tamils and LTTE sympathizers, many of whom
contribute to the LTTE.

Of these expatriates, 60,000 are in Italy, 25,000 in Switzerland,
30,000 in Denmark, 60,000 in Canada, 20,000 in the USA, 5,000 in the
Netherlands, 60,000 in France, 70,000 in the UK, 65,000 in Germany
and 53,000 in India.  In future, fund raisers who maintain bank
accounts in support of the LTTE can be indicted and bank accounts
frozen under the emergency regulations.

SRI LANKA
ECONOMY

The economy continued to improve during the first seven months of
1995, despite rising defense expenditure, largely as a result of a
20% increase in exports, compared with the same period of 1994.
Exports in the first seven months of last year US$2.072 billion.

Amazingly, tourism was also up, with a total of 280,000 tourists
visiting the country by the end of August.  The rise in exports and
tourism receipts boosted the foreign exchange reserves to Sr136,868
by the end of August.

The manufacturing sector grew by 9% in real terms last year and
accounted for 95% of the overall growth in the GDP. Overall, the GDP
is estimated to have grown by 5.5% last year.

This year, the government is aiming for a GDP growth of over 6%.
Total investment in relation to GDP is projected to rise to about 27%
from 25.5% last year.  The agricultural sector is expected to grow by
3%, while exports are projected to grow by Sr44,592 million, with
industrial exports rising by 18% to Sr183,104 million.

SRI LANKA
FINANCE

However, with defense expenditure expected to have soared to Sr30-33
billion by the end of last year against a 1995 budget estimate of
Sr24 billion has thrown the government's finances off balance.  The
additional defense expenditure, coupled with higher than expected
costs for the government's wheat subsidy and rising debt service
costs are expected to have pushed last year's budget deficit up to
around 9.3% of GDP, compared with the budget target of 7.5% of GDP.

As a result, even if the military operations against the LTTE
continue to go in the government's failure, Sri Lanka is going to
have to live with high budget deficits right through to the end of
the century.

The 1996 budget, presented to parliament on November 8, projects
revenues at Sr18 billion.  On the expenditure side, a combination of
cuts and savings of Sr4.6 million produced a gross spending figure of
Sr273.4 billion.  Against this there is Sr185.9 billion in revenue
and grants, resulting in an overall deficit of Sr87.4 billion.  This
is to be met by foreign borrowings of Sr32.7 billion and domestic
non-inflationary financing of Sr54.7 billion.   Overall, the
government is projecting a budget deficit of l7.8% of GDP this year,
to be followed by deficits of 6.6% in 1997 and 5.1% in 1998.

The budget package includes a package of tax concessions, reductions
in excise and customs duties, measures to develop the capital market
and investment, and a salary hike to civil servants.  The defense
levy introduced in 1992 and currently standing at 4.5% will continue
at that level for through this year, but under a new name, the
national security levy.  It will however be reduced to 2% for imports
of capital goods.

The tax exemption threshold has been increased from Sr60,000 to
Sr100,000.  This will cost the government Sr40 million in lost
revenue.  The intermediate tax rates have also been reduced - the
first Sr35,000 within the tax bracket will be subject to a 10% rate,
the next bracket 15%, and the next two brackets to 25% and 35%.

The budget introduces a new consolidated welfare program in place of
the existing welfare programs.  Under this, the most vulnerable
families will be given a monthly income transfer of Sr1,000 per
family, while other poor families are given Sr500 per family.  There
are also incentives to sustain high production in the agricultural
sector.

High priority will continue to be given to public enterprise reforms
with a view to encouraging inward investment in the main sectors of
the economy.  Peiris noted that last year's foreign aid commitment of
US$843 million was confirmation of foreign confidence of the
government's handling of both the economy and the military conflict.

On specific allocations, fundamental economic facilities are to
receive Sr14,900 million and ports' expansion Sr5,500 million. Large
financial allocations have been made for transportation,
telecommunications, power and highways.  The estimated expenditure on
fundamental facilities is Sr6,920 million; agriculture Sr4,800
million and the development of social infrastructure (education,
health and youth affairs) Sr7,160 million.

     Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.

     Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.
     Yomiuri
     GINOWAN, Okinawa
     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said here Tuesday that the government
will consider a U.S. proposal to build an offshore heliport in Okinawa
Prefecture to replace Futenma Air Station.
     Hashimoto visited the prefecture for the first time as prime minister at
the invitation of Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota.
     Hashimoto first held talks with Ota in Ginowan, home of the U.S. Futenma
Marine Corps Air Station. Following the meeting, Hashimoto delivered a speech
to local politicians and business leaders.
     "The United States offered a new proposal to conduct a joint feasibility
study for building a removable heliport at sea," Hashimoto said in the speech.
"I think this is an option worth considering."
     The United States is proposing an ocean heliport off Urazoe, Okinawa
Prefecture.
     After returning from Okinawa Tuesday evening, Hashimoto said that he will
propose a Japan-U.S. joint discussion on the new heliport plan during summit
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for Sept. 24.
     It is highly possible that at the summit meeting the two leaders will
agree to study the heliport proposal.
     Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo that he had also considered the
offshore heliport plan because negotiations between the two countries over
replacement of Futenma Air Station were experiencing difficulties.
     Japan proposed that the heliport in the air station be integrated into
Kadena Air Base, but the United States has been hoping to buildt it at Camp
Schwab in the northern part of Okinawa Prefecture.
     Hashimoto said he is also considering a removable floating heliport
because it causes less harm to the environment than a man-made island.
     In his Okinawa speech, Hashimoto expressed regret at the central
government's lack of efforts to ease Okinawans' suffering over the dominant
presence of the U.S. military. The prime minister vowed continued effort to
reduce U.S. bases in the prefecture.
     Regarding economic development of the prefecture, Hashimoto proposed
constructiing an international convention center combined with a shopping
center.
     Hashimoto's visit came on the heels of Ota's decision to abide by the
prime minister's order to proceed with legal procedures to force Okinawa
landowners to renew leases for U.S. bases.
     In his speech, Hashimoto congratulated Ota for "making a very difficult
decision as governor."
     Hashimoto added that, "Throughout history, Okinawans have undergone a
series of hardships. We, Japanese citizens, need to earnestly admit that we
did not necessarily make our best effort to understand the historic burden and
feelings of people in Okinawan, who played a key role in maintaining peace and
balance between our nation and Asia."
     The prime minister said, "We will also try to improve situations in the
prefecture by reviewing various issues concerning the Japan-U.S. Status of
Forces Agreement."
     "The U.S. proposal pertaining to a possible offshore heliport is worth
considering despite the fact that many obstacles must be solved before such a
plan is realized," Hashimoto added.
     Regarding the various plans to promote Okinawa's economy, Hashimoto
proposed building a health center and facilities designed for long stays. He
also proposed a marine and agricultural research institution to conduct
various studies under the subtropical climate.
     Also proposed were an international convention center combined with a
tourism facility and shopping mall, as well as a special "multimedia"
district.
     Ocean heliport
     The ocean heliport proposed by Hashimoto as a possible option to replace
the Futenma Air Station is generally known as a "mega float." The offshore
structure, which would be built with several huge iron blocks and anchored to
the seabed, would not be a permanent facility.
     According to the government, such a facility has major advantages as it
could be easily dismantled, would not cause noise pollution or cause red sand
to flow into the ocean, which was triggered in the past by construction of
base facilities.
     Japan has insisted that the Futenma air base be merged with the Kadena
airfield, while the United States has demanded that a new facility be built at
Camp Schwab. Both sides rare deeply divided.
     Task force to be formed
     The government Tuesday formally decided to establish a new task force in
charge of discussing basic plans for the development of Okinawa.
     The government decided on the creation of the Okinawa Policy Council at
Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.
     Hashimoto promised the establishment of a task force in his meeting with
Ota on Sept. 10.
     The task force will debate various policies concerning the prefecture,
including economic development and the base issues.
     All Cabinet members except Hashimoto and the director-general of the
Hokkaido Development Agency will take part in the task force.

     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party

     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party
     Yomiuri
     A committee set up Tuesday to organize the launch of Minshuto (Democratic
Party) attracted 37 legislators who are set to join the new party.
     The participants included 16 lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party,
eight from New Party Sakigake (Pioneers), five from Citizens Action League,
six independents and two House of Councillors members from the SDP. Two of the
participants also are deputies for two Diet members.
     The inaugural meeting of the organizing committee named Yukio Hatoyama to
head a group that will devise strategies for the upcoming lower house
election.
     Hatoyama and Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan were chosen as
co-directors of the organizing committee.
     The committee will hold a meeting Sunday to celebrate the Democratic
Party's inauguration. The party's election strategy headquarters hopes to
produce by then a list of candidates who will run in the upcoming general
election with the party's official backing, according to committee officials.
     SDP leaders held several meetings Tuesday to discuss procedures for
allowing party members to join the Democratic Party.
     The SDP earlier said that all party members would be allowed to
participate in the Democratic Party. But SDP chief Tomiichi Murayama told
participants at the meetings that he had changed his mind and opposed
Hatoyama's reported plan to screen SDP candidates who hope to run on the new
party's ticket in the election, sources said. Hatoyama's idea could mean that
some SDP members would be admitted into the new party but not receive its
endorsement in the election.
     Some SDP members have insisted on fielding candidates with the support of
their party. That scenario could split the SDP, according to observers.
     Tuesday's inaugural meeting of the Democratic Party's organizing
committee marked a new phase in the party's creation.
     Nonetheless, Hatoyama and Kan, both chief promoters of the Democratic
Party, remain split over some issues, such as whether and how to urge Sakigake
members to join the new party, and its relationship with the administration of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
     Shoichi Ide, Hiroyuki Sonda and other Sakigake officials Tuesday told Kan
and Hatoyama that they would not join the new party.
     Hatoyama has said that he does not want Sakigake leaders to participate
in the new party, while Kan has insisted that the new party include
mid-ranking and experienced politicians, which would open the door to Sakigake
veterans.
     Sakigake scrambles
     New Party Sakigake (Pioneers) faces the desperate task of shoring up its
rapidly weakening position, as junior members are certain to leave Sakigake to
join the ranks of the planned Democratic Party.
     During a meeting Tuesday, Sakigake officials adopted proposals regarding
promoting administrative reform in an effort to impress voters with their
policies during the election campaign.
     Sakigake's plan calls for individual politicians and parties to join
hands in establishing after the election an administration dedicated to
streamlining administrative operations.

     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port

     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port
     Yomiuri
     AOMORI
     A ship from France carrying 620 tons of uranium for processing at a
uranium enrichment plant began unloading its cargo Tuesday at Mutsu Ogawara
Port in Rokkashomura, Aomori Prefecture.
     Japan Nuclear Fuel, Ltd., which announced the ship's schedule and the
amount of uranium on board as instructed by the Science and Technology Agency,
chartered the 5,600-ton Eastern Hero.
     After the ship docked at about 7:20 a.m., 18 rods were loaded on a
trailer and transported to the nearby enrichment plant.
     Although police were on full alert when the rods were unloaded, there
were only about 10 protesters at the enrichment facility, which has been in
operation since 1992.
     The protesters were calling for a complete stop to the use of nuclear
energy.
     The cargo includes 50 uranium cylinders, and unloading will continue
until Thursday.

     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods

     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods
     Yomiuri
     The Health and Welfare Ministry plans to simplify the system of
monitoring medical products so that pharmacists and nurses--not just
doctors--can file reports with the ministry.
     The ministry will revise the 1967 system because they received no reports
on the side effects of the unheated blood products that infected many
hemophiliacs with HIV, the AIDS virus.
     In addition, when 16 people died within a month of the introduction of
the anti-shingles drug Sorivudine in 1993, there were "almost no reports,"
ministry officials said.
     Under the current system, about 3,000 medical institutions in Japan are
designated to submit reports, but in fiscal 1995 the ministry received only
1,900.
     Some medical institutions have not filed any reports, ministry sources
said.
     Under a similar system in the United States, more than 15,000 reports are
channeled to the U.S. government each year, the sources said.
     They said the ministry is consulting specialists on ways to change the
system.
     The present system is laborious because it takes at least two hours to
fill in the appropriate form, the sources said, and details of liver, kidney
and blood examinations must be included with each report.
     Under the revised system, which will be implemented during fiscal 1997,
the medical services will be able to submit reports to the ministry about even
vague side effects, and the forms will be simplified.
     "Under the present system, pharmacists and nurses in theory can submit
such reports, but in practice they are unable to do so because their reports
must bear the seal of the medical doctors concerned," officials said.
     Using the revised forms, they will only be required to fill in their
names and the reports can be submitted directly to the ministry without going
through doctors, they said.

     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen

     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen
     Yomiuri
     The Tokyo District Court awarded 500,000 yen to a 15-year-old girl and
her father Tuesday in a lawsuit against the city for abuse the girl suffered
when she was struck by her middle school teacher.
     Kanako Soejima, now a high school student, was slapped across her face
twice by her social studies teacher in November 1994, when she was attending
Chuo Middle School in Kurume, western Tokyo.
     The male teacher hit her when she complained of the way he led the class.
The teacher reportedly struck her, saying, "Just say that again" and "What is
this face you make?"
     Presiding Judge Takashi Sonoo said the teacher's violence was out of line
and sparked by his emotions.
     "The plaintiff was not injured and 500,000 yen might be seen as expensive
compensation," Sonoo said. But, he added, the court needed to hand down such a
ruling as an indication that corporal punishment should be eliminated from the
classroom.
     After Soejima was slapped by her teacher, she and her father Hiroaki, a
lawyer, filed a complaint with the school. The teacher and the middle school
principal then wrote them a written apology.
     But the Soejimas said the apology was not earnest and decided to file a
lawsuit against the teacher, the middle school principal, the metropolitan
government and the city's board of education.
     They demanded 6 million yen in damages and insisted that the written
apology be displayed on the school bulletin board.
     In the ruling, Sonoo said corporal punishment was banned after World War
II under the School Education Law.
     But, he said, it was a concern that corporal punishment had not been
completely eliminated and that there were even people who defended it.
     "Corporal punishment says to students that violence is the answer to
problems," Sonoo said, adding that violent acts by teachers could not be
called education.
     Sonoo ruled that Soejima suffered grave mental anguish.
     The district court's ruling follows an order by the Hachioji Summary
Court for the teacher to pay 100,000 yen to Soejima. The order was handed down
last December in a criminal complaint filed against the teacher.
     The teacher had resigned and began teaching at another school in March
last year.

     Residents fight quake reconstruction

     Residents fight quake reconstruction
     Yomiuri
     ASHIYA, Hyogo
     Six landowners filed a lawsuit against the Construction Ministry on
Tuesday, demanding it stop an earthquake reconstruction project that requires
them to give up part of their own properties for public use.
     The project calls for more open public space and the widening of two
roads to make the 13.4-hectare area, which was damaged in the Great Hanshin
Earthquake, safer if there is another major disaster.
     However, landowners have to contribute part of their own properties to
provide the extra space. If their properties are too small, they have to
contribute money equivalent to the value of the land they would otherwise be
required to surrender.
     Kenzo Otani, 41, a company worker of Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, and five
other landowners in the area filed a suit with Kobe District Court,
complaining that it is unfair to force the project on residents against their
will.
     The plaintiffs say they will not get any benefit from wider roads and
larger public space, while reduction of their properties is a burden.
     They also say it is a violation of their property rights and unfair to
put such a financial cost on quake victims.

     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood

     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood
     Yomiuri
     OSAKA
     A former Green Cross Corp. executive authorized continued shipments of
its products that were suspected of being contaminated with the AIDS-causing
virus on the request of sales division employees even after safe products had
been approved by the government, The Yomiuri Shimbun learned Tuesday.
     According to sources close to Green Cross, the executive, 75, who headed
the sales division at the time, told his colleagues and associates that he had
allowed employees to distribute HIV-tainted unheated blood products after the
Health and Welfare Ministry approved the sale of heated blood products in
December 1985.
     A member of the company's administrative council at the time, he was also
responsible for the collection of unheated blood products that had already
been shipped, following the ministry's approval of safe, heated blood
products.
     After senior employees in the company's sales division decided to
continue selling unheated blood products, the executive acknowledged their
decision on his discretion, but failed to report this to the council, the
sources said.
     The executive is under investigation by the Osaka District Public
Prosecutors Office in relation to a suit that was filed against the company's
former president, Renzo Matsushita, also 75, for the death of a man who died
of AIDS after receiving doses of Green Cross products in the treatment of his
liver ailment.
     The sales division in January 1986 distributed to the company's branch
offices a written notice under the name of Matsushita that instructed the
shipments of the unheated blood products should continue "because it will take
three months to secure a sufficient supply of heated products."
     Prosecutors are investigating whether Matsushita was aware of the
continued shipments and are trying to determine who was responsible for
failing to collect and suspend sales of the unheated products.

     Ministry eyes crisis management team

     Ministry eyes crisis management team
     Yomiuri
     The Health and Welfare Ministry decided Tuesday to inaugurate a crisis
management team next month to serve as a liaison between divisions and bureaus
in cases of medical emergencies, a ministry official said.
     Learning valuable lessons from recent cases such as the widespread HIV
infection through tainted blood products and the O-157 epidemic, the ministry
said it hopes to improve its lax crisis management system and set up one
better equipped to handle emergency situations.
     Ministry officials also said they plan to compile a "security crisis
management manual" which should outline measures to be taken in states of
emergency.
     A team, tentatively called a coordination team for security crisis
management, will consist of more than 10 officials led by the health and
welfare science division chief and including assistant chiefs of the
Pharmaceutical Affairs bureau, the Health Services bureau and the
Environmental Health bureau, officials said.
     The team members regularly exchange information to prevent overlooking
possible dangers such as serious drug side effects, large-scale food poisoning
and new infective diseases.
     In the recent case of massive HIV infections caused by tainted blood
products, important information was funneled into a single division in the
ministry and was not shared with outside divisions. This is believed to be one
of causes that led to further spread of the infection.
     The team will be created to overcome such a typical shortcoming of the
vertical administrative structure. In cases of emergency, the team will serve
as a coordinator and liaison between the division directly responsibility for
the case, the health and welfare minister and other ministry officials.
     By setting a clear outline of responsibilities, the ministry's new manual
should urge swift and accurate administrative measures, officials said.
     In the case of side effects to pharmaceutical products, for example, the
manual will clearly define requirements and procedures for the ministry to
exercise rights such as ordering pharmaceutical firms to recall dangerous
drugs or deciding to import drugs from abroad.

     Man with knife robs mayor

     Man with knife robs mayor
     Yomiuri
     NIIGATA
     A man held the mayor of Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, and his wife
prisoner at knife point for 13 hours in their home and stole 40 million yen
hastily collected by a city official, police said.
     According to police, a man broke into the house of Mayor Seizaburo Hiura,
77, at about 8 p.m. Monday and threatened him and his wife, Saeko, 73, with a
kitchen knife, measuring about 30 centimeters in length. He told the couple,
"I'm in trouble with too many debts." He then demanded money.
     The man held Hiura and his wife captive in their living room on the first
floor of their home. The intruder stayed in the mayor's house for 13 hours
until Tuesday morning.
     Hiura was forced to phone Nagaoka city government official to ask him to
prepare the money. The mayor turned over 40 million yen to the man who
departed at about 9 a.m. Neither Hiura nor his wife were injured.
     The mayor reported the incident to police at 3 p.m. after the city
assembly meeting on Tuesday. The Niigata prefectural police set up an
investigation headquarters at its Nagaoka Police Station and mobilized 80
police officers to hunt down the criminal.
     Hiura and his wife told police the man appeared to be around 60, was 160
centimeters tall and was of medium build. They said he was wearing glasses, a
white shirt, dark blue pants, black shoes and dark colored cap.
     The man entered the house through the front door, which was unlocked,
police said.
     Hiura and his wife told police that they could not sleep because the man
kept threatening them with his knife throughout the night. They said when the
man left, he threatened their lives if they called the police.
     Hiura eventually reported the incident to police through another city
government employee.

     Mystery substance kills aged woman

     Mystery substance kills aged woman
     Yomiuri
     Five residents of a nursing home for elderly people suffering from
dementia apparently ingested an unidentified substance, resulting in one death
and four of the residents hospitalized Monday night, police said.
     At about 4:50 p.m., employees of the Daini Waraku Home in Ome, Tokyo,
found four female residents and one male resident on the ground, foaming at
the mouth and in pain, near a table in the home's cafeteria.
     Because there were several glasses on the table, the employees believed
the residents ingested a substance of some kind. Their stomachs were pumped
out and the five were then taken to a nearby hospital.
     One of the women, 84-year-old Chitose Matsuba, died at the hospital at
7:25 p.m. The other residents have been treated for throat pain.
     Nursing home employees told police that it is the home's policy to keep
medicines out of the reach of residents.
     There was reportedly a residue in the glasses that smelled like an
antiseptic used by the nursing home to clean toothbrushes.
     Police are continuing their investigations into the case and are
conducting an autopsy on Matsuba.
     Tokyo metropolitan government officials commented that they instruct
nursing homes for the elderly to keep drugs locked up and out of the reach of
their residents.
     The metropolitan government is currently questioning the home about its
handling of medicine and cleaning materials.

     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up

     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up
     Lani Cossette Yomiuri Shimbun Washington Bureau
     PC3
     WASHINGTON
     Congressional Republicans conclude that White House officials engaged in
an "elaborate coverup operation" to hide the involvement of President Bill
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the controversial travel office affair,
according to the draft of a House committee report.
     Republicans investigating the matter allege that once the travel office
story was out, White House advisers constructed a "colossal damage control
effort" to protect the Clintons from political fallout by "smearing the
reputations of innocent people" and withholding relevant documents through
frivolous claims of executive privilege.
     "Travelgate," which has led investigators to the highest levels of the
White House, is the product of a 31/2-year investigation. The report targets
the president directly, claiming he knew about the firing of seven career
White House employees two days before it happened and should be held
accountable for obstructing the investigation and abusing the power of the
presidency.
     Throughout the investigation, which was prolonged by battles with the
White House over document requests, committee Republicans unearthed one piece
of evidence that served to motivate a separate investigation into the travel
office affair, led by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr who is examining Mrs.
Clinton's role in the matter.
     The previously disclosed "soul cleansing" memo by David Watkins, a key
figure in the affair, shows that Mrs. Clinton pressured senior White House
aides to fire the travel office workers, according to the report. The memo
reveals a conversation between Watkins and Mrs. Clinton in which she told
Watkins she wanted "those people out" and "our people in." Mrs. Clinton has
denied having a role in the dismissals.
     The report also claims to have records of meetings, phone calls and
contacts that demonstrate Mrs. Clinton's involvement including a letter from
Watkins to her in which he says he regretted revealing his conversation with
her to investigators, and assured her that he knew who his "client" was.
     Starr is looking into whether White House officials lied under oath or
obstructed government investigations into the firings and whether the White
House politicized the FBI in announcing a criminal investigation of travel
office employees.
     The committee plans to officially release the report along with the
Democratic findings on Wednesday. The House committee's work stands in sharp
contrast to a report released earlier this summer by the Senate Whitewater
Committee that made perjury recommendations to Starr on three senior White
House advisers based on evidence and testimony received by the committee.
     The White House has dismissed the committee's 375-page report as a waste
of taxpayer dollars and an attempt at "last-ditch, negative campaigning by
innuendo and rumor."
     The fiasco erupted in May 1993 when the story broke that seven longtime
travel office employees were fired and replaced by Clinton associates. White
House officials touted the dismissals as an accomplishment in efficiency; the
press reported it as divvying up political favors to Clinton supporters,
"political cronyism," according to the report.
     The White House accused the travel office employees of mismanagement and
the head of the office, Billy Dale, was indicted on charges of embezzlement,
although he was acquitted on all charges. Dale has come to be something of a
cause celebre among Republicans and an embarrassment to the Clintons.
     It was Dale's FBI file, which was mixed in with other documents and
released to congressional investigators, that led the committee to discover
that the White House had collected hundreds of FBI files from former Reagan
and Bush administration officials, an issue that is also under investigation
by the independent counsel. The White House maintains it was an innocent
mistake.
     The Senate voted Friday to reimburse the legal expenses Dale incurred
from the lawsuit. A White House spokesman said earlier this year Clinton would
sign it, but Clinton denied it last month, angrily responding to a reporter
that he did not believe in giving "special preference to one group of people
over others" referring to White House employees who have racked up legal bills
from Whitewater.

     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing

     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing
     Hideaki Miyama
     Yomiuri
     The confrontation between the central government and the Okinawa
prefectural government has ended, at least for now, following Okinawa Gov.
Masahide Ota's decision last week to take legal steps to expropriate land for
U.S. military bases.
     Symbolic of the end to the yearlong wrangle, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto visited Okinawa on Tuesday although he was only there for about two
hours.
     However, Ota's decision to comply with the central government's request
that steps be taken for the compulsory use of land by the U.S. military does
not mean the issue has been settled.
     Despite Ota's decision, it is not certain that the Okinawa prefectural
land expropriation committee will complete its examination of the plots being
used by the U.S. forces before the leases on them expire in May next year.
     Thus, there is no guarantee that the Japanese government will be able to
legally lease plots of privately owned land at Kadena Air Base and other
facilities.
     If the committee's work is not completed in time, Kadena Air Base--the
biggest U.S. Air Force base in the Far East and considered the foremost
frontline facility under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement--will run the
risk of illegally occupying the land.
     Many problems remain for the governments of Japan, the United States and
Okinawa Prefecture.
     Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. The
Japanese government planned to invite U.S. President Bill Clinton as a state
guest in November. Stressing that the bilateral security system was a major
factor contributing to peace for Japan in the postwar years, the government
was preparing to reaffirm the alliance and issue a joint security declaration
on the occasion of his visit.
     However, the security system that was thought to be so strong was rocked
by the rape of an Okinawa primary school girl by U.S. military servicemen on
Sept. 4.
     With that incident as a turning point, antibase sentiment spread like
wildfire through the prefecture. The incident also exacerbated a deeply rooted
distrust of the Japanese government.
     Amid such developments, Ota refused to act as a proxy for antibase
landowners and sign documents for the forced use of their land by the U.S.
military.
     The central government countered by filing three separate suits against
the governor. The central government and prefectural government thus squared
off legally, politically and emotionally.
     On the other hand, Clinton, who was to remain in Japan for the state
visit after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Osaka
in November last year, canceled the trip, citing strained relations between
the White House and Congress as the reason.
     The Japan-U.S. security system served as an axis of Japan's postwar
diplomacy. However, a single incident--and subsequent rebellion by a
prefectural government--has revealed its fragility.
     Clinton finally visited Japan in April this year. Seizing on the occasion
of the Hashimoto-Clinton summit, the governments of the two countries reached
an agreement on the return of Futenma Air Station, a matter that the Okinawa
prefectural government had termed the priority issue in consolidating and
reducing U.S. bases. The two nations also issued, with much fanfare, a joint
security declaration that addressed the reduction of U.S. military bases in
Japan and promotion of bilateral cooperation in emergencies.
     However, the declaration was merely a scrap of paper representing a
political agreement between the two countries.
     Even after the declaration was issued, the central government and Okinawa
government remained at loggerheads as they battled it out in court, with the
former continuing to illegally occupy land at the U.S. Navy's Sobe
communications installation.
     The confrontation continued after the Supreme Court on Aug. 28 came down
on the side of the central government, in effect ordering Ota to take legal
steps for the forced use of land.
     Okinawa residents then voted in a prefecturewide referendum concerning
the reduction of U.S. bases and a review of the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces
Agreement.
     Because some people apparently viewed the referendum as being too
"political," with the questions worded in a way to encourage "yes" votes,
turnout was 59.53 percent, which was lower than what the prefectural
government had expected. However, 89.09 percent of those who cast ballots
wanted the U.S. military presence reduced.
     The central government and prefectural government finally moved toward a
compromise following the referendum, which meant the resolution of a number of
Okinawa-related items on the political schedule.
     Hashimoto met with Ota on Sept. 10 and explained a government plan for
promoting Okinawa's economy, complete with a concrete figure for financial
assistance. Furthermore, it was supported by the Cabinet, so that the
government would not retreat from it.
     Ota responded by saying on Sept. 13 that he would take the long-sought
steps, including publicly posting land documents.
     The central government withdrew its suits against the governor. It thus
took a year for the two sides to work out their differences.
     With Ota's reversal, some progress has been made, but Okinawa still
remains the most important strategic area under the Japan-U.S. security
alliance.
     The government must now decide where the facilities at Futenma are to be
transferred. Until this is done, the agreement on the return of the air
station will remain an empty promise.
     On the other hand, the Okinawa prefectural government must now complete
steps for the expropriation of plots scattered about Kadena Air Base and other
installations before the leases run out next May 14 so that the U.S. military
can continue using them legally.
     Since Futenma Air Station is located close to Naha and is surrounded by
residential areas, the prefectural government wants it to be returned first.
     Thus, the Japanese and U.S. governments secretly reached an accord on its
return just before the summit in April. Hashimoto and U.S. Ambassador Walter
Mondale made a "lightning" announcement on it at a joint press conference.
     However, it has not been decided where the heliport at the U.S. Marine
installation will go, although six months have passed since the announcement
was made.
     The prefectural government has called for it to be moved out of Okinawa,
but the central government has asked the United States to move it to Kadena
Air Base.
     However, there is a deadlock, as the United States is opposed to the
idea.
     The agreement on Futenma's return will take on real meaning only if the
Japanese government wins a concession from the United States on the site.
     Ota decided to have the lease documents posted, but that did not settle
the problem of expropriation.
     There is a plot of land right at the center of Kadena Air Base that is
subject to expropriation. Including the owner of that land, there are 3,000
people who own land at the 11 U.S. military installations in Okinawa.
     In compliance with Ota's decision, the prefectural land expropriation
committee on Tuesday started posting the documents in question for a period of
two weeks. It will later hold public hearings where the landowners will be
able to express their views.
     Committee Chairman Kenji Kaneshiro said, "Since there are many landowners
who live outside the prefecture, it will take about three months for the
committee to deal with just preparatory procedures."
     If that is the case, the hearings cannot be held until early next year.
And if the committee conducts such sessions at its usual pace, it will not be
able to complete its work before the leases expire in May.
     In that event, the landowners will probably demand that they be allowed
to enter the installations where their land is situated.
     It is possible for Kadena Air Base to occupy the land after the leases
expire, just as the Sobe installation illegally occupies land now. However, in
Kadena's case, unlike the Sobe facility, there are 3,000 landowners involved.
Since the majority of them firmly oppose the bases, it will perhaps be
difficult for the air base to carry out normal operations.
     If that ensues, it would mean that Kadena Air Base, a symbol of the
Japan-U.S. security alliance, would be using other people's property
illegally. That would make the bilateral alliance a "castle in the air,"
posing the possibility of collapse.
     Many problems must be resolved if the joint declaration issued by
Hashimoto and Clinton in April is to have real meaning.

     Yomiuri
     There has been a sudden burgeoning of major U.S. retail companies in the
Japanese market.
     Sports Authority, the largest sporting goods chain store operator in the
United States, has opened its first store in Japan in Nishi Ward, Nagoya. In
Ginza, there has been much consumer interest in a store opened by Gap Inc., an
apparel chain store operator based in California. Office Depot, a major U.S.
office supply company, plans to open stores in Japan in conjunction with a
major electrical appliance manufacturer. Several other major U.S. companies
reportedly plan to launch operations in Japan.
     What has sparked this rush to enter the Japanese market? This is a
crucial question, not just for the retail trade, but for the Japanese economy
as a whole.
     The answer was supplied by Rupert Murdoch, the media tycoon who has
bought a large stake in TV Asahi to begin a multichannel digital satellite
broadcasting service called JSkyB. When asked why he wanted to launch
operations in Japan, he said the country was a large untapped gold mine. In
the eyes of foreign companies, it seems that Japan has become the land of
opportunity.
     For foreign TV companies, this would appear to be the case. With
long-established broadcasters still dominating the TV market and cable
television and multichannel satellite broadcasting yet to take root, Japan
offers lucrative opportunities to prospectors.
     Likewise with the Japanese retail sector, where domestic entrepreneurs
tend to stick to traditional business practices. Foreign corporate executives
with revolutionary ideas would appear to have immense opportunities to make
inroads in this field.
     Another important but little recognized fact is that the income level in
Japan in dollar terms has nearly tripled in the past 10 years.
     The exchange rate, which was 250 yen to the dollar about a decade ago, is
now 110 yen to the dollar. Thus, while income levels in Japan have not grown
spectacularly in yen terms, the appreciation of the yen means they have risen
2.5 times in dollar terms. Japan's per capita income, which was about 12,000
dollars in 1985, has risen to just under 35,000. dollars
     Domestically, the Japanese market appears to be almost unchanged but,
viewed from abroad, it has expanded enormously. Not surprisingly, foreign
corporations are keen to tap into this rich vein.
     U.S. companies, which were rather hesitant in the past, have begun to
take a more active interest in Japan. The recent trade dispute between Japan
and the United States over cars and semiconductors stemmed largely from
growing U.S. interest in the Japanese market. This is a vast change from 10
years ago when exports from Japan to the United States were the only cause of
bilateral trade disputes.
     The fact that U.S. companies have resorted to what is basically political
pressure reveals the extent of their desire to grab a share of the colossal
Japanese market. In 1985, when Japanese income levels in dollar terms were
about one-third of present levels, the Japanese market did not have the appeal
that it does today.
     The appearance of more foreign companies will stimulate a structural
change in the Japanese economy. When Toys 'R' Us, a major U.S. toy retailer,
first entered the Japanese market, it touched off a chain reaction of
deregulation in retailing. The many regulations and practices that serve as
nontariff barriers to foreign business will be subject to international
criticism hereafter.

     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery

     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery
     Yomiuri
     Various reports, including one that revealed real gross domestic product
came to minus 2.9 percent in the April-June quarter, indicate the nation's
economy is on rather shaky ground.
     Adding to the gloom was the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey on the
short-term business outlook, known as tankan, which reported in August that
the number of major manufacturing firms that believed the economy was
recovering had dropped by four percentage points.
     An increasing number of companies are revising their business performance
forecasts downward for the current fiscal year.
     All of this is apparently the result of widespread uncertainty over the
prospects of the economy. This uncertainty was created by such factors as the
worsening condition of the semiconductor market, weak employment statistics
and fewer public works projects planned for the months ahead. The planned two
percentage point increase in the consumption tax rate also appears to be a
contributing factor.
     ===
     For better or for worse
     The government, for its part, keeps telling us that the economy is still
recovering. The private sector, however, is divided into pessimistic and
optimistic camps. The former says we are on the verge of economic breakdown,
while the latter maintains we are only experiencing a lull, a temporary
"slackening off."
     There is no denying that the economy is currently at a low point in the
business cycle. The minus growth rate recorded in the April-June quarter,
however, was nothing more than a backlash against the surprisingly high 12.2
percent growth rate recorded during the January-March quarter. In this sense,
the downturn should have been expected, even though the central bank's August
tankan report said that an increasing number of major nonmanufacturing firms
believed that the economy was improving.
     Viewed on a semiannual basis, the nation's economy shrank by 0.2 percent
in real terms during the first half of last year. This compared with 3 percent
growth in the latter half of 1995 and 6.4 percent growth in the first six
months of this year.
     In the 1996 business year, the nation's economy would grow 2.8 percent if
it achieved 0.5 percent on a year-on-year basis during each quarter of the
year, up from a forecast projected by the government. There would be little
cause to complain about that figure if it were not for the fact that Japan--an
economic power that generates about 20 percent of the world's economic
output--is suffering greatly from the impact of massive nonperforming loans
and a sharp decline in land prices in the wake of the collapsed bubble
economy.
     First and foremost, it will be impossible for the nation to again
experience the kind of high economic growth that was recorded year in and year
out during the late '60s and early '70s, when Japan still had a modest
economy. The growth rates seen during the bubble days are also long gone.
     According to statistics on profits, debts, deposits and sales of
corporations, new businesses specializing in such fields as information and
communications are experiencing a boom. Also, the nation's shrinking trade
surplus in recent months indicates Japanese companies are learning to
integrate into the international division of labor, particularly in Asia.
     Five years of recession are changing Japan's economic structure. These
changes should be better explained to the public, which would likely
appreciate the various adjustments that have been made. To put it another way,
recession is the mother of new growth.
     Many politicians have been running around making "pledges" to voters with
the next House of Representatives election just around the corner. Their
promises include freezing the plan to increase the consumption tax or keeping
it where it is, and formulating a large-scale supplementary budget after the
election.
     These reckless moves have destabilized the stock market and discouraged
the business community from going it alone.
     A question can be raised over whether the government, bogged down with
its own massive accumulated deficits of 240 trillion yen, should shoulder even
more financial burden considering the current economic circumstances.
Politicians should stop trying to win support by making irresponsible
proposals. They should instead present the public with programs and practical
methods to turn around the nation's troubled economy.
     ===
     Priorities vs pledges
     The government should also declare that it will shift the focus of its
economic policies. By departing from its emphasis on financial and other
macroeconomic policies, the government should adopt more bread-and-butter
policies such as nurturing new industries, creating more jobs and encouraging
land transactions.
     The most important question, however, is whether private businesses will
seek to go it alone. The nation will not achieve full-scale economic recovery
for good if corporations continue to swing back and forth between optimism and
pessimism with respect to every single economic indicator that comes out.
     The engine of the economy is business, not government. It is about time
companies look for business opportunities in the nation's economy during this
time of historic structural reform. This should serve to restore
entrepreneurship.
     (From Sept. 18 Yomiuri Shimbun)ARF no substitute for U.S.-Japan alliance
     What can be done to ensure peace and security for Japan in the post-Cold
War era?
     One possibility is building a multilateral security framework in Asia
that would allow for the reduction of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa
and other prefectures.
     There is little doubt that a regional security system would contribute to
world peace.
     Nevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that Japan should shift its
security focus--from the Japan-U.S. security treaty to multilateral
arrangements--in the belief that the nation can afford to weaken the bilateral
alliance.
     Any discussion of a regional security framework must start from the right
perspective.
     Considered a harbinger of such a framework is a 19-member forum centering
on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations called the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF).
     The ARF, launched in July 1994, seeks to provide a forum for political
and security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region.
     The forum is composed of the seven ASEAN nations and 12 others--Japan,
the United States, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia, Papua New Guinea, New
Zealand, Laos, the European Union, China, Canada and Australia.
     Proponents of multilateral security arrangements in Asia apparently
expect the ARF to become the Asian version of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
     ===
     European experience
     They say that the ARF should seek to follow the precedent set by European
nations.
     The OSCE succeeded the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
in 1994.
     The CSCE was inaugurated in 1975 when the leaders of 35 countries in
Eastern and Western Europe met in Helsinki to sign a document requiring them
to respect national boundaries.
     There is no doubt that the OSCE is working to build trust among European
countries and cement security in Europe. But it is a far cry from serving as a
framework for collective security. That role has been played by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
     Even such an established organization as the OSCE appears to have a long
way to go before it will be capable of ensuring security in Europe.
     In this regard, it is not realistic to expect the ARF to play such a
role.
     At a conference in May in Canberra concerning security in the
Asia-Pacific region, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said no one
expected the ARF to become a framework for collective defense in the manner of
NATO. He added that no ARF member favored such a development.
     In the next five to 10 years, the key factor for security in Asia will be
alliances between Asian nations and the United States, which are strengthened
by the U.S. military presence in the region.
     The ARF should be used as a forum for dialogue and contacts to complement
that framework.
     ===
     Bilateral pacts come first
     Trust among allies is an important element of any effort to ensure peace
and security. In this sense, Japan must play an active role in promoting the
ARF.
     However, the forum does not replace security pacts signed between the
United States and Asian countries.
     During the Canberra meeting, Downer said the Japan-U.S. relationship was
the most important of all ties between the United States and Asian nations in
ensuring stability in the region.
     Asia faces many potentially destabilizing elements today, including
uncertainties on the Korean Peninsula. To leave no void in the regional
security setup, it is essential that Japan and the United States keep their
alliance intact.
     This is a security foundation that must not be undermined when it comes
to reducing the burden shouldered by Okinawans because of the U.S. military
presence on their islands.

     Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?

     Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?
Much to t he surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fuk
     Shintaro Kubo
     Yomiuri
     Much to the surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fukutoshin, the waterfront
subcenter constructed on reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay, attracted more visitors
than even nearby Tokyo Disneyland during Golden Week and the summer vacation
period this year.
     Being something of a novelty hunter myself, I visited the waterfront area
immediately after the new Yurikamome transport system went into operation on
Nov. 1 last year.
     But as Yurikamome left the terminal, I had a strong feeling of deja
vu--the landscape outside the window looked extremely familiar. Then it came
to me--it was much like Docklands, the redevelopment area along the Thames in
London's East End, once the center of British shipbuilding during its heyday.
     It was four years ago that I visited Docklands. Having a few spare hours
before my flight back to Japan, I decided to take a look around the area
alone. I rode the subway to the City, then changed to the new transport system
to Docklands. My first stop was the visitor center, where I found, to my great
surprise, a Japanese-language pamphlet on the development area--a clear
indication of how many Japanese visitors were attracted to the area.
     ===
     Imitation of Docklands
     In Britain, the Docklands redevelopment project drew a mixed response,
but my own impression was favorable. I felt the British had done a good job.
     Looking out of the window of Yurikamome, I recalled that experience in
London and thought to myself that the development of Rinkai Fukutoshin was an
imitation of Docklands.
     Metropolitan government officials might well argue that the Tokyo
waterfront project is different because it has many advantages over Docklands.
For example, it uses more sophisticated technology such as its vast central
cooling and heating system. However, I am not convinced the differences are
that great.
     There is also a resemblance between the Rinkai Fukutoshin project and
other waterfront projects overseas. In the United States, a project in
Baltimore, Md., or Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, for instance, are very
similar. When I visited those two places I saw crowds of Japanese visitors.
     Other popular spots for Japanese visitors are the huge shopping malls in
the United States, Canada and Britain. One example is the wholesale center in
Milton Keynes, about 60 kilometers north of London. In Japan, commercial
district redevelopment planners have adopted ideas from such overseas
projects.
     ===
     Nation of copycats?
     No doubt this makes our lives more convenient and comfortable, but
thinking about how Japan bases many of its policies on overseas models brought
to mind a remark made by my British assistant when I worked in London as a
correspondent. We had engaged in a heated discussion on the nature of the
Japanese people, which ended when the assistant shouted, "At school, we were
taught that the Japanese imitate everything."
     As soon as I crossed back over the Bay Bridge, I saw cars packing the
roads bumper to bumper and found myself thinking, "This system is crazy. Why
doesn't someone do something about it?"
     It can be said that progress comes from imitation and it cannot be denied
that there is much to be learned from following others, but there are flaws in
the Japanese habit of copying foreign models.
     According to Tohoku University President Junichi Nishizawa, the Japanese
have a strong creative capacity. Japanese inventions and discoveries seem to
prove this, but when it comes to planning large-scale projects, such as
economic reform, this creative spark apparently weakens.
     In the post-Cold War period, Japan is struggling to reform various
domestic systems to adapt to the so-called age of competition.
     ===
     Questions, questions
     Is this because of a belief that we lack the imagination to conceive of
effective plans on our own and have given up trying? Is it because we are now
looking for a suitable foreign model to imitate? Or is it because people in
finance and business are still searching for a way to nurture creative talent?
     Something to mull over perhaps, the next time I ride on the Yurikamome to
Rinkai Fukutoshin.

     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis

     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis
     Kenichi Suematsu
     Yomiuri
     Since July, newspapers have run a number of timely features on fiscal
structural reform--an issue that must be addressed if the Japanese economy is
to be revived.
     The themes of such articles have varied: Newspaper A looked at "The Road
to Fiscal Reform," newspaper B had a piece titled "Dynamics of the
Government's Restructuring Plan and Expenditure Growth," while newspaper C ran
a feature on "Reconstructing Finances--What a Major Debtor Nation Must Do."
     They have also published commentary pieces with various experts outlining
their views on what must be done to solve current fiscal problems, including
concrete proposals on public works projects and agricultural administration.
     As a result of this media coverage, a growing awareness of the critical
fiscal situation and the need for reform is spreading among the population.
     In addition, the government recently issued a white paper on fiscal
reform and announced a plan to thoroughly review government spending. To
demonstrate its determination, the next fiscal year has been designated "the
first year of structural fiscal reform."
     However, it remains true that government ministries and agencies continue
to pursue their own interests in making budget requests for the next fiscal
year.
     The figures are revealing. The current fiscal year shows a government
deficit of 21 trillion yen, with expenditure at 75 trillion yen and income at
only 54 trillion yen. The shortfall is covered by issuing government bonds: in
other words, debt.
     Government spending includes 12 trillion yen in interest payment on bonds
issued in the past. Since the already colossal amount of debt will rise even
further this year, interest payments will be even higher for the next fiscal
year.
     If a company were using more than 20 percent of its annual revenue just
to pay interest on loans, it would consider the situation to be a crisis.
     Yet ministries and agencies--which correspond to divisions of a company--
appear dead set against changing their ways. To protect their vested interests
and justify their work, they continue to submit bigger requests every year.
     The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to adjust budget requests, lacks
the resources to adequately scrutinize whether the money will be well spent.
Instead it appears to distribute money across the board.
     If this were happening in a company, the management would panic, fearing
that the firm could go under. Top executives would implement drastic measures,
such as conducting a thorough review of the company's strategy and
organization, scaling down or even stopping unprofitable operations, cutting
costs to the bone and laying off employees.
     The Cabinet corresponds to management when it comes to national finances.
As such, Cabinet members must exercise the same disciplined leadership as
executives in the private sector. They should order ministries and agencies to
make cuts in inefficient areas of activity, pursue outsourcing, find ways to
lower running costs and, where appropriate, pursue greater efficiency through
privatization. The ministries and agencies would then be forced to get their
accounts in better order.
     Regarding measures to balance the budget, it should be noted that in
recent years the emphasis among the major economies, including the United
States and European nations, has been on cutting expenditures rather than
attaining fiscal reconstruction through tax increases. This is because of a
fear that tax hikes would lead to a decline in international competitiveness
and a hollowing out of industry.
     For instance, the United States and Britain have introduced systems to
control and cap government spending, while many European nations have
imple-mented severe cuts in their social security programs. Welfare spending
is an act of kindness in the short term, but ultimately leaves a negative
legacy for future generations.
     Compared to the austerity measures taken by other nations, I cannot help
but feel that Japan has shown a lack of determination in the way that it has
addressed fiscal reform.
     A general election, expected soon, is likely to further dampen enthusiasm
for reform. There is a growing concern that pressure to increase spending on
public works projects will increase as the fight for votes heats up.
     Therefore I want to take this opportunity to express hope that the media
will make an extra effort to explain to the people as simply and plainly as
possible how the disparity between revenue and expenditure is a cause for
great national concern.
     I suggest they use the metaphor of a company's balance of accounts to
show who will benefit from social security and who will pay. Then they should
ask the public to judge whether the government's welfare programs should be
continued, expanded or reduced.
     Raising public awareness of the crisis is an indispensable first step
toward eliminating vested interests in government and can provide the impetus
for the bold policy changes that are needed.
     It must also be made clear that if we are spendthrifts today, then we
will have to pay the consequences tomorrow.
     For example, public works projects in construction and agriculture often
do not increase productivity or international competitiveness. In fact, it is
widely recognized that such projects have sometimes led to increases in
utility rates and the price of farm products.
     If information concerning the cost-effectiveness of public works were
disclosed, taxpayers would be able to judge whether such projects are
worthwhile. The same can be said of state funding for moribund
government-affiliated corporations.
     If the public were told in clear and simple terms how their taxes are
being spent, I believe there would be a national chorus for reform, which in
turn would create enough momentum to overcome administrative inertia.
     Of course, such a disclosure would mean that the public would have to
make tough choices about spending priorities, which they have been shielded
from in the past. But, for the first time, this would mean that political
parties would no longer have to try to win votes by making policy pledges that
the nation later comes to regret. In this sense, a more open economic policy
would be a step toward politics that truly reflects the will of the people.

     U.S. candidates big on TV, short on policies

     U.S. candidates big on TV, short on policies
     Masashi Iiyama
     Yomiuri
     WASHINGTON--With Labor Day on Sept. 2 over, campaigning for the U.S.
presidential election has entered the final heat. During the next two months
until polling day on Nov. 5, every movement of Democratic candidate President
Bill Clinton and Republican candidate Bob Dole will be watched and analyzed.
     But it is still unclear what the main issues are. There has yet to be a
"great debate," as Clinton put it, between the two candidates.
     The only sign of action was U.S. missile strikes against Iraq, which
suddenly occurred in the midst of campaigning. This move worked
over-whelmingly in favor of the president.
     A public opinion poll showed that 79 percent of the public supported the
strikes. Dole, who made a critical remark immediately after the attacks, was
eventually forced to express support for them. This, however, fell far short
of a heated debate on political issues.
     Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican national conventions in August
were political shows aimed at television and followed well-planned scripts.
     The main performers were movie star Christopher Reeve, who has been
paralyzed from the neck down since falling off a horse, and a downed U.S.
pilot who survived in Bosnia by eating weeds.
     Between speeches, singers went on stage and sang one song after another.
Shops selling caps and T-shirts with the candidates' names were crowded with
delegates from across the country.
     At the Democratic convention, Clinton proposed a 1,500 dollars tax credit
for college tuition, a system to encourage young people to purchase homes,
introduction of uniforms in public schools and a curfew for children.
     These mini-initiatives--which one might expect from candidates for
municipal assemblies or local education boards--were in response to everyday
concerns and complaints from the public. However, they hardly seemed
appropriate in a campaign by a U.S. president who hopes to lead the world
community in the 21st century.
     Meanwhile, Dole proposed a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut,
claiming it would boost economic growth and benefit both the government and
the public.
     His overly optimistic policy, however, gave the impression that he had
switched from a long-held emphasis on balanced national finances to a generous
offer of money to voters.
     So far, apart from the tax-cut proposal, there is no major difference
between the policies of the two candidates.
     Now that election consultants manage campaigns on the basis of opinion
polls, presidential candidates form policies to reflect the majority view.
     With the end of the Cold War, the United States has lost its arch rival,
the Soviet Union. This may be another factor behind the lack of dynamism in
the U.S. presidential race.
     The two candidates are proposing policies in areas in which the public is
keenly interested, such as education, employment and crime, while foreign
policy hardly appears--except for the missile strikes against Iraq.
     Domestically, the massive cumulative budget deficit of 5 trillion dollars
makes it difficult for the candidates to put forward policies requiring large
budget spending-- another reason why Clinton is proposing low-cost
mini-initiatives.
     However, the candidates are stressing moral standards. A typical example
is repeated calls for the restoration of "family values"--a term voiced many
times at both parties' conventions as though it were the conferences' main
slogan.
     In the United States, the number of families headed by single mothers is
soaring, in particular among the poor and blacks, and such families account
for nearly one-fourth of all households in the country.
     Single mothers with small children are unable to work and depend on
welfare benefits for years. The number of recipients is now 14 million,
equivalent to the population of a medium-sized nation. This expansion has
resulted in problems for the country's welfare programs.
     As Uncle Sam moves toward a smaller government, it will become more
difficult to maintain existing welfare programs, and how to sustain
single-parent families will become an even more serious problem.
     Despite this gloomy outlook, Clinton has proposed tiny steps to restore
"family values," calling on business to hire more people on welfare and on
parents to read more books to their children.
     The question is whether this preaching, done on behalf of clergymen, will
be effective in reforming U.S. society.
     There is a danger that it may merely sound comforting to the voters'
ears. All that can be done is to wait and see.

     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan

     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan
     Tsuneo Sugishita
     Yomiuri
     The government's promise of a 3 million dollars emergency aid package to
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Japan last week, is widely
seen as an attempt to kick-start the stalled Middle East peace process.
     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met with Arafat and said Japan would
extend aid through the United Nations Development Program to help create jobs
for Palestinians.
     Japan has played an active role in promoting the peace process,
announcing aid measures as early as 1993, two years before Israel and the
Palestinian side signed the accord on Palestinian self-rule.
     In September 1993, then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the U.N.
General Assembly that Japan planned to offer up to 2 million dollars over a
two-year period to the Palestinians.
     Since then, it has earmarked official development assistance to help fund
the Palestinian economic committee on development and reconstruction, and for
projects such as the construction of houses for Palestinian police officers
and the purchase of computers for police.
     Former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama visited the Palestinian area in
Gaza in September last year, just before the self-rule accord was signed. He
announced a plan to begin direct aid, in addition to the indirect assistance
Japan had already been giving through international organizations.
     Japan's direct aid for fiscal 1996-97 comes to 41.65 million dollars,
including medical equipment, teaching materials for higher education and a
plan to construct a hospital in Jericho.
     Thus far, including money given through international organizations,
Japan has extended more than 200 million dollars in aid to the Palestinians,
making it the largest donor nation.
     The emergency aid that Hashimoto announced is to be used for job creation
projects in Khan Yunis, a city suffering acute unemployment as a result of the
economic blockade imposed by Israel after a terrorist incident in March.
     Hashimoto also pledged to send a study mission to the Palestinian
self-rule area that will provide farm machinery, chemicals and fertilizer to
increase food production.
     Japan's active role in the Middle East stems from self-interest, notably
the hope that peace in the region will lead to a stable and long-term energy
supply.
     It is also a good opportunity for Japan to make the international
contribution that is expected of it as a major economic power.
     The central principle of Japan's Middle East policy is that peace will
only take root if the area's residents can lead stable lives. This requires
economic development, hence the continuing growth of Japanese economic
cooperation through ODA.
     On the Palestinian side, there are great expectations of Japan. Arafat
has repeatedly pointed out the importance of Japan's role in promoting peace
in the Middle East.
     Japan has several advantages in its involvement in the region. There is
no major historical distrust between Japan and the Middle East and so Japanese
aid is accepted more readily.
     Furthermore, while other advanced nations such as the United States and
those in Europe are suffering from donor fatigue, Japan shows no signs of
that. There is fairly widespread support in Japan for extending assistance to
the Middle East.
     Of course, there are obstacles. The biggest problem is that the peace
process has stalled since the election of a hard-line Israeli government under
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
     The effectiveness of Japanese assistance in a region facing such
destabilizing factors is unclear.
     The construction of bridges and roads linking the Palestinian self-rule
area to Jordan and other countries would be an important step forward.
However, there is no precedent for a Japanese ODA project involving two or
more nations simultaneously. Japan is faced with the technical problem of how
to work out such new forms of ODA.
     However, the momentum started by Japan's assistance to the Palestinians
cannot be slowed. For many years the Middle East was a central stage for
European diplomatic activity--now it offers opportunities for Japan to enhance
its international profile.
     It is to be hoped that Japan's policy on the Palestinians will be driven
by independent initiatives and not merely follow the priorities of U.S.
diplomacy.@:

     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up

     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up
     Yomiuri
     Wakashio Bank, successor to the failed Taiheiyo Bank, launched operations
on Tuesday as a regional bank based in Tokyo.
     Wakashio Bank was set up with investment from four major commercial
banks. It has assets of 671 billion yen and deposits of 450 billion yen.
     Sakura Bank supplied the entire capital of 40 billion yen, while Fuji
Bank, Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank extended subordinated loans totaling about 93
billion yen.
     The new bank has 42 branch offices in Tokyo, Kawasaki (Kanagawa
Prefecture), Yokohama, Ichikawa (Chiba Prefecture) and Urawa (Saitama
Prefecture) and 945 employees.
     Before starting business, a ceremony was held at the bank's head office
in Jimbocho, Chiyoda Ward, attended by top executives including President
Hiroyasu Ichikawa.
     Ichikawa addressed the staff saying he wanted to see the bank grow
soundly, fully aware of its public mission as a regional bank.
     Then a decorative paper ball was burst to celebrate the start of the new
bank.

     Tax agency gets tough on transfer pricing scams

     Tax agency gets tough on transfer pricing scams
     Yomiuri
     Tax authorities imposed a transfer-pricing tax in 44 cases involving 49.2
billion yen in income for the year to June 1996, an official said on Tuesday.
     This is a new record for the National Tax Administration Agency since the
tax began in 1987.
     The transfer-pricing tax is a penalty surtax imposed when a company
manipulates the value of transactions with overseas subsidiaries to conceal
taxable income.
     There are similar systems in Western countries including the United
States.
     During the past nine years, the agency has imposed a transfer-pricing tax
in 130 cases, involving what is believed to be 194.8 billion yen moved
overseas to evade taxes.
     The figures, which show a third of cases and a quarter of the value
occurred in the most recent of the nine years, indicate the advances the
agency has made in detecting transfer pricing.
     A company found guilty of moving income can request a consultation
between the tax agency and its foreign counterparts to avoid double taxation.
     If the consultation is successful, the company can obtain a refund of
part of the tax paid, in one or both of the countries.
     Out of the 130 cases, more than 10 have been settled with foreign
consultation, while consultations are being held in 31 other cases.
     There are also cases where foreign taxation authorities have imposed a
transfer-pricing tax on the foreign subsidiaries of Japanese companies.
     Because it usually takes a long time to settle cases and companies have
to bear a heavy financial burden until settlement, "a prior confirmation
system" was set up in 1987 to enable companies to confirm with the tax agency
the proper value of goods bought and sold between the parent company and its
overseas subsidiaries.
     The agency received 42 inquiries under this system during the year to
June 1996.

     Premium diesel fuels competition

     Premium diesel fuels competition
     Yomiuri
     Competition among oil companies for diesel fuel sales has intensified as
sports-utility vehicless have gained popularity and as sales in general have
dropped following import liberalization in April.
     The industry is suffering reduced sales and dramatically lower gasoline
prices since the liberalization.
     Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil, two major wholesalers, are trying to
expand distribution channels with the aim of boosting their lines of "premium"
diesel fuel, which contains additives to improve fuel efficiency, according to
sources.
     Kygnus Sekiyu K.K. also plans to market premium diesel fuel as early as
this week.
     There are high expectations in the industry for premium diesel fuel
because most RVs have diesel engines. Industry sources also expect higher
prices for the premium fuel to bring higher returns.
     Premium diesel fuel burns more efficiently than regular diesel, giving
more kilometers per liter. It also is more efficient in staring a diesel
engine on cold days and reduces exhaust pollutants.
     Regular gasoline prices began falling two years ago in anticipation of
liberalization. In August 1994, regular gasoline averaged 120 yen a liter, in
August 1995, 113, yen and this August, 105. yen
     The first premium diesel, Nisseki proG, was introduced in 1993. Its
retail price is now about 8 yen a liter higher than regular diesel fuel, which
averages 81 yen per liter.
     Nisseki plans to expand gas stations dealing in the product from 300 to
1,000 by the year 2000.
     Mitsubishi started marketing its "RV Diesel" in August 1995. Company
sources said it was selling 14 million liters a month, far exceeding the
initial projection of three million liters. It is priced 3 yen to 5 yen above
regular diesel.
     The company plans to have 1,000 of its gas stations marketing the product
by the end of October, doubling the current 500.
     Kygnus will test-market its version of the product in six gas stations in
Kanto and Nagoya regions from this month until next March.
     After analyzing customer feedback, it expects to start full-fledged
distribution next April, according to company sources.
     Premium diesel fuel is said to be cost efficient because it is made by
simply adding chemicals to regular diesel and can be priced higher. Some view
it as the savior of a hard-hit industry.
     On the downside, however, the product requires new investment such as
separate storage facilities and separate vehicles for transportation.
     Because of this, the other oil wholesalers remain cautious about
introducing the product and are waiting to see how the other three fare.
     But one of the other major wholesalers "might follow suit if the three
companies perform well," according to a company source.

     economic perspective

     economic perspective
     Onoue
     Yomiuri
     Annual quotas for five types of fish and one type of crab will be applied
in Japanese waters, starting Jan. 1 next year, according to an official at the
Fisheries Ministry. The planned quota system, aimed at long-term preservation
of marine resources, is based on the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,
which the Diet ratified last July.
     For the time being, current hauls will be used to set quotas, the
official said. However, the new measure is expected to have far-reaching
consequences for fishermen and consumers, since the agency is set gradually to
introduce quotas for other types of fish and also to revise quotas each year,
based upon the extent to which fishing resources are being depleted.
     The six species subject to quotas from the beginning of next year are
mackerel, Alaska pollock, saury, horse mackerel, pilchard and snow crab. At
first, the agency had considered imposing quotas on 10 types of marine
creatures but four were dropped because, according to one agency official, the
six had a higher priority for preservation, and their fishing was considered
easier to manage and verify,
     Nevertheless, catches of the six totaled 2.57 million tons in 1994, about
half of the entire fishing haul around the Japanese archipelago.
     The U.N. convention states that a country can impose an economic zone
within 200 nautical miles of its coast, within which it can exercise the
exclusive right to fish and develop marines resources. However, if a nation
establishes such a zone, international law obliges it to impose fishing quotas
to preserve and manage marine resources. Japan's move to introduce quotas is
in line with these requirements.
     The agency explained the criteria it had used for selecting which fish
would be subject to quotas: first, those subject to intensive fishing and
bearing high economic value; second, those whose stocks are heavily depleted
and in urgent need of preservation and fishing management; and third, those
caught in waters around Japan, not only by domestic fishing boats, but also by
foreign vessels.
     The agency plans to determine the exact quota for each of the six fish
before the end of October, after which it will inform each prefecture of its
allotment. To minimize the impact on fishermen's quotas in the first year will
be almost the same as current catches, according to the agency official.
     However, the depletion of these species is already a serious matter. In
recent years the catch of Alaska pollock has dropped to one-tenth of its peak
of 3 million tons, while hauls of snow crabs have fallen to one-fourth of
their peak of 24,000 tons.
     The sharp drop in catches is attributed to overfishing, which has
depleted marine resources in Japanese waters.
     The agency is concerned with the situation and from the second year if
plans gradually to lower quotas for those fish whose stocks are the worse
depleted .
     The agency is also well aware that introducing strict quotas will hit the
income of fishermen and may leave some facing financial difficulties. Thus it
is considering requesting extra spending in the fiscal 1998 budget to provide
support, such as low-interest loans and subsidies.
     If fish hauls drop as a result of the new quotas, prices may raise, which
would hit consumers. The agency, however, maintained that the new measure is
in the long-term interest of consumers. "It is clear that continued
overfishing will lead to further falls in the volume of catches. Managed
fishing will help to maintain and nurture marine resources and create a stable
supply of fish to consumers," an agency official said.
     To impose quotas, the agency will eventually have to order fishermen to
report their hauls on a regular basis and punish those whose catches are in
excess of limits. However, the planned quotas will not be binding until the
nation's bilateral fishing agreements with South Korea and China are revised,
said the agency official.
     Japan introduced a 200-mile fishing zone in 1977, but South Korea and
China are exempt from this restriction because of existing bilateral
agreements.
     Under current arrangements boats in the zone are supervised by their
country of origin. Therefore, as long as the present agreements remain intact,
fishing boats belonging to South Korea and China are outside the Japanese
government's jurisdiction even if they fish inside the zone.
     Applying quotas only for Japanese fishing boats would be unfair and an
ineffective way to reduce hauls, said the agency official.
     To rectify the situation, the government is urging its two neighbors to
revise the existing agreements so that Japan can exercise authority over any
fishing boat, regardless of nationality, within its 200-mile fishing zone.

     okura reform

     okura reform
     Yomiuri
     A ruling coalition task force discussing reform of the Finance Ministry
has set Thursday as its deadline to come up with the coalition's unified
proposal, despite apparent discord among its member parties.
     The deadline was set Tuesday, when the task force decided to present the
coalition's proposal when it meets again on Thursday, according to sources
close to the team.
     However, political observers question whether the three ruling
parties--the Liberal Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake (Pioneers)--will be able to smooth over their difference on this
sensitive issue by Thursday.
     The LDP and SDP, the two largest parties in the coalition, are united in
principle on a two-pillar plan.
     Under the plan, the ministry's three key bureaus--securities, banking,
and international finance--would be merged into two bureaus dealing with
finance and international affairs, while its banking and finance inspection
function would be separated from the ministry and be taken over by a new body
attached to the ministry.
     Sakigake, on the other hand, is demanding more drastic reform through
complete separation between its functions in dealing with fiscal and financial
affairs.
     The LDP and SDP have given up on a plan to separate the supervising
function from the ministry, because it would involve other ministries, such as
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, which, according to LDP and
SDP sources, would face insurmountable obstacles.
     Presently the ministry has three fundamental functions concerning
financial administration: drafting policies, inspecting and supervising banks
and securities houses.
     The LDP and SDP are calling for the inspection function to go to a new
organization whose jurisdiction would cover not only banks but also
agricultural cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions.
     Under the LDP-SDP proposal, the organization would be affiliated with the
ministry and subject to the provision of Clause 8 of the National Government
Organization Law.
     Some coalition members had also called for the application of the law's
Clause 3 to the proposed organization so as to give it more independence from
the ministry.
     However, the two parties eventually backed down, because this would
require a drastic reform of the ministry, including its local inspection
sections, which LDP and SDP sources say is practically impossible.
     Nevertheless, the LDP-SDP proposal attempts to reinforce the independence
of a new body by designating the prime minister, not the finance minister, as
the supreme authority in appointing its head.

     R.A. McDonald, president of P&G Far East P&G's commitment to Kobe is

     R.A. McDonald, president of P&G Far East P&G's commitment to Kobe is part
of o ne to Japan and the world
     Ikuo Anai
     Yomiuri
     Kobe
     According to your personal history, you graduated from the U.S. Army
academy West Point in 1975--the year the Vietnam War ended. Five years later,
you left the military and joined Procter & Gamble. Can you tell me what you
did in the military and why you left?
     McDonald: It's a requirement that you serve in the army for five years
after graduating from West Point. I served primarily with the 82nd Airborne
Division as an infantry officer. It's a parachute unit.
     Did you think of leaving the military early on?
     No, not really. I found it fine to be an army officer. But over time I
met my wife and I went to an MBA program (at Utah State University). I then
decided that my goal had changed and this led me to private industry.
     I'd like to take (the fall of) the Berlin Wall as an example. When I went
to West Point, I thought that would happen because the military creates
freedom for people in other countries. But the reality is that businesses
create freedom. People in East Germany wanted Levi's jeans and BMWs that
people in West Germany had. That made the wall come down--not really a battle.
     So, in some way, global business plays an important role in liberating
people. Look at China. One could argue--at least the U.S. government would
argue--that engaging China has resulted in more progress than in isolating
China. That's probably the future trend of the world.
     I think that is already an ongoing trend as many multinational companies,
including your company, have already started operations in many developing
countries such as China.
     I think so. We have quite large operations in China and employ a lot of
Chinese people. In fact, we have many of those Chinese people working right
now in this building--our regional technical center.
     P&G Far East is not a public company so it isn't obliged to divulge
information about sales.
     That's right. But I can tell you about total global company results if
you are interested. As of June 30 this year, we announced record annual
earnings of more than 3 billion dollars. That's the first time that we made
more than 3 billion dollars in profit--a 15 percent increase over the previous
year. Actual worldwide net sales were 35.28 billion dollars, up 5 percent.
Again, that's the first time that we have ever made more than 35 billion
dollars.
     It's not surprising that each of our four regions--North America, Europe,
Latin America and Asia--showed record volumes and record results. Asia
accounted for about 4 billion dollars of that 35 billion dollars--actually
3.79 billion dollars--and that was a 5 percent increase.
     How about results in Japan?
     We don't refer to Japan separately. But we would say that no matter how
good the result is, we want to do better. The presence of this building--a
technical center and our Asian headquarters--is evidence of our commitment to
Japan and of the importance of Japan not only in Asia but really to our global
business.
     The way we like to think about it is that the Japanese consumer is one of
the most critical and most discerning in the world. The Japanese consumer can
see product differences that other consumers often miss. We use the capability
of the Japanese consumer and the tough competition we have here in Japan to
not only improve our products in Japan but improve our products globally.
     Let me give you some examples. You may know that we introduced the
dish-washing detergent called Joy in 1995 and it became the market leader in a
relatively short period of time. It was formulated differently (from a
comparable product in the United States) because habits are different in
Japan.
     In North America, consumers put dish-washing liquid in sinks, fill them
with water and create a solution. In Japan, consumers put drops of
dish-washing liquid on a sponge and then wash with it.
     In hair care, we also have to formulate differently. Japanese, and Asian,
hair is six times the diameter of Caucasian hair. If you understand geometry,
the larger the diameter is, the more surface area you have and the more
conditioning you need.
     I understand that in the early years of its operations in Japan, P&G
simply brought U.S. products to Japan.
     That's correct. And they failed.
     When did your company actually realize there were differences in consumer
tastes?
     I don't remember the exact year, but it was maybe 1985, with a program we
called "Ichidai Hiyaku."
     Meaning a great leap forward?
     Exactly. We really got focused on creating products in Japan for Japanese
consumers. That led to better business growth.
     We now want to go a step further and use the Japanese consumer to help us
innovate products for the rest of the world. That's the reason you see this
building here.
     You know many, many foreign companies are going to places like Singapore
and Hong Kong. We purposely chose to come to Japan.
     Let me ask you about the impact on your company of the bearish state of
the Japanese economy in the wake of the economic bubble. You are lucky because
your arrival coincided with the very beginning of a recovery.
     Is it recovering? (laughter)
     Did your company suffer any adverse effects from the collapse of the
bubble economy? Many Japanese companies blame it for their poor performance.
     I think that of a number of issues, the most critical to me is (that) we
need to...get the economy growing again.
     From our company's standpoint, we are trying to increase the rate of
innovation in our products. I don't think the Japanese consumer has become any
less desirous of quality products or better value.
     In fact, consumers have become even tougher--tougher judges. We know that
if we innovate in our products and if we give them a product that truly is
superior, they buy it. That's a challenge.
     I have read an awful lot about price destruction after the bubble
economy. In some ways, price destruction is our own fault. As we look at some
(of our) behavior as a company, we have found that many things that we did may
have exacerbated and perpetuated price destruction.
     Some of these things have perhaps hurt the consumer more than helped the
consumer. We have a strategy worldwide that we call ECR or efficient consumer
response. ECR is the idea that you focus on specific consumer needs and give
the consumers what they want and eliminate all non-value-added activity.
     In Japan, as you know, sometimes when you go shopping, you can find a
certain product at one store at 200 yen and at another store at 1,200. yen As
a consumer, you immediately register in your mind: What's going on? Why is
there such a price disparity?
     This is because the situation is not transparent. The consumer doesn't
understand the value of the products that they are buying. We want to create a
transparent environment--an environment where the consumer can buy a product
because of the product performance, the position of advertising and
variants--no deception...By eliminating all the inefficiencies in supplying
products, we can be the lowest price every day.
     When I spoke with a New York fund manager the other day, he said he
favors household product manufacturers like yourself because their stock
prices are not so vulnerable to the cyclical changes in the economy--the
consumer needs your products anyway regardless of the prevailing economic
conditions. Is this observation correct?
     Let me tell you the way we look at it. Our company's job is to increase
total shareholder value. In order to measure our performance, we actually
measure ourselves against many other companies in our industry. And we'd like
to be in the top of that measurement.
     Total shareholder value includes things like stock-price appreciation and
dividends. A consumer goods stock is good to hold in a bearish market. Procter
& Gamble in the last three years actually has been at the top of the industry.
As a result, we've seen an exponential increase in the share price. We hope we
will be able to keep that up.
     We believe it is very important for the employees to feel that they are
the owners of the company.
     Procter & Gamble believes very deeply that the interests of its employees
and the company are inseparable. As a result, here in Japan in August, we gave
each employee stock in P&G.
     Was that stock offer the first of its kind?
     Yes, the first time. Again it demonstrates our commitment to people. The
idea is to increase the feeling of their ownership of the company.
     P&G has been in Japan for 23 years. Do you think this is long enough to
achieve a solid customer base that can generate earnings automatically without
pouring an enormous amount of money into advertising?
     That's a great question. The interesting thing about Japan, as I told you
before, is that the Japanese consumer is discerning. As a result of that, in
Japan, you win big or you lose big.
     There really is no in-between. If you develop a superior product like
Joy, you win very big. But if you have a product that is inferior, you can
lose very big.
     So I don't think that there are any automatic earnings or automatic
market share in Japan.
     I would say of all the countries I worked in--I worked in many and am
familiar with our business all over the world--in this country, you have to be
working hard every single day to satisfy the consumer. Otherwise, you lose.
     Part of that is the consumer and part of it is the competition, because
the competition is working hard every day.
     We have Kao-san (Kao Corp.), Lion-san (Lion Corp.) and Uni-Charm as our
competitors here in Japan. I am afraid that even if we are here for a century,
there will be nothing like automatic earnings.

     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd

     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd
     Yomiuri
     Yokozuna Takanohana maintained his hold on first place and a perfect
record, defeating No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga on the 10th day of the Autumn
Grand Sumo Tournament at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan on Tuesday.
     Takanohana (10-0) was sent sliding backwards by the maegashira's initial
charge, but quickly righted himself, and turned the momentum rapidly in his
direction to push out Tamakasuga (4-6).
     Yokozuna Akebono suffered his second loss of the basho when he was thrown
down by No. 1 maegashira Asahiyutaka.
     The two rikishi had to wrestle twice, after the judges called for a
rematch when the first bout ended in confusion.
     Akebono (8-2) appeared to have lost when he inadvertently stepped out of
the dohyo while trying to apply the final shove to Asahiyutaka (7-3).
     Akebono had a solid two-hand belt hold on the maegashira at the time and
had him toeing the straw, when he accidentally stepped out with his right foot
as Asahiyutaka struggled to stave off the yokozuna.
     Television replays clearly showed that the yokozuna had indeed stepped
out first, but after a lengthy discussion, the judges ordered the pair to
wrestle again.
     Ozeki Takanonami had to muster all his energy to avoid defeat at the
hands of sekiwake Kaio, leaving both wrestlers at 7-3.
     Kaio shot off the mark and stood the ozeki up, gaining a two-hand belt
grip in the process. The sekiwake moved the ozeki near the edge of the circle,
before Takanonami finally fought off the charge and quickly turned the tables
and lifted Kaio out.
     Ozeki Wakanohana fought off an aggressive effort from No. 2 maegashira
Kotoinazuma (3-7) to bag his kachikoshi eighth victory.
     Wakanohana stood firm in the face of the maegashira's repeated slaps and
thrust, weathering the storm until he could wear down the maegashira and push
him out of the dohyo.
     Ozeki Musashimaru got his kachikoshi by prevailing over No. 1 maegashira
Akinoshima (3-7) in a bout that lasted just a split-second.
     Akinoshima tried to fire off the tachi-ai at a low angle, hoping to knife
in underneath the ozeki, but Musashimaru reacted quickly to foil the
maegashira's plan.
     Musashimaru extended both arms to steady himself by touching the
maegashira's shoulders, then quickly pulled Akinoshima down by the back of the
neck.
     Sekiwake Takatoriki (5-5) dominated komusubi Kotonowaka (1-9) in a short
affair. Takatoriki took charge of the match from the outset, using a left-hand
smash to the throat of the komusubi to pave the way to victory.
     Takatoriki kept his hand on Kotonowaka's throat, then moved in and got a
belt-hold, which he used to twist the komusubi around in a circle before
pushing him out.
     Komusubi Musoyama benefitted from some carelessness on the part of No. 2
maegashira Kenko (1-9) for his sixth win .
     Kenko came off the tachi-ai with the advantage, forcing the komusubi
backward with a succession of slaps to the face. However, just as the
maegashira moved in to finish Musoyama off, he allowed the komusubi to grab
his arms at the exact moment his body was extended in a precarious position.
     Musoyama seized the opportunity, and moved to the side and pulled the
maegashira down.
     Komusubi Kotonishiki (8-2) made short work of No. 5 maegashira Daishoho
(5-5).
     The agile komusubi employed a combination of good hand and footwork to
get himself behind the maegashira and push him out.
     Flying off the mark, Kotonishiki kept himself out of Daishoho's reach
while simultaneously applying deft blows to the shoulders and back of the
maegashira to put himself in position for the win.
     No. 3 maegashira Kotobeppu (1-9) finally got in the win column by scoring
a victory over No. 4 maegashira Konishiki (5-5).
     The two heavyweights bashed into each other repeatedly, before Kotobeppu
got Konishiki off-balance, then used his ample stomach to move the larger
Konishiki backward over the straw.
     No. 7 maegashira Minatofuji threw down No. 4 maegashira Kitakachidoki
(2-8) with a one-hand belt grip to garner his fourth win of the tournament.
     Minatofuji (4-7) quickly gained a hold on Kitakachidoki's mawashi and
then lifted him in the air and flipped him over.
     No. 6 maegashira Aogiyama (4-6) forced out No. 5 maegashira Asanowaka
(3-7).

     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup

     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup
     Yomiuri
     TANAGURA, Fukushima
     The Ohio State University men's golf team shot a collective 5-under-par
Tuesday to lead the team competition of the Topy Cup U.S.-Japan
Intercollegiate Golf Championship at the Tanagura Country Club.
     The U.S. squad is followed by Senshu University at 3-under-par and
defending champion Nihon University at 1-over.
     Ohio State senior Chris Wollmann, who made the cut at the U.S. Amateur
Championship in August, shot a team high a 3-under-par 105 at the par-72
course 7,050-yard course.
     "I hit a lot of greens and my putting was very good," said Wollmann, who
admires Greg Norman and plans to turn pro next year. "I can make more birdies
if I putt well tomorrow."
     Another Ohio State senior, Didier De Vooght, played aggressively on the
hilly course. "I used my driver every hole except the short holes," he said.
     The Belgian golfer, whose driving distance averages 280-290 yards, won
the Belgian Amateur Championship in August. He will represent his country in
the World Amateur Cup this fall.
     The Ohio State team is among six U.S. teams, including Clemson
University, University of New Mexico and San Jose State University.
     The tournament, which uses five-man teams, takes the four lowest scores
in each group and totals them after 54 holes to decide the team champion. The
individual championship will be decided by the lowest 54 hole score.

on Tuesday night.
     The win increased Orix's lead over the idle second-place Nippon Ham
Fighters to 41/2 games.
     So Taguchi homered and had two RBIs and Junichi Fukura added a pair of
RBIs in the win for the BlueWave.
     Willie Fraser won his ninth game of the season for Orix, scattering five
hits and one run in five innings on the mound.
     Hawks' starter Kimiyasu Kudo (8-14) took the loss allowing all six runs
on eight hits in 62/3 innings.
     Hiroki Kokubo and Arihito Muramatsu had RBIs for the losers.
     In another Pacific League game:
     Marines 6, Buffaloes 5: Iwao Omura went 3-for-4 with a home run and three
RBIs as Chiba Lotte edged Kintetsu at Fujiidera Stadium.

     The win moved the Giants back to within one game of the first-place
Hiroshima Carp in the race for the CL flag.
     The Giants pounded out 15 hits off seven Yokohama pitchers, including
solo home runs by Daisuke Motoki and Shinichi Murata.
     Takashi Saito (9-9) started and took the loss for the BayStars, getting
pelted for five runs on six hits in 41/3 innings.

to lower his ERA on the season to 2.47.
     Swallows 8, Carp 4: Tom O'Malley went 3-for-4 with a three-run homer and
four RBIs as Yakult downed Hiroshima at Jingu Stadium.
     O'Malley's blast came in the bottom of the first inning off Hiroshima
starter Ken Yamasaki (9-4) who took the loss.
     Kazuya Tabata (11-11) gave up four runs on six hits in 72/3 innings but
got the win for the Swallows.
     Tomoaki Kanemoto hit his 26th homer, a three-run shot, in the loss for
the Carp.
     Shinya Miyamoto also homered for the Swallows.

WORLD BANK'S PLANS FOR BOSNIA

The World Bank has unveiled what it calls an integrated approach to
reconstruction in Bosnia that envisages spending no less than $4.8bn to
rebuild a devastated country.  The bank's president, James Wolfensohn,
listed 10 major project components for the three year programme to run
from January 1996.  These are: water and sanitation ($380m); energy -
to include power, district heating, natural gas distribution and coal
($893m); transport ($698m); telecommunications ($567m); agriculture and
rural reconstruction ($330m); industry ($400m); education ($275m);
health ($540m); housing ($600m); and mine-clearing ($200m).

Extent of destruction.  The programme is needed to cope with the
destruction or serious damage of two-thirds of the country's housing
stock, half of its schools and colleges, and one-third of its health
facilities, Mr Wolfensohn told the London Conference on Peace
Implementation in December.  It was also necessary to wean ordinary
Bosnians back into economic life.  At present, nine out of 10 are
dependent on humanitarian assistance, whilst family incomes are
averaging one-quarter of their pre-war level.

Donor meeting.  The programme will have to be financed by a variety of
bilateral and international groups.  Mr Wolfensohn said that the IMF
and the central banks of key potential donor countries are backing the
programme.  The Netherlands is expected to play a major role in hosting
a donors' conference in the next few weeks.  The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is currently preparing major
projects in the power, telecommunications and transport sectors.

EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere says technical missions have made
preliminary assessments and that detailed project preparation studies
have been defined.  The EBRD, he said, "is considering both equity and
loan instruments, oriented to channel resources efficiently to Bosnian
enterprises."  Mr de Larosiere stated that Bosnia would require
significant levels of concessional funding.  Both bank presidents
stressed the need for a dual approach: the revitalisation of local
enterprises - which often amounts to the establishment or encouragement
of private sector enterprise in an economy still dominated by the state
- along with the physical reconstruction of key infrastructure.
Palestinian experience.  The World Bank has learned from its experience
in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza that if such an
ambitious reconstruction programme is to get off the ground, then
concrete aid proposals will have to be formulated - and implemented -
very quickly indeed.  In this context, it has already begun
implementing a priority three month programme to run from January 1 to
March 31 1996, which Mr Wolfensohn estimates will require between $550m
and $600m.  At a meeting in Brussels in December, the Bank, the
European Commission and the EBRD held an initial meeting of donor
countries and agencies to set out a comprehensive reconstruction
programme and mobilise short-term commitments.

Mr Wolfensohn has already committed the bank to contributing a
significant part of this short term financing, whilst the European
Union, the Islamic Conference Organisation and individual European and
Islamic states are putting the finishing touches to contributions that
should ensure the initial programme is fully funded.

In stressing an integrated approach to reconstruction, Mr Wolfensohn
and other potential donors have stressed that they will take into
account humanitarian and human rights issues as well as those of
practical reconstruction.  It seems likely that a number of significant
major projects will be initiated in 1996, not least in terms of the
restoration of basic services in Sarajevo and other major cities.  But
it is impossible to predict what will happen in 1997 in view of the
fact that the American-led military implementation force is supposed to
complete its mission at the end of 1996, thus potentially removing one
of the key pillars of day-to-day security in Bosnia.

Political strings.  In addition, the US has made it very clear that
reconstruction comes with tough political strings.  "Reconstruction
funds are not a right.  Those who fail to comply with the Dayton
Agreement should not expect our help; those who do not co-operate with
the War Crimes Tribunal should not expect to receive the benefits of
economic and financial assistance," the US ambassador to the UN,
Madeleine Albright, told the London conference.

EBRD LOOKS TO BOSNIA

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is predicting an
"explosion" of investment funds in war-torn former Yugoslavia, once the
peace settlement takes hold in the emerging patchwork of states.  A co-
author (along with the European Union) of the region's nascent $3bn -
$4bn World Bank-led reconstruction programme, the EBRD is to undertake
the rebuilding of the financial sector in order to "mobilise domestic
and foreign capital".

The government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has already
applied for full membership of the international financial
institutions.  But this has been held up pending a settlement of the
issue of outstanding debt obligations of the former Yugoslavia.  The
peace agreement means, however, that a solution to the problem will
soon be found.  Indeed, reconstruction plans, which will depend on
World Bank and other international finance, are already in an advanced
stage.

"Finance for local companies has been limited all over the Balkan
countries", says Peter Bod, the bank's board member for Hungary, the
Czech and Slovak Republics and Croatia.  "But as the region recovers
from the transitional depression and opportunities improve following
the implementation of the peace agreement, the demand for funds will
certainly explode.  The EBRD has been active in all member countries
and is willing to contribute to further modernisation in the Balkan
region".

Croatian example.  The EBRD is pointing to neighbouring Croatia as a
role model for its investment plans.  The country is a relatively new
member of the bank, but has been able to produce a selection of
bankable private and public sector projects.  In the last 12 months it
has become one of the most dynamically expanding clients of the EBRD.
This was against a backdrop of hyper-inflation of 1,150 per cent in
1993 (now down to 3 per cent) and surrounding instability.

The bank's Croatia portfolio tops $300m worth of infrastructure
reconstruction projects including $100m on new highways, $100m for
electricity network reconstruction and $80m for air traffic control.
There are also strong industrial projects, like the pharmaceutical
project at Pliva, and sizeable banking projects.  The bank is the sole
investor in Croatia's financial sector.

"Among the institutional prerequisites, the banking sector
rehabilitation is perhaps the crucial one" says Mr Bod.  "Bilateral
support and multilateral assistance should concentrate on this task.
Reliable banking and savings institutions are needed to support savings
in the countries concerned.  Domestic sources must become the main
source of investment and trade finance".  He points to the region's
more advanced transition countries where two thirds of financing
requirements are sourced domestically.

Gap for EBRD.  None of the countries in the region has an "investment
grade" classification from the World Bank.  Western investment banks
are therefore reluctant to take long-term risk in the region.  The
local banks' capability and willingness to take longer term corporate
risk is also limited, partly because of a lack of longer term deposits.
 Moreover the structures of the banking industry in the region are
highly concentrated.  This is where the EBRD will come in.

The EBRD sees a mammoth task ahead.  In previously war-stricken areas
it has identified wholesale investment requirements in physical
infrastructure - bridges, power, roads, water supplies, health care,
housing.  The Trans-European routes have been neglected and suffered
destruction and require major reconstruction.  Formation of new states
needs new cross-border transport and communication links.  And the
region is saddled with companies whose equipment is obsolete and calls
for extensive upgrading and modernisation.

EBRD PREPARES FOR SOFIA

As the New Year dawned, officials from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) declared themselves well
satisfied with progress to date for the 1996 conference to be held in
Sofia in April.

Bulgarian businessmen may be profoundly sceptical that the capital can
cope with the thousands who turn up for the bank's annual jamboree. But
the "sherpas", who have been carrying out the donkey work since last
September, believe they have cracked the main problems.

Sofia's airport is a notorious bottle neck at normal times. Immigration
and customs would be completely overwhelmed by jumbo-loads of high-
powered international politicians and bankers. Soviet administrations,
however, were finely tuned to the needs of visiting dignitaries. Their
legacy is a 1960s-built VIP wing as large as the main terminal itself.
This will be placed at the disposal of the EBRD caravanserai.

Electricity?  Sofia also boasts a late 1970s Congress Centre designed
with command economy mass rallies in mind. Officials have found its
layout and design more functional and easier to move around in than
anything Budapest, St Petersburg or London have been able to supply.
More importantly in this city of unreliable utilities, the centre has
independent power supplies.

Tight squeeze.  Hotel accommodation remains a bone of contention.
Gilbert Sabathe, (the bank's assistant secretary-general) in charge of
conference planning and protocol, is confident of putting up the core
delegations in western comfort at the Sheraton, InterContinental and
Novotel. A further 19 hotels have been chosen to accommodate the
expected 2,000 to 2,500 visiting foreign representatives, guests and
press. (Bulgarian attendees are expected to find private
accommodation.)

Even with these numbers - distinctly on the low side by Budapest and St
Petersburg standards - the bank's travel agents have had to scour the
countryside and 2-star operations in the less salubrious inner city
quarters to come up with sufficient beds. No recommendations on room
sharing have yet been issued.

Mr Sabathe concedes that Sofia, like some other East European capitals,
may not be ideally suited to servicing pampered westerners but he
regards it as central to EBRD's role to encourage such cities to reach
international standards.

HORN SHOWS IRRITATION

"There is only one decision-making authority in this country and this
is the government," Gyula Horn, the Hungarian prime minister, said last
month. He is increasingly irritated by the rejection of some of his
economic policies either by parliament, by the Constitutional Court or
his own Socialist Party.

In an interview with a local economic newspaper Mr Horn said he was
surprised by the parliament's vote (including some support from the
ruling coalition) demanding that the extra revenue generated by
privatisation sales is devoted to reducing Hungary's debt rather than
spent on domestic investments. However, Mr Horn is confident that he
can modify the decision when the full extent of the revenue is known.

The rejection of some of the cutbacks in social provisions by the
Constitutional Court forced the government to raise the top rate of
personal income tax from 44 per cent to 48 per cent but the "main
problem is that this leads to the further weakening of the middle
layers", said the prime minister. "Many take the view that the
government is pursuing a kamikaze policy, working against its own
future. But what else can we do in the current economic situation? ...
Here we cannot proceed according to party-political criteria".

At the same time he conceded that it is "unjust that the wage position
of public sector workers is getting worse from year to year ... Next
year we hope to stop this trend, although there is no scope for
improvement".

About the next two years Mr Horn said that 1996 "will be the year of
creating employment and stabilisation. In 1997 the credits (from
Germany and the Far East) will bear fruit."

ROMANIAN LINKS WITH ITALY

The crash of a Romanian airliner after take-off from Verona on December
13 has revealed the build-up of a close business relationship between
the Verona-Vicenza-Treviso area of Italy's Veneto region and the
Timisoara-Arad-Oradea area on Romania's west.

Of the 49 killed in the Banat Air Antonov 24 turbo-prop, 30 were
Italians and included entrepreneurs, technicians and accountants. Most
were bound for Timisoara on what is now  a thrice weekly service,
extending also to Bucharest.

Passenger lists of the Italians showed their activities were in textile
and apparel manufacture, sale of textile machinery and printing
machinery, agricultural seeds, bakery, bijouterie and silversmiths.

A regular traveller, not on the aircraft, said it was advantageous for
a medium-small entrepreneur to set up a manufacturing operation in
Romanian as manpower costs were lower than in Slovenia or Hungary.

According to the economic newspaper 24 Ore some 150 companies dealing
with west Romania have been established in Verona alone, while the
Verona-Timisoara service has in the last year carried nearly 10,000
passengers.

DEVISING INVESTMENT GUIDELINES

Experts from eight CIS governments and parliaments sat down with
western experts in Istanbul at the end of last year and worked out a so-
called framework destined, as the Paris-based OECD told EEM, "to
enshrine good principles of open and even-handed treatment of foreign
direct investment".

Rolf Alter, senior negotiator of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development said that the "Framework for  Foreign
Investment in Transition Economies" does not have official status as
yet, but "reflects the cumulative experience of experts from both CIS
and OECD member countries".

He added: "Those on the CIS side were not officially representing their
governments.  Rather, they were people with expertise in applying
foreign investment legislation and who had been confronted with the
problems in this field.  The framework is a kind of `how-to-do-it'
document".

OECD, which serves as a think-tank for the world's industrialised
countries, said it will hopefully provide a source on which CIS
countries can draw in revising foreign investment laws; a basis for co-
ordinating advice to CIS countries; help harmonise CIS legislation with
international standards, such as investment protection treaties, and,
above all, "foster clarity and transparency in CIS countries' foreign
investment legislation".

The meeting was attended by representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Ukraine was a notable absentee.

HUNGARIAN BANK TO LEAVE LONDON

Due to anticipated changes in Hungarian legislation as well as to meet
international requirements, Hungary's most successful foreign banking
operations - the London-based Hungarian International Bank (HIB) - is
to be wound up.

The decision follows unsuccessful soundings by the 93 per cent owners
of the bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to sell it as a going
concern to foreign interests.  OTP, the Hungarian savings bank owns the
remaining 7 per cent.

During its last financial year ending in September 1994 HIB made a
profit before tax of $4.3m.  While some of Hungary's larger banks would
have liked to acquire the operation - which has been active in London
since 1973 as a trade finance and forfaiting institution - banking
sources indicated that the capital strength of the would-be owners did
not impress the Bank of England sufficiently to endorse the change of
ownership.

The bank's operations are currently under winding down, with a view to
closure by end-1996.  However, it is understood that some activity
mainly forfaiting may be carried on as a new operation by OTP, although
no  statement was forthcoming either from HIB or OTP on future
intentions.

The NBH in Hungary was unwilling to make a statement about their
reasons for their failure to sell HIB as a going concern.  Some
observers were surprised that HIB was not sold to third parties as it
would have represented considerable capital value.  However, contrary
opinion was expressed by Jack Wilson, who was managing director of HIB
during the 1980s and now is chairman of London  Forfaiting Company, a
leading player in the forfaiting market.  "A banking licence in London
has a doubtful value.  The Bank of England does not encourage the trade
in existing banking licences", he said.

The closure will mean the end of 60 jobs although some of its
activities may be continued under a different name and different
ownership.  HIB has representative offices in Frankfurt, Zurich, Tokyo,
Paris, New York, Budapest as well as in Cambridge and Manchester in the
UK.

Two other NBH-owned banks are also to be sold.  The Frankfurt-based
Deutsche-Ungarische Bank and the Vienna-based Central Wechsel und
Creditbank have been  put on the market.

POLAND'S BANKS ON THE MOVE

After lagging in the Polish economy's economic growth stakes, the
banking sector is moving ahead with privatisation and looks set to
become a spectacular success story into the coming decade.  This is the
prediction of Derek Chambers, banking specialist at James Capel Europe,
who has singled out the country's nascent High Street banks as the
sector's beneficiaries of the "most exciting growth".

Speaking at a recent seminar in London on Poland's privatisation
programme, Mr Chambers pointed out that the country's banking sector is
already beginning to see a rapid increase in the scale of its
activities.  He pointed out that consumer borrowing is growing at a
rate similar to what was experienced in the UK in the 1970s.
"Inflation is 23 per cent this year" noted Mr Chambers.  "It will be 20
per cent next year and fall to 14 per cent in 1997.  Our belief is that
the retail banks will benefit from this situation.  Three or four of
the privatised banks will have excellent prospects".

His reasons for optimism are many.  Paradoxically, one is the  state of
health of the much-maligned zloty.  There has been a decline in foreign
currency deposits in Poland following the zloty's stabilisation against
the dollar, making zloty returns more attractive.  More employees are
being paid by bank transfer, and the number of active personal accounts
has soared over the past 12-18 months, doubling or even trebling in
some banks.  Consumer finance for purchase of household durables is now
within reach with the fall of inflation and interest rates and it is
estimated that as much as two thirds of consumer durables are now
purchased on credit.

Rapid growth of accounts.  Traditionally, the number of adult Poles
with bank accounts was low - not much more than 20 per cent.  Mr
Chambers predicts that the changes in Poland's economic climate are
helping to revolutionise this situation.  "The development of the
economy and the relatively small scale of banking intermediation at the
moment, means that an annual double digit percentage real growth in
banking business volumes will be sustained for some years to come," he
said.  "Lower margins will be required to make banking services
affordable, but the volume growth should offset the margin effect on
profitability".

Lower real interest rates also make lending to private sector
enterprise more viable.  Business is showing increasing willingness to
embark on large scale investment projects.  In the first half of 1995,
private sector investment outlays increased by nearly 50 per cent in
real terms.  Overall, he believes that banking services could easily
double relative to the economy over the next 10 years, which would add
7 per cent per annum real growth to underlying 5 per cent growth.

Although international banks are much in evidence in Poland, most of
the future growth is likely to come from domestically-based banking
institutions.  "Some of the banks that have emerged from the state
banking sector are likely to be the best placed to provide the services
that the population and the economy will require", adds Mr Chambers.

In the 1980s commercial banking in Poland was monopolised by the
central bank. However, there were also other specialised institutions.
Bank Handlowy was originally founded in the nineteenth century and
regained its autonomy in the 1960s, specialising in foreign trade.
Although it has lost its monopoly, it continues to handle about half of
foreign trade finance.  PKO BP, the national savings bank, has the
largest branch network, and also finances home loans.

Bank Pekao is the main foreign currency deposit-taker in Poland, and
the largest bank in terms of deposits.  In 1989, the central bank hived
off its branches into nine regional banks, which developed into quasi
regular commercial banks.  Three have been privatised, and
privatisation of a further two or three is likely during the next year.
 The rest will be taken out of state control before the end of 1996.

Mr Chambers does, however, see one down side: "The banks have not been
totally privatised.  There are still substantial holdings in the hands
of state agencies.  I would like to see a change in this."

ELECTION RESULTS: THE MEANING

Why should a president with a popular rating in single-digits believe
he can win re-election six months after the party of his supporters
takes a  drubbing?

The victories of "Our House is Russia" in Moscow (19 per cent) and the
Communist Party in the country (22 per cent) once again provide Mr
Yeltsin with the confrontationist card he has always enjoyed playing;
the one he exploited in the early months of 1993 when he promoted
polarisation  with a "communist" parliament, and acted as if Russians
have only one reform  democrat choice to make.

Now, as western governments and media rumble with warnings of a
communist return to power, Mr Yeltsin  can try to upstage opposition
democrat Grigory  Yavlinsky, whose failure to improve on the 8 per cent
vote his Yabloko party won in 1993 is a serious blow to his
presidential chances.

After co-founder of Yabloko, Yury Boldyrev, recently resigned with a
withering attack onMr Yavlinsky's  political morals (see below), and
another founder,  Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, left amidst criticism of Mr
Yavlinsky,  competence,  Yabloko is floundering. As a one-man vehicle
for Mr Yavlinsky's ambitions,  the party has nowhere to turn now,
except towards those who backed the  government on December 17, or
towards the Moscow democrats who split between Mr  Yavlinsky, Yegor
Gaidar and Sviatoslav Fyodorov.

If, as seems likely, Mr Yeltsin retains the  Prime Minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, and  strengthens the reform faction of ministers in his
government, he can  outflank Mr Yavlinsky in the electorate. By a
combination of bullying and  bribery, he should also be able to lure
the banks and oil companies away  from financing the huge costs Mr
Yavlinsky will need to sink into television in  order to stay in the
race.

The replacement of the foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev - which even he
admits  to expecting now - is an easy sop to the new parliament. It may
be a  consolation prize for Ivan Rybkin, the former speaker of the
Duma, whose  Kremlin-sponsored bloc failed to win any seats.

Last month's result confirms what has been obvious on both sides of the
Kremlin wall for months. Mr Chernomyrdin is unelectable for president,
and cannot expect to take Yeltsin's mantle in what some Kremlin
advisers once imagined would be a "natural succession" to the
presidency. The election result also destroyed the reputation of
government apparat and the oil and gas lobby - once presumed to be the
most powerful vote-getting machines in the country.

The two machines that emerge from the parliamentary election are the
Communist Party, and the city of Moscow. United, the two would almost
certainly defeat Yeltsin. Divided, Mr Yeltsin can defeat the
communists. Thus, Gennady Zyuganov and Mr Yeltsin are bound to admit
their chances of  winning power depend on which way the mayor, Yury
Luzhkov, decides to swing.

With 22 per cent of the vote, plus 4 per cent for Viktor Anpilov's
alternative communist bloc, and the eclipse of rural ally, the Agrarian
Party, the  communist leadership  can read the election outcome as good
for the  party, but not for  Mr Zyuganov as a presidential candidate.
Senior party figures knew that beforehand. They told EEM they would
analyse  the Duma poll to judge whom to choose as the figurehead of an
alliance against Yeltsin.

Lebed marginalised.  The surprise failure of the Congress of Russian
Communities (KRO) to reach  the 5 per cent required for party seats in
parliament, can be explained by the lack of effective grassroots
organisation, and the drift of votes from the industrial centres to the
Communist Party, not to Yury Skokov. His rivalry with General Alexander
Lebed has cost KRO dear. Gen Lebed himself won a personal seat for the
arms-manufacturing centre of Tula.  But without a KRO faction to sit
with, he is now a commander without troops. To advance further, he now
needs the Communist Party. The election result doesn't suggest they
need him, because the general is not a vote-winner in the big cities.

The Duma election demonstrated again, if anyone needs to be told, how
isolated Moscow has become from the rest of the country - an island of
affluence in a sea of poverty and resentment.  Mr Yeltsin's re-election
strategy  must capitalise on support from Moscow, and on the resistance
to a return of  the communists to power that is still felt throughout
the country. The man  Mr Yeltsin needs is the same man the communists
will be looking to for their  figurehead - this is Mr Luzhkov.

M r Yeltsin's confidante, Alexander Korzhakov, made it clear in a
television interview just before the December poll that he expects Mr
Luzhkov to stay out of presidential politics - at least until the end
of Yeltsin's second term. "If he decides to  run for re-election as
mayor",  Mr Korzhakov said of Mr Luzhkov, "I will vote for him. But if
he decides to run for president in 2000, I will not vote for him."

Mr Luzhkov has three months to judge whether he is better off siding
with Mr Yeltsin or against him. If Mr Yeltsin stokes the same fire with
parliament as  in 1993, it is likely Mr Luzhkov will also follow the
same course, keeping his head down.

Another sign to lift Yeltsin's presidential election chances was the
size of the no vote. Since Mr Yeltsin's first presidential election win
in 1991, Russian voters have steadily reflected their disappointment by
staying home on election day. This time, however, turnout rose to 64
per cent across the  country, confounding many politicians who expected
a further drop below the  51 per cent who voted in 1993.

The gain in voters' sense of duty was partly an achievement of the
disciplined local Communist Party organisations. But an estimated 5 per
cent of Russian voters chose the bottom-line on their ballot paper in
which they rejected all of the 43 parties listed.

When parliament debated the law on presidential elections early last
year, the Kremlin successfully pressed to remove this choice out of
fear the  no-vote may end up larger than the vote for the winning
presidential  candidate. That was done. When the presidential poll,
planned in June, takes place, Mr Yeltsin can count on forcing a simple
choice on the voters - the communists or himself. Those who don't like
that will stay at home, and the result is one Mr Yeltsin has reason to
be confident he can win.

SIGNIFICANCE OF MOSCOW RESULTS

The parliamentary election results have once again made clear that the
policies of President Yeltsin and the popular reaction that  galvanised
the Communist Party vote open a huge political divide separating
Moscow from the rest of the country.  Ironically, it is this which
sustains the government's confidence that it can continue in power, and
poses the most serious obstacle to the  communist challenge. To bridge
the divide in the presidential election  starting up now will require a
candidate who promises to keep Moscow's  affluence intact, while
convincing provincial Russians that, however unfair  and miserable
their lot may be, the communist alternative would be much worse.

The most notable result of the Duma election campaign is that the
communist gain is a consolidation, not a significant increase in their
national vote. The government's loss of votes is a defeat in the
country, but not in the capital. Put the two together, and you have a
case of all that changes stays the same. The sensation of deja vu is
bound to follow if  politicking in the early months of 1996 begin to
resemble the same period of  1993.

Support for government.  The election returns indicate Moscow was the
only major part of  the country where support for the government
remained stable, and  where the pro-government bloc came in ahead of
the opposition. Though the  parties and movements have changed names
and leaders, roughly 33 per cent of  Muscovites supported the
government in 1993; those votes were cast for  Russia's Choice (Yegor
Gaidar), the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  (Sergei Shakhrai), and
a number of small democratic reform groups. In December, the percentage
was almost identical, though this time the votes went  to Prime
Minister Chernomyrdin's "Our House is Russia" (NDR), Mr Gaidar's
Democratic Choice of Russia, and another handful of democrats.

In Moscow, the centre opposition or anti-government democrats have also
remained more or less in the same position, with just under 20 per cent
of the votes. In 1993 they included Yabloko (12 per cent) and the
Democratic Party of Russia (6 per cent); this year Yabloko did better
(15 per cent) and in place of the Democratic Party, Sviatoslav
Fyodorov's Working People's Self-government party emerged (4.5 per
cent).

Finally, the left opposition among Muscovites has changed character,
but its share of the total vote has stayed much the same as in 1993.
Then the Communist Party recorded 11 per cent; Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) 13 per cent. This time, the
Communist Party grew to 15 per cent, the LDPR slipped below 5 per cent,
and the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) replaced it with 6 per
cent.  The national figures show some differences, but the underlying
picture hasn't changed. Communist support is much greater than in
Moscow, but  proportionally not very much greater countrywide than the
1993 result.  Yabloko as the democratic alternative to the government
hasn't budged, and  remains at the same 8 per cent mark.

The government party NDR has been hit harder this time than Russia's
Choice  was in 1993. When Mr Gaidar drew 15 per cent, the defeat was a
stinging one. Now  that Mr Chernomyrdin has won just 10 per cent, the
result, though anticipated by  the Kremlin and press, ought not to be
less painful. With Mr Gaidar just clearing the 5 per cent barrier,
their combined total stays at 15 per cent. That  neither the Kremlin
nor the White House appears to be feeling too much pain  is explained
by their location in the heart of Moscow. In a real sense, they  won
Moscow - though they lost the country. Holding on to their political
power would be impossible without Moscow. What sort of power they can
exercise when the rest of the country has turned against them will be
seen  as the presidential campaign accelerates - and as the
independently elected  deputies of the Duma, and the regional
representatives in the Federation  Council take their new seats.

Because so many parties competed, but fell short of the 5 per cent
minimum vote required to be represented, their vote has been
redistributed to the five parties that have qualified  This will have
the  effect of magnifying the number of the Communist Party's seats
well beyond  its proportional share of the vote. One estimate by a
Kremlin official  indicates the communists will occupy roughly one-
third of the 450 Duma seats  - a big gain over the last parliament, but
still short of a majority.  The one in three Moscow voters who
supported Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Gaidar have  obvious economic
interests which a stable government can deliver more  reliably than Mr
Yavlinsky's promises. So long as Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of  Moscow,
stays loyal to Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, Moscow isn't likely to
fall  to Mr Yavlinsky. The communists have proved they couldn't elect a
president unless they find a non-communist to lead them, and he would
also have to appeal to Moscow's pro-government interests.  That's a
political improbability Mr Yeltsin should savour, for he can appeal to
both the pro-government Muscovites, and the large reservoir of anti-
communist sentiment in the countryside. Mr Yeltsin can borrow Charles
De Gaulle's slogan, "apres moi, le deluge". Even if still ailing, he
may not need to  convince the voters there really is a "moi", so long
as the "deluge" is worrying enough.

FIGHT OVER NEW OIL LAW

Yabloko leader and presidential candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, has come
under attack by the co-founder of his party, Yury Boldyrev, for trying
to promote oil company profits at the expense of Russia's national
interests.  The attack by Mr Boldyrev, who represents St Petersburg in
the outgoing  Federation Council, came on the eve of the December 19
session of the Council, when the senators voted to approve amendments
to the law on production-sharing in the oil and gas industry, and send
the revised bill to the President for signing.

Mr Boldyrev told EEM he resigned from Mr Yabloko several weeks ago
because of M r Yavlinsky's refusal to allow amendments to the
production-sharing law favoured by a majority of the Duma. Mr Boldyrev
is now deputy chairman of the Accounting Chamber, the independent
watchdog of government spending. Before his parliamentary career, Mr
Boldyrev headed anti-corruption investigations in the presidential
administration.

He led the Federation Council campaign to reject the Duma version of
the law, which was passed in June after intense lobbying by oil
companies and government officials. From July until October, the
Council came under the same pressure, but finally voted to reject the
key provisions.

That no-vote in the upper chamber included many regional
representatives appointed by the president, who were antagonized by the
lobbying campaign. The Council veto was the biggest defeat this year
for the oil and gas lobby, provoking Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to
publicly criticize the  fuel and  energy minister, Yury Shafranik, for
not lobbying hard enough.

"The first version [of the law] allowed the executive power to sign any
kind of contract", Mr Boldyrev said. "Any contract was allowable and
did not take into account the national interest." When the Accounting
Chamber asked the government in August to provide details and contracts
for the major oil  and gas projects at stake, nothing was handed over.

Opposing arguments.  These amendments were voted by the Duma on
December 6. Mr Yavlinsky's Yabloko was united in voting against, but
failed. Mr Yavlinsky has argued that the concessions are vital if
foreign energy companies will agree to invest billions of dollars in
Russian projects.  Mr Boldyrev says the amendments that have been
introduced in the law "allows and guarantees foreign investors, but
limits loopholes and stops making gifts of deposits to friends."

The amendments which were approved last month establish the primacy of
Russian civil and criminal law over contracts, and requires contract
disputes to be settled in Russian court. Tax and excise duty privileges
have  been trimmed, and new limits introduced on the concessions for
oil and gas  deposits which the government can award in contracts.
Production-sharing  benefits are to be allowed only for those deposits
and projects that are listed in federal law.

"These are the difficult deposits, which involve high costs and high-
risk investment",  Mr Boldyrev said. "They aren't the cream of the crop
which can be easily obtained."

He said the new law will tighten control of oil and gas concessions
that can be awarded without tender, and require investment contracts
for strategically important deposits to be approved by parliament.

In the Council, representatives of Russia's oil regions found
themselves in an ambiguous position over the terms of the production-
sharing law. Though it promised to open the doors to foreign investment
that is desperately needed in their regions, the small print of the law
took away the power to decide contracts from the regional authorities,
and gave it to the federal government. The regional senators are much
happier with the amended law than with the original version.

Explaining how the oil lobby was more successful in the opposition-led
Duma than in the more conservative Council, Mr Boldyrev said: "In the
upper chamber there are more experienced people, and more diverse
interests."

FLOWER POWER

When Muscovites celebrate national holidays, rose-growers on the
mountain slopes of Ecuador run out of roses to sell, and prices go up
rapidly. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, where most of Europe's cut
flowers are auctioned, if every Dutchman were to buy a rose between now
 and New Year, the number of roses traded would still be less than the
number  of roses Moscow will buy in the same period.

 It is figures like this that make Moscow the largest, fastest growing
market for cut flowers in Europe. And because fast growth also promises
fast money, dozens of speculators and short-term traders jostle the
larger Russian flower companies in what one executive calls "unhealthy
competition."

Today, flower entrepreneurs told EEM, there are about 60 importers of
cut  flowers for sale in Moscow. The total is an inexact one, because
many appear  for just one or two deals, often concentrating on sales
for a single  holiday, the March 8 "Women's Day." It is on that day the
Russian flower  business reaches its annual peak. Retail sellers'
margins, which usually  average around 100 per cent, leap to 200 per
cent and higher.

Valery Stayen, chief executive of Business Bouquet, believes that about
20 companies are regular importers of flowers. His company is one of
the largest, bringing in from the Dutch auctions by truck 300,000 roses
each week. Another "five or six" companies, Mr Stayen calculates, may
be importing comparable volumes of flowers. Together with the smaller
operators, the total imports to Moscow may exceed 2m weekly, or 8m per
month.

No-one in the flower trade knows for sure, and Customs figures are
misleading because most importers avoid paying the full 25 per cent
duty by official, as well as unofficial means.

According to Mr Stayen, the Moscow flower market is quite unlike other
cities in Europe or the US. Because of the long cold season, and the
sale of flowers on the street, only thick-stemmed roses and carnations
are suitable for trade. Ecuador produces most of the roses Russians
buy, but of the 30 types grown, only 10 can be sold to the Russian
trade. Inadequate and slow air transport between Quito, Ecuador's
capital, and Moscow, gives the Dutch brokers the chance to dominate
Russian supply - at least until the Russian flower companies can start
up their own plantations in Ecuador, and improve cargo delivery times.

Carnations, the second Russian choice, mostly originate now from
Columbia, Spain, Kenya and Israel. Again, the Dutch market serves as
the intermediary, adding about 16 per cent in margin, plus extra
transport costs. At least one Israeli horticultural company has a joint-
venture investment in a Kaluga-region growing operation; but foreign
investment of this kind is  rare.

Fluctuating market.  Russian tastes are also unique. "In Europe flower
demand is stable," Mr Stayen observed. "People use flowers in their
house each day. In Russia, there is  still the habit of buying for
special occasions. And because of that, because you have to have the
flower for that day, it doesn't matter how much it  costs."

Imports face limited domestic competition. There are a handful of
horticultural farms in the Moscow region. But they and Moscow's cottage
gardeners were able to exploit this year's unusually dry, hot weather
to produce more than the usual supply of roses, together with other
varieties of flowers. Although the Dutch auction price doesn't
fluctuate much seasonally, domestic Russian flowers were able to pull
down the import price this year.

Changed supplies.  Just over three years ago, at the start of 1992, the
market conditions were entirely different. Mostsvettorg, a state
enterprise, held the monopoly of imports, distribution, and retail
sales through its own kiosks and shops. Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan
supplied most of the roses and carnations within the Soviet economy;
Bulgaria, Egypt and Vietnam provided imports as part of inter-state
barter trade.

The collapse of the Soviet trading system, and war in Azerbaijan, have
virtually eliminated these sources of supply. Although Azeri traders
still control some retail locations around Moscow, they no longer
dominate the import business. The largest importers are now Russian.

Mr Stayen's company started three years as a small floral decorator,
providing exotic flower arrangements for companies, offices, and
special occasions to order. It then moved into the import business, and
began operating as a major wholesaler, not only to Moscow but  to a
network of provincial cities. They now number more than two dozen.

"For us", Mr Stayen told EEM, "it is not necessary to be the biggest
importer.  Better to optimise profitability on operations." Business
Bouquet dismisses  the buy-cheap, sell-dear tactics of the small
operators. It concentrates on  establishing regular volume clients, and
cutting supply costs.

CASPIAN SEA SAGA TO CONTINUE

The Caspian pipeline saga looks set to continue throughout 1996.  Last
October, the consortium developing Azerbaijan's principal offshore
reserves announced their intention to export "early oil" via both
Russia and Georgia - with a Russian contract to be signed by the end of
the month.  That contract has still not been signed and, with Chechnya
again embroiled in an increasingly violent conflict, the question is
whether Moscow can actually deliver on its promises concerning
Azerbaijani oil exports via Grozny and the Russian Black sea oil
terminal of Novorossiysk.

Georgian problems.  Ironically, no progress seems to have been made on
the second project, the establishment/renovation of a pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian port of Soupsa, for eventual export by ship to
northern Turkey.  For while the Russians have got bogged down over a
variety of security, financial and capacity considerations, the
Georgian line ran into problems over project finance structuring.

A fresh series of meetings scheduled for January could resolve the key
financial problems affecting both routes, but the security problems are
more difficult to resolve.  Negotiations on the northern route
initially became stalled because the Russians began demanding port fees
for the use of Novorossiysk in addition to the charge of $2.80 in
transit fees which would be levied for every barrel of Azerbaijani
crude shipped through the system.  The $2.80 figure is a net rate,
taking into account the half dollar depreciation which would stem from
the necessary blending of relatively high quality Azerbaijani crude
with Russia's own Urals blend.

Although this is around 50 cents higher than the $2.30 calculation for
comparable cost of shipping early oil out via Soupsa, the consortium
does not appear to believe that cheaper oil shipment costs warrant an
preference being given to the Georgian route.  For one thing, the costs
of this differential will be borne by Azerbaijan, in its capacity as
owner of the actual reserves being exported.  The 1994 agreement under
which Azerbaijan granted the three fields of Chirag, Guneshli and Azeri
to the consortium specified that capital and operational expenditures
were to be deducted before royalties were due, so transit costs, which
are generally covered by these headings, matter less to the consortium
than they do to the Azerbaijani government, which would in effect bear
the cost of the extra 50 cents through decreased revenues.

Russia's dilemma.  From the Russian perspective, the question is
whether capturing up to 5m tonnes (100,000 b/d) of Azerbaijani early
oil for Novorossiysk is worth the fact that it will displace an
equivalent volume of purely Russian exports, since Novorossiysk is
already working at its full capacity of just 32m tonnes per year and,
with troubles dogging the rival Caspian Pipeline Consortium's proposal
for a capacity expansion line from Tikhoretsk to a single point mooring
just west of Novorossiysk, it looks as if it will be some years before
handling capacity is increased. Such problems are capable of commercial
resolution and the long-term prospect of securing full-scale
Azerbaijani exports for Novorossiysk can serve as a rationale for short-
term cutbacks, or re-routing , of Russia's own exports, particularly
where the volumes are so relatively small.  But the recent fighting in
Chechnya raises problems of an altogether different dimension, and here
the consortium remains dangerously vulnerable.

Grozny route vital.  In the long run, it can certainly consider a
pipeline routing to Novorossiysk that avoids Chechnya, but in the short
run, it has to use the Grozny line if it is to export early oil.  This
requires an essentially political decision and the impression at
present is that two of the consortium's main pillars, Amoco of the US
and British Petroleum , are still trying to secure use of the Grozny
route because they believe close co-operation with Moscow is essential
for their other oil interests in the region whilst also being necessary
in terms of assuaging Moscow's concerns about the very fact that they
are developing the still controversial and politically disputed oil
reserves off the coast of Azerbaijan.

Turkish election result.  As for the Georgian route, Turkey continues
to stress that is would provide full political risk guarantees for any
oil shipped by that route in the hope that this will encourage the
consortium to shift its focus away from Novorossiysk.

Now that it looks likely that the Islamist Refah party will not come to
power in Ankara, prospects for the Georgian route have improved.  But,
as always, nothing is certain in this enduring saga.

EMPLOYEE RIGHTS DEMANDED

With some exceptions "the rights of ordinary employees to take part in
privatisation are either non-existent or widely ignored in many former
socialist countries in this part of the world," according to Robert
Oakeshott, executive director of London's Job Ownership Ltd (JOL).  He
was addressing an international seminar in Slovakia on employee
involvement in privatisation.

He cited as exceptions Slovenia and Bulgaria, among five countries with
which he worked; the others being Hungary, Romania and Macedonia.  Even
in Romania and Hungary however, despite "quite robust" laws on
employees rights, "it seems that managers and others with unusual
influence are frequently able to trample over them."

It was therefore significant that leading trade unions in at least
three countries - Bulgaria, Slovenia, Macedonia - had "now woken up to
the fact that members' rights in privatisation may need to be fought
for and then protected."

Is privatisation in Eastern Europe therefore a rip-off, from the
ordinary working person's viewpoint?  Such a feeling was not far from
the surface at the two-day seminar, where discussions focused on
various forms of possible employee involvement, such as direct share
ownership, MEBOs (Management-led Employee Buy-Outs) and ESOPs (Employee
Share Ownership Plans), in which a trust is established to hold
employees' shares.  The meeting was hosted by the Slovak metalworkers
union Kovo, with some organisational and financial support respectively
from JOL and Britain's Know-How Fund (KHF).

Criticism of Slovakia.  The keynote speaker was Eugen Skultety's, Kovo
vice-president, who did not mince words about his government's
privatisation methods.  Privatisation had taken an "unethical and often
illegal  course."  Citizens were losing confidence in the process, but
were too frightened to complain.  The absence of controlling organs
"creates an optimal milieu for a variety of speculators, illegal money
exchangers and a number of, we can openly say, mafias acting in this
field."

After describing some of the techniques these people employed, Mr
Skultety recalled that in May the Slovak government had adopted five
principles for the participation of employees, but these principles
were ignored by the National Property Fund, whose activity in
implementing privatisation was "completely non-transparent."

Mr Skultety's criticisms were backed by a legal adviser, Prof Gustav
Lesyk, who spoke of the privatisation of a chemical company employing
3,400.  Seventten managers got 34 per cent of the shares, and employees
the rest; the managers' shares were in bearer form so they could be
available to political friends.  But Prof Lesyk added, the unions must
keep out of politics.  "The unions role is to depoliticise the whole
thing."

Slovak participants heard presentations on employee ownership in
western companies like Republic Engineered Steels of US, Tullis Russel
(paper making) and Baxi Partnership) (domestic heating) of Britain.
They were also told about experiences nearer home, in Eastern Europe,
where JOL and KHF have been working.

Except for Macedonia, still at the starting line, the state of play
could be summed up as follows:

* A successful example is that of Herend, the 126 year old Hungarian
porcelain maker.  It described how an ESOP agreement establishing
employee ownership was signed in 1992.  Hungary is reported to have
about 100 ESOP companies but not all do so well.

* Eugenie Kostourkov, director of the Ownership Foundation, Sofia,
spoke of lobbying to get employee ownership legislation passed in
Bulgaria, resulting in the birth so far of some 20 ESOPs. He
illustrated two successful pilot projects; one, a company making
tractor parts which are exported to Germany; the other, a battery
manufacturer which had lost business with Russia's car plant at
Togliatti, but since diversified into other types of batteries.

* Slovenia, after some questionable early grabs by managers while an
old Yugoslav law was still in force, has probably the widest worker
ownership.  In 83 per cent of companies so far privatised, employees
hold the maximum permitted stake of 60 per cent.  Aleksandra Kanjuo-
Mrcela of DEZAP  however pointed out that this represents only some 50
per cent of capital value.  DEZAP, established to promote serious and
lasting employee ownership, has seven company members plus the Slovene
Free Trade Union Federation, though some others are poised to join,
including the leading domestic appliance maker Gorenje.

* Romania had no one present at the meeting, but JOL has organised
seminars there and invited several representatives on study tours to
Britain.  A considerable number of MEBOs are reported to have taken
place, though how many will stand the test of time has yet to be seen.
(continued on page 14)

In Slovakia, the question now is whether these experiences of others
can prove useful in launching similar employee involvement schemes in
the privatisation process, which is due to be completed by next June.
Or will they be frustrated by a regime which - if critics are to be
believed - increasingly shows authoritarian tendencies reminiscent of a
past era?

CASE STUDY - BOC IN POLAND

Britain's BOC Group has more than 20  years' track record in Poland.
Operating BOC Gazy - 70 per cent of its shares owned by the BOC group
and 30 per cent by the Polish State Treasury - it has since the early
1970s been Poland's sole supplier of helium.  It is now  also the
country's largest merchant hydrogen supplier, offering its customers a
high purity gases capacity, with a combination of both locally-sourced
and imported product.

The company was formed in April 1993 with the joint venture and was
bolstered by BOC Gazy's acquisition of three Polgaz (the former state
gases company) plants in the towns of Siewierz, Poznan and Wroclaw.
BOC Gazy has a 650-strong local workforce based on eight locations.  It
boasts between 25-30 per cent market share.  And it is extremely upbeat
about its experience.

"We were among the pioneers in joint venture investment in Poland"
boasts John Filer, the BOC director responsible for the Polish venture.
 "And our operations have continued to expand with increasing success.
From the start we took the view that Poland presented by far the best
investment opportunity.  And so far we have been proved right".

BOC's investment to date is 30m ($45m) and this will rise to between
#35m and #40m in the next few years.  The company paid 6m for the
initial deal for the three plants, and has pumped #2m a year into its
distribution network.  Currently it is expanding with a 65 tonnes-a-day
oxygen production plant for Elstal Labedy in Gliwice to be opened in
January 1996 and a 450 tonnes-a-day cyrogenic air separation unit (ASU)
at the Huta Czestochowa steelworks to come on-stream in mid-1996.

Distribution.  The company found that Polish industrial gases companies
operated on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with customers compelled to
collect their goods.  "Distribution was the missing link and to this
day there remains a "production mentality.  I make it - the customer
collects it".  As Mr Filer puts it: "Distribution was another word for
middleman - someone who got a cut without actually making anything.
What's more, they found that Polish companies had no confidence in
state producers, giving rise to a "DIY mentality."

BOC Gazy set out to change that.  It invested a fleet of modern liquid
tankers and palletised cylinder vehicles and is in the process of
establishing a network of strategically-located retail outlets - both
company-owned and independent agencies.  As a result, it has given the
country its first-ever reliable supplies of high purity liquid
nitrogen.  This will form the basis for growth of a wide range of
customer applications including purging, food freezing and electronics.

Its distribution asset programme includes the innovation - for Poland -
of BOC-owned storage tanks for liquefied gases in customers' premises.
BOC Gazy's will be the first two dedicated supply schemes in Poland,
supplying industrial gases by pipeline to large customers.

BOC Gazy's product range of liquid gases includes oxygen, nitrogen,
argon, carbon dioxide, helium and hydrogen, as well as compressed gases
for cutting and welding, oxy-fuel welding mixtures, and high purity
gases.

The company is bidding for business with major international companies,
themselves onward investors - Philips,  Pilkington's, Coca Cola,
PepsiCo (the latter currently have to import carbon dioxide), and the
freezing activity for McDonald's hamburgers.  "Before we came along
frozen meat for the food chains came from Germany" says Mr Filer.  "Now
locally produced meat is processed and frozen, and appears in the
hamburgers of consumers in Poland".  The company also supplies oxygen
to Polish hospitals.

Indigenous management.  Mr Filer puts much of the company's success
down to its indigenous management policy.  "This was deliberate from
the start.  We did not send any UK-based staff to Poland to take over.
The chairman is a Polish, so is his deputy.  We have recruited and
trained a professional sales team from within the ranks of the existing
employees.

Headaches with the workforce?  "Poland is strong in trade unions and
workers councils.  All I can say is that their co-operation has been
admirable.  And it should be taken into consideration that we pay our
workers a proportion of the profits so that they know that they have a
stake in ensuring that the company is a success".

Advice for others.  Mr Filer has some advice for western investors.  He
says they must accept that a sudden massive injection of foreign
capital - and presence - is bound to be traumatic experience for all
concerned on the ground and should be borne in mind.  "We believe that
western companies setting up shop there must also be prepared to invest
in the country and in its local communities".

FRENCH HYPERMARKET FOR POLAND

Centres Leclerc, a leading French hypermarket chain, has opened its
first Polish store at Ursynow, southern Warsaw, and plans a second
store at Zoliborz, west of the capital, in February.

Ninety per cent of goods on offer will be Polish food and clothes
because of high import duties, but the stores will be run on co-
operative lines established by the Centre's founder, Edouard Leclerc.
The Leclerc system is to group independent retailers under one roof and
one brand, giving them leverage with producers.

The Polish stores will be sponsored by French Leclerc stores, which
have invested FFr20m ($4m) in the programme.  Polish staff, accompanied
by their families, have been trained in France over three years.  In
all, the Polish expansion of Leclerc has been five years in the
preparation.

The stores in the Warsaw suburbs represent the first Polish investment
by a leading French chain.  French hypermarkets have been expanding
around the world, but have tended to avoid Eastern Europe.

Jean-Philippe Magre, the Leclerc executive in charge of the operation,
told EEM, "It's going to be a difficult market as Polish shoppers are
not yet at the stage of mass consumption.  Suggestions that Poland
represents a market of the kind that French chains found in Spain 20
years ago are erroneous.  We will draw first on a local population of
100,000 living five to 10 minutes from the store.

"We are starting modestly in Ursynow with only 2,000 square metres of
sales area, but plan to double this.  There will be petrol pumps, a
McDonald's and parking for 600 cars.  The Polish managers have all been
trained by us."

Leclerc wants  young Polish managers to imitate its French system of
powerful regional purchasing groups and to open quickly 10 stores-cum-
training centres, the basis of a future national chain.  Leclerc added
to EEM that the French government regrettably had offered no aid,
leaving it alone to fight "the German and Dutch groups investing
massively in Poland".

BULGARIAN GAS PROSPECTS

A new natural gas and light oil (condensate) field has been discovered
in northern Bulgaria by a local oil and gas exploration company.
According to the Oil and Gas Extraction Company  in Pleven, the field
is located outside the town of Montana near an old gas field.

Experts from the oil and natural gas department of the Committee for
Geology and Mineral Resources (CGMR) have estimated that the filed has
the potential of some 200,000 cu m of natural gas and around 40 cu m of
light oil per day.  Such a flow is considered to be very good as far as
current Bulgarian resources and demand are concerned.

Evaluation work on the commercial potential of the field is expected to
start early this year. The Pleven company will finance the evaluation
work.

Eight commercial natural gas fields have been discovered in Bulgaria so
far, all of them at a depth of 3,000m to 4,500m.  Experts believe that
the fields can also be found at a greater depth at the foot of the
Balkan mountain range.

According to experts, the share of locally produced natural gas may
rise to meet 15-20 per cent of Bulgaria's demand. Currently, Bulgarian
oil and gas reserves cover just about 1 per cent of the country's
needs.  Bulgaria currently lacks funds for proper exploration.

Six western companies have invested over $140m in oil and gas
exploration in Bulgaria, but only Texaco has discovered so far a
natural gas field that might be of commercial importance.  It is
located near the town of Varna on the Bulgarian Black Sea.  A final
assessment is being completed to determine the profitability of the
field considering extraction expenditures.

In the first half of this year, Bulgarian officials are expected to
meet with Texaco, Austria's OMV and Enterprise Oil to discuss whether
to establish a joint venture to develop it.

Investor protection row.  Bulgaria is planning to announce a new tender
with international participation, but critics say that the recently
adopted Concession Law creates obstacles rather than encourages foreign
investors.  One problem is that the law does not provide guarantees
that a company which has funded exploration work will also acquire a
concession for extraction - the company will have to participate in a
separate tender.

MOBILE TELEPHONE DISPUTE

France Telecom has asked the International Court of Justice to become
involved in a dispute with Poland over mobile telephone networks.  The
French company is seeking $500m in damages because it says Poland
failed to honour a pledge made in 1991 to allow it to run a GSM
cellular network.  France Telecom owns a 24.5 per cent stake in the
Polish telecom company PTK/Centertel.  This week Poland announced three
bids in a tender for licences.

GUATEMALA: NEW LAW LIMITING UNION RIGHTS FOR
CIVIL SERVANTS PROVOKES HUGE LABOR PROTESTS (Part 1)

     On May 23, Guatemala's governing Partido de Avanzada
Nacional (PAN) used its legislative majority to approve a new
law that eliminates the right to strike for most public
employees.  The law, which is part of a broad government
effort to modernize the state, has provoked bitter opposition
from public and private-sector unions.  Among other things,
labor leaders say the law is aimed at paving the way for
privatization of state enterprises by impeding the ability of
civil servants to resist the sale of government firms.
     When Guatemala's current Constitution took effect in
1986, the country's labor movement strongly supported some of
the clauses contained in the new Magna Carta, especially its
recognition of the right of civil servants to organize unions
and to strike, which was an important break from past
constitutions that prohibited such rights among public
employees.  Even so, the Constitution places significant
limits on the right to strike to ensure that essential public
services are never interrupted by labor disputes.
     The country's labor code states that workers in public
health services, sanitation, the energy sector, and water
services cannot strike unless they first make arrangements for
those services to continue without interruption.  And, for any
civil-servant strike to be deemed "legal," the union in a
given state ministry or institute must first petition the
courts for a "strike permit."  Without such a permit, any
decision to walk off the job is considered illegal and
adequate justification for dismissal or other punitive action.
     Nevertheless, since 1986 there have been only a few
instances in which public-sector unions have successfully
petitioned the courts for a strike permit.  In most cases, the
legal process takes many months--sometimes years--before a
judgement is forthcoming, forcing the unions to carry out de
facto strikes to push their demands.  As a result, essential
services, such as those provided by hospitals and health
clinics, have frequently been shut down during strikes,
generating ongoing debate about the country's labor laws.
     Since President Alvaro Arzu took office in January, the
debate has gained momentum, in part because of a series of
public-sector labor disputes that exploded this year.  In
January, for example, workers at two huge state hospitals in
Guatemala City--San Juan de Dios and Roosevelt--shut down
outpatient services to press for wage hikes, and they
threatened to mount a nationwide general strike if the
government did not open negotiations with them (see Chronicle
of Latin American Economic Affairs, 02/29/96).
     Beginning in mid-March, the country's 3,700-member
Sindicato de Trabajadores del Organismo Judicial (STOJ)
paralyzed the country's entire judicial system for three weeks
to press for wage hikes and approval of a new collective
bargaining agreement that the union had been negotiating with
the Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Justicia, CSJ) since March
1995.  The STOJ had petitioned the courts for a strike permit,
but given the slow progress of the request, plus the CSJ's
refusal to accept a wage hike in negotiations, the union
decided to forfeit legal permission and press forward with the
walkout.
     During the three weeks that it lasted, the strike gripped
public attention since it completely shut down the courts
throughout the country, leading to huge conflicts in some
towns and villages where criminals were caught by police but
then set free because the judiciary was inoperative.  In about
a dozen cases, local mobs took justice into their own hands.
A total of six men were lynched, and in four of the cases,
angry citizens burned the bodies of the victims after killing
them.
     Given the public backlash against the strike, the CSJ
hardened its position and successfully petitioned the courts
to declare the strike illegal.  Under threat of dismissal,
STOJ members finally returned to work on April 8 without any
of their demands being met.
     The conflict in the judiciary, however, emboldened the
Arzu administration to push forward with legislation to
further restrict union rights among civil servants.  On April
9, the day after the STOJ went back to work, the governing
party introduced a bill in Congress that would make it illegal
to even partially shut down public services in some ministries
and institutes under any circumstances, and to make legal
action against civil servants who strike without a permit much
faster and easier.
     In particular, the bill prohibits strikes in about a
dozen public sectors, including health, sanitation,
telecommunications, energy generation and distribution,
aeronautics, postal and telegraph services, the judiciary, the
security forces, urban and rural transportation, and water
distribution.  It also allows the executive to extend the
strike prohibition by decree to include other public
ministries and institutes if the government deems that a labor
walkout will seriously affect the national economy or if it
represents a grave risk to the public.  And, in those cases
where a union does strike without a legal permit, the bill
gives authorities the right to fire the striking workers
without need for court approval.
     The government says that the bill is part of a much
broader government plan to modernize the state.  According to
Vice President Luis Flores Asturias, in addition to the labor
bill, the Arzu administration is preparing a series of
complementary public-sector reforms to reduce bureaucracy and
increase government efficiency.  The reforms include a plan to
significantly cut back the civil servant work force.
     The government is now negotiating a loan with the World
Bank to finance a "voluntary retirement" plan whereby public-
sector employees would be given incentives to leave their
jobs.  The goal, according to Flores, is to reconcentrate the
responsibility for public services in the hands of a much
leaner and more technically qualified work force.  By reducing
the payroll, the government could offer better wages for those
who remain, thereby attracting better trained professionals
who would be more efficient at their jobs.
     "What we want is a smaller number of employees who will
be paid larger salaries that match their qualifications, both
technical and academic," said Flores.  "The modernization
program is still in the planning stages.  In the coming months
we will send proposals to Congress for approval with the goal
of implementing the full program at the beginning of next
year."
     Nevertheless, although reaction to other components of
the modernization plan remains to be seen, the labor-reform
bill has generated fierce disagreement since it was introduced
in Congress, not just within the country's labor movement, but
among most of the opposition parties in the legislature.  In
part, the criticism stems from the authoritarian approach
taken by PAN, which controls 43 of the 80 seats in the
unicameral Congress.  (Cont.)

GUATEMALA: NEW LAW LIMITING UNION RIGHTS FOR
CIVIL SERVANTS PROVOKES HUGE LABOR PROTESTS (Part 2)

     PAN has used its legislative majority to limit all debate
on the bill, discarding suggestions by the opposition that
labor leaders be consulted, or that the Constitutional Court
first be given an opportunity to rule on whether the bill
would violate the Magna Carta.  As a result, on May 23 PAN
unilaterally approved the bill against the unanimous
opposition of the remaining 37 congressional representatives,
generating harsh criticism from opposition parties.
     "A party dictatorship has been implanted in Congress
where laws are simply approved by PAN representatives without
even the slightest interest in listening to the opinion of
legislators from the other parties," said Aristides Villatoro
of the Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG), the second
largest party in Congress.
     In fact, the president of Congress, PAN leader Carlos
Garcia Regas, prohibited the public from being present in the
legislature when the bill came up for a vote.  Garcia hoped
that measure would block union leaders and activists from
filling the legislative auditorium in protest.
     In Guatemala, a bill must be passed in three consecutive
votes in Congress to become law.  On May 21, when the bill
came up for a second vote, Garcia Regas ordered the doors of
Congress shut to the public.
     In retaliation, about 300 labor leaders from the
Federacion Nacional de Trabajadores del Estado (FENASTEG) and
the Unidad de Accion Sindical y Popular (UASP) forced their
way into the building and held a sit-in in the voting chamber.
The activists refused to leave until 1,000 police officers and
army soldiers surrounded Congress and threatened to forcibly
remove them.
     When the bill received final approval in a third-round
vote on May 23, Congress remained under heavy guard by the
army and police, including four armored cars sent by the
military's Guardia de Honor, one of the largest bases in the
capital.
     According to labor leaders, the approval of the law has
encouraged the country's unions to take a much more aggressive
stance vis-a-vis the Arzu administration.  FENASTEG and the
UASP are planning massive demonstrations during the month of
June to protest the government's anti-union policies.
     "This law is part of a broad government offensive to roll
back the basic freedom of workers to organize unions, to
negotiate collectively, and to strike," said UASP leader
Sergio Guzman.
     Moreover, the unions believe that, in addition to
restricting union freedoms in general, the labor reform is
specifically aimed at paving the way for the privatization of
state firms and institutes in Guatemala by eliminating the
ability of public-sector unions to fight back.
     "This is the first step toward privatization in
Guatemala," said Guzman.  "The government is attempting to
clear the path for powerful private groups to take control of
state services, all of which tends toward the imposition of a
neoliberal model in Guatemala."
     Until now, adamant union opposition had prevented
consecutive governments from privatizing strategic state firms
in Guatemala, such as the telephone company Empresa
Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL) and the electric
firms Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE) and Empresa
Electrica de Guatemala (EEGSA).  In late April, however, the
Arzu administration announced plans to move forward with the
"demonopolization" of GUATEL, and possibly INDE and EEGSA as
well (see Chronicle, 05/16/96).
     That, in turn, has radicalized union opposition.  At this
year's May Day demonstration, union leaders made opposition to
privatization a central theme of the march in the capital,
attended by about 10,000 workers.  During the rally, the
GUATEL union burned a huge artificial loaf of bread in effigy
of the governing PAN, which means "bread" in Spanish.
According to the union, the act was also a symbolic
demonstration that workers will not allow the governing party
nor the private sector to "gobble up" public patrimony.
     Perhaps more important, Guatemalan unions are now, for
the first time, seeking to forge an alliance with unions in
other Central American countries to create a regional movement
against privatization.  The week prior to May Day, the
telecommunications and electricity-sector unions from
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua met in San Salvador,
where they formed the Federacion Centroamericana de
Trabajadores de las Telecomunicaciones y de la Energia
Electrica (FESTEN).
     FESTEN is aimed at forging a "common front" against plans
by regional governments to sell off telecommunications and
electricity institutes, which is a stated goal of nearly all
the isthmian administrations.  FESTEN member unions will
organize simultaneous actions in their individual countries,
including strikes, demonstrations, educational campaigns, and
lobbying of diplomatic entities.  The unions from those three
nations will also seek to incorporate telecommunications and
energy-sector unions from Costa Rica, Panama, and Honduras.
     "FESTEN's creation is necessary because the problem of
privatization is exactly the same in all the Central American
countries," said Orlando Aguillon, secretary general of the
Salvadoran electricity workers union Asociacion de
Trabajadores de la Comision Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (ATCEL).
     According to Nicaraguan labor leader Ronald Membreno, the
goal is not to halt privatization programs outright since such
an objective is unrealistic.  Rather, FESTEN hopes to
influence the process to make the outcome more favorable to
workers and lower-income groups.
     "We are aware that we will not be able to reverse the
privatization process in Central America since it is a plan
that is being imposed on local governments by international
lending institutions," said Membreno.  "But we can
energetically oppose the process to reduce the negative
effects of privatization as much as possible."  [Sources:

HONDURAS: U.S. IMPOSES EMBARGO ON HONDURAN SHRIMP IMPORTS

     On May 1, the US ordered its market closed to shrimp
imports from 49 countries, including Honduras.
Environmentalists say that shrimp from these countries are
caught in nets that simultaneously capture and kill sea
turtles, an endangered species.  Honduran officials, however,
expect the embargo to be lifted within a few weeks, after an
inspection team from the US certifies that Honduran shrimp
boats are equipped with turtle-safe nets.
     In 1993, owners of shrimp fleets in Caribbean Basin
countries agreed to switch to the use of nets equipped with
metallic turtle-excluder devices (TED), which allow turtles
entangled in the net to escape.  But environmental
organizations complained to the US State Department that there
was little or no compliance.
     Following announcement of the embargo, Honduran vice
minister of economy Edwin Araque admitted in a press
conference that the Honduran shrimp industry had indeed failed
to equip its boats with turtle-safe nets.  As a result, the
economy is threatened with an enormous loss of hard currency
from shrimp exports.  Shrimp is the most profitable
nontraditional export and third among all Honduran exports,
earning about US$120 million per year in foreign exchange.
     The embargo is only against shrimp caught at sea, which
will affect the Honduran catch from the Islas de la Bahia
region along the northern Caribbean coast.
     However, shrimp cultivated in tanks in the Gulf of
Fonseca on the Pacific coast, which account for 75% of
Honduran shrimp exports, will continue to be admitted to the
US market, but their origin must be certified.  Araque
estimated the loss in hard currency at US$40 million per year
if the embargo is not lifted.
     The embargo went into effect on May 1, but the US quickly
granted a reprieve until June 15.  During that time, a
commission will be sent to Honduras to verify that the shrimp
boats are being equipped with the required nets.
     The Honduran government has taken immediate steps to
avoid implementation of the embargo.  On May 9, the department
of fish and aquiculture (Direccion General de Pesca y
Acuicultura, DIGEPESCA) issued an order prohibiting the use of
the old nets.
     "By next week, no product from the [Caribbean] zone can
leave the country if it does not have a certificate showing
that it uses dragnets with excluder devices," said Marco Polo
Micheletti, vice minister of natural resources.
     The navy and merchant marine will enforce the order, and
violators will loose their licenses, said Micheletti.
     The ministry expects the cost of the new nets to be
absorbed by the shrimp industry.  The bill for equipping the
entire shrimp fleet of 125 boats would be about US$600,000,
far less than the US$40 million loss the embargo would cause,
said Micheletti.
     The US has issued embargo warnings against 50 nations in
all, but has so far excluded 11 Latin American countries that
have taken steps to require the use of the new nets.  Belize,
Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela, and Trinidad and Tobago have all
been certified by the US as being in compliance with the
turtle-safe requirement.
     In a related incident, local press reports in Tegucigalpa
say that US diplomatic representatives in Honduras suspect
that shrimp boats are being used by drug traffickers to
smuggle cocaine into the US.  The attorney general's office
has asked the US to supply information on the matter.

NICARAGUA: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONFRONTS A CREDIT CRISIS (Part 1)

     While coffee and a few nontraditional crops are bringing
good prices on the world market, Nicaragua's agricultural
sector is in crisis, largely because of insufficient credit.
Growers blame government policies, which they say withhold
assistance to agriculture while favoring selected industries.
The government argues that the problem is not one of credit,
but of overdue debt.
     Nicaraguan agriculture has shown positive growth for the
past two years, both in profitability and amount of land under
cultivation.  This growth is largely due to high prices for
some commodities and an increase in crop diversification.
Coffee output in 1995, for example, grew by 32% over the 1994
level.  Growers of nontraditional crops have been steadily
putting more land under cultivation in tropical fruits,
cotton, and flowers.  The area devoted to the production of
melons for export to the US and Europe increased by more than
9% between 1994 and 1995.
     However, even growers of nontraditional crops, which are
aimed primarily at the export market, do not have adequate
capital to expand and keep up with changing technology.
Rodolfo Delgado, director of the Nicaraguan investment fund,
Financiera Nicaraguense de Inversiones (FNI), said that the
most profitable products--such as tobacco, peanuts, and
sesame--need US$89.6 million in credit for the 1996-1997
growing season, but only US$60 million is available.
According to Delgado, the credit shortage last year prevented
80% of the sesame growers from planting.  FNI is looking to
European lenders to fill the gap.
     Not surprisingly, the credit shortage has become a
serious point of contention between growers and the
government.  Associations representing farmers, ranchers, and
other agricultural segments accuse the government of
strangling their livelihood through adverse policies.  For
example, during the 1996-1997 season, the government's
development bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo, BANADES) will
make only US$30.4 million in agricultural loans.  Any
additional amount, according to Central Bank President Jose
Taboada, will have to come from funds recovered from overdue
debt.
     But according to Amilcar Navarro, head of the farmers and
cattle ranchers organization (Union Nacional de Agricultores
y Ganaderos, UNAG), the credit demand for the season is more
than US$164 million.  He said that 80% of those who want
credit will not get it and that the private banks are too
conservative to extend credit to small producers during the
present economic crisis.
     Furthermore, the cost of credit is prohibitively high for
a majority of the producers and nearly impossible for those
with overdue debt.  Interest and other bank charges are
problems, as well as the controlled monthly devaluation of the
currency against the US dollar, since loans are calculated in
dollar terms.  These factors have pushed the real cost of
borrowing as high as 40% on commercial bank loans and somewhat
less for state bank loans.  Some growers turn to exporters and
other intermediaries for credit but at usurious interest
rates.
     The western department of Chinandega has been hard hit by
the crisis.  Growers there continue to cultivate sugar cane
and other traditional crops but have also tried planting
nontraditionals such as peanuts, soy, sorghum, and cotton.
These crops may offer a greater return on investment than the
traditional crops, but producers need credit to make the
changeover.
     Some relief came in mid-March, when the regional Banco de
America Central (BAC) offered to finance cultivation of 1,400
hectares of sugar cane in Chinandega.  The aid would be in the
form of short-term credits at 14% interest, which is ten
percentage points below interest rates charged by the state
banks.
     But the BAC loans will not help the poorest and most
indebted campesinos.  Nor will financing 1,400 ha go far to
reactivate agriculture in Chinandega, since nearly 280,000 ha
need assistance, according to UNAG.
     Writing in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada, Navarro
said that government policy was slowly killing the
agricultural sector.  Navarro said that the government
collection agency Cobranzas de Nicaragua (COBANICSA),
nicknamed the Cobra, "is designed to do away with agriculture
in our country."
     Although the Cobra is supposed to foreclose on the larger
producers, who owe the most money, it is also a threat to the
smaller growers.  Critics of the Cobra say that foreclosures
will eventually lead to severe social unrest and violence,
without either reducing the debt or rejuvenating the
agricultural sector.
     "What good is the Cobra if there is no credit?" asked
Navarro.  "Furthermore, what good is credit if it is a
suicidal act to take it when you can't pay it back?  What good
is it to lower interest rates if trade policy allows imports
to compete advantageously against our products?  And what good
is it to regulate imports if fiscal policy is loading us up
with taxes?"
     The UNAG demanded in March that the government provide
sufficient credits for the 1996-1997 growing season.
According to Juan Betancourth, president of UNAG in
Chinandega, 12,000 small and medium-size growers in the
department have been unable to get credit from BANADES.  Small
amounts of financial aid from nongovernmental organizations
have been the main sources of financing.  As a result of the
credit shortage some 269,000 ha of cultivable land are idle
and 60,000 campesinos are finding it difficult or impossible
to meet their basic needs, says Betancourth.
     Besides the financial hurdles campesinos face,
Betancourth notes that many do not have legal title to their
land.  Without titles, banks will not lend money even when it
is available.  Therefore, the organization has also demanded
that the government legalize ownership of 14,000 ha for which
it has not yet granted title.  (Cont.)

NICARAGUA: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONFRONTS A CREDIT CRISIS (Part 2)

     On the national level, growers and ranchers associations
petitioned the National Assembly in March to pass two bills
that they believe will reactivate the depressed agricultural
sector.  One proposal, submitted by an alliance of ranchers,
merchants, and manufacturers, is intended to revive the
economy in general.  The text of the proposal describes the
productive elements of the economy as "in complete
abandonment."
     The law would mandate a declaration that the
"rehabilitation" of agriculture and industry is "of national
interest."  The state banks would then be required to
negotiate favorable terms of repayment for those in both
sectors who carry overdue debt of less than US$365,000.  The
proposal contemplates the refinancing of these debts and
suspension of any seizure of the debtors' property.
     The other proposal, submitted by the coffee growers
association Union Nicaraguense de Cafetaleros (UNICAFE), is
intended to improve market prices for coffee and increase
producer profit.
     "Producers have been forced by conditions of poverty to
sell their coffee at a disadvantageous price," reads the
proposal.
     Most Nicaraguan coffee is grown by small and medium-sized
producers who do not have enough clout to protect their
interests in dealing with importers of machinery and supplies,
coffee exporters, banks, tax collectors, and other
intermediaries in the coffee production and marketing chain.
     The law would set up a national coffee council (Consejo
Nicaraguense del Cafe), made up of Central Bank and other
government officials plus representatives from UNICAFE and the
coffee exporters.  The council would negotiate equitable
business terms among all participants in the industry. In
addition, the law would establish a fund to stabilize prices
(Fondo de Estabilizacion y Fomento), capitalized by a tax on
coffee sales.
     The credit crunch is not the only problem facing the
smaller agricultural producers.  The movement toward free
trade means drastic reductions in tariff protection for
agriculture.  At the same time, growers are burdened with new
or higher taxes on inputs such as machinery and fertilizers.
In addition, government efforts to favor one or another
domestic industry to make the Nicaraguan economy competitive
in the global marketplace have provoked other concerns in the
agricultural sector.
     Cattle ranchers complain that these policies have helped
reduce their herds to dangerously low levels.  The cost of
inputs has risen year by year, but export prices have varied
little in the last 20 years, according to Lorenzo Arguello of
the ranchers organization Comision Nacional Ganadera
(CONAGAN).
     Ranchers and meatpackers have protested government
policies that favor tanneries by holding down the price of
domestically produced hides and by collecting a 25% custom
duty on imported leather.  Alfredo Marin, president of the
meatpackers association (Asociacion de Mataderos), said that
it was unjust to sacrifice these two productive sectors, which
generate 100,000 jobs, to indulge 30 tanneries, which employ
only 500.
     CONAGAN leaders say that while ranchers are struggling
with insufficient credit to overcome the obstacles of high
costs and low prices, the government is negotiating for beef
imports from Argentina.
     CONAGAN is also lobbying in the Assembly against a bill
intended to foster economic stability, investments, and
employment.  The organization argues that the bill would do
none of these things.  Among other provisions, it would
rapidly lower import duties but would offer no assistance to
agriculture to make it more productive and competitive.
     Another drag on the cattle industry is a 2% tax that
ranchers must pay on their tangible assets and inventory.
Cattle ranchers argue that they have low profit margins
compared to the fixed costs of their assets and that such
taxes are the "coup de grace" for the industry.  Instead,
CONAGAN is asking the Assembly's committee on economic policy
to offer real economic incentives to ranching.
     In contrast to the pessimism among these producer
associations, government officials are uniformly optimistic
about the economy and see the basic problem in agriculture as
its inefficiency and lack of global competitiveness.
     Cabinet officials and government economists are
predicting a strong 5% growth in GDP for 1996, and along with
it continued growth in agricultural output.  As for credit,
they say that domestic savings is on the upswing, growing 17%
faster this year than in 1995.  As a result, there is ample
credit available--some US$608 million--says Mario Flores,
general manager of the Central Bank.  The problem is not a
lack of funds but rather the borrowers' "culture of not
paying," he said.
     "It's the quality of the borrowers, problems of
productivity, poor management, and low profitability of the
projects," said Flores.
     When asked what he thought of proposals to restructure
the debt, Flores said that if adopted, such proposals would
break the Nicaraguan banks.
     The government's policy is to avoid a collapse of the
Central Bank brought on by bad debt.  Some 30,000 producers
are in arrears in their payments and the total overdue debt to
state banks is now US$182.5 million.  Until debtors liquidate
their obligations, they will not be eligible for additional
state bank credit, said Central Bank president Taboada.  Bank
policy for the future will be to loan only to small and
medium-size producers.  It is the big growers who have the
biggest state-bank debts. About 200 of them account for 80% of
the nation's overdue agricultural debt owed to the state
banks.  However, by most accounts few of the 30,000 debtors
will be eligible for additional state credit during the
current growing season.
     To Flores and Taboada, the credit crunch, if not the
general crisis on the farm, is caused by mismanagement or
outright fraudulent use of credit.  But the president of the
UNAG chapter in Masaya department, Jose Martinez, pointed out
that the government was also a debtor begging for debt relief.
     "President Violeta de Chamorro's government received a
pardon of 80% of its foreign debt with the Paris Club," said
Martinez.  "So, the growers are proposing that the interest on
the debt they have with the state banks be reduced and the
term extended to 15 years."  (Sources: La Prensa, 03/21/96,

PROPOSALS FOR THE FINAL STAGE OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION

from EUROPEAN INSIGHT, 18 October 1996, No. 720

On October 16, the European Commission unveiled proposals on the stability
pact meant to maintain budgetary discipline in the countries of the Euro
zone, on the legal status of the single currency and on procedures aimed
at strengthening convergence in the Member States that do not participate
in the final phase of Economic and Monetary Union from the outset
("pre-ins"). The Commission is preparing draft Regulations and a
Communication to be submitted to the Council of Finance Ministers in
November and December so that the Dublin Summit on December 13 and 14 can
proceed with the final adoption of the architecture of the future Monetary
Union, set to come into being on January 1, 1999. These proposals will
take into account the conclusions of the informal Finance Council held in
Dublin on September 20 and 21 and the meeting of the EU's influential
Monetary Committee on October 8.

Legal status of the Euro

A pair of draft Regulations designed to guarantee the continuity of
contracts denominated in national currencies and offer legal security to
Euro users, between January 1, 1999 (the start of the final stage of
Economic and Monetary Union) and the complete demise of national
currencies (no later than six months after January 1, 2002) were approved
by the European Commission The first Regulation clearly confirms the
continuity of legal instruments, not least contracts, would be ensured
between the older national currencies and the Euro and between the ECU and
the Euro. It specifies in Article 2 that as soon as EMU stage three comes
into being any reference to the ECU shall be replaced by a reference to
the Euro. The conversion rate is one Euro for one ECU. Starting on January
1, Regulation 3320/94, which fixes the composition of the ECU basket of
currencies, will be repealed. Article 3 of the proposal says the Euro does
not allow a party to a legal instrument the right to change it or
unilaterally cancel it. As for conversion rates, Article 4 envisages four
specific provisions:

- Conversion rates express the value of one Euro in each of the national
currencies taking part in the process. They comprise six key figures; -
The rates may not be rounded off nor truncated during conversion; - They
are used for conversion between the Euro unit and national monetary units
or the other way round. Reverse rates calculated on the basis of
conversion rates may not be used; - Any amount to be converted from a
national monetary unit into another has first of all to be converted into
a Euro-denominated monetary amount, rounded off to three decimals then
converted into the other national monetary unit. The second Regulation
provides that the single currency will be divided into100 sub-divisions
called "cents" and will expressly include the list of countries taking
part in the final phase. During the transitional period, due to get under
way on January 1, 1999, and end on December 31, 2001 at the latest, the
Member States will be entitled to convert outstanding amounts of debts
(bonds and loan securities) denominated in a national currency unit. The
markets could also replace the national currency in the accounts of their
operating procedures by the Euro. Notes and coins denominated in a
national currency unit keep their legal rates within the countries
concerned during the above-mentioned transitional period. By January 1,
2002 at the latest, the ECB and the central banks of the participating
countries would place Euro-denominated notes into circulation (notes and
coins may be introduced for practical reasons before the end of the
transitional period). Six months after the end of the transitional period,
national currencies would cease to be legal tender.

Stability pact.

The EMU stability pact will be based on two draft Regulations defining a
system of sanctions for countries violating the criteria (as provided for
in Article 104c of the Maastricht Treaty) and will establish a system of
reinforced convergence via stability programmes to prevent budgetary
excesses on the part of the countries of the Euro zone. The Regulation on
sanctions is to take effect on January 1, 1999, while that on reinforced
convergence is scheduled to enter into force on July 1, 1998. The
Commission provides for each Member State participating in EMU to present
a compulsory and regularly updated stability programme setting out
medium-term macro-economic objectives. These programmes will be made
public in the interests of transparency. The stability programme will
commit the Member States to correcting any budgetary excesses. An early
warning system will also be introduced, based on the stability programme
and provisions for implementation established by the Commission, to put a
halt to any slippage of the budget deficit well before it reaches the
maximum value of 3% of GDP. If, despite warnings, a Member State's
financial position continues to deteriorate, the Council of Ministers may
decide to apply the sanctions procedure. If, in fact, an excessive deficit
does exist, the Council will immediately address recommendations to the
Member State in question and give it a deadline for correcting the
situation. The Member State will have ten months from the time of
determination of an excessive deficit to take the necessary action before
sanctions are imposed. The first penalty would be applied in the form of a
non-interest-bearing deposit, comprising a fixed part (0.2% of GDP) and a
variable part (0.1%) of GDP per deficit point higher than the 3% budget
deficit limit. A maximum penalty value equal to 0.5% of GDP will
theoretically be chosen. The afore-mentioned final figures might well be
revised between now and the Commission meeting on October 16. If the
Member States fail to cut their excessive deficits dow

 to size within two years, the deposit would be converted into a fine.

The European Commission has adopted a communication to the Council on
reinforced convergence procedures and a new exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The ERM will be a temporary waiting room for countries preparing to join
monetary union. In line with the recommendations of the European Monetary
Institute (EMI), there is a broad consensus among Member States on a "hub
and spoke" arrangement of bilateral links between the Euro and pre-in
currencies. The fluctuation margins will in general be relatively wide,
with the possibility of closer links for countries with sufficiently
strong convergence performance: intervention by the European Central Bank
will be automatic at the margin of the fluctuation bands. However, it may
be suspended (and realignment discussions initiated) where the level of
intervention is incompatible with a monetary policy geared towards price
stability.

Building on existing procedures for the examination of national
convergence programmes and multilateral surveillance of economic policies
(under Article 103 of the Treaty), the Commission envisages the following
innovations:

- all pre-ins would be formally obliged to submit convergence programmes.

- the first programmes in this new generation would be submitted before 1
January 1999.

they would be updated annually.

- convergence programmes would contain more detail than at present, in
particular on the measures envisaged to achieve the convergence objectives
in terms of public finances, inflation and exchange rate stability. They
might also contain indications of the supplementary action envisaged to
correct any slippage from agreed targets.

a more precise timetable would be set for the examination of national
programmes by the Council.

- the Council would have the right to endorse a country's convergence
programme after detailed examination and analysis by the Commission and
the Monetary Committee (which will be succeeded by the Economic and
Financial Committee on 1 January 1999).

- the Council would exploit to the full the procedures of Article 103 of
the Treaty, in particular the possibility to make policy recommendations
(if appropriate publicly) to countries whose economic performance deviates
from agreed objectives.

GETTING CYPRUS-REGISTERED SHIPS TO TOE THE LINE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Union is leaning on the Republic of Cyprus, which boasts the
world's fourth biggest merchant shipping fleet, to align its shipping
policy with the EU's, before joining the European Union. On a visit to
Cyprus on October 18, Neil Kinnock, European Commissioner for Transport,
stressed that what the EU mainly had in mind were standards for shipping
safety and the flags of convenience policy, making it easy for foreign
ships to register in Cyprus. "This is of particular importance for us,
given the size of the Cypriot fleet, which is currently the world's fourth
largest fleet and expanding rapidly, and because of the large number of
vessels which belong to EU companies yet fly the Cypriot flag", according
to Mr Kinnock, who was in Nicosia to take part in a conference of European
maritime experts. The Commissioner claims that because of Cyprus'
potential EU membership (a matter that will be considered in 1998), the
Commission is obliged to ensure high safety standards at sea as well as
fair competition in the merchant shipping industry. Mr Kinnock was thus
making a veiled criticism of the country's lax attitude to ship
registration.

The tonnage of the Cypriot merchant fleet totalled 38.3 million in 1994,
but nearly 80% of the Cyprus-registered tonnage was over 15 years of age.
By way of comparison, 45% of Liberia's fleet, the biggest in the world, is
less than five years old.

STOP PRESS: HUMANITARIAN AID MUST GET THROUGH IN ZAIRE, BONINO SAYS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino launched an urgent appeal on
October 25 to the groups fighting around the border region of Zaire and
Rwanda to let humanitarian aid through to the 1.2 million refugees
affected by the crisis, and said the international community had to make
it clear to those launching the attacks that a new genocide in the region
will not be tolerated. She also criticised the functioning of the EU's
foreign and security policy, saying that it was not able to effectively
seek solutions to the problem, and pleaded for an acceleration in the
procedures needed to release emergency budgetary reserves in response to
the crisis.

The refugees have been grouped mainly in camps around the cities of Goma,
Bukavu and Uvira in eastern Zaire. Following the outbreak of the fighting
between the Zairean army and Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels, all of the 190,000
people in the 12 camps around Uvira have fled and, along with tens of
thousands of the Zairean population, are taking to the hills in Zaire or
on their way to Bukavu. Painting a bleak picture, Commissioner Bonino said
the rebels - which she says seem to be following an organised plan to
destabilise the Hutu refugee camps - are also advancing toward Bukavu,
causing thousands to begin to flee camps in that area.

While food stocks for several weeks exist around Bukavu and the European
Community Humanitarian Office and other bodies are preparing to establish
other emergency measures, such as food drops, the resources will be put
under considerable stress if most of the refugees from Uvira reach the
camps. However, even this is uncertain, the Commissioner said, because
access to camps around Bukavu and Goma are being blocked by the army or
the rebels, and humanitarian workers are unable to reach them.

EU/MEDITERRANEAN STATES: INTERMEDIATE REPORT ON MEDA ACTIONS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Of the ECU 4.685 billion in EU subsidies earmarked for the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership for the period 1995-99, ECU 414 million had
been allocated by October 1, 1996 to bilateral actions and projects, and
ECU 30 million to regional activities and projects. These figures are
contained in an interim report published by the European Commission on
October 24. Euro-Mediterranean funding for regional projects and
activities extends to five areas: Barcelona process projects, economic
cooperation, decentralised cooperation programmes, information technology
and media projects, and projects concerning cultural heritage, as well as
to the MEDA Democracy programme.

Economic cooperation.

ECU 20 million has been granted this year to the MEDSTAT regional
cooperation project involving Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the
European Communities), and the statistics institutes of the twelve
Mediterranean partners and the fifteen EU Member States. Subsidies have
also been granted to events aimed at nurturing business contracts between
small and medium-sized enterprises in Mediterranean third countries and
the EU: "Med Interprise Bethlehem" (February 1996), "Med Interprise Cairo"
(May 1996), "Med Interprise Algeria" (scheduled for December 1996) and at
involving Mediterranean countries in the Europartnership events in Lulea
(June 1996) and Genoa (November 1996). A frame-work contract has been
drawn up to cover the short term hiring of experts for the preparation of
economic cooperation projects (ECU 2 million)

Decentralised cooperation.

ECU 37 million has been granted to the "Med Campus" (cooperation between
universities), "Med Urbs" (cooperation between local authorities), and
"Med Media" (media cooperation) programmes. A further programme, "Med
Techno", involved with technological cooperation will be launched shortly.

Culture and media.

Following the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Culture in
Bologna in April 1996, and the meeting of experts on cultural heritage in
Brussels in September (both meetings were financed under the "Barcelona
process"), a initial list of 14 joint projects is being drawn up for
financing in 1996 or the beginning of 1997. Funding granted to these
projects will depend on fine details, notably the number of countries
participating in each project. In addition, two training projects have
been provisionally financed under the Med Media programme, and a subsidy
granted for the dissemination of information on the Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership through Maghreb radio station Medi 1 (set up in the Moroccan
city of Tangiers).

Democracy.

Financed through a separate MEDA budget line, implementation of the MEDA
Democracy programme began in 1996 with subsidies totalling more than ECU 6
million granted to 32 projects.

Miscellaneous.

Other activities benefiting from regional funding through MEDA include:
support for the REDWG Secretariat (Regional Economic Development Working
Group, chaired by the European Union) in Amman (ECU 400,000), the
Euro-Arab Management School in Granada (ECU 400,000), and "micro-actions"
(ECU 1.8 million). A total of ECU 1.7 million has been granted over 1996
to the preparation and organisation of sectoral meetings at Ministerial
level and among experts in the following fields: culture, the information
society, energy, small and medium sized enterprises, investment, cultural
heritage, shipping, water management, foreign policy institutes and the
instruction of diplomats.

MEPS CRITICISE BP ROLE IN COLOMBIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Parliament criticised human rights abuses in Colombia on
October 24 and asked that an unpublished Government Human Rights
Commission report on the activities of British Petroleum, which MEPs
accused during a debate of complicity in human rights abuses and
environmental damage in the Casanare region, be made public. In a
Resolution, the Parliament calls on all European oil companies to "observe
the highest standards of respect for human rights and environmental
protection, especially given the conditions of conflict in which they are
working". Backed by 127 to 62 with 7 abstentions and supported by Members
from most of the Parliament's major political groups, the Resolution says
a new dialogue should be established between the oil companies and the
community in Casanare to broker support for a new social and economic
development plan for the region.

British Socialist MEP Richard Howitt, a member of the Parliament's South
American delegation, accused BP during the debate earlier that day of
collaborating with the military in the region, saying these allegations
are backed by the Human Rights Commission report. "The report makes
accusations of the passing of secret video evidence to the military
leading to the death and disappearances of anti-oil protesters, and
suggests that military denunciations against the protesters lead to
assassinations", he said.

BP "rejects these charges completely", according to a company spokesman.
The British oil group applies the same human rights standards in Colombia
as it does in other countries, he said, and "would never ask the Colombian
military to break up a strike". BP also questions whether the report is
actually preliminary testimonies into oil industry activities in general
in two Colombian regions rather than a report on BP activities in
particular.

In its Resolution, the Parliament "condemns unreservedly all human rights
abuses committed in Colombia" by the security forces or paramilitary or
guerrilla groups. It also finds fault with the Government, calling on it
to guarantee rather than restrict press freedom in the country, to stop
the use by the army of extrajudicial and arbitrary killings, torture and
other human rights violations, to cooperate with the Colombian
Attorney-General's office in its efforts to arrest those involved in
extrajudicial killings and to continue its efforts to counter
drug-trafficking.

EU/SLOVENIA: PARLIAMENT PRESSES EU STATES TO RATIFY ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on October 23, the European
Parliament adopted reports by Bernd Posselt (EPP, Germany) on the economic
and commercial aspects of the Association Agreement between the European
Union and the Republic of Slovenia, and Ulpu Iivari (PES, Finland), on the
political aspects of this agreement, sending a clear message to Member
States to ratify the Association Agreement without delay. The Parliament
is delighted that Slovenia lodged a request for accession to the European
Union on June 10, and will therefore be placed among the vanguard of
candidates for the next enlargement.

Rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mrs Iivari observed that
adoption of an Association Agreement between the Union and Slovenia has
been a long drawn-out process. Negotiations began on March 15, 1995, with
the Agreement signed more than a year later on June 10, 1996. Negotiations
became bogged down on the fact that - historically - a part of Italy was
annexed by the former Yugoslavia. Rome insisted that Italian nationals
forced to leave Yugoslavia in the 1950s should be granted the right to
recover what real estate they abandoned. However, Slovenian legislation
and constitutional law prohibits foreigners from owning real estate. The
two parties have now settled on a compromise whereby Slovenia has agreed
to guarantee all EU citizens the right to acquire real estate from the
fourth year after the entry into force of the Agreement. In addition, EU
citizens who have resided for at least three years on Slovenian territory
(the case of Italians) will see their rights to acquire real estate
recognised from the entry into force of the Agreement.

In her report, Mrs Iivari explains that the general situation in Slovenia
is encouraging: per capita income stands at USUSD9,000 a year, and
Slovenia already meets a number of the Maastricht criteria set for
Economic and Monetary Union. The text urges the Slovenian Government to
pursue privatisation and the European Commission to provide financial
backing for redevelopment projects and encourage economic and cultural
cooperation. In his speech to the Parliament, EU External Relations
Commissioner Hans van de Broek called on the Member States' national
Parliaments to ratify the Association Agreement with Slovenia as quickly
as possible. Slovenia itself will need to amend its Constitution as regard
the acquisition of real estate, overhaul administrative structures, and
consolidate economic reforms.

Encouraging the Slovenian Government to pursue the privatisation process,
Bernd Posselt's report invites the European Commission to offer financial
support to border regions between Slovenia and the EU for redevelopment
projects to counteract the disappearance of traditional border activities,
and to encourage economic and cultural cooperation. Member States are also
urged to provide long-term backing for major infrastructure projects in
Slovenia and to include these projects in European planning for
trans-European transport networks. Finally, the report urges Slovenia to
further improve protection for minority groups.

Slovenia on the right road to EU membership.

On the eve of the European Parliament's vote, the head of the Parliament's
delegation for relations with Slovenia, Michel Ebner (EPP, Italy), said at
the end of a two-day meeting in Ljubljana that Slovenia was proceeding on
schedule for meeting the preconditions for EU membership. The encounter
was held in the context of high-level meetings with senior political
figures, including Josef Skolc, President of Slovenia's parliament, Janez
Drnovsek, Prime Minister, and Davorin Kracun, Foreign Minister. The
impression given during the meeting was that all parties what ever their
stripe were much in favour of closer ties with Europe.

The European Parliament's delegation judges that in order to ensure the
continuing possibility of early EU membership, Slovenia would have to take
steps to complete its own ratification procedure as soon as possible after
the November 10 elections. Other subjects raised at the meeting include
the EU's Inter-governmental Conference on the Maastricht Treaty reform and
the application of the PHARE programme of aid for economic reforms in
Eastern Europe, as well as a number of economic and environmental issues.
Privatisation was considered with Mr De Prikmajer, State Secretary at the
Ministry for Economic Relations and Development. The officials also mooted
the situation in Bosnia after the September 14 elections, and welcomed the
positive role that Slovenia is being called upon to play in the region.

PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR COMPLETE EU EMBARGO ON BURMA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Parliament said on October 23 that the EU should implement
economic sanctions against Burma (Myanmar) in an attempt to pressure its
military rulers, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), to
end widespread human rights violations. On the same day as Burma announced
that it had detained Kyi Maung, a top advisor to Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the Parliament condemned in a Resolution "the
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms being perpetrated
against the Burmese people".

It called in particular for the Council to "end all links between the
European Union and Burma based on trade, tourism and investment in Burma
by European companies" when it meets on October 28-29, and for the
Commission to present without delay the conclusions of its present inquiry
into withdrawing Generalised System of Preferences trade concessions from
Burma. The withdrawal of GSP, which would cost Burma tens of millions of
Dollars, is the only immediate step which may be taken to put effective
pressure on the SLORC, the Parliament said.

Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg, the MEPs took particular aim at
foreign companies active in Burma. It expressed concern that investment in
Burma by UNOCAL and French oil group Total has caused significant
violations of human rights and indirectly led to forced relocation and
labour, and welcomed the decisions by 15 international companies to stop
investing in the country. International pressure should also be brought to
bear on the country through the United Nations, says the Resolution. The
Parliament called on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
to refuse Burma's application for membership until the SLORC has stepped
down from power, warning that "Burma's full membership would harm
relations between the EU and ASEAN".

EU/US: COMMISSION TRIES TO WRING DANISH SUPPORT FOR CUBA MEASURE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The threat of a Danish veto on the European Union's common response to the
United States' anti-Cuba laws has sent European Commission and EU Council
of Ministers officials into a frenzy as they seek to persuade the errant
Member State of the merits of their proposal. The Commission has also used
the deadlock as an argument for ending the use of a veto in EU foreign
policy.

The EU's Foreign Ministers will be meeting in Luxembourg on October 28 for
their Council and the Commission wants the common response agreed against
the so-called Helms-Burton law, by which the United States hopes to punish
companies doing business with Cuba. But Denmark appears determined to
resist the move, insisting it is not against a response as such, rather
against the legal means by which the Commission is proposing to push
through the measure. "Our position is firm and our Government clearly
indicated this in two meetings of COREPER", a Danish official said.

In fact, Denmark actually supports EU arguments against Helms-Burton, and
claims its caution is based on a potential threat to EU Members State
sovereignty thanks to the rarely-used Article 235 of the EU Treaty. The
retaliatory measures will be taken under this Article which states that
the Council has the power to act on issues not specified in other areas of
the Treaty, but can only do so by unanimity. It says: "If action by the
Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation
of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this
Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting
unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the
European Parliament, take appropriate measures".

Denmark says it has held misgivings about Article 235 ever since joining
the European Community in 1973, as it clashed with Article 20 of the
Danish Constitution which says the Government cannot give away too much
sovereignty. "Denmark is not against the European Union taking
precautionary measures against the USA. It's just that we cannot accept
the use of Article 235", Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said. "I
know that others are trying to find an alternative basis on which to
proceed."

Some officials in Brussels suspect Denmark's reticence on ceding authority
to the Commission is linked to a pending court case in Copenhagen on the
issue of sovereignty. A group of 11 citizens recently filed a suit
claiming the Danish Government's signature of the Maastricht Treaty on
European Union contravened the country's Constitution by transferring too
much political and judicial authority to supranational institutions. And
the sensitivity over sovereignty can also be traced to Denmark's two
referendums on the Maastricht Treaty. The Danish Government only secured
approval for the Treaty during the second referendum, in 1993, after
renegotiating Denmark's position so there could be an option on the final
stage of Economic and Monetary Union and other EU measures potentially
threatening to national sovereignty.

The European Commission discussed the problem during its weekly meeting on
October 22, and the Commission President Jacques Santer said it proved how
important it was for the EU to speak with one voice on such matters. "This
is a very concrete example which shows that we have to take decisions
quickly without unanimity", Mr Santer's spokesman said. "What is important
is that the Union establishes a joint action as soon as possible as we
risk losing our credibility on the international stage."

As for finding a way around the problem, officials appear to be looking at
all the available means within the EU's legal instruments to placate the
Danes. "We are not being dogmatic about it and we are not fixated with
Article 235", said one official. "But we have gone through the Treaty with
a fine tooth comb and we believe the combination of articles we are using
is the best."

EU AND EGYPT STRIVE TO REVIVE TALKS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The Middle East process, trade relations, Association Agreement talks,
financial cooperation and regional cooperation - these are just a sample
of the key themes due to be discussed, on October 28 in Luxembourg by EU
and Egyptian Foreign Ministers. Gathered for a Cooperation Council
meeting, the two sides are likely to focus on problems that have succeeded
in stalling the Association Agreement negotiations for several months now.
The European side believes the concessions being sought by the Egyptians,
mainly concerning farm trade, are excessive and do not reflect the real
level of trade between the two sides. Egypt wants the right to be able to
enjoy zero or reduced-rated duties for products for which they are not
traditional exporters to the EU market. (potatoes, for example). They also
want the export quota system to take account of reference years Egypt
considers are most in the country's favour. These demands are not accepted
by the European Commission or the EU Member States, who are fearful of
seeing their own producers having to compete with farm produce from Egypt.

The two sides will also be taking stock of EU financial assistance for
Egypt. Under the new MEDA financial programme for non-EU Mediterranean
countries, Egypt is slated to receive ECU 275 million for 1996. 155
million will be channelled into the Social Development Fund, 100 million
into the basic education sector and 20 million into environment causes.

EU/PALESTINE: LEON BRITTAN AND PARIS SPAT OVER PEACE PROCESS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

France is somewhat miffed over a statement that Leon Brittan European
Commissioner for External Economic Relations, made on October 24 to the
effect that the conditions are not ripe for the EU to take part in the
Middle East peace process. Why? Because the Member States are unable to
work together. He also called on the major EU countries to refrain from
taking any independent addiction in this sphere. Sir Leon was making a
veiled allusion to the role Paris wants France and the EU to play in the
Near East. Catherine Colonna, spokeswoman for the French President, said
that the Commission's words were singularly lacking in relevance. They are
not the sort of things one expects to hear from the European Commission
nor do they reflect reality, she stressed, adding that the Commission has
no powers in common foreign policy matters. Elsewhere, the Commission has
signed a three-year agreement with the UNRWA involving ECU 130 million.

On a visit to the Middle East from October 20 to 26, President Jacques
Chirac made a call for Europe to become a joint sponsor of the peace
process. The US and Russia have been the two sponsors since the peace
process got under way in October 1991 in Madrid. Sir Leon Brittan judged
that the conditions are not ripe for EU involvement. "If we succeed in
working together and we refrain from any independent action, we will then
be able to work with the US in the region. Otherwise we will not succeed
in this endeavour", he implied.

Ms Colonna stresses that policy positions on the Middle East were being
taken regularly at the highest level of the EU and that Europe is
increasingly present and active in this area via its Member States and
collectively. She recalled that before his trip to the Middle East, Mr
Chirac took care to inform his partners that he would be reporting back to
them as soon as he got home.

Aid for Palestinian refugees.

The EU is to provide the hefty sum of ECU 106 million over three years for
the UN refugees welfare Agency. UNWRA's General Commissioner, Peter Hansen
says the 4.5% increase in aid (in comparison with last year's
contribution) would help cover18% of his organisation's Budget. The EU is
the second biggest contributor to the UNWRA Budget after the US, but the
first if donations from each Member States are taken into account. The
money is used for programmes relating to food, education and health for
the 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West
Bank and Gaza.

Mr Hansen says the EU aid has arrived just at the right moment, because
the UNWRA Budget is running a 15% deficit and was on the verge of having
to stop making payments. The General Commissioner is planning to make a
tour of the Arab countries to ask them to boost their contributions
(currently accounting for only 1% of the Budget). As for Israel, he is
simply asking the authorities there to facilitate the efforts being made
to deliver aid.

The aid for UNWRA is quite separate from that awarded to the Palestinian
Authority. The EU is also funding other projects such as one for a major
Palestine hospital due to open next year, for which the EU has paid ECU 20
million.

Gaza port.

During his visit to Palestine, President Chirac announced on October 23
his decision to revive the Palestinian shipping port project for Gaza.
Sponsored by the Netherlands and France, the project is supposed to result
in the port being able to handle more than one million tonnes of cargo
annually in six years' time. Mr Chirac visited the site during his visit
to the Gaza Strip. A USD1.5 million contract was signed to allow French
engineers to press on with the preparations and to help with construction
immediately after an Israeli/Palestinian agreement along these lines. "The
construction of a port in the Gaza Strip, that France has decided to fund,
together with its European partners, is an economic and political
necessity", according to Mr Chirac.

A first feasibility study, initiated with the support of Israel by the
Dutch firm Grabowsky and Poorts, was conducted by Tel Aviv University in
1990/91. The autonomy agreements signed by Israel and the PLO have, in the
meantime, conferred on the Palestinian Authority the right to its own
port. The Israelis and Palestinian have agreed upon a negotiating system
specifying their mutual approval for each of the three project phases:
studies, construction and port operations. The port exists only on paper
for the moment, but the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, symbolically
laid the first stone last January 18 in the company of the Dutch Prime
Minister, Wim Kok. The cost of building the Gaza port is put at USD71
million, with the Netherlands supplying FF 23 million, France 19 million
and the EU (via the European Investment Bank) 29 million.

EU/LEBANON ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT LOOMING UP

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Lebanon and the European Union are likely to be in a position to sign a
partnership deal before the end of the year, a European official hinted on
October 22 in Beruit. Major progress had been made in the talks, according
to Bernard Philippe, a senior European Commission official in charge of
negotiating with Lebanon. At the end of a meeting with Zafer al-Hassan, a
high-level official from the Lebanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mr
Philippe stressed that more talks were needed for farming, emigration and
services. Without mentioning any exact date, the EU's negotiator in Beruit
expressed confidence about a deal being struck between the two sides
before the end of the year. The talks on establishing an economic, social
and cultural partnership got under way in 1995.

EIB loan to Lebanon.

The European Investment Bank announced on October 24 an ECU 50 million
loan to Lebanon to pay for projects to combat water pollution. The loan
agreement was signed by Ariane Obolensky, Vice-Chairman of the EIB, and
Nabil Jisr, head of a Government-sponsored development and reconstruction
organisation. Carrying a 3% rate of interest, the loan forms part of
overall aid of ECU 130 million from the Lebanese Government, the World
Bank and a Japanese fund awarding money for schemes to clean up Lebanese
coastal cities. The EIB has awarded loans to the tune of ECU 300 million
for Lebanese reconstruction projects launched since the end of the
1975-1990 civil war.

EU/BULGARIA: "CONSTRUCTIVE" TECHNICAL MEETING WITH BULGARIA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Despite the recent problems in Bulgaria (see European Report N   2064),
there was a conciliatory tone to the second meeting of the Association
Council, held in Brussels on October 22. Implementation of Bulgaria's
Europe Agreement is "progressing according to schedule", delegates agreed,
and the EU side - headed by Sipke Brouwer, Director for relations with
Central and East Europe in the European Commission's External Political
Relations Directorate-General, DG IA - welcomed the recent economic
stabilisation and restructuring programme from the Government, and
expressed hope that it would help sustainable long-term development.

Bulgaria's application to join the EU, its accession to the World Trade
Organisation, and its adoption of a national strategy to respond to the
1995 White Paper on rules for the Internal Market were all welcomed (and
Bulgaria also reported on its work to set up a special framework agreement
with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). There was
also recognition of Bulgaria's efforts at developing regional cooperation,
especially via the Sofia Ministerial meeting in July. Moreover, Bulgaria's
plans for enterprise and financial sector restructuring and for cash
privatisation were judged appropriate for "substantial" assistance from
the EU-coordinated PHARE programme for economic reform. The EU
acknowledged the "important steps" taken towards "economically viable"
electricity prices as a crucial aspect of energy reform.

But it was made clear that any further EU macro-financial support would be
given only if Bulgaria brings the IMF-agreed macro-economic and structural
reform programme back on track. There is a need for more agricultural
reform, too, the EU side pointed out firmly, with emphasis on new rules on
land ownership and market liberalisation. Bulgaria's recent request for
food aid to overcome a short-term cereal supply imbalance will be assessed
in the light of how many concrete steps Bulgaria shows it is ready to make
in that direction - particularly since the EU has already agreed to
facilitate planting by private farmers for the 1997 harvest.

During the meeting - where the Bulgarian delegation was led by Emil Valev,
Director of European Integration, and Peter Stefanov, the Deputy Minister
of Trade - most of the outstanding trade issues were resolved, but there
remains much to be done to meet Bulgaria's desire for greater freedom of
movement for workers. The EU also stressed the need to keep to schedule
for bringing in - and for giving real effect to - legislative
approximation, particularly in respect of competition, certification and
standards. Another urgent need, the EU side said, is for a civil service
law to promote a stable and professional public administration. And on the
sore point of visas, the current aim is to develop PHARE programmes that
will "create the conditions for a reconsideration by the EU of its visa
policy".

EU/EAST EUROPE: EU LOOKS AT ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION WITH CEECS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
(CEECs) is not only delivering a plethora of headlines on the political
relations between the EU and its candidates. It is also bringing these
countries ever closer to EU operating methods, through a series of less
spectacular but nevertheless influential mechanisms. The meeting of EU and
CEEC Internal Market Ministers in Luxembourg on October 25 was scheduled
to look at one of the latest moves in these "back office" developments -
what goes under the prosaic title of administrative cooperation. What it
comes down to is trying to ensure that all the CEEC rule changes result in
new conditions on the ground as well as in their statute books, so that a
genuine Single Market will be brought into being with enlargement.

Administrative cooperation has already been a permanent feature of
relations between existing EU Member States for years - based on the
knowledge that no Single Market will work at all in practice without
constant common efforts to avert problems and prevent the emergence of
latent protectionism masquerading as national safeguard measures. Between
Member States, regular meetings of officials at all levels and across all
Internal Market sectors has made it possible to deal with potential
problems early, before they become serious obstacles to free movement -
and at the same time mutual confidence has been built.

These existing mechanisms within the EU include the system of prior
notification of new national measures of a technical nature (set up by
Directive 83/189) and the related procedures for assessing derogations
from rules on free movement of goods, which will come into effect from the
beginning of 1997 (under Decision 3052/95), and a new procedure for
ensuring transparency of technical standards in the framework of the
information society. They also include networks created, in line with a
number of Council Resolutions over the last two years, to establish
national contact points and information on national administrative
structures - aimed both at increasing cooperation between Member States
and at helping companies to understand their rights for cross-border
operation in the Single Market. And they include the programmes such as
Karolus, Mattheus and Mattheus Tax for exchanges between Member States of
officials working in customs and taxation.

When CEECs join the EU, their officials too will have to play an active
part in these networks. To start preparations for that time - and
particularly since few East European officials have much experience of
many of the market economy mechanisms which are at the heart of a Single
European Market - the European Commission has made a number of specific
suggestions. Bringing CEEC officials progressively into the loop will get
them ready to work fully with their new colleagues after accession, and
will in the meantime also provide them with a lot of technical help in
resolving some of the problems that their own national legislative
adaptations are presenting.

Already the TAIEX office in Brussels provides the CEECs with technical
assistance and access to expertise - including short visits, contacts with
EU Member State experts, and seminars. The Commission is also suggesting
setting up some ad hoc groups of EU and CEEC officials and experts in
specific domains - such as DG XVII is now doing for gas, where each Member
State has been asked to nominate one official and one industry expert. And
it recommends that specific meetings - such as DG XVII (again) organised
on energy matters at Director-General level in March - can be helpful.
What the Commission is seeking from all the Internal Market Ministers is
guidance on what they would themselves find most useful.

Treading carefully.

The Commission is conscious of the need for caution in such a process.
Some of the EU mechanisms for administrative cooperation also have a
decision-making (and sometimes even a legislative) role, and it would not
be appropriate for officials from non-Member States to take part, even as
observers - and there was some initial resistance from Member States to
the idea of premature cooperation. But the Commission, in its 1995 White
Paper on integrating the East Europeans into the Internal Market, already
announced its intention of suggesting some methods in which CEEC officials
might gain a better understanding of the operation of the Single Market.
Prior to the Council, Presidency sources downplayed the significance of
Member State resistance, suggesting it was based on a misunderstanding
that exaggerated the size and speed of the steps now under discussion.

EU/ZAIRE/RWANDA: EU REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION TO CONFLICT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

EU Development Commissioner Jo_o de Deus Pinheiro and members of the
Council's Africa Working group have thrown their support behind new
efforts to calm tensions at the border between Zaire and Rwanda that
observers fear could escalate into an all-out conflict. They met on
October 23 with Aldo Ajello, European Union envoy to the Great Lakes
region, following recent fighting between Zairean Government troops and a
Tutsi community near the frontier and a mass exodus of refugees in the
area.

EU representatives gave the envoy a mandate to proceed with attempts to
bring about a meeting as soon as possible between the Prime Ministers of
Zaire and Rwanda to defuse the situation. "A meeting was initially
scheduled for early November. All efforts possible should be deployed to
ensure it takes place despite the incidents that have taken place these
last few days in South Kivu in eastern Zaire", the Commissioner said after
his meeting with Mr Ajello. The special envoy also met Commissioner Emma
Bonino to discuss humanitarian aid. A crisis unit, set up within the
European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will be responsible for
following the situation and deciding whether to activate any emergency
measures.

In a statement published on behalf of the EU on October 21, the Council
Presidency "urged all parties to exercise restraint and to ensure the
prevention of open conflict across the border between Zaire and Rwanda".
The EU statement, which was backed by the associated Central and Eastern
European countries, Cyprus and Malta, also supported the efforts of the
United Nations Special Representative, Ibrahima Fall, to seek a peaceful
resolution.

EU/CENTRAL AMERICA: EU PROJECTS TO AID REFUGEES IN GUATEMALA AND EL
SALVADOR

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission cleared on October 23 two development aid projects
designed to help uprooted people in El Salvador and Guatemala. In El
Salvador, the ECU 4 million programme will help integrate into local
communities displaced persons, demobilised soldiers and people returning
to the department of Morazan, one of the areas worst affected by the
fighting that ended with peace agreements in 1992. In Guatemala, the EU is
putting up ECU 3.1 million to help pay for infrastructure improvements and
to promote agricultural and forest production.

In an effort to encourage self-sufficiency and sustainable development in
El Salvador in the longer term, actions under the new programme will be
targeted specifically at strengthening productive activities via a credit
system and providing specialised technical assistance and support for
marketing development and training needed to build productive
infrastructure.

Other activities carried out under the ECU 4 million programme (of which
ECU 3.6 million comes from the EU) will aid in the construction and
rehabilitation of social, health and education infrastructure and
communication routes, cleaning up the environment and the development of
technical skills and expertise. The encouragement of basic cereal
production, the creation of family kitchen gardens and livestock
production will also be priorities. Carried out jointly by the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs in El Salvador and the European Union in
collaboration with local and European non-governmental organisations, the
project is scheduled to run for one and a half years.

The Commission has supported those uprooted by armed violence in El
Salvador since 1984, and since 1991 has provided aid to help people
resettle in Morazan from, for example, the Colomoncagua refugee camp in
Honduras. Some ECU 4.6 million has been invested in projects geared
primarily at supporting self-sufficiency in health, education,
agricultural and stock-breeding production, the installation of workshops,
and the production of textiles, leather and footwear.

Aiding peace in Guatemala.

With the November 1996 signing of an overall peace agreement in Guatemala
in view, the Commission approved a programme to help resettle communities
in the Sayaxche and La Libertad municipalities in the El Peten department
that were displaced, primarily to Mexico, by the civil war. It is designed
to foster the move towards democracy, promote socio-economic development
and create the machinery for consultation between the government and civil
society.

The ECU 4.4 million project (of which ECU 3.1 million will be provided by
the EU) will finance infrastructure and basic services construction such
as access roads, schools, health centres and drinking water systems, and
aid in agricultural and forest production, including the promotion of
permanent crops, reforestation, sustainable forest management, and the
development of other natural resources. Funding will be provided for
training in carpentry and wood craftsmanship, weaving and eco-tourism. The
project also aims to reinforce the capacity of local communities to
formulate and draw up their own development projects.

With an estimated 30 million refugees and displaced persons worldwide, the
European Commission has just published "Refugee Issues", a 36-page
document which provides an overview of EU aid in favour of displaced
persons in Africa, Latin America, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and the
CIS, the Middle East and North Africa. In 1995, ECU 725 million was
allocated to help deal with refugee crises.

CULTURE: COMMISSION TO FUND 147 PROJECTS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A total of 147 projects concerned with preservation of the European
cultural heritage will benefit from Community funding to the tune of ECU
ten million. This decision by the European Commission falls within the
framework of actions in preparation for the implementation of the Raphael
programme. This programme, which is on its way to being adopted, was the
subject of a report by Francisco Sanz Fernandez (PES, Spain) adopted by
the European Parliament, meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on
October 22, and recommending an increase in its budget.

The European Union's activities in the area of cultural heritage
preservation expanded during the 1980s under the influence of the European
Parliament. Each year, the Commission supports projects selected for their
cultural or technical value. It also finances exhibitions and publications
vaunting Community projects and initiatives in this area. The Commission
proposed the Raphael programme on March 29, 1995, with the goal of
providing a broader and more coherent framework for activities already
under way in the area of cultural heritage.

Parliamentary report.

Introducing his report on second reading, Mr Sanz Fernandez stressed the
need to increase the programme's budget to ECU 86 million from the ECU 30
million proposed by the Council of Ministers and which he considers
inadequate in light of the programme's objectives. The report emphasised
that culture is not a luxury and that handing the European cultural
heritage down to future generations is essential. It also pointed out
cultural activities' potential for job creation. The Commission has
indicated that it recommended a budget of ECU 67 million. The rapporteur
had no objection to the Council's wish to reduce the length of the
programme from five years to four, taking into account preparatory
activities conducted in 1996.

Financing of pilot projects.

The 147 projects selected by the Commission were advanced by national,
regional and local authorities, as well as associations of private
individuals in the EU Member States. Some 25% of these projects provide
for participation by associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe
and other third countries that have Association or Cooperation Agreements
with the Union. Five distinct actions were launched:

- cooperative projects for the preservation and promotion of the European
Baroque heritage

- projects aimed at promoting the European archaeological heritage

- projects for the promotion and provision of access to the cultural
heritage of museums

- activities and/or events with a European dimension for the preservation
and increased awareness of the European cultural heritage

- supplementary training and mobility for professionals in the sector.

OPPOSITION TO COMMUNITY TRANSIT DECISION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Against the background of the war it is waging on Community transit fraud,
the European Commission is planning to increase the overall guarantee for
"non-sensitive" goods on the basis of duties and taxes paid during
delivery operations. Under the Commission proposal the guarantee would be
raised from 30 to 100% A few months ago, the guarantee was suspended for
"sensitive" goods, which are subject to high duties and taxes and are thus
a favourite target for fraudulent activities. The matter was expected to
be considered by the October 25 Internal Market Council. In view of the
proposed increase, EuroCommerce, which represents the EU's commercial
sector, has already voiced its firm opposition to a plan, saying it is
unwarranted. The association reckons that the low level of duties and
taxes to be paid for non-sensitive goods act as a disincentive to fraud.
EuroCommerce is worried about the harmful consequences for the economic
operators involved. During a public hearing held by the European
Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, Community transport operators also
stressed what a heavy burden they would have to support as a result of
increased guarantees. They are calling for more sharing of
responsibilities between the different agents in the transit chain.

AUDIOVISUAL POLICY: PARLIAMENT INDICATES SUPPORT FOR GUARANTEE FUND

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

"The Americans have managed to inculcate the entire world with their
values. Europeans must use their film industry to defend and promote the
ideals of the European Community", declared French MEP Armelle
Guineberti
re (UFE) in support of the creation of a European Guarantee
Fund for audiovisual production during a debate in the European
Parliament's plenary session. In a report adopted by the Parliament on
October 22, Mr Guineberti
re issued a moving plea for a full-scale
European response to American domination of the cinema. "A European film
industry must have resources at its disposal", she said, calling the
Guarantee Fund the answer to both a cultural and an economic need.
Amendments to the Commission's proposal were nonetheless numerous and
supported special provisions for productions in less widely-spoken
languages.

The draft Decision establishing a Guarantee Fund for the audiovisual
industry was unveiled on November 14, 1995. Under the proposed system,
banks would be granted guarantees for a portion of the loans they make to
film producers or distributors. The European Union's contribution would be
ECU 90 million, this amount to be matched by the private sector and other
public bodies. This Fund would be administered by the European Investment
Fund (EIF). It will not be easy to put into practice, given the
reservations expressed by the Council of Ministers, which must reach a
unanimous decision for the proposal to go ahead. Furthermore, as Mrs
Guineberti
re's report points out, the unresolved technical and financial
issues shed doubt on the firmness of the Member States' political will to
set up a Guarantee Fund of this kind. In any case, the Parliament plays a
merely advisory role on this proposal, which based on Article 130 of the
Treaty.

Specific strategy for SMEs.

The Audiovisual Guarantee Fund would have to take into account the demands
of the market, production issues and television rights, which do not
concern the cinema directly, but merit more consideration, the
Parliamentary report noted. Criteria for eligibility would give special
treatment to small countries, those with a less widely-spoken language and
smaller firms. The MEPs were also sceptical about the choice of the EIF to
manage the Fund. Given the specific features of this sector and the legal
and financial implications of the guarantees to be provided, an ad hoc
structure would have to be set up within the EIF to represent the European
Union's funds. However, it would be assisted by a group of professional
experts from the film industry and the world of banking, as the
"particular nature of the audiovisual sector rules out the direct
application of the EIF's own criteria", according to the report.

Mrs Guineberti
re further recommended a pilot period of five years, during
which the Fund's impact on the European audiovisual sector could be
assessed. Once its usefulness had been demonstrated, the Union could begin
to think about laying the legal foundations for its future activities.

Commission reaction.

Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner for the Audiovisual portfolio,
declared that he hoped the Council of Ministers will adopt the proposal
for setting up the Fund at its December 16 session on audiovisual affairs.
He indicated willingness to incorporate 21 of the Parliament's amendments,
in particular one emphasising the difficulties faced by countries with
lesser-used languages. He also supports some other amendments in
principle, including the one proposing an ad hoc structure wherein
industry professionals would be represented to administer the Fund, and
another in favour of support for SMEs and small-scale projects. However,
Mr Oreja opposes the idea of setting up the Fund for a provisional period
of five years during which its impact on the European film industry could
be assessed.

CULTURE: PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR INCREASE IN CREDITS FOR ARIANE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The financial package provided for the Ariane programme to promote books
and reading is too small, according to the European Parliament. On second
reading of a proposal on this cultural programme, the MEPs adopted a
report by Nana Mouskouri (EPP, Greece) during their October 22 plenary
session in Strasbourg.

Ariane is a programme of support for books and reading. First proposed in
November 1994 (COM(94)356), it is based on Article 128 of the Treaty
(requiring the Council of Ministers to take a unanimous decision). The
Parliament gave its Opinion on first reading in April 1995 and the Council
adopted its common position in July. As Mrs Mouskouri pointed out, this
common position changed four points of the initial proposal:

- The length of the programme was reduced from five years (1996-2000) to
two years (1994-1998), with the option of launching another programme
after an assessment of the first one, to which the rapporteur had no
objections. Pilot projects in the areas covered by Ariane had a budget of
ECU 2.5 million in 1996; this was the figure advanced by the Commission
for the first year of the programme.

- The budget was decreased from ECU 34 million over five years to ECU
seven million over two years. The Council adopted the proposals contained
in the revised version of the Commission's budget. This is unacceptable,
in the Parliament's view, if the Union wants to have a real impact on the
current situation. The Parliamentary report thus proposed a budget of ECU
10.5 million.

- While the Commission proposed setting up an Advisory Committee to
administer the programme, the Council preferred a joint Advisory and
Management Committee. The Parliament is in favour of an Advisory Committee
as initially proposed.

- The original proposal provided for three main actions, but the Council
established six priority measures. Mrs Mouskouri believes this approach
provides a clearer vision of the scope of application of the programme,
but she emphasised promotion of reading via translation of works written
in the Union's lesser-used languages.

Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner responsible for Cultural
Affairs, assured the Parliament that the Commission is particularly
sensitive to arguments concerning the need to defend minority languages,
but said he could not agree to the funding increase given budgetary
constraints.

MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINK

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news that
UK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain condition
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a press
conference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thought
in the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring in
stricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that the
UK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some
150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.
Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive and
negative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,
was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eaters
of infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positive
element consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easier
to trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed. Meanwhile, in
Strasbourg, Members of the European Parliament voted to extend the mandate
of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE.

BSE and vCJD prions "match".

The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of a
new technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in the
Prion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, for
tracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the brain
tissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemical
signature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches that
of prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthens
the conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British
cattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of a
rapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.

Further safety precautions?

Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EU
executive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for some
time and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already in
place. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees for
examination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis of
their recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, Franz
Fischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the Farm
Council on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chain
those cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.

Harmonisation needed.

The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervous
tissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting the
fatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. The
only EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, which
are banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle and
sheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bone
meal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The French
authorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they banned
from both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,
from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.
Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischler
believes Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the French
model. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in July
met with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.

The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25
to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislative
Bill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France of
the sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to foster
EU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since July
maintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues from
the UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.

Inquiry extended.

Meanwhile the European Parliament voted in plenary session on October 24
to extend the mandate of its Temporary Committee of Inquiry (TCI) into BSE
for another three months. The nineteen MEPs who have been interviewing
Commission staff, government officials and scientific experts since early
September feel they need more time to get to the bottom of all the
evidence, some of which seems to point to an early cover-up of the dangers
of "mad cow disease" for public health. The TCI will now produce its
report sometime in late February.

FISHERIES: PROCESSORS CALL FOR LIFTING OF FISH IMPORT TARIFFS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Union's tariffs on fish imports have been sharply criticised
in a report by the European Fish Processors Association (AIPCEE) which
argues that they raise prices to the detriment of the consumer. The report
- which calls for an end to import restrictions by quantity or by price -
says the EU now depends on imports from third countries for half its fish
consumption.

Tariffs harming EU industry's competitiveness.

European Commission sources tried to dismiss the report as irrelevant and
one-sided, but the AIPCEE, which represents the fish processing industry
in twelve EU Member States, insists that the policy implications are
clear. The report says that tariffs levied on imports harm the
competitiveness of the EU processing industry on the international market
against those processors from countries where tariffs are negligible,
especially on finished products. "The outcome of the regime can only be to
raise prices to the detriment of the consumer, the processing industry and
ultimately to the fishermen themselves through the destruction of markets."

Around 50% of total imports of fish and fishery products from third
countries are covered by imports of cod, saithe, redfish, haddock, hake
and Alaska pollack, the report says. "The supply of the EU market with
these species has to be safeguarded up to 83% by imports from third
countries like Norway, Russia, Iceland, Poland and Argentina." This means
that only 17% of total white fish supply can be met by the EU's own fleet.
The report argues that with demand outstripping supply, imports of these
stocks do not harm the EU's own fishermen. "Therefore, there is no purpose
in restricting imports by quantity or by price when supplies are not
available from EU fishermen."

The AIPCEE estimates that the supply of EU fish products amounted to 8.5
million tonnes in 1995, up 29% from 6.6 million tonnes in 1986. Over the
same period, imports from third countries nearly doubled from 2.7 million
tonnes to 5.5 million tonnes in 1995. By contrast, exports from the EU to
third countries grew only from 1.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes.
"The continuous trend towards import dependence needs to be recognised in
a further liberalisation of the conditions under which such imports from
third countries are allowed", the report says.

The report offers four policy recommendations for the European Commission
and the EU's Council of Ministers:

- decisions on tariff suspensions should be taken sufficiently in advance
to give EU enterprises time to plan their forward purchases and avoid
unnecessary costs for storage and financing;

- there should be duty free access to raw material especially when
important third countries are granted duty free access to the EU for
processed fish products;

- further reductions should be made in import duties for species which
cannot be supplied in sufficient quantities from EU catches: such reduced
duty imports should extend not only to frozen raw material, but also to
fresh fish necessary for the processing industry;

- autonomous tariff quotas should be converted for certain species into
general tariff suspensions.

More generally, the AIPCEE makes four suggestions to contribute towards
improving supplies for domestic fisheries:

- using size control to produce more selective catches: cod, saithe and
haddock catches are generally too small and of low marketing standards;

- improving quota management so that supplies are available on a reliable
and continuous basis for the filleting industry: the report says the
processing industry cannot cope with the successive gluts caused by
erratic landing patterns of EU catches;

- the plans to cut fishing capacity should be based on long-term analyses
of the conditions necessary for sustainable fishing effort;

- closer cooperation between EU fishermen and the processing industry on
measures to improve domestic supply, based on the long-term sustainable
availability of fish at world market prices.

Last March, the association called for the lifting of the Commission's
plans for fish inspection charges. It listed four reasons for rejecting
the plans: the levy would act as a tax on the fish consumer, and demand
would fall further if prices rose; fish is very safe and becomes
unpalatable before it becomes unsafe, making the checks an unnecessary
bureaucratic procedure; the need for checks can only actually be judged by
local inspectors after individual operations; and it would be impossible
to assess what a standard charge should be when the cost is not known.

Emma Bonino, the European Fisheries Commissioner will address a seminar in
The Hague on October 29 on the common organisation of the market for
fisheries products. The seminar, organised by the Commission and the
Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament, is part of the
Commission's effort to liaise with fisheries officials and hammer out the
serious problems facing the European Union's fisheries sector. The day
before the seminar, Mrs Bonino take part in a round table in The Hague on

REGIONAL POLICY: COMMISSION TIGHT-LIPPED ON COHESION REPORT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission has been remarkably secretive about its draft
Cohesion Report, due to be released on October 31, which is expected to
provide a comprehensive assessment of the European Union's various
Structural Fund policies and its efforts to reduce regional disparities.

The services of Regional Policy Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies often
tend to be cautious about information, but there is particular reticence
about the Cohesion Report, which has involved a number of different
Directorates since the beginning of the year. Rumours about the report
suggest that it may reveal continuing disparities in certain regions, but
Commission officials are refusing to confirm or deny any speculation.

The structure of the Cohesion Report can, however, be revealed. There will
be four sections dealing with different aspects of regional policy. The
first will be an overview of social and economic cohesion within the EU,
showing past trends and developments. Then there will be a section dealing
with the individual efforts by the EU Member States to influence cohesion
within their territories. The third part will be an examination of the
EU's various complementary polices which have had an effect on the
regions, like the Common Agricultural Policy, telecommunications, business
networks and social policy. And the final part will concern the effects of
the EU's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund on the regions.

The impact of the report will be felt far beyond the Commission's regional
policies. The Commission is able to concede that the Cohesion Report will
provide a springboard to the 1999 review of the Structural Funds. And any
analysis of the link between the EU's efforts and social and economic
cohesion will be studied closely by the aspiring EU candidates in Central
and Eastern Europe (CEECs) hoping to gauge future EU regional policy.

The current Structural Funds have a total budget of ECU 157 billion for
the 1994 to 1999 period, and Mrs Wulf-Mathies has suggested maintaining
the overall criteria for the package. This will mean the Structural Fund
budget would remain at the current 0.46% of the EU's gross domestic
product, and the overall figure for the 2000 to 2006 period would be about
ECU 260 billion. But there is scepticism about keeping other aspects of
the current Structural Funds. For example, the Cohesion Fund, which
provides Funds for Member States with less than 90% of the EU's average
gross national product could be dominated by the CEECs if they join. The
same goes for the current criteria for Objective 1 of the Structural
Funds, which goes to the EU's poorest regions, whose gross domestic
product is 75% or less that the EU average.

AGRICULTURE: 1995 EU FARM SPENDING DOWN AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Total expenditure under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) for 1995 rose to ECU 34,503 million,
from the ECU 32,970 million disbursed in 1994. However, this figure
represents a lower percentage of both the total EU Budget (51.7%, compared
with 55% in 1994) and total Community Gross Domestic Product (0.53%, down
from 0.58% in 1994). These facts emerge from the 25th EAGGF Guarantee
Section report*, newly approved by the European Commission. The report's
authors point out that the 1995 expenditure figures are inflated by the
inclusion for the first time of the three new Member States -Austria,
Finland and Sweden - and by the fact that direct aid to farmers introduced
under the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was also
stepped up during the year.

Expenditure well inside guideline.

The final total of appropriations allocated to the EAGGF Guarantee Section
in 1995, i.e. the original 1995 Budget, the Supplementary and Amending
Budget (SAB), letter of amendment, transfers and provisional
appropriations, totalled ECU 36,849.6 million (not including the monetary
reserve of ECU 500 million) plus automatic carry-overs amounting to ECU
64.3 million. During the 1995 financial year, the agricultural guideline,
which sets a ceiling on Guarantee Section spending, was fixed at ECU
37,944 million, somewhat higher than the 1994 financial year (ECU 36,465).
In the event, total expenditure came to ECU just 34,503 million. No
non-automatic carry-overs were made from the 1994 Budget to that of 1995
and there was therefore no expenditure under that heading. The trend in
expenditure since 1988 is shown below in Graph 1a. Graph 1b shows EAGGF
Guarantee Section expenditure within the EU's General Budget.

Expenditure breakdown.

Looking at the different categories of spending, the figures show that
spending on export refunds continued to decline, falling from ECU 8,161
million in 1994 to ECU 7,802 million in 1995. It thus now accounts for
only 22.6% of total EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure. Meanwhile,
intervention spending in 1995 came to ECU 26,206 million, mainly
consisting of storage aid and price compensatory aid (production,
processing and marketing aid). As a result of a return to more balanced
markets, expenditure on storage fell very steeply from ECU 5,386 million
in 1993 to ECU 1,070 million in 1994, and then again to ECU 339 million in
1995. On the other hand, price compensatory aid was up (from ECU 24,490
million in 1995 as compared with ECU 21,339 million in 1994). This was due
to the major expansion of production aid schemes (acreage payments,
set-aside, suckler-cow premiums and premiums for male bovine animals)
introduced as part of the 1992 reform of the CAP.

Arable aid dominant.

Comparing product sectors, arable crops, a heading which now subsumes four
former expenditure headings (cereals, oilseeds, protein plants and
set-aside), accounted for 43.5% of overall spending. This sector was
followed by milk products (11.7% ) and beef and veal (11.7%). (See Graph
2a below.)

France the chief beneficiary.

Among the Member States, France is still the main recipient of Guarantee
Section expenditure at ECU 8,377 million - absorbing some 24% of overall
spending. Next, at some distance, come Germany (ECU 5,380 million), Spain
(ECU 4,562 million) and Italy (ECU 3,364 million) (see Graph 2b). In their
first year following accession, Austria received ECU 86 million, Finland
ECU 62 million and Sweden ECU 75 million.

Lengthy clearance of accounts process.

One of the main features of the clearance of accounts procedure, the
report explains, is that it enables the Commission to recover from the
Member States sums unduly paid in the application of the regulations on
the Common Agricultural Policy. After lengthy dialogue and conciliation
stages with the Member States in question, decisions leading to recovery
are taken by the Commission. Following this path, clearance of the
accounts for 1991 was only adopted by the Commission on 21 December 1994,
so that its consequences apply in the 1995 financial year. The sum
recovered amounted to ECU 1,518.3 million out of expenditure totalling ECU
30,332 million, the report details.

Conciliation body begins work.

During 1995, under the accounts clearance procedure for 1992, a proposal
was put to the Commission for the recovery of ECU 1,026.5 million out of a
total of ECU 32,083 million. The Commission's final decision in February
1996 reduced the amount to be recovered to ECU 997.5 million. 1995 was
also the year in which the conciliation body began its work, which
involves observations on the clearance of the 1992 accounts. This led to a
series of new, lengthy preventive measures on the part of the Commission
EAGGF accounts clearance departments following upon the conciliation
procedure. At the same time, preparation of the accounts clearance
procedure relating to the 1993 financial year continued to the stage of
dialogue with the Member States, says the EAGGF report.

ENVIRONMENT: "NEW" PROPOSALS FOR ENFORCING LEGISLATION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

On October 22, the European Commission presented a three-point programme
for improving implementation of EU environmental legislation. This is not
a superfluous initiative: in 1995, the Commission registered 265 suspected
breaches of environmental Directives, representing no less than 20% of all
infringements against Community law. This is why, according to the
Commission, "original proposals" must be now considered. However, it
remains to be seen whether this "Communication on the implementation of EU
environmental law" - which only sets out general guidelines - will have
any genuine effect as it does not contain any binding measures. It will at
least have the merit of launching a wide-ranging debate on the issue.

As Ritt Bjerregaard, the Environment Commissioner, recalled, "improving
implementation of EU environmental law is not just a question of taking
Member States to Court". "It is neither possible nor practical for all the
legal actions that could arise from lack of compliance with Community
rules to be channelled through one enforcing authority, the Commission and
one court of law, the Court of Justice", the Commission explains. Recourse
to Articles 169 and 171 of the Treaty appears insufficient but will remain
complementary to any new measures envisaged.

According to the Communication, the following three initiatives are most
apt to effectively improve the implementation of EU environmental
legislation "because control of implementation begins at home, in the
Member States":

* the establishment of guidelines to assist the Member States in their
environmental inspections;

* the establishment of a procedure within the Member States to receive and
examine complaints from the public about the implementation of Community
environmental law;

* examination by the Commission of the question of guaranteed basic access
for representative organisations to the national jurisdictions, "in
keeping with the principle of subsidiarity" (some Member States already
have an Ombudsman system, while others have no provision). This is the
most controversial issue. Following the adoption of the Communication, one
Commission official explained "we have no wish to create new mechanisms
where provisions already exist".

"The solutions we are advocating would enable non-governmental
organisations to appeal to the courts", he explained, imparting the
Commission's wish for decisions to be taken at the most local level
possible.

On the Community level the Commission may, in future proposals (and when
revision existing Directives), introduce a specific provision requiring
the Member States to provide sanctions in national legislation for failure
to respect EU environmental law. These penal, administrative and other
sanctions may for example take the form of withdrawing operating licences
from such factories as fail to respect a Directive.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTES ON SAFETY OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND SHIPS.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Gathered in plenary session in Strasbourg between October 21 and 25, MEPs
adopted two reports concerning transport. The approved report concerning
the Directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their
trailers (cooperation procedure second reading) only retains three of the
amendments proposed by the rapporteur Italian Independent Spalato Bellere.
MEPs are anxious to increase the frequency of testing (three years after
the date on which the vehicle was first used and thereafter every year)
and ban old vehicles that fail to meet minimum standards for braking
systems and emissions. Voting to adopt the report by Nikitas Kaklamanis
(UFE, Greece) on the safety and efficiency of marine equipment aboard
ships sailing between European Union ports, MEPs retained a number of the
amendments tabled in first reading (under the cooperation procedure),
notably the insistence that safety checks are carried out by accredited
independent bodies.

SWEDEN REFUSES TO BUDGE ON TRAVELLERS' ALCOHOL ALLOWANCES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Sweden remains intractable in current negotiations with the European
Commission on purchases of alcohol by travellers. To the Commission's
dismay, Sweden is still refusing to set a date for the end of a derogation
allowing it, along with Denmark and Finland, to impose stricter limits on
purchases of alcoholic beverages by citizens travelling within the
European Union than those provided for in Community legislation. Mario
Monti, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Customs and
Taxation, held another round of talks with the Finance Ministers of the
three Nordic countries in Strasbourg on October 23. He said that he
remained flexible as to the date when the exemption would end, but that he
wanted this date, once specified, to be firm (see European Report N  s
2167). If no agreement can be reached, the European Court of Justice will
be responsible for putting an end to the derogation, the Commission warned
following the meeting.

Denmark and Finland are reportedly willing to give up their special regime
in 2004. The Commissioner feels, however, that five and half years is
sufficient time for these countries to adjust. He said following the
meeting that he would suggest that the Commission set a deadline of June
30, 2002. The Commission will present a proposal to this effect very
shortly, so that the Finance Ministers will have time to examine it before
the end of the year. Unanimous agreement is required to extend these
exemptions beyond 1999, the date initially specified by the Commission.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision to
create an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995
Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informal
but institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure its
support when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. This
Committee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areas
where Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on the
means needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on these
proposals before they are finalised.

The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,
distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with the
protection of the environment. During the preparation of the White Paper,
all these interested parties had indicated to the Commission the priority
they place on dialogue and transparency in the formulation of EU energy
policy.

INTERNAL MARKET COUNCIL: ALL TALK AND SCARCELY ANY ACTION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Gathered on October 25 in Luxembourg for a sitting devoted to the Internal
Market, EU Ministers listened to strong words from European Commissioner
Mario Monti, who sought to prod them into applying EU Single Market
legislation more effectively. The Ministers held a debate on transparency
of rules covering information society services. Talks about administrative
cooperation, in particular, were held with representatives of associate
countries from Central and Eastern Europe (see separate article). As
European Report was going to press, the Council was on the verge of
passing a Resolution on streamlining customs procedures and giving the
European Commission permission to negotiate a Customs Cooperation
Agreement with Norway.

Toeing the line.

Unless EU countries show a bit more determination in trying to apply
mutually-agreed rules, the Single Market will not be able to produce the
anticipated benefits in terms of jobs, economic growth and
competitiveness. This is the gist of the message that the Commissioner for
the Internal Market had to give to Ministers. In spite of the appeal made
at the EU Summit in Florence last June and the letter Mr Monti sent to
each Member State, there is little improvement to report in the way the
Member States are transposing and applying Internal Market Directives: the
overall rate of transposition for all Member States is virtually the same
as that reported at the previous Internal Market Council in May (93.3% in
the case of Directives reflecting the 219 measures the 1985 White Paper
thought necessary for completing the Single Market, and 90.9% for the
1,140 Directives relating to the Internal Market).

In the context of Single Market legislation as a whole, the Commission has
instituted 11 proceedings against Member States in the EU Court of
Justice. Denmark and the Netherlands are the two most disciplined
countries in this respect and far outstrip the larger countries. Spain and
France come eighth and ninth respectively in the class, whereas, Germany
is last but one, the one being Austria. The most problematic sectors
continue to be public procurement (Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands
are alone in successfully transposing EU legislation in this area) and
insurance (Spain and Greece are lagging well behind). The Commissioner
reported the presentation, in early November, of a Commission
Communication on the impact and efficiency of the Single Market in the
European Union.

Mr Monti explained to Ministers the key ideas in the Citizens First
initiative due to be launched on November 26 (and not November 20 as we
mistakenly reported in our previous issue). The first information guides
for the general public in Europe will focus on the themes of living,
working, studying, training and carrying out research in an other EU
country. Others due to be published in mid 1997 will cover consumers and
the social dimension of the Single Market. A free phone service will be
set up in each country to enable individuals to gain access to the media
for this large-scale information campaign The Commission also referred to
the progress made with pilot projects initiated under the SLIM programme
on legislative legislation. This matter is due to be given a higher
profile during the November 26 Internal Market Council.

Openness in the information society.

During the debate on the Commission's proposal for a Communication on
regulatory transparency in the Internal Market for information society
services, France was the only country to bristle at the strategy being
recommended. Paris argued that the some of the services were treated in
the proposal "like pieces of merchandise". The French representative was
referring to the Commission's idea of treating on-line services,
interactive entertainment services and on-line information services as
coming within the scope of EU legislation on the free movement of goods
and not on telecommunications or the audiovisual sector. (European Report
will return to this matter in a forthcoming issue.)

Other subjects.

As the afternoon was drawing to a close, on October 25, Ministers were
still preparing to adopt a Resolution on the simplification and
rationalisation of customs rules and procedures. Ministers had already
reached an agreement on this matter prior to the Council meeting. They
were also due to give permission to the Commission to negotiate a customs
cooperation agreement with Norway, an agreement that would take account of
links this country has in this sphere with the Nordic EU countries. They
were also set to adopt without further debate a Regulation for increasing
from 30 to 100% the guarantee given by transport hauliers for
non-sensitive goods (less exposed to fraud) under the Community transit
system. This decision gave rise to an agreement on October 23 between
COREPER (the Committee of Member States' Permanent Representatives to the
EU) and the European Commission (see previous issue of European Report).
The agreement nonetheless allows certain exemptions and maintains the
guarantee at 30% for transporters above suspicion (established in the
Member States where the guarantee is given, frequent users who have always
behaved correctly, etc.).

FARM COUNCIL: BEEF DOMINATES AGENDA FOR OCTOBER 28/29 SESSION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

EU Agriculture Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg on October 28
and 29 will return to a subject which has dominated the headlines in one
way or another since March, namely beef. The Farm Council will try to
agree on a support package consisting of short-term crisis measures and
longer-term structural adaptations to help the beef sector cope with
falling demand in the wake of the BSE crisis. With a number of Member
States unwilling to back some of the more far-reaching elements in the
European Commission proposals for cutting production volumes, the
Ministers are unlikely to reach consensus without burning the customary
midnight oil. However, the financing question may prove to be the biggest
stumbling block. The European Parliament has so far refused to consider
proposals for slashing cereals aid to pay for beef support, which means
the Council cannot legally adopt them. Meanwhile, the Commission is
insisting it cannot endorse the necessary ECU 1 billion-plus of
expenditure without first balancing the books.

Commission wants balanced budget.

A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cuts
in investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and other
short-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,
estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen in
the wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure to
vote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sector
measures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for the
controversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressed
reluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing over
ECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at the
same time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.
However, a Commission spokesman insisted on October 25 that basic
agreement on the medium-term measures - designed to cut back production by
slaughtering very young calves, reducing premium rights for farmers and
lowering stocking density - would have to be reached before Ministers head
for the airport on October 29 or 30.

In fact, Franz Fischler has already given away an important bargaining
chip in agreeing to raise the Community beef intervention ceiling from
400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse public buying-in of
lighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in weight. These
decisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by Ministers at the
Fisheries Council on October 14, have taken some of the urgency out of the
issue, and the Member States' delegations may now be more inclined to hold
out for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The more
intensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium
are opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used for
calculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers and
reduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensification
premium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce the
new-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage public
opinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,
while Portugal is fighting to maintain the second premium payable on its
older, extensively-raised, bulls. (see European Report N   2158 for full
details of Member States' positions).

Problem now less urgent?

Meanwhile a report on the beef crisis drafted by experts in the
Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI), which was due to
be discussed at the Council, has been held up in the pipeline by Edith
Cresson, one of France's two Commissioners. The conclusions of the report
basically state that no further compensation should be paid to EU beef
farmers for losses incurred this year. Total producer losses since the
beef crisis began are put at just over ECU 1.1 billion for 1996. Council
has already allocated a package of Community money worth ECU 850 million,
with provisions for the Member States to match that figure with equal
national funds. Meanwhile some ECU 230 million has been brought forward
from the 1997 Budget allocation to pay advance suckler cow premia during
1996. This will have the effect of freeing up an equal amount of Community
funds to help finance beef measures next year. The French authorities are
still pushing however for extra compensation for their beef producers.

Exports booming.

On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further
31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, into
intervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcases
now in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996
intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in early
pessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Union
are now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnes
ahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked up
again. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export of
subsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when the
problem will flare up again, he warned.

Identification and labelling.

The Council will also register its initial reaction to Commission
proposals for cattle identification and beef labelling rules. The idea is
that all EU cattle should be identified by means of an eartag and personal
passport. As regards labelling, individual producers and organisations
would be authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing the
customer with detailed information on their beef products. The draft
Regulation lays down what information may appear on a label (for details
see European Report N   2163), and lays down rules for verifying the truth
of any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up and
running by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to register
its Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the legislation.

Quickfire offals proposal?

Franz Fischler has also announced he will be tabling proposals banning all
designated "sensitive tissues" from cattle and sheep from the human-animal
food chain (see separate article on mad cow disease).

Inspection Office.

Under the final main point on the Council agenda, the Ministers will look
at the long-standing proposal to set up an EU Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Inspection Office in Ireland. The proposals call for an independent agency
to take over part of the tasks currently being carried out by the Office
of Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection and Control (OVPIC) under the
auspices of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture. The
Council has been asked to approve changes to the legal structure of this
new body in order to ensure its effectiveness and speed of action. An
advance staff has already set up shop in the town of Grange in County
Meath as the site of the new Agency, but disagreements are still raging
over the status of the office, the powers to be accorded to its staff,
numbers of new veterinary personnel to be hired, and the financing for the
expanded operation. Germany believes the Agency should remain a small
operation, financed entirely from the Community Budget, rather than
obtaining its own finances from licence fees on products authorised.

Other business.

A number of Member States have tabled points they wish to discuss under
any other business:

- Austria is concerned about subsidised cattle exports from Switzerland,
which are making life hard for Austrian exporters of calves to Italy;

- the Spanish and Portuguese delegations are demanding that the Commission
draft a "reflexion paper" for wide discussion before finalising its
upcoming proposals for reform of the olive oil sector;

- France and Greece want to see the provisions for grubbing-up of apple,
pear and nectarine orchards agreed under the 1996/97 price package
implemented promptly;

- the UK and the Netherlands want to keep up the pressure for
thoroughgoing implementation of Directive 95/29/EC, safeguarding the
welfare of animals in transit, particularly as regards mandatory staging
posts and vehicle capacity;

- the Greeks want to discuss the issue of foot-and-mouth disease in Turkey;

- Portugal intends to bring to the fore the plight of farming and forestry
in arid regions;

- the Swedish delegation wants to discuss the upcoming World Food Summit,
scheduled for November 13-17, urging that further CAP reforms would
facilitate cheaper worldwide provision of food.

AMERICAN SURVEY ON FACTORS AFFECTING EUROPEAN BUSINESS FORTUNES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands are the European countries rated
as most favourable for business, according to a survey conducted by the
European Council of Chambers of Commerce (ECACC*). The ECACC members were
invited to assess factors likely to affect the development of business in
23 European countries and the Mediterranean basin. The factors include
government policies, infrastructure, employment and social security
legislation, tax systems, and the quality of life. Countries with the most
unfavourable "climates" in this respect are Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, the
Slovak Republic and Romania. ECACC members were also questioned about the
medium-term (the next five years) prospects: the UK, Belgium, Switzerland,
Italy and Germany are fairly pessimistic, believing that the economic
climate is set to get worse.

Economic factors, including government incentives, banking systems, tax
levels and rates, social security costs, employee healthcare costs,
foreign exchange rate stability and environmental policy, were most
favourable in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands and
Austria, while they were rated as unfavourable in Poland, Hungary,
Belgium, Romania and France. As for workforce-related issues, including
worker quality, labour costs, training and retraining, labour unions and
worker involvement, Ireland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Norway and Turkey were
rated highest in terms of the most favourable business environment, and
Belgium, France, Germany, Romania and Portugal came in lowest.

* Set up in 1963, ECACC represents American Chambers of Commerce in 21
countries, from Sweden to Israel and from Russia to Portugal. Some 16,000
companies (American and European) are affiliated to these Chambers of
Commerce.

MEMORANDUM TO CLEANING INDUSTRY

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Trade union and employers' representatives from the European cleaning
industry, the FENI representing employers and Euro-Fiet the trade unions,
signed a joint memorandum on new sources of employment on October 21. This
agreement is the first concerning the development of new jobs signed by
social partners within the framework of a sectorial dialogue. The European
Commissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, described the agreement as
"an innovative and realistic action marking an important step in the
shared work of the social partners". The memorandum asks public
authorities to create the conditions necessary for the exploitation of
these new sources of jobs, the cost of which is often too high for
individuals. The social partners have suggested that the Member States
introduce subsidies to develop demand on the part of individuals and
discourage work "off the books". Other mechanisms could include the
introduction of tax incentives and a reduction of the VAT rate on cleaning
services. The FENI and Euro-Fiet plan to hold a European colloquium on
this theme in early 1997, followed by Round Tables of all of the concerned
actors in the Member States.

UNICE OPPOSES ROAD USER CHARGE POLICY.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

European employers represented by UNICE do not want to see road user
charges rise for another five years, to allow time for a global assessment
of the impact of such measures. It comes as no surprise that the proposals
on goods haulage by road presented by the Union of Industrial and
Employers' Confederations of Europe in Brussels on October 22 diverged
widely from the strategy pursued by the European Commission over the past
few months. Concerned about European industry's ability to compete on the
North American and Japanese markets, UNICE claimed that other modes of
transport are not competitive enough to handle the additional freight that
would be shifted off the roads to rail, inland waterways or maritime
cabotage. "European companies, on average, pay 16% more than those in the
United States and 21% more than in Japan for transport and logistics
services", says UNICE to justify its opposition to any increase in road
taxes. The message is clear: road transport is the only mode that works
efficiently, and imposing higher taxes on it will make it more difficult
for European firms to compete and could lead to company transfers and job
losses.

EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert denied reports on BBC Radio
Five Live on October 24 that a formal investigation was under way into
alleged distortion of EU competition rules by British Satellite channel,
BskyB, over its football Premiership deal. An EU source said that the
British Broadcasting Corporation had been mistaken in its confusion

currently being made into seven-year fixed contracts for a Dutch sports

FRANCO-GERMAN STEEL TAKEOVER CLEARED

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A takeover by German stockholding and steel distribution company Klockner
Stahl and Metallhandel (KSM) of French Arus Distribution Industrielle,
which is active in the same field, was cleared by the European Commission
on October 24. KSM is indirectly wholly-owned by the German industrial
giant, VIAG. Arus was founded in December 1993 when Paris-based Arbed and
Usinor Sacilor of Luxembourg, merged their steel business. It distributes
steel products in France and Britain for industry, ironmongery,
non-ferrous metals, heating and sanitary equipment. Under the takeover
agreement, KSM will acquire 62% of the shares in Arus, 31% from each of
Arbed and Usinor. Although the remaining shares are widely dispersed, KSM
will, as a result of the deal, hold sole control over Arus.

A Commission investigation into the agreement showed that it would not
give rise to market shares above 10% in either Germany, France or Britain.
In all sectors of the steel market, the combined Arus/KSM company was also
found to be likely to face strong competition from PUM, the Cockerill
Sambre subsidiary and the largest steel stockbroker in France, as well as
a large number of other stockholders, including at least two with market
shares of over 10% for heavy sections and merchant bars.

PUBLIC AID SCHEME FOR LUXEMBOURG'S COUNTRYSIDE APPROVED.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

An aid scheme under Luxembourg's "programme for the upkeep of the
countryside and the landscape" was approved by the European Commission on
October 23. It constitutes a series of measures, financed on the one hand
by national aid, and on the other by funds from the EU's agri-environment
programme, to vineyards on steep slopes (with an inclination amounting to
more than 30%) and terraced vineyards. The total aid comes to
approximately 47,000 Luxembourg Francs and works out at about ECU 1,208
per hectare. The Commission has also said it will allow the Luxembourg
authorities to use state subsidies to finance less-intensive farming
methods which are compatible with environmental protection and the
maintenance of the countryside, before the Community part-funding arrives.

COMMISSION CLEARS STATE AID FOR GERMAN CIVIL ENGINEERING FIRM.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

German construction and civil engineering firm Schachtbau Nordhausen was
given European Commission approval on October 23 to receive state aid for
a restructuring plan which began soon after it was privatised in 1992. The
aid involves a waiving of claims on the firm totalling 3.8 million
Deutschemarks, and a four-year extension on the repayment period of a 4
million DM state loan. In authorising the aid, the Commission took account
of its role in the overhaul of "an ailing firm in an area facing
considerable economic difficulty". The unemployment rate in Nordhausen was
running at 21% at the beginning of the year.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: COMMISSIONER URGES DEREGULATION IN SPAIN BY JANUARY
1998

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Karel Van Miert, European Commissioner for Competition, sent a letter on
October 24 to the Spanish authorities, asking them formally to forgo a
five-year waiver allowed by EU legislation. Spain would therefore
undertake to completely liberalise its telecommunications industry
(services and infrastructure) by January 1, 1998. An EU-wide telecoms
deregulation agreement, which hinges on the Spanish decision, would help
give a fillip to the stalled World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks on the
worldwide deregulation of telecommunications services, stresses the
European Commission.

Exemptions.

Spain has already made clear its intention not to use the five-year
transitional period in full, but it is still seeking a 22-month stay of
grace. This would mean that not before October 1999, the date when the new
legislation on licences would be introduced, would Madrid be required to
grant permits to other vocal telephony operators. Commissioner Van Miert
is apparently ready to grant Spain extra time to introduce the licensing
legislation, but no longer than six months. This would mean that no later
than June 30, 1998, the Spanish telecoms market would be opened up to
competition. Spain is the only Member State not to formally seek a delay
for opening up the sector to competition. Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg
and Greece also enjoy this possibility and have made requests along these
lines (see table below).

The Commission stresses that Telefonica, the operator with monopoly
control over the basic vocal telephony service in Spain, is prepared to
accept liberalisation by January 1, 1998. Community sources also indicate
that the go-ahead for the merger between Telefonica and Unisource will be
not be given until Spain has officially confirmed the timetable being
sought. Unisource is jointly owned by operators from Sweden (Telia AB),
the Netherlands (PTT Telecom) and Switzerland (Sweizerische PTT-Betriebe).

Karel Van Miert cites several reasons for minimising the periods of time
covered by the exemptions. Under the terms of EU Directives regulating the
liberalisation process, transitional periods of this kind may be granted
only in the light of the sophistication of the networks. Further, the
Council of Ministers and the European Council have often stressed the
importance of a swift liberalisation process, in the interests of economic
growth and the promotion of the information society. It is also important
for the countries involved to become integrated as soon as possible into
the European telecoms market and thus be in a position to benefit from
investment and corresponding services.

WTO talks.

The Commission believes the EU-wide telecoms deregulation process will
also make a major impact on the WTO talks on telecommunications. The EU
deadline has to be as close as possible to 1998 in the Member States, as
1998 is also the target date set for liberalisation worldwide.

The WTO talks are due to end on February 15, 1997. The 53 countries taking
part in the talks should have reached an agreement last April 30, but at
the eleventh hour, the US decided to harden its position and thus
undermined the deal. The parties therefore gave themselves another nine
and a half months. The next key stage will unfold from December 9 to 13 in
Singapore, during the WTO Ministerial-level conference. In the meantime, a
high-level meeting is scheduled for November 14, after the US Presidential
elections.

Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner with the External Trade portfolio,
is hoping to use the intervening period to put the final touches to
Europe's improved offer to Geneva, with a firm commitment from Spain: this
country assumes particular importance in the WTO talks, given the size of
its domestic market and the inroads made by Telefonica in several Latin
American countries. Spain is the only country to be expressing reluctance,
according to a sources closely involved with the matter. Belgium, France,
Greece and Portugal also seemed disinclined, last March, to open up their
markets, but their doubts have now been dispelled, apparently.

Reaction from Madrid.

In a communique published on October 24, the Spanish Government confirmed
its resolve to open up Spain's telecoms sector in 1999. Rafael Arias
Sagado, Spanish Ministers for Public Works, issued a timetable, on October
9, for the programme of activities needed to ensure the telecoms markets
is fully exposed to competition. The timetable provides for the general
Law on communications to be completed in December 1997 and for the
Regulation on services and licensing procedures12 months later. The
Regulation governing the conditions for occupying the public sector is to
be adopted in the first quarter of 1999. Concrete licensing decisions are
due to be taken during the second quarter of 1999, according to the
Minister.

VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to the
Belgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the power
utility Electrabel, to force local authorities into long-term electricity
supply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,
Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales
(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) the
chance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-year
electricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,
under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contracts
lasting more than 15 years.

The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities for
a clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will have
to end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.
An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received a
letter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "in
principle" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned about
recent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning a
U-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in their
duration.

ENPA APPLAUDS GREEN PAPER ON COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Newspaper publishers represented by the European Newspaper Publishers
Association (ENPA) have cheered the approach recommended by the European
Commission in the Green Paper it published last May on commercial
communication (COM 96/192). The paper offers several guidelines for
harmonising the framework of rules on these sorts of communication (that
is advertising in all its forms) or at least for smoothing out the
national difference to some extent. The ENPA is particularly pleased about
the idea of a case-by-case probe of initiatives that European and national
authorities would be called upon to take in this realm. Subjecting the
initiatives to public scrutiny should prevent the emergence of new
obstacles, particularly in the context of the information society. ENPA
thinks that initially the country of origin rule should be strengthened
throughout the Single Market. This may be achieved by mutual recognition
of national rules. The publishers are backing the Commission's aspirations
to streamline the European legal setting. They call on the EU authorities
to take full account of the cultural diversities in the EU. The ENPA also
wants to see the Committee due to be instructed to monitor the rules
governing approximation process extended to publishers.

The ENPA is a lot more scathing about the Commission media concentration
plan. Confected by the services of Mario Monti, European Commissioner for
the Internal Market, the project is still under negotiation at the
Commission. The aim is to set a number of restrictions on media
concentrations so as to safeguard pluralism. The way the ENPA sees it, the
plan in its present form would act as a major obstacle to the future
development of local or regional publishing houses. The criteria adopted
would discourage the companies from growing as a de facto readership
threshold of 30% is imposed on any newspaper hoping to get involved in
broadcasting, according to the ENPA. Moreover, the rules being
contemplated would affect only time-honoured activities (daily newspapers,
radio and TV) and would affect the ability to develop new products and
services in the media industry.

INTERNAL AUDITORS STAKE A CLAIM IN AUDIT GREEN PAPER DEBATE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA) has
welcomed the European Commission's July 24 Green Paper on the Role,
Position and Liability of Statutory Auditors (see European Report N  
2152), but says the Commission's insistence on effective systems of
internal control as a key element of corporate governance is only a start.
"Establishing, running and maintaining an effective system of internal
control calls for skills which most managers do not possess, and which can
only be provided through a competent and professionally qualified internal
audit function", says the internal auditing profession's European body. It
goes on to call for internal audit to be made mandatory in large
organisations.

ECIIA says an "expectation gap" has opened up between what the public
expects and what current rules provide on corporate governance. But
"exclusive reliance on the statutory auditor" cannot ensure adequate
internal control, and only creates "unfulfillable expectations in the
public mind". Certification of financial statements is not enough, it
argues: a "snapshot" judgement as to whether a company has a chance of
still being able to trade twelve months ahead "is hardly up to the task of
responding fully to shareholder and creditor concerns", it says, insisting
on the need for more systematic measurement - via an internal audit
function - of more reliable business performance indicators. Similarly,
the best way of dealing with fraud is by prevention rather than detection,
ECIIA argues - again pointing to the role of internal audit.

Above all, ECIIA says - contrary to the Commission's view - that boards of
directors are not in a position to respond to public concern over the need
for effective control. This is largely a day-to-day matter more properly
in the realm of management, the internal auditors claim. And any control
system put in place without an adequate review system "will probably fail
at critical points", warns ECIIA.

STATE AID: COMMISSION REJECTS TAX BREAK SCHEME FOR ITALIAN ROAD HAULIERS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Tax credits worth ECU 466 million for Italian road hauliers in 1993 and
1994 were rejected by the European Commission on October 23 as
incompatible with EU state aid rules. The scheme operated on the basis of
payments of a fixed percentage, up to a certain maximum, of the cost
(minus VAT) of fuel and lubricants, calculated according to the weight of
the vehicle, to travel within Italy.

Under the scheme, Italian legislation provided for a system of tax credits
for Italian road hauliers operating for other people (i.e. not on their
own account), and for a system of compensation for non-Italian EU hauliers
(who are compensated for the fuel they use in travelling on Italian
territory). In 1992, the Commission started formal state aid proceedings
against the Italian State regarding a similar credit scheme in operation
that year, and found the aid to be incompatible with the Treaty. Two years
later, the Commission took Italy to the European Court of Justice for
failing to observe its Decision.

But the Italians continued with their tax incentives for road hauliers.
The credit schemes proposed for 1993 and 1994 are in all but terms of
budget, ceilings and application periods the same as those already
outlawed by the Commission; the only new element is the compensation for
non-Italian EU hauliers. A formal state aid investigation into the
1993/1994 scheme under Article 93(2) of the Treaty was opened in October
1995.

The Commission inquiry has found the scheme incompatible with the Treaty
on the grounds that it is an operating aid that is not offered as part of
a restructuring plan for the sector. It does not, therefore, fill any of
the conditions for exemptions to the Treaty's state aid rules. All aid
already paid out has been ordered to be recovered by the Italian
authorities.

COMMISSION RE-OPENS SECURIPOST STATE AID CASE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European Commission investigation into allegedly illegal state aid to
French transport and security company, Securipost, prior to its
privatisation in 1993, was re-opened on October 23. The decision was made
following a September1995 ruling by the European Court of Justice that the
Commission had not taken sufficient account of a complaints by the Chambre
syndicale nationale des entreprises de fonds et de valeurs (French union
for investment funds, stock brokers and other financial service firms),
known as Sytravel, and the company, Brink's France.

The French Government will be asked to provide information in particular
on compensation payments to civil servants made redundant as a result of
the privatisation plan, and an apparent failure by Securipost to pay
social security contributions towards state unemployment benefit funds.
There are also suspicions that the French authorities may have made a
direct capital investment of FF15 million to Securipost in 1989. At the
specific request of the Court of Justice, the Commission has said it will
also carry out further investigations into fees charged by Securipost for
its services to the French national post office. Paris has one month to
reply to the allegations

FRENCH R&D SUBSIDIES FOR STEEL INDUSTRY APPROVED

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

French Government subsidies for two steel industry research and
development projects were approved by the European Commission on October
23. The first, a project dubbed "Myosotis", is being carried out at
Isbergues, in the Pas-de-Calais region, in collaboration with the German
group Thyssen, through a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), and
relates to a continuous thin-strip casting process. It is expected to cost
a total of FF 96 million and cover a three-year period (1995-97). Under a
scheme known as "Major Innovative Projects" the project will be 50%
financed by the French steel company Uscinor Sacilor, which will receive
FF 12 million from the French State.

The other project, covering an equivalent period, to be carried out at the
Maizi
res and Gondrange works by IRSID, a Usinor Sacilor subsidiary, is
designed to adapt steel-making processes for use with scrap, and in
particular to adapt electric furnaces to new sources of iron. To be known
as the "steelworks of the future", it is intended to make optimum use of
energy and find solutions to the environmental hazards caused by the large
amounts of scrap metal in France and other Member States. The project,
which will cost a total of FF 76.5 million, is at the applied research
stage and will receive aid of FF 17.5 million.

STATE AID: GREEN LIGHT FOR TWO OUT OF THREE SPANISH OPEL PLANT SUBSIDIES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Two 1994 state subsidies granted by the Spanish region of Aragon to Opel's
Saragossa plant were given European Commission retroactive approval on
October 23. The Commission said the aid, which was intended to help
towards the production of the new Tigra sports model, was compatible with
rules for state aid to the motor industry. A third aid injection to the
General Motors-owned German car maker, from the same year, but for a
different sector of the plant, was turned down by the Commission, and
ordered to be repaid.

The permitted aid consisted firstly of a grant of 100 million Pesetas
towards an overall investment of 1,326 million for the introduction of
new, more sophisticated technology at the plant, and secondly, of a grant
of 68 million Pesetas towards total costs of 340 million Pesetas to train
the 500 employees to use the new technology. The third aid injection, a
grant of 200 million Pesetas towards the development of new software
equipment at a total cost of 1,300 million Pesetas, was rejected on the
grounds that it did not comply with EU criteria for state aid to the motor
industry. In a statement, the Commission said it has since received
assurances from the Spanish authorities that the 161 million Pesetas
already granted to the firm would be recovered.

Opel Spain is wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors Spain. In 1993,
the Saragossa headquarters produced two Opel models, the Corsa and the
Astra, and had a turnover of 465 billion Pesetas, with net profits of 19
billion. Production of the Tigra model began in 1994 when the state aid
was granted.

VAN MIERT MEETS GERMAN SKET DELEGATION OVER NEW AID PLAN

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A new restructuring plan for German heavy machinery giant SKET is soon to
be submitted to the European Commission for approval, a meeting between a
delegation from the company and EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert revealed on October 23. A former flagship of East German industry,
SKET Schwermaschinenbau Magdeburg, based in Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, went
into financial receivership in mid-October. A Commission spokesman said Mr
Van Miert was "concerned with the situation, and prepared to analyse a new
plan with the same understanding he has already shown to SKET".

The Commission opened a formal investigation in March 1995 over
approximately DM 957 million worth of state aid to the troubled company.
The procedure was extended in July 1996 when additional measures worth DM
352 million were announced after the original privatisation plan
floundered (see European Report N   2153). SKET's recent efforts to restore
profitability have amounted to a reduction in costs of DM 31 million, but
the Commission is still doubtful about its chances of long-term viability
- something which a new plan must ensure if it is to be approved. Brussels
also suspects that some of the aid may have been used to cover SKET's
operating costs or to sell products at dumping prices. SKET owns 120 small
supply companies, and is currently under the control of the Bundesanstalt
fur vereiningungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BvS) - the German public agency
for special tasks related to reunification. Although there is no official
deadline for the formal submission of the plan, German Government sources
have said they hope it will be drawn up by the end of the year.

COMPETITION: COURT REJECTS COMMISSION EUROTUNNEL CONTRACT DECISION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European Commission decision nearly two years ago to force French and
British railway companies, Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF), and
British Rail (BR) to give 25% of the Channel Tunnel's capacity to third
party operators (case T-79/T-80/95) was rejected by the European Court of
First Instance on October 22, on the grounds that it was based on a
factual error. In a statement, the Court said it had found the Commission
to have made a "profound error of judgement" over the interpretation of
the usage contract governing access to the tunnel.

A fixed rail link beneath the English Channel between Frethen in
Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Cheriton in Kent, was born of an agreement signed
on February 12, 1986 by the French and British Governments. On March14,
1996, two private companies, Channel Tunnel Group, and France Manche,
secured the concession to build and operate the Channel Tunnel,
establishing a joint-venture company under the name of 'Eurotunnel'. The
concession, which was originally for 55 years, but later extended to 65
years in 1994, provided for half the Channel Tunnel capacity to be
reserved for passenger and goods trains between Britain and continental
Europe. SNCF and BR were to be entitled to retain full use of their share
of the capacity, on the condition that they arranged for the maximum
number of trains possible, provided adequate national railway
infrastructure (including for high-speed trains), and maintained their
payments to Eurotunnel - including a share of upkeep and maintenance.

But, after receiving comments from the interested parties, the Commission
ruled on December 13, 1994 that the way the usage contract was structured
allowed BR and SNCF to hold 100% of hourly paths available for
international freight, and that it was an infringement of Article 85 of
the EU Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. It imposed a condition
on the two companies by which they would be required to make available 25%
of the hourly capacity of the tunnel to competitors. SNCF and BR contested
the Commission's Decision and lodged complaints at the Court of Justice on
March 7 and March 8, 1995 respectively. On October 22, they successfully
convinced the Court that third parties have always had access to the
Channel Tunnel, and that they had never had any intention to secure more
than 50% of international capacity. Since the Commission Decision has been
in place, no parties have actually come forward to exercise the right to
the remaining 25%, which is now no longer likely to be applicable,
following the Court's ruling. Meanwhile, loss-making Eurotunnel said on
October 22 that it would shed 657 jobs in an attempt to improve its
competitiveness.

EIB EURO-BOND ISSUE IN SPAIN.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Investment Bank is preparing the first Peseta-denominated
bond issue in Spain intended for small savers. "Bonos Europeos" will be
available in Spain from October 28 to November 15. Some 20 savings banks
and commercial banks, with more than 15,000 agencies in the country, will
offer for subscription 40 billion Pesetas worth of EIB bonds for a nominal
value of 10,000 Pesetas (ECU 62). The bonds are for 10 years and carry a
six-month interest rate of 7% (annual rate of 7.12%). The managing
underwriters are guaranteeing individual investors liquidity of the bonds
within 24 hours. The issue will be jointly managed by the Caja de Madrid,
Banco Central Hispano and Banco de Santander. The bond issue will
strengthen cooperation between the EIB and the Spanish banking sector and
allow the Bank scope for continuing to diversify its system for collecting
Peseta-denominated resources, according to the Bank. In Spain, the Bank
has helped along the development of the "Matador" market (bond market for
non-resident issuers of Peseta-denominated bonds) by its continuing
presence as a borrower of large amounts of funding. Between 1988 and 1995,
the EIB launched 38 issues and managed to collect over 750,000 million
Pesetas. Since the start of the year, it has raised over 200 billion.

MILD IMPROVEMENT IN CONFIDENCE INDICATOR IN JULY/AUGUST

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Confidence in the economic outlook improved slightly between July and
August, according to a European Commission survey conducted among company
managers and consumer and published on October 21. The figures show that
the period of zero growth is drawing to a close, even though economic
indicators are still below the long-term average.

Figures for August show that companies prepared to step up production in
the coming months outnumber those who expect to do the opposite.
Nonetheless, EU industry orderbooks are far from full and exports continue
to be too low. The level of durable stocks is also considered excessive in
terms of demand for industrial products. The outlook is less bleak in
terms of the predicted level of orders and growth in exports. Industry is
also counting on increased output in the near future. This mild
improvement will not make any immediate effect on employment in the
industrial sector, though. EU industry's utilisation capacity was running
at 80.8% in July, which is much the same as the level reported in the
previous quarter. As for consumers, they are now less pessimistic about
their own financial circumstances and future developments.

TAXATION: COMMISSION WORRIED ABOUT GERMAN CAR INCENTIVES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Should Germany be allowed to provide tax incentives now for cars that
already meet the next round of vehicle emission standards recommended
under the Auto Oil air quality programme, which are still only at the
proposal stage? As the matter has now taken an almost exclusive political
turn (with "mistakes" being committed by all sides), it will be up to
European Commissioners to give an answer to the question, during their
October 30 meeting. On top of the political irritant, there are a series
of legal "hitches" that can be traced right back to the complex
compromises that preceded the adoption of the last Directive on motor
vehicle pollution.

The European Commission sent a letter to the German authorities last
September 23 to notify them that their draft Bill intended to allow lower
road taxes for cars that are more environmentally-friendly than required
by the standards in the Auto Oil proposals (tabled by the European
Commission on June 18) were out of step with EU legislation (see European
Report N   2161). Germany meekly withdrew its proposed Bill and it was
thought that was the end of the matter. Determined to press on with their
tax breaks, the German authorities soon tabled a new Bill and this too
offered tax incentives starting in 1997 but they are supposed to apply to
cars that comply with the standards provided in the Auto Oil proposals.
The Bill is therefore based on standards that are less strict than in the
previous plan.

They might, however, turn out to be too strict for the Commission's taste.
The matter is nevertheless still a highly controversial one. Article 3 of
Directive 94/12/EC (on motor vehicle pollution) certainly argues the case
for a unfavourable opinion from the Commission: it proposes that Member
States may provide tax incentives only for vehicles complying with the
requirements in this same Directive (the standards in the German Bill
extend beyond the confines of the Directive and are based on a proposal
that has still not been adopted by the EU Member States, far from it).
However Article 4 of Directive 94/12 argues the case for retaining the
German Bill: it specifies that the Commission and industry have to consult
under the Auto Oil programme in order for the Commission to recommend a
further tightening of the standards before the end of 1994 and that these
proposals should be adopted by the Council of Ministers before the end of
1996. Even though the Commission is not entirely to blame, the Auto Oil
proposals in the end were not presented until mid-1996 and have yet to be
adopted. There are therefore grounds for considering that Germany could
legitimately expect to be able to introduce, starting on January 1, 1997,
tax incentives for cars that are cleaner than required by the 94/12
standards (the Auto Oil proposals envisage the same kind of article as
Article 3 in the Directive 94/12).

Faced with the politico-technical conundrum, the Commission is feeling
extremely uncomfortable about the idea of refusing to allow Germany to
press on with its plan. "The Commission might well decide not to run the
risk of being taken by Germany to the EU Court of Justice for
non-observance of Article 4 of Directive 94/12", according to officials
closely involved with the matter. Admittedly, Article 4 made it possible,
when the Directive was being adopted, to rally the support of certain
countries which have long been more to the fore on the environmental
protection front. But is also completely unrealistic, in that it leaves
the Commission only a few months in which to define its position in the
face of the powerful interests of the motor industry and the oil industry.

TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGY
SOURCES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before the
end of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineral
oils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,
coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If the
proposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council of
Finance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties on
mineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those Member
States that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2
tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now to
win acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,
on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on the
principle than actual tax rates, has already created "very serious
tensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.

Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set excise
duties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed in
ECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-free
petrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineral
oils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too
(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for these
products at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among the
Member States within the Single Market to prevent distortions of
competition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectives
in adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.

* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg

* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg

* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres

* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litres

Commission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, not
only to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards a
closer approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to be
ineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according to
experts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-border
shopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies in
other areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax has
foundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but not
so high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by the
Commissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological and
practical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.
Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to ten
years, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III
(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (Internal
Market) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.

Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Community
minimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)
impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that are
equivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These Member
States would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to comply
with the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose the
proposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose rates
are already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give Member
States with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making excise
duties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing up
the concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with a
positive impact in terms of environmental protection.

These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission to
broaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties to
include other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.
The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for the
principle of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as a
first step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 tax
proposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in this
proposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structure
of excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)
and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still held
up in the Council).

COMMISSION ADOPTS TAX SYSTEMS REPORT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European "code of good conduct" has to be developed to prevent national
tax policies continuing to be threatened by too much fiscal competition
between Member States, said European Commissioner for Taxation Mario
Monti, when presenting on October 22 the report the European Commission
had just adopted on the development of tax systems (see previous issue of
European Report for further details).

The erosion of the tax base is the main problem singled out by the
Commission, which recommends setting up a high-level forum, or a "Fiscal
Policy Committee" that with its overview of policies would work on
developing a code of good conduct for use by the Member States. "It is not
the proposals that are lacking, it is a consensus that is missing", Mr
Monti stressed once again, referring to the numerous proposals that seek
to complete the European fiscal area but have been held up in the EU
Council of Ministers for many years owing to the rule on unanimous voting.
"Nowadays it is much more often the markets, and no longer the Member
States, that are sovereign", he lamented, calling for greater coordination
between the Member States. "If the countries were to exercise this
sovereignty together, they might then be able to recover it from the
markets". He urged the Member States to coordinate their fiscal policies
more.

Minimising tax evasion, ensuring the smooth functioning of the Single
Market, promoting employment and environmental protection are just some of
the main themes in this report due to be presented to EU government
leaders at their December 13/14 Summit in Dublin. It will first be
examined by EU Finance Ministers in November. The report argues the need
to reverse the current trend towards an increasing burden on labour.

EMPLOYMENT: PARLIAMENT APPROVES NEW LABOUR MARKET POLICY COMMITTEE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The proposal for a Council Decision to set up an "Employment and Labour
Market Policy Committee" was endorsed by the European Parliament's plenary
session in Strasbourg on October 24. The report by Ioannis Theonas (EUL,
Greece), which formed the basis for the Parliament's Opinion, recognises
that such a Committee would remedy a deficiency by creating an official
and stable structure charged with monitoring employment policy and the
implementation of multi-annual programmes.

The Parliament believes this Committee should strengthen coordination
between the employment policies of the different Member States. It should
also participate in preparatory work on the annual report on the
employment situation and the joint report submitted to the European
Council.

The creation of a Committee similar to the Economic Policy Committee set
up in 1974, with the objective of promoting the coordination of Member
States' short- and long-term economic policies, was first proposed at the
informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers in October 1995. Since March
1995, monitoring of the employment situation has been the responsibility
of the ad hoc group of personal representatives of Labour and Employment
Ministers. However, this group has encountered difficulties in fulfilling
the task assigned to it, because of the lack of resources at its disposal.

The European Commission believes the Committee should serve to: - monitor
employment trends in the EU;

- examine Member States' employment and labour market policies;

- exchange information and experience between the Member States and with
the Commission;

- prepare reports and recommendations on these questions; and

- draw up an annual comparative report on the employment situation in the
Member States and the policies followed by the latter.

A preliminary agreement on setting up the new Committee was secured at the
Social Affairs Council on September 24, and should be ratified at the
December 2 Council (see European Report N   2160 for further details).

EMI TO UNVEIL EURO BANKNOTES THIS YEAR

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Monetary Institute is expected to unveil the new Euro
banknotes this year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy announced on
October 22. These banknotes will begin circulating on January 1, 2002 at
the latest. The EMI, precursor to the future European Central Bank,
launched a competition to design the Euro in mid-February, restricted to
artists specialising in the design of banknotes and designated by the
Central Banks of the European Union Member States. The final choice must
be approved by the EMI Council, which is composed of the Governors of the
15 Central Banks of the European Union, at a meeting later this year,
although no date has yet been set, Institute sources in Frankfurt said.
The EMI has received 44 proposed designs for the Euro. "I believe that we
will be able to announce the result of the selection process this year",
Mr Lamfalussy told a gathering of German businessmen.

A committee of specialists chose two themes for the future currency:
European historical periods and styles, and modern or abstract designs. Mr
Lamfalussy indicated that the first theme had been used in 27 of the
designs. A spokesman for the EMI explained that every aspect of each entry
is now being examined to determine whether it meets the criteria laid
down. Each denomination (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 or 500) must bear the
name of the currency, the initials of the European Central Bank in five
languages (BCE, ECB, EZB, EKB, EKP) and the stars symbolising the European
Union. The notes must also incorporate the latest anti-counterfeiting
technology (a watermark, a security thread that turns black on
photocopies, colour-changing inks) and be easily distinguishable by the
visually impaired.

POLE TO HEAD EAST EUROPE BRANCH OF COLLEGE OF EUROPE.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, well-known in Brussels as Poland's chief negotiator
- until just weeks ago - with the EU, has been appointed as Rector of the
College of Europe in Natolin, on the outskirts of Warsaw. He will take up
his appointment at the start of 1997. The College in Natolin was set up
two years ago, largely with PHARE programme funding, to provide a sister
establishment to the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, but with a
particular focus on Central and Eastern Europe. The 60+ students who
follow postgraduate European studies courses there each year come from
most EU and EFTA countries, most of the Central and East European
countries, and from countries in the former USSR. The teaching faculty
includes eminent visiting lecturers from across Europe and from Polish
political, administrative and academic circles. There is to be an official
opening ceremony for the College on November 6.

ECSC: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SEEKS REVISIONS IN DRAFT 1997 BUDGET

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission's draft 1997 Operating Budget for the European
Coal and Steel Community, which cuts all items of expenditure except aid
for research, should be modified to fall in line with Parliament requests,
especially those concerning continuing ECSC aid for redeployment,
restructuring and research. Such were the conclusions of a Resolution on
the Budget adopted without amendment by the Parliament in plenary session
on October 24.

The Parliament is anxious to ensure that the necessary measures are taken
to prepare for the period after 2002, when the ECSC Treaty will expire,
and in the meantime that existing credits are used as wisely as possible.
In its Resolution, the Parliament said that the proposed operating budget
of ECU 265.5 million - an increase of ECU 24.5 million over the 1996 one -
is inconsistent with the run-down of activities implied by the plan to
phase out the Treaty. Also, noting that real needs estimated by the
Commission are of the order of ECU 172 million rather than ECU 265.5
million, the Parliament contests the Commission's decision to set aside
surplus revenue appropriations of ECU 93.5 million - almost the total sum
of resources derived from the levy on companies in the coal and steel
sectors - as a reserve for the successor body to the ECSC. For the
Parliament, the proposed Budget represents an imbalance between available
resources and requirements and, by containing a provisions for subsequent
financing, runs counter to the principle of an annual budget.

In its Resolution, the Parliament proposes increasing the sums allotted
for redeployment aid (from 56 to ECU 60 million), research (from 82 to ECU
91 million), conversion aid (from 7 to ECU 11 million) and social measures
in the coal industry (from 22 to ECU 26 million). It would also provide
ECU 5 million for the preparation of a successor body to the ECSC while
reducing the proposed reserve for this organisation from ECU 93.5 million
to ECU 67.5 million.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL: AGENDA STRETCHES FROM CUBA TO SINGAPORE, VIA
AFRICA AND RUSSIA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg on October 28
and 29 has a full agenda, with decisions expected on international trade
matters - notably the anti-Helms/Burton law measures and the preparations
for the WTO Ministerial meeting in Singapore in December, on international
political matters - notably in the Middle East and former Yugoslavia, and
on crucial EU affairs including progress with the Inter-Governmental
Conference and with the preparations for Eastern enlargement of the
European Union.

The EU's response to the US Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislation is almost
ready. The Council will be asked to decide on the "blocking statute" - a
draft Council Regulation and a draft Joint Action - which would together
protect against the effects of third-country (for which, read "US")
legislation on EU trade with third countries (for which read "Cuba",
"Iran" and "Libya"). The draft EU measures are subject to some questions
still - with reservations on specific questions from the UK, Germany and
Spain (principally, non-compliance, recovery of damages, and scope), and
with Denmark opposed to the entire legal base of the draft Regulation. But
the Presidency says that discussions have now reached a point where it is
up to Ministers to take a decision. The European Parliament was expected
to give its Opinion on the proposals on October 25.

The Middle East features in several of the agenda items: the Council will
examine the Middle East peace process in the light of recent EU and Member
State contacts there, and will discuss the possible appointment of an EU
envoy in the region - although no precise EU view has yet been established
of an envoy's role or status (unofficial candidates are being discussed
already, however, with an informal short list including the Spanish
Ambassador to Israel, and a number of Italian and Swedish names); European
Commissioner for relations with Mediterranean countries Manuel Marin will
report orally on negotiations for a Euro-Mediterranean Association
Agreement with Egypt; the Council will be asked to adopt the common
position on the 10th session of the Cooperation Council with Egypt - which
will take place on October 28 at midday (see separate article in Section
V); and over the following a lunch broader political issues will be
discussed.

On the Inter-Governmental Conference, the Council will look particularly
at external action of the EU under the headings of Common Foreign and
Security Policy, external economic relations, and security and defence,
where the Presidency is seeking political direction from Ministers (see
separate article in this issue). The Ministers are planning an exchange of
views with the President of the European Parliament, but no formal
discussion of the recent Franco-German proposal on closer cooperation (see
Document with this issue of European Report) is planned by the Presidency,
which has merely noted the paper as one of several contributions to the
IGC discussions, but is taking no view of it. The Member States' personal
representatives will discuss flexibility at their own IGC meeting in
Luxembourg on October 29.

Ministers will also meet their counterparts from the ten applicants from
Central and Eastern Europe on October 29, with talks focusing on progress
in the pre-accession strategy, the IGC, and - over lunch - current
international issues, particularly former Yugoslavia and Russia.

Other matters up for examination at the Council include:

- progress in establishing an EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and
Xenophobia (although no decision will emerge until later this year);

- former Yugoslavia, with a report from the EU's High Representative
there, Carl Bildt, on the postponement of elections and other recent
developments, as well as discussion and probable adoption of Conclusions
on a regional approach for EU relations with South Eastern Europe and on
policy guidelines for EU input into upcoming international meetings on
former Yugoslavia;

- the probable adoption of EU guidelines for upcoming meetings of the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe;

- support for transition to democracy in Zaire (with a Belgian-inspired
discussion on the recent developments in the Great Lakes region); and

- the probable adoption of Conclusions setting out guidelines on EU
preparation for the WTO Ministerial meeting in Singapore on December 9-13
(with discussion focusing on trade in relation to labour standards,
tariffs, textiles, environment and investment). The Council will hear a
progress report on the telecommunications talks and consider the
newly-proposed mandate for the EU to begin negotiations with major trading
partners on an international Information Technology Agreement (see last
issue of European Report).

The Council is also scheduled to sign a Framework Agreement with South
Korea (see last issue of European Report). And the Council is expected to
decide on suspending trade concessions for Burma under the Generalised
System of Preferences (see separate article on the European Parliament's
Resolution).

IGC '96: MEPS WARY OF DUBLIN SUMMIT OUTCOME

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Members of the European Parliament are expressing doubts about the outcome
of the special EU Summit hosted by the Irish Presidency on October 5 in
Dublin to try and inject some impetus into the negotiations on
institutional reform ahead of the EU's expansion to the East. In a
Resolution adopted on October 23 in Strasbourg by 328 to 34 with 83
abstentions, MEPs noted that EU government leaders had oft-repeated their
commitment to ensuring the Inter-Governmental Conference on the Maastricht
Treaty review is concluded next June in Amsterdam. However, MEPs want to
ensure that this should not serve as an excuse for scaling down the
ambitions. Meanwhile, the Franco-German proposals for ways of promoting
closer cooperation between small groups of countries has been given a
cautious welcome in some EU quarters. Personal representatives of Foreign
Ministers are due to consider the proposals on October 30 in the context
of the IGC. (European Report is publishing, as a supplement to this issue,
a full version of the Franco-German proposals on greater cooperation.)

Tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, the Parliamentary
Resolution expresses concern about the EU's Summit's failure to move
forward on institutional reforms. The European Commission's President, who
was there to take part in the Parliamentary debate, agreed that "the
positions adopted by the delegations were still a far cry from what is
needed" and a great deal of progress had yet to be made in this area. The
Parliament nonetheless applauds the EU's resolve to stick to the timetable
and in particular to round the talks off next June in Amsterdam. However,
MEPs call for the draft Treaty, due to be presented by the Irish
Presidency prior to the EU Summit in Dublin, to "demonstrate the Union's
capacity to acquire instruments adequate to the important commitments it
will have to fulfill in the near future".

Generally speaking, the Parliament has stressed its commitment to the idea
of introducing a Treaty chapter on employment, adopting effective measures
to provide the EU with a Common Foreign and Security Policy and creating a
genuine Euro-wide policy based on internal security and freedom. The
Resolution underscores the need for decisions to be take by EU Heads of
State and Government when they gather for the next European Council in
Dublin, on December 13/14. Several MEPs in the Socialist, Christian
Democrat, Liberal and Green camps are leaning on the Member States'
governments to make a commitment soon to a full-blown public debate on the
EU reform process.

In the wake of an amendment tabled at the last minute, the Parliament gave
its reaction to the Franco-German plan to introduce a "general clause on
closer cooperation" allowing those who wish and have the ability to do so,
to move at a faster pace towards economic and political integration. The
Parliament judges that "any increased cooperation under the various
pillars must be achieved with due regard for the institutional framework,
the acquis communautaire and the objectives of the Union and must be open
to all Member States at any time".

Caution and flexibility.

The Franco-German idea of having a Maastricht Treaty clause to allow
certain countries to improve their cooperation in certain areas has been
given a cautious welcome. The Member States and the Commission are
planning to go through the proposal with a fine tooth comb. "The issue of
flexibility is one of the more importance ones to emerge from the
Inter-Governmental Conference. There is a strong feeling that there is a
need for something in this area, but there is also a very strong feeling
that this matter has to be given cautious consideration", Noel Dorr, the
current IGC Chairman, opined on October 22. During initial talks about the
flexibility proposals, several Member States voiced fears about the risk
of the Single Market being undermined. In Commission circles, the feeling
is that the text, which still has to be converted into articles (and this
will take some time), is going in the right direction.

The Commission has several reasons to be pleased. First of all the French
and Germans are seeking to apply enhanced cooperation in areas where
unanimous decision-making is required.

Second, the flexibility strategy is bracketed by stringent principles,
such as the need to retain the single institutional framework: no Member
State would enjoy a right of veto, no Member State would be excluded, and
there must be full respect for the EU's legislative achievements, for
Community law and the Treaty objectives. These principles would be
guaranteed by verification procedures enforced by the EU Court of Justice,
in particular, acting in response to a request from a Member State not
taking part in the enhanced cooperation.

A third reason to be pleased is the Franco-German determination not to
tamper with the Single Market: the flexibility strategy would not apply to
the EU legislative achievements and therefore to the Internal Market and
common polices. In the case of the first pillar, the Franco-German plan
stresses that "the need to list the possible areas would have to be
examined". The idea has been proposed for the flexibility approach to be
used, for example, by Economic and Monetary Union participants to converge
their tax laws, indeed even their compulsory levy systems, if unanimity
voting is to continue in these two areas by the end of the IGC. France and
Germany's partners believe the system has the major drawback of imposing
rules on those who intend to join the Euro zone at a later date, without
having allowed the newcomers to have their say.

Another advantage of the flexibility strategy is that in the context of
the Common Foreign and Security Policy and defining a common defence
policy, enhanced forms of cooperation may help to take account, without
necessarily having too suffer the consequences, of the specific
circumstances of certain Member States and in particular of the neutrality
of the Nordic countries, Ireland and Austria. The Franco-German plan
proposes to set a minimum threshold of Member States for implementing the
closer cooperation plan.

As far as France and Germany are concerned, the flexibility would be
another kettle of fish in the context of Maastricht's third pillar
(cooperation between the courts and police forces, immigration, right of
asylum, visas, combating drug-trafficking and crime). In this broad policy
area, the Franco-German plan envisages measures to slacken the system for
Conventions so that they would be able to come into effect after a certain
number of ratifications by the Member States (and solely for the States
having ratified according to a threshold to be set on a case-by-case basis
as well as scope for concluding Conventions with less than 15 countries,
thus committing only States that are parties to the Convention) and the
implementation of operational measures and material cooperation between
certain Member States.

The Franco-German plan certainly has its appeal, not least in the way it
seeks to prevent Community activities from being thrown into a state of
paralysis. However, the closer cooperation idea raises a series of
questions of a technical nature that have to be debated before being able
to be included in the Treaty. It also raises the fundamental question of
how the system will operate. Instead of providing a coherent view of
Europe, the numerous alliances could, on the contrary, end up by creating
disorder. The Member States would all be able to live under the same roof
- the European Union - but would proceed at different speeds. In theory,
and here were are looking some way into the future, countries joining the
single currency will not necessarily be the same ones taking part in
military operations in the Middle East, say, nor those who have
established an area in which people may move without obstruction. Against
this background, what will become of the family spirit and in particular
the financial solidarity on which the European Community is built? The
Franco-German plan still has to be spelled out in a bit more detail, but
it is possible to see that the initiative could act like a tonic on the
institutional negotiations: if it creates enough fear, it may induce the
Member States to be more ambitious about extending qualified majority
voting, to which the Germans and French are in theory still committed.

1997 EU BUDGET: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF ECU 800
MILLION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

On October 24, the European Parliament in first reading proposed an
increase of some ECU 800 million to the draft European Union General
Budget for 1997 adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in July. Payment
appropriations emerge from the Parliament's first reading at ECU 82.514
billion, compared with the 81.646 billion voted by the Council. The
increase advocated by MEPs would chiefly benefit spending linked to the
functioning of the Internal Market - with an additional ECU 300 million
for the trans-European networks - research and development, the Northern
Ireland peace programme and external relations.

The European Parliament subscribed to the principal amendments tabled by
its Committee on Budgets on reports by the Dutch MEP Laurens Jan
Brinkhorst (on the General Budget and the European Commission's Budget)
and the Spanish Member Juan Manuel Fabra Valles (on the Budgets of other
institutions - see separate article on the ECSC Operating Budget). The
Parliament has chosen not to question the horizontal reduction of ECU 1
billion in farm spending sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, excluding
exceptional spending on the beef and veal sector and costs linked to the
BSE crisis, and in Structural Fund spending except for the less-developed
regions of the Community.

By contrast, the Parliament exercised its rights within the limits of the
financial perspectives, and voted to re-enter credits on internal policies
linked to the internal market and on external relations, revoked be the
Council during its first reading. In respect of internal policies, the
MEPs have chosen to put in reserve ECU 300 million including ECU 73
million in a negative reserve to cover funding for the 14 priority
transport projects and the IVth Framework Programme of Research and
Development, and ECU 100 million for the Northern Ireland peace programme.
This accounting trick should enable funds to be lifted from current lines
in Section 3 of the Budget. MEPs also expanded budget lines on things such
as the environment, consumer protection, equal opportunities, information
and communication, anti-fraud measures and transport, for which the
Council had approved deep cuts (see table below).

Turning to external relations, the MEPs voted through a ECU 335 million
increase in payment appropriations over draft Budget approved by the
Council. Among others, this increase will benefit the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe and the former USSR, Mediterranean and Latin American
countries and cooperation with non-governmental organisations. The
Parliament voted to withhold aid intended for Turkey (ECU 53 million for
the EU/Turkey Customs Union and ECU 3.5 million for technical measures).
As regards the appropriation for the MEDA programme of assistance to
Mediterranean third countries, of which Turkey is just one beneficiary,
the Parliament and the European Commission have agreed to finance projects
linked to promoting democracy and respect for human rights and
strengthening civilian structures in Turkish society. By contrast, the
Parliament complied with a Commission request and rejected projects
intended for South-Eastern Anatolia. A working party made up of 5 MEPs and
the European Commissioners Manuel Marin (Relations with Mediterranean
States) and Hans van den Broek (External Political Relations) will be set
up to exercise prior control over projects the Commission proposes to
finance in Turkey in 1997. Finally, the European Parliament took a scythe
to the Common Foreign and Security Policy line.

The Budgets of EU institutions, and in particular the Commission, have
emerged from the Parliament's first reading with a number of
modifications. MEPs decided to put in reserve 26% of remuneration for
Commission officials, in order to force restructuring of the
Directorate-General for Enterprise Policy, Tourism and the Social Economy
(DG XXIII), following the scandals that have sullied the Tourism Unit.
They also voted to put in reserve 50% of the credits allocated to the
Directorate-General for Information and Communication (DG X) to force it
to review its information policy. Discipline demands, the institutions
will not increase their personnel next year. However, in order to
guarantee the proper functioning of the institutions, the Assembly
approved a recommendation from Mr Fabra Valles, and voted to increase by
ECU 1.37 million the overall amount allocated to the Council of Ministers,
the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social
Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the joint ESC/CoR structure.
This increase will finance measures involving personnel at the Court of
justice (ECU 154,000 on ECU 1.138 million), the ESC (ECU 16,486 on 90,158)
and the joint organisational structure (ECU 55,000 on 142,348).

These sums are not final. The Council of Ministers can reinstate a more
austere Budget in its second reading on November 19. However in respect of
so-called non-compulsory spending (with the exception of agriculture), the
MEPs will have the last word in December. Between the two readings, the
Parliament hopes to succeed in negotiating two agreements with the Council
and the Commission. The first concerns the forty budget lines that
correspond to pilot projects and Community programmes whose credits are
not allocated for want of a legislative act of the Council. The second
concerns the financing of EU fisheries agreements with third countries, on
which the Parliament is anxious to have its say.

Criticism of the execution of the 1996 Budget.

The European Parliament has also adopted a highly critical resolution on
the execution of the 1996 Budget, tabled by British Conservative MEP James
Elles. The Assembly criticises the wretched quality of budget forecasts in
the farming sector, denounces the poor rate of execution of the Structural
Funds budget, and disapproves of the Commission's deliberate refusal to
enact articles concerning the promotion of inter-regional cooperation
actions and the centre for enterprise and innovation, on the grounds that
similar actions could be financed through the structural funds. MEPs have
also expressed concerns over the slow-down in the execution of the budget
of Community actions supporting peace in the Middle East and has called on
the Commission, without delay, to provide information on the planned use
of credits covering special aid to refugees in the Republics of the former
Yugoslavia.

Governments Have Lost Control of International Trade

International trade is growing twice as fast as most
countries domestic GNP. Eastern Europe is rapidly moving
toward a market economy. Communications networks are the
railroads of the future; allowing value-added transactions to
move across borders unmeasured, and unrecorded.

Commerce Secretary Mosbacher has initiated a major policy
change to reduce the disincentives to export, created by an
export control policy which is out of touch with commercial
reality.  It is not a criticism that the change will be too
little too late, but the commercial reality is that the
European firms investing in Eastern Europe are not going to
compete in the marketplace with one hand tied behind their
back because of outdated concepts of export and technology
transfer controls.  Nor are they going to wait around for the
US government to give them permission.

Unless something changes Eastern Europe's direction (like
tanks in Tiananmen Square), economic activity will increase.
Eastern European countries are restricting exports of
subsidized consumer goods because it pays for an individual
to drive across a border to sell the goods for hard currency.
Small frequent export transactions are taking place because
human capital is available, even if financial capital is in
short supply.

To illustrate the amazing pace of change in Eastern Europe,
please note the following message from the new leadership in
East Germany (as quoted in a recent article by Craig Whitney
of the New York Times).  According to Mr. Gregory Gysi, the
new head of the East German Communist Party:

"I have never been in America in my life, but I think it is a
country that should not give up its responsibility for
Europe.  If the continued independence of the German
Democratic Republic is in the interests of stability in
Europe, then you should think about whether you want to leave
help for the G.D.R. up to a single neighbor country, and
thereby create dependency, or whether it wouldn't be better
to share the responsibility, to prevent the re-emergence of
Greater Germany,"

Referring to the possibility of unification, he added: "But
if so, then it should happen quickly-and simply."

Last June, 80 Socialist parties from around the world voted
in conference to reject socialism and adopt a system based on
market forces.  And barely six months later, the head of the
East German Communist party calls on the US to help complete
the post war process. The appeal of Eastern Europe is that
they want to buy what we have to sell, and despite a shortage
of hard currency they will take the necessary steps,
including mass emigration to obtain it.

Correction: The SED filing minimum will go to $2,500 when the
final rule is published in the Federal Register.

Our early information that the process of comments was
expected to be complete by January 1 was incorrect. Look for
a final rule with implementation at the earliest April
1st.  In the meantime, all export shipments where one
Schedule B number has a value greater than $1,500 requires
the filing of a completed Shipper's Export Declaration.

Housekeeping: Federal Register Notices usually appearing
monthly will reappear next month. "More than You Ever Wanted
to Know About Letters of Credit" is also scheduled to
reappear next month.

Europe 1992: Direction

Advisory Committee Report

The following is an abstract of the executive summary of the
Europe 1992 report of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy
and Negotiations (ACTPN).

Executive Summary

The European Community's program to create a single,
integrated market by the end of 1992 promises substantial
benefits to U.S. companies.  The program also presents
important challenges to the international trading system
whose current rules do not adequately address the intensely
competitive conditions of global markets.  The U.S.
government and the private sector have an interest in meeting
these challenges by seeking solutions to issues that now
serve to increase bilateral trade tensions.

The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations
(ACTPN) has identified six such issues in which the U.S. has
a significant interest in influencing the direction of
change.  The ACTPN has also recommended actions the U.S.
government and the private sector need to take to address
current bilateral concerns.  In brief, the issues and
recommendations are:

Rules of Origin-The U.S. government needs to continue to
apply pressure on the EC to provide greater transparency,
clarity, and predictability in Community rule-making and
administration; to eliminate the use of local content in
settlements of antidumping charges; and to support the U.S.
goal within the Uruguay Round to reach a multilateral
discipline governing the rules of origin.

The private sector needs to build support among U.S.
companies for a harmonized system for determining origin; and
to establish a dialogue with companies in Europe aimed at
reducing the mutual reliance on trade law to restrict market
access.

Public Procurement-The U.S. government needs to press the EC
to extend fully competitive procedures for suppliers of non-
EC products; to seek time limits and conditions under which a
Member State may use "industrial adaptation" to postpone
market-opening changes; to allocate additional resources to
the GATT government procurement negotiations on the excluded
sectors; and to use the renegotiation of bilateral defense
agreements with the EC as leverage to achieve access to the
Community's largest areas of government procurement.

The private sector needs to press for the formulation and
acceptance of an effective remedies proposal providing
protection for injured suppliers; and to seek to influence
the ways in which procuring entities in Europe apply the 50%
value-added requirement and establish criteria for qualifying
and selecting suppliers, for evaluating bids, and for using
standards other than European standards.

Product Standards, Testing and Certification-The U.S.
government needs to formalize ad clarify recent agreements
reached with the European standards-setting organizations to
provide effective access for U.S. companies; to support the
commitment made by the EC that it will adopt international
standards wherever possible, rather than developing
specifically European standards; and to press for workable
structures in the EC and in the U.S. that will facilitate the
mutual recognition of test data and certification procedures.

The private sector needs to establish communications with
European subsidiaries, partners, distributors and customers
to keep abreast of standards-related developments in the
Community; and to participate more actively in the
international standards-setting process.

Technology Transfer-The U.S. government needs to assign the
highest priority to streamlining the list of multilaterally-
controlled products and technologies; to adopt standards for
resolving domestic jurisdictional disputes over the control
of goods and technology having both military and commercial
applications; to press the EC to indicate how it will ensure
a common standard of enforcement among the twelve Member
States; and to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.
foreign policy controls to identify areas of unnecessary
duplication and inconsistency that encourage foreign firms to
design-out U.S. products and technology.

The private sector needs to provide advice to the U.S.
government on streamlining the control list; and to support
efforts to redirect current U.S. export control policy to
address changing technologies and East-West relations.

Local Content-The U.S. government needs to consult with the
EC and the Member States to ensure that the recently enacted
broadcasting directive is implemented in a flexible, non-
binding way.

The private sector needs to monitor developments in the
Member States, and to support the European groups opposed to
the introduction or strengthening of existing national
quotas.

Reciprocity-The U.S. government needs to continue its strong
support for the compromise language contained in the proposed
Second Banking Directive; and to monitor the EC's progress in
making similar changes in the draft directives on insurance
and investment services.

The report was adopted unanimously by ACTPN and represents
the consensus view of a broad spectrum of U.S.  industry and
labor.  It was submitted to Carla A. Hills, U.S.  Trade
Representative by James D.  Robinson III, ACTPN Chairman, and
Chairman and CEO of American Express Company; and Lawrence A.
Bosidy, Chairman of the ACTPN Task Force, and Vice Chairman
of the Board General Electric Company.

Relaxing Export Controls

A New Mosbacher Initiative

Commerce Secretary Mosbacher has gone on record saying that
there will be a "signifigant shortening" of the list of
commercially controlled items before the next Cocom meeting
in April. In an interview on the American Interests
televison show, Mr. Mosbacher said that "...we need to finish
our review, internally, in the US, get our groups together,
and see where we stand, going into Cocom together."

It has been observed that the other members of Cocom usually
follow the US lead in relaxing Cocom controls. It should be
remembered that last spring the official policy of Cocom was
announced as higher walls around fewer products. The delay
in implementing this policy position seems to come from a
dispute over which should come first, the higher walls or
fewer products.

The difference this year is the potential reunification of
Germany.

Following a meeting with his counterparts from East Germany,
Mr. Helmut Haussmann, the West German Economics Minister,
called for a relaxation of rules on East-West transfer of
technology to help give trade and industry cooperation
between East and West Germany "new perspectives". While this
may appear to be simply a German question, it raises the
issue of the viability of Cocom itself under the radical
restructuring of Eastern Europe.

Following the discussions, both East and West Germans were
reportedly satisfied with the talks which covered areas of
greater cooperation in medical technology, electronic control
systems, energy, and environmental technology. David Marsh
writing from East Berlin in the Financial Times said that
"Legal changes are expected to be made by both countries by
next February to allow joint ventures and to protect West
German investments in East Germany." In response to questions
about Cocom controls Mr. Hausman said that some rules
affecting areas like telecommunications and machine tools are
"senseless".

The Cocom process relies upon each member country enforcing
the agreed upon rules within its own borders.  President Bush
has acknowledged that the US "should and will review" the
Cocom process. Secretary of State Baker has said that "we
should rationalize the system to the extent that things that
are to some extent (italics added- ed.) available off the
shelf should not be locked up."  Deputy Secretary of State
Eagleburger is reported to have said that some dual use
technologies will no longer require prior approval, and that
"we understand that CoCom has to change."

Change first requires policy agreement, then implementation.

Two industry supported groups, looking at the process of
change from different perspectives have identified
essentially the same priorities and problems. (See the
following two articles.) The problem has been identified, and
for the most part the solution has been identified.

Before exporters see an actual reduction in the need to
obtain an export license, three obstacles remain:

1.  The Defense Department has not yet announced its
position, and with the rapid changes taking place in the
whole structure of European defense it is not clear when they
will have a new policy position.

2.  Writing new regulations, creating new lists, implementing
change takes time both in initiating the change, and then
going through the interagency review process.  Remember that
the process of shortening the list was also last year's
priority.

3.  Congress is about to re-authorize the Export
Administration Act. The National Academy of Sciences is due
to present another report. That which does not get done by
June is likely to have Congressional input by September,
further delaying the actual publication of new rules in the
Federal Register.

The difference, this year, is Eastern Europe and Western
Europe's integration.  Viscount Etienne Davignon, former EC
Commissioner of Industry, and current head of the European
Roundtable of Industrialists recently pointed out that Cocom
was a "procedure" which is not legally binding. As events in
Europe become clear, however, the procedure should be made
simpler and should become the "joint responsibility legally
of the EC" to reassure the US that Europeans are complying
with export controls.  While an interesting solution, the
problem is that the EC and Efta are currently re-negotiating
their trading relationship in light of 1992; a process which
is seen as the model for the EEC and Eastern Europe to enjoy
trade relations without full political relations.

The final text of the 12/15/89 NATO meeting ministerial
communique states : "In this regard, we support the progress
of rationalising existing export controls through a co-
ordinated approach that allows greater support for reform in
the East, and for Western investment in those countries while
protecting our security interests."  US Secretary of State
Baker was the US representative at those talks.  Agriculture
Secretary Yeutter, returning from a fact finding mission to
Eastern Europe, said that a process of building a
distribution infrastructure was necessary before foreign
direct investment would reap its full benefits.

Commerce Secretary calls for case by case evaluation of
higher tech sales to Eastern Europe; Soviets on hold.

When asked about the proposed sale of five very high-powered
Control Data Computers for contolling nuclear power plants on
NBC News, "Meet the Press" Commerce Secretary Mosbacher said
that they will "have to look at each item on a case-by-case
basis."  On a follow up question, Mr. Mosbacher said "but let
me say that we released middle technology, and we're going to
look to see whether it should go any higher than that.
Eastern European countries, yes. Soviet Union, would have to
be very careful."

In terms of specific direction for high-tech exports,
Secretary Mosbacher said "I think we will, particularly with
the Eastern European countries starting with Poland and
Hungary, open the door for higher technology as long as our
national security is protected.  We're willing to do it with
them because they have told us that they will protect us and
give us the opportunity to review (on site-ed.) what they're
doing with the higher-tech items."

On a very practical note, one knowledgeable observer
commented that with all those East Germans walking back and
forth across the border to West Berlin every day, did anybody
really think that all the packages they were carrying were
being inspected?  Defense Department policy notwithstanding,
soldiers at the border are also writing policy.

1992 and Technology Transfer

Recommendations

Recommendations on U.S. technology transfer policy by the
Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN)
to the U.S. Trade Representative.

The removal of EC internal frontiers increases the pressure
on the U.S. to accelerate efforts within Cocom toward the
development of common standards for national export control
systems.  To accomplish this goal, the U.S. will first have
to reduce the range products and technologies it currently
restricts, and further curtail its efforts to control
reexports of U.S.-origin goods and technology from Member
States, whether for reasons of national security or foreign
policy.

The danger is that, if the U.S. does not move rapidly enough
and cannot find common ground through Cocom then European
tolerance for U.S. export control policy may diminish further
in the context of a large, integrated market.  Were this to
happen it would likely increase European reluctance to
incorporate U.S. components in defense and high technology
products and undercut the ability of U.S. companies to
conduct cooperative research.  U.S. companies might then be
encouraged to conduct their R&D and production in Europe in
order to participate in EC and global markets.  European
companies with U.S. subsidiaries would also be discouraged
from conducting R&D in the U.S.

Thus, export control policies intended to safeguard the U.S.
could serve to weaken its technological lead.

The ACTPN therefore recommends that the U.S. government:

Assign the highest priority to streamlining the Cocom control
list.  The list needs to include only those items which are
of critical military importance to the USSR and its allies,
and are not available from non-Cocom sources.  This action
would assure the continued viability of the multilateral
control system and gain broad acceptance within Cocom of the
minimum necessary standards for national controls.  Serious
effort toward a significant rationalization of the control
list and removal of U.S.  unilateral controls will require a
high-level Administration policy initiative to assign
priority for action and overcome entrenched resistance within
U.S. government agencies.

Adopt standards for resolving jurisdictional disputes between
the Department of Commerce and the Departments of State and
Defense over the control of "dual-use" goods and
technology.  The lack of useful standards for determining the
boundary between the scope of the Export Administration Act
[EEA], administered by the Commerce Department, and the Arms
Export Control Act [AECA], administered by State and Defense,
has created a situation in which non-weapons items with
defense applications are incorporated within the U.S.
Munitions List and treated as weapons items.  The extension
of weapons export policies and procedures to non-weapons
exports in purely commercial transactions in the West results
in unreasonable restrictions on U.S. exports and further
encourages Western European companies to "de-Americanize"
their products.

Seek clarification from the EC regarding the conditions under
which individual Member States will continue to exercise the
right to restrict exports of Cocom-listed goods and
technology to other Member States after 1992.  While
alternative safeguards will probably be licensing may be kept
for munitions and nuclear technology items.  The U.S.,
therefore, should seek understandings with Member States on
how such controls will be administered.

Press the EC Commission to indicate how it will ensure a
common standard of enforcement.  Assurances are needed that
Cocom controls on exports to non-Cocom countries will be
effectively enforced throughout the Community.

Undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign policy
controls to identify areas of unnecessary duplication and
inconsistency that encourage foreign firms to design-out U.S.
products and technologies.  Foreign policy controls are
currently imposed under a broad range of laws and
regulations, including the Foreign Assets Control Act, the
Trading With The Enemy Act, the International Economic
Emergency Powers Act, and the Export Administration Act.
Foreign firms attempting to comply with U.S. laws are faced
with an array of confusing and, at times, conflicting
requirements, most of which have some extraterritorial reach.
The competitive disadvantage created for U.S. firms is
compounded by the fact that other countries are less prone to
use export controls as an instrument of foreign policy and,
when they do, they do not apply such controls
extraterritorally.

U.S. companies interested in avoiding a post-1992 competitive
disadvantage in strategic technology trade need to monitor
carefully developments in the U.S. and the EC, and within
Cocom, and seek to influence the redirection of policy.

The ACTPN therefore recommends that U.S. industry:

Participate in the streamlining of the Cocom control list.
Industry participation in the statutorily-mandated technical
advisory committees should be upgraded and more aggressive in
promoting control list rationalization.  In addition, the
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 permits the
President to include representatives of industry as advisors
to the U.S. delegation at Cocom.  This increased role in
developing U.S. technology transfer policy is in keeping with
the key role played by industry representatives of other
Cocom countries in helping their countries prepare for
multilateral control list negotiations.

Support the initiation of a comprehensive study by the
National Academies of Sciences and engineering of current
U.S. export control policy. The study, which is required by
the 1988 Trade Act, is aimed at providing guidance for
renewal of the Export Administration Act, scheduled for 1990.
Among the major goals established for the study is the
development of dynamic and implementable principles for
determining which technologies should be subject to control
and at what point technological diffusion and/or obsolescence
dictates that a particular technology should be decontrolled.
The study will also develop proposals to harmonize U.S. and
Cocom procedures for dealing with cases of "foreign
availability," i.e., where identical functionally similar
technology exists beyond the reach of the Cocom countries.

Monitor the implementation of the export decontrol measures
included in the 1988 Trade Act.  Particular attention should
be paid to the removal of unilateral export controls for the
least sensitive goods and technology, i.e., those whose
export to controlled countries would require only
notification to Cocom member countries.

Background

The convergence of economic and political change in Europe is
placing new strains on the ability of the U.S. to
unilaterally control the flow of sensitive technologies that
could enhance Soviet military capabilities.  First, European
economic integration is helping create strong competitors
capable of challenging U.S. dominance of high technology
trade for the first time in the post war era.  Economic
integration is leading to the creation of large companies
capable ot achieving greater economies of scale and of
investing heavily in R&D.  This development coincides with
the growing insistence by European countries on nurturing an
indigenous high technology defense industrial base.

Second, although European political integration is still
distant, the EC has already taken its first, tentative steps
toward its goal of assuming a greater role in world affairs.
One of the important changes made by the 1987 Single European
Act was to incorporate the European Political Cooperation
process in the Treaty of Rome, the EC's governing agreement.
The Community has since begun to strengthen its political
structures, including those dealing with foreign policy.  The
key challenge in this arena is the coordination of policy
toward the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries.  European
attitudes on the issue of East-West relations have already
started to diverge from American attitudes, which are only
slowly emerging from the postwar consensus in which European
integration was seen primarily as a bulwark against Soviet
expansionism.

With the current Soviet and East Bloc leadership focused on
internal economic restructuring and pursuing trade and
defense initiatives with the West, most EC Member States are
increasingly persuaded that new realities have overtaken the
postwar consensus.  They argue that a new consensus among
alliance partners is needed, one that places greater emphasis
on multilateral coordination and is more open to East-West
trade.  In this context, Europeans view the continuing U.S.
preoccupation with restrictive East-West technology transfer
policies as misguided.  In particular, continued resistance
to reducing substantially the list of multilaterally
controlled goods and technology serves to undermine adherence
to multilateral constraints as well as inhibit U.S.-based
exporters from establishing trading relationships in Eastern
Europe.

The divergence between U.S. and EC approaches to technology
transfer may become more pronounced as European economic
integration proceeds and internal border controls are
eliminated.  Debate over alternative safeguards for
protecting sensitive technologies is just beginning within
the Community.  The debate is expected to center on the
setting of common minimum standards for licensing and
enforcement, and on the role of the Commission in formulating
and enforcing a borderless control policy.  The UK and
France, for example, have taken the position that they will
not relinquish to the Commission national controls on
munitions, nuclear and other sensitive military technologies;
Germany, on the other hand, has historically expressed the
desire to turn over most controls to the EC.

U.S. export control policies are currently conducted
bilaterally and are based on the U.S. assessment of the risk
of diversion of controlled goods and technology from that
country to the Soviet bloc and the People's Republic of
China.  Other factors considered are possible nuclear weapons
proliferation and foreign policy restrictions aimed at
specific nations.  Countries that participate in multilateral
control agreements, such as the Coordinating Committee
[Cocom], are given preferred treatment.  Cocom administers
three lists of controlled items: munitions, nuclear energy
and "dual-use (i.e., items with both commercial and military
application).  Cocom members include all the EC countries
(except Ireland), the U.S. Canada, Norway, Japan, Turkey and
Australia.  Switzerland and Austria are accorded full Cocom
privileges although they are not voting members.

"Dual-use" technology is increasingly importamt to the Soviet
Union which is intent on closing the existing gap with the
West through aggressive acquisition.  U.S. alliance partners
agree that the acquisition of leading Western "dual-use"
technologies represents a serious military threat and have
been supportive of U.S. attempts to strengthen Cocom.
However, they resent the U.S. tendency to resort to foreign
policy trade sanctions to penalize Soviet and other nations'
political behavior and the application of extraterritorial
controls that signal U.S. mistrust of its Cocom partners.

These strains within the alliance are exacerbated by the more
restrictive U.S. control regime.  A National Academy of
Sciences study in 1987 found that:

"U.S. national security export controls encompass more
products and technologies, are generally more restrictive,
and entail more administrative delays and shipper
uncertainties than those of the other major Cocom countries.
Only the United States requires foreign resellers, even in
countries that are our closest allies, to obtain the prior
approval of-or to account periodically to-the U.S.
government for reexports of U.S.-origin products, U.S.-origin
parts and components incorporated into foreign equipment, and
foreign equipment, and foreign products manufactured with
U.S.-origin technology.  These light of the fact that many
controlled products are available from or through non-Cocom
countries with few or no restrictions."

European countries, for example, have cited U.S.
extraterritorial controls on reexports of U.S.-origin goods
and technology as the reason for denying U.S. participation
in development of the European Fighter Aircraft [EFA} and for
eliminating or designing out U.S. parts and components in
projects supported by Member States.

The U.S. recently has acted to redress some of these
problems.  The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
contains reforms which, when implemented, will reduce the
cost and competitive burdens of U.S. exports controls for
national security-controlled "dual-use" items, especially
where West-West trade is involved.  These reforms include:
(1) decontrolling the exports of less sensitive U.S.-origin
goods and technology to Cocom and other Free World countries;
(2) decontrolling  the reexport of U.S. parts and components
comprise less than 25% of the end-product.  In addition,
unilateral national security controls are to expire unless
the Department of Comerce determines that there is no other
comparable capability, or that negotiations for multilateral
control are underway.

The U.S. has also taken the initiative within Cocom to
propose upgrading the multilateral control system and to
create greater harmonization of national policies.  The U.S.,
as an incentive, has offered to go beyond the 1988 Trade Act
and remove all requirements for validated licensing of "dual-
use" exports and reexports to and among Cocom countries, and
to reduce substantially the list of multilaterally-controlled
goods and technology.  Cocom Member States have responded
favorably, indicating their willingness to upgrade their
enforcement control systems to an agreed-upon common
standard.  It now remains for the U.S. to initiate a
realistic reduction in the Cocom control list.

An upgraded Cocom system based on common standards would
simultaneously allow removal of U.S. control over reexports
from Cocom and permit a license-free internal market for the
EC.  These actions resolve much of the debate within the
Community over alternative safeguards for protecting
strategic goods and technology once internal borders are
eliminated.

Summary of the Issue

As part of its 1992 program, the EC plans to eliminate
internal customs border controls, and is likely to exert more
authority over the export control policies of Member States.
These changes could increase tensions between the U.S. and EC
over their differing approaches to technology transfer
further justifying European perceptions that U.S. policy is
out of step with new political and economic realities.  If
the U.S. fails to reduce or remove its unilateral controls
over the reexport of U.S.-origin products to third countries,
its company may find it more difficult to export to, and
cooperate with, European firms and governments.  Europeans
are increasingly unwilling to include U.S.-origin goods and
technology in their end-products because of these reexport
controls.  Increased rejection of U.S. goods and technology
by European customers could also discourage both U.S. and EC
firms from conducting research and development in the U.S.

The U.S. should assign higher priority to substantially
reducing the list of multilaterally controlled goods and
technology.  This action would signal the U.S. commitment to
developing and implementing common standards for national
controls among the member countries of Cocom.  Such common
standards must be sufficient to allow removal of U.S.
extraterritorial control over reexports from Cocom countries,
as well as permit a license-free internal market for the
Community.

The U.S. should also press the EC to indicate the extent to
which it will exert authority over the control policies of
Member States, and how it will ensure a common standard of
enforcement.

National Institute of Standards

Hearing Notice-Opportunity to Comment

On April 3, 1990, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) will hold a public hearing to solicit views
and recommendations  concerning the government's role in
coordinating U.S. participation in international standards
activities.  The hearing is expected to include expressions
of views on potential models for government-private sector
interactions, such as the Standards Council of Canada or any
others.

The following representative subjects may be discussed by
participants in the hearing.  They are offered as general
guidelines to stimulate contributions from interested
parties, but are not intended as limitations on subject
matter or documented points of view.

Standards Participation

How can we best ensure appropriate technical and financial
support for international standardization activities?  Should
the Government help finance participation, especially by
small and medium-sized companies?

Standards Usage

Antiboycott Provision

Announcements of BXA Fines

The following notices have been released by the Department of
Commerce regarding the implementation of the anti-boycott
provisions of the Export Administration Act.

Export Administration Regulations prohibit U.S. persons from
refusing to do business with others because of foreign
boycotts and from furnishing information about their business
relations with boycotted countries and blacklisted persons.
The Export Administration Act also requires individuals and
companies to report promptly receipt of restrictive trade
practices or boycott requests.  The antiboycott regulations
apply to all foreign boycotts which are not supported by the
United States and which are directed at countries friendly to
the United States.

Martin-Decker voluntarily disclosed the alleged violation to
the department in a timely manner and cooperated fully with
the investigation.  While neither admitting nor denying the
alleged violation, the company agreed to pay the civil
penalty. (BXA89-37).

A Survey of Export Finance Services

Banks in Export Finance - Part I

Servicing the East

By Heather L. McCulloch

The demand for export finance among American companies is
growing as the ranks of new exporters expand, and experienced
players become more active in foreign markets.  While many of
the larger banks are still reluctant to serve any but their
largest customers, others have recognized the potential
business of the expanding market of growing exporters.

In the past, new or infrequent exporters have lost business
to foreign buyers which demanded credit terms.  Considering
the small size of potential shipments and small companies
lack of collateral to support working capital or accounts
receivable financing, many companies did not feel it was
worthwhile to seek credit from reluctant bankers.  Today,
these companies see foreign markets as bearing the greatest
growth potential, so their demand for export finance has
mushroomed.

The following article is the first in a series on banks in
export finance.  The series, based on interviews with trade
finance specialists in banks across the country, will explore
the activities of those banks which are gaining a reputation
for servicing the needs of local exporters.  (The Exporter
welcomes your comments and suggestions as we progress from
the East to West coast in the next issues.)

While many of the larger money center banks have closed down
or strictly limited their trade finance departments in recent
years, several regional and super-regional banks on the
eastern seaboard have given trade finance top priority.
This first article focuses on five east coast banks which are
becoming recognized for their expertise in the market.  They
include the Bank of Boston and Bay Banks in Massachusetts,
Philidelphia National Bank (PNB) in Pennsylvania, Maryland
National Bank (MNB) in Maryland, and Citizens and Southern in
Georgia.

The trade services department of the Bank of Boston provides
exporters with more than the traditional collections and
letter of credit services.  While other banks have pulled out
of the market, Bank of Boston has continued to provide a
diversity of trade finance services for large corporate
clients as well as small and medium-sized exporters.

The majority of the bank's exporting clients have
traditionally been frequent exporters with established buyer
relationships; but the export finance group is beginning to
address the growth potential in the companies which are new
to exporting, or which are beginning to increase their export
sales.

In order to provide such financing without increasing their
international exposure, the Bank of Boston's trade finance
specialists have been trying to work more closely with
government programs to help companies which are small and/or
new to exporting.  In the past, the extensive paperwork
involved discouraged many banks from participating in the
government programs.  The Bank of Boston is trying overcome
this hurdle by developing a reporting package that will
expedite administrative procedures to increase the cost-
effectiveness of lending for smaller transactions.

The bank is interested in doing more accounts receivable
financing for sales covered by Eximbank or FCIA.  They have
also been active in providing buyer credits, a direct loan to
a foreign client to support a customer's sale, again with
Exim or FCIA coverage.

Bay Banks, of Boston, also sees potential in the expanding
middle market.  The bank is trying to figure out ways to use
government working capital and accounts receivable financing
guarantee programs more effectively, so they too can become
more active in providing credit to smaller, or less frequent,
exporters.

One solution reducing the paperwork has been to try to work
more closely with MIFA-Massachusetts Industrial Finance
Agency-the state's export development agency.  MIFA
facilitates the processing of Exim and FCIA applications by
screening companies and providing administrative services in
the application procedure.  (For more information, see
article on state agencies in this issue) Still, according to
the bank's trade finance specialists, the number of bankable
transactions under these programs is still disappointing.

One problem with using government programs is the fact that
many new exporters are start-up companies.  Exim requires
that companies be in existence for three years before they
are eligible for their programs.  Trade finance specialists
within the bank often find this requirement to be a
constraint on the bank's lending because they often see young
companies which would merit the bank's support if Exim were
more lenient.

For medium term lending (mainly for larger transactions of
more than 180 days), the bank is becoming more active in
arranging "supplier credits"-a loan to the buyer, arranged by
the seller.  To minimize its own exposure, the bank works
closely with Exim to arrange a guarantee of the loan, or with
forfaiting houses, which will purchase or participate in the
credit obligation.  For short term financing, the bank may
use the services of an international factoring house, which
will purchase the exporter's foreign receivables at a
discount.

Moving down the coast, Philidelphia National Bank(PNB) is a
growing 'super-regional' which sees trade finance as an
integral part of relationships with corporate clients.  Since
the bank's trade finance unit is a "shadow unit", rather than
a profit center, they are willing to work on all sizes of
transactions.  However, the focus of the bank is on servicing
the needs of its traditional corporate clients, rather than
seeking out new business amongst growing exporters.

PNB bank is willing to provide buyer credits with FCIA
insurance or an Exim guarantee.  They are not involved in
international factoring, but will participate in the
forfait market, if needed to complete a transaction.  PNB has
also been involved in the arrangement of countertrade
transactions, though they will not take title to the goods.

MNC International Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Maryland National Bank.  Focusing on merchant banking, MNC is
more deal-driven than commercial banks.  With a customer base
which stretches across the United States,  this transaction-
oriented, rather than relationship-oriented approach helps
the bank to meet the needs of a diverse customer base.

MNC is among the top ten users of Exim guarantee programs in
the area of post-export finance.  In structuring export
finance, MNC's trade specialists try to respond as quickly as
possible to the customer's needs.  A large percentage are
exporters of capital goods, so no transaction is "standard".
In the area of pre-export finance, the bank is active in the
provision of working capital lending to small companies,
again, it is one of the largest users of Eximbank's programs
(this time for working capital guarantees).

Non-traditional activities of the bank, include growing
cooperation with Maryland National World Trade (formed in
1983, the company was dormant for a period but is now
experiencing a revival), and in a number of countertrade
transactions.  MNC is seeking to expand its business with new
exporters, on a deal-by-deal, or on-going basis.

Citizens and Southern Bank in Atlanta, Georgia, has been
actively providing export finance services for the last 30
years.  While the international departments of money-center
banks were focusing on direct lending in the 1970's, Citizens
and Southern continued to emphasize trade-related lending.
The bank emerged largely unscathed from the third world debt
crises.  Consequently, they have been able to continue to
accept country risk from countries in which other banks have
completely withdrawn.

Citizens and Southern has one of the largest international
departments in the southeast.  It is in the process of
merging with Sovran Bank of Virginia, which is also known for
its trade finance expertise.  On the domestic side, the
bank's focus is on fulfilling the trade finance needs of its
established customers, but they will accomodate the needs of
smaller, or less frequent, exporters if this service is part
of a broader commercial relationship.

The bank has followed the trade finance patterns of its
customers, with a traditional focus on sales to Latin
America.  They are able to accept short term country risk in
countries such as Chile, Brazil and Mexico which other banks
have been unable to do.

To service the needs of its middle market clients, the bank
has developed strong expertise in factoring operations.
Factoring is typically used in transactions of 120 days or
less, and takes two forms, guaranteeing of the receivable at
a nominal rate, and advancing against the guaranteed
receiveable. For the discounting of medium term notes, the
bank is not, itself, an active player in the a-forfait
market.  However, they will consult customers on the
availability of forfaiting services, using access to
forfaiting houses and other banks in the market.

The Roundtable On Credit Conditions

Developments in Africa

Namibia

Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, is moving towards
independence.  At the moment, Namibia is still governed by
the Republic of South Africa.  Following recent elections,
however, the former German and British colony will soon be
preparing the law of the newly independent nation.

The UN General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate for
Namibia in 1966.  The Republic continued to occupy and
administer the territory in spite of a series of UN
resolutions which sought to establish Namibian independence.
Movement towards granting independence, as set out in the UN
Resolution 435 in 1978, was also stymied by armed conflict in
neighboring Angola.

On December 1988, a tripartite peace accord between South
Africa, Angola, and Cuba established a timetable for the
phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and called upon
the UN to effect movement towards Namibian independence.  The
polling for the Constituent Assembly just took place.  These
elections were a contest between the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance.  Real independence for Namibia is scheduled for
April of 1990.

On the economic side, mining activity is the mainstay of the
Namibian economy representing about one-quarter of GDP and
providing some three-quarters of the territory's foreign
exchange earnings.  Of particular importance are the rich
deposits of alluvial diamonds, of which Namibia produced
approximately one million carats in 1987 alone.

The Rossing open-pit mine produces some 3,600 tons of uranium
annually.  This output is primarily used for generating
electricity.  Other notable resources include copper, zinc,
lead, tin, gold, silver, and semi-precious stones.
Independence should result in the end of South African
sanctions, thereby opening up export markets and promoting
the development of the territory's resource potential.

Some 70% of the population derive their livelihood from the
agricultural sector, mostly employed in subsistence farming.
Because of the arid climate and poor land quality, the sector
is dominated by extensive livestock husbandry, exporting meat
and sheep pelts.  Wheat and maize are the principal arable
crops.

Work is now underway to supply water from the Okavango River
in the north to other parts of the country which should boost
agricultural production.  Upon independence, Namibia hopes to
implement a 200-mile exclusive economic zone to conserve its
fishing resources, and it will develop fish processing
facilities.  With a small domestic market and close ties with
the South African economy, Namibia's manufacturing sector
accounts for only 5% of the GDP.  It produces a limited range
of consumer goods and is undertaking some export processing.
Opportunities for growth are largely in import substitution,
especially in foodstuffs, and in domestic processing of
primary products.  In fiscal 1989-90 the budget deficit will
most likely increase to some 214 million South Africa Rand.
This reduction can be largely attributed to substantial South
African aid reductions.

The outlook for this sparsley populated, predominantly desert
territory is that the country will confront major challenges
in its emergence as an independent nation.  Developed
countries, notably Great Britain and West Germany, have
planned additional assistance, but despite Namibia's
political autonomy, it is likely to remain economically
dependent on South Africa for the foreseeable future.

Ivory Coast

The Ivory Coast was formerly a part of the French West
Africa.  It became independent in 1960 under the leadership
of President Houphouet-Boigny.  Now over eighty years old, he
was confirmed in office for another 5 years in October 1985.
The President heads the unity party, Parti Democratique de la
Cote d'Ivoire.  The constitution provides that, in the event
of the death or resignation of the Head of State, the
President of the National Assembly will take power for an
interim period with an obligation to call new elections
within 90 days.

The Ivory Coast always had a free market economy, and between
1973 and 1980 GDP increased on average by 6.8% per year.
However, per capita income amounted to only US$ 864 in 1988,
partly the result of austerity programs imposed by the IMF
and the World Bank.  The good harvests of 1985 and 1986
improved commodity prices, fuelling a short-lived recovery.
However, the subsequent fall in both commodity prices and the
dollar, together with a reduction in it cocoa crops in 1988,
resulted in liquidity problems for the country.

The banking system of the Ivory Coast came under pressure at
the end of 1988 when resources were required to finance crops
to the detriment of other sectors of the economy.  Exporters
were unable to repay crop credits while credit had to be
restricted because of the increase in external debt
repayments.  As a result of the liquidity crunch, foreign
bank subsidiaries obtained funds from head offices, while
local banks found it increasingly difficult to meet customer
withdrawals.  As some banks closed, others were reorganized
or merged.  (It should be noted, that the local currency, the
CFA franc, is fully convertible with the Franch franc.)

Agriculture in the Ivory Coast generates about 30% of the GDP
and employs approximately 80% of the labor force of the
country.  Agricultural products account for more than three-
quarters of export earnings.  Since the end of the 1970s, the
Ivory Coast has been the world's biggest producer of cocoa.
The country is also the third largest producer of robusta
coffee.  These two crops together account for about one half
of export earnings.

The coffee crop reportedly declined again in the 1988/89
season, to 4.2 million sacks from 4.55 million in the
previous year.  This decline reflects the ageing of plants
and lower guaranteed prices than for cocoa.  The
International Coffee Organization export quota was reduced to
3.6 million sacks in 1988/89, notably because of Western
consumer preference for arabica.  A record cocoa crop of some
750,000 tons was recorded in 1988/89 against 630,000 tons in
1987/88, an increase of 20%.

Cocoa and coffee are largely produced on small-scale
plantations which employ foreign labor and sell their crops
to Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des
Productions Agricoles (CSSPPA), the State marketing agency,
at prices fixed by the government.  Since 1987, however, the
local cost of cocoa, of about CFA francs 600 per kilo, has
exceeded the world price by about 50%.  With the government
no longer able to make up the difference, planters have had
to sell crops at half the guaranteed price or to accept
purchase vouchers in lieu of payment.

In order to broaden the agricultural base, cotton is being
promoted.  In 1986/87 the Ivory Coast became the third-
largest cultivator among African cotton producers.  Exports
of tropical fruit and rubber have also increased
significantly.  Rubber production is expected to double by
1990, making the Ivory Coast Africa's largest producer.  Rice
output has also been increased considerably and self-
sufficiency has been virtually achieved in pork and poultry.
Wheat imports have been held down despite continuing high
population growth rate.  The production of yams and manioc
fell, by 50% and 20% respectively in 1986/87.

Fish production meets 60% of the domestic needs. Abidjan is
Africa's largest tuna fishing port, accounting for almost a
quarter of the total Atlantic tuna catch.  The total area of
exploitable timber is estimated at only one million hectars,
against 15.6 million at the start of the century, because of
the excessive clearing of forest land.

Industry, including mining and construction, accounts for
about 13% of the GDP, but employs only around 4% of the labor
force.  Agricultural and foodstuff processing account for
about 40% of output, with coffee and cocoa the major sectors.
Some 40 firms produce textiles.  Wood is processed by about
65 firms that depend on the level of activity in the local
building trade, which accounts for 3% of the GDP.  Over two-
thirds of industry is lcoated in and around the commercial
capital of Abidjan.

The Ivory Coast remains a net importer of energy.  Following
the rapid introduction of thermal turbines after the drought
of 1983 to 1985, thermal power stations now account for 60%
of total energy.  The possibility of exploiting rich natural
gas deposits in the coastal region has been considered, but
relatively lower oil prices have restrained the earlier
enthusiasm for using gas instead of oil to fuel generators.

On the financial side, total expenditures for 1989 have been
set at CFA francs 645 billion, an increase of 1.25 from the
previous year.  This amount includes an increase of 1.4% in
operating expenditure to CFA francs 500 billion.  The special
investment and equipment budget (BSIE), of CFA francs 145
billion, has been increased by 1% and is being devoted mainly
to major agriculture programs (39% of the budget), housing
and urban development (11%), and training (8%).

Budget spending, particularly under the public sector's
consolidated budget, could turn out to be substantially
higher than forecast.  The public sector's current revenue
should amount to CFA francs 880 billion, from which CSSPPA's
forecast deficit of CFA francs 180 billion must be deducted.
Current expenditure is expected to total CFA francs 700
billion.  Including the BSIE, which has local debt of CFA
francs 50 billion and external debt of CFA francs 470
billion, total expenditure will total around CFA francs 1,370
billion.  With CSSPPA's cumulative arrrears and government-
guaranteed loans of CFA francs 360 billion, the public
sector's financing requirement will increase to CFA francs
850 billion (US$2.7 billion), or 28% of the GDP in 1989 and
to fall to about CFA francs 500 in 1990.

With approved or anticipated external funding of about CFA
francs 475 billion, about CFA francs 140 billion for 1989
will have to be generated through domestic measures such as
higher taxes, a reduction in "presidential levies", and a cut
in guaranteed producer prices, none of which will be easy to
achieve in the country.   As a result of this, adjustment
will be spread over several years if the austerity policy is
maintained.

With the Ivory Coast the world's largest cocoa producer, and
because the quality of the bean is of the highest grade, the
President adopted a policy in 1988 of holding back exports in
an unsuccessful attempt to raise world prices significantly.
Almost 90% of the crop has reportedly been sold but for only
a portion of the prices demanded.  An agreement reached
with a commercial company in December 1988 provided for the
removal of 400,000 tons of cocoa in 1988/89.  Of this amount
125,000 tons was applicable to 1988, half of which was
stocked in European ports for two years.  The selling price
was reduced to the world price for the Ivory Coast cocoa (CFA
francs 500 per kilo) by waiving a removal tax of CFA francs
100 per kilo. In June of 1989, a contract for the removal of
280,000 tons of cocoa, the balance of the 1987-89 crop years,
was signed with another commercial concern.

Despite the generally unfavorable trend in commodity prices
in 1989, with cocoa prices falling by 10% and cotton prices
by 7.5% (the exception was coffee with a 4.5% price
increase), a rise in export volume should increase export
earnings by 12% to US$2.7 billion.  Imports are not expected
to increase because of the foreign exchange shortage and the
implementation of the IMF-agreed austerity program.  One
aspect of this program is expected to be a fall in the
guaranteed producer price for cocoa to CFA francs 250 per
kilo from CFA francs 400.

The rise in the trade surplus to US$1.1 billion, an increase
of 42%, should offset the adverse impact of higher
international interest rates.  The current account deficit is
expected to fall to US$1 billion from US$1.3 billion in 1988
but, at the equivalent of 10.5% of GDP, it will remain high.

Principal and interest arrears are in the vicinity of CFA
francs 470 billion, while payments to the IMF and the World
Bank remain behind schedule.  Debt is increasing rapidly.
According to the World Bank, it amounted to US$13.5 billion
at the end of 1987, a figure which includes guaranteed long-
and medium-term public debt of US$8.4 billion.  According to
some estimates, total outstanding debt at end-1989 could
amount to US$15.5 billion if short-term debt is included.
This implies a debt servicing of about US$2.9 billion, or 86%
of foreign exchange revenues prior to rescheduling.

France is the major trading partner of the Ivory Coast,
accounting for 35% and 16% respectively of the country's
imports and exports.  Nigeria, the Netherlands, and Japan
each provide about 6% to 7% of imports, while the major
export markets, apart from France, are the United States
(12%), West Germany(10%), and Italy(8%).

Latest Information on the Ivory Coast: Responding to the
demands of creditors for deep cuts in the public-sector
spending, the country's President has radically streamlined
the government.  Ten of the overall 39 ministeries were
abolished.  In general, credit terms extended to the country
show all terms, from open account to strict letter of credit
transactions.  The delay on lenient terms has been longer in
recent months, and some exporters have to wait several weeks
for payment.  Overall, payments are still being made.
Exporters should definitely check the creditworthiness of
their customers, both old and new, to avoid any surprises.

State Export Development Agencies

States Pick Up the Slack in Export Finance

By Heather L. McCulloch

The notion that small business in America is an untapped
source of exports which, once mobilized, will turn around
America's trade deficit is, today, a common perception.
Though the theory has yet to be proven, state administrators
of newly established export finance agencies are trying their
best to push local companies into international markets.

The Reagan administration drastically reduced federal funding
for Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) programs, recommending that
exporters turn to the private sector for export financing.
Unfortunately, in the wake of the third world debt crisis and
the resulting increase in capital adequacy requirements;
American commercial banks were simultaneously retreating from
trade finance, particularly for their smaller customers.

Small and medium-sized American companies are making progress
in tackling foreign markets; but their lack of access to
export finance remains a major barrier to overseas sales.
Small or infrequent exporters face many barriers to obtaining
credit from commercial banks.  It is harder for smaller
companies to obtain working capital financing for domestic
instances; but when it comes to cash flow being dependent on
foreign receivables, the banks' concerns about
creditworthiness are multiplied.

The majority of U.S. exports are sold on a cash or short term
credit basis (less than 90 days), but exporters are
increasingly demanded to extend credit terms in competitive
foreign markets.  In many cases where exporters can not
extend credit, the sale is lost to competiters who can.
In some states, few or no banks are willing to provide post-
shipment export financing, even for their largest customers.
Finally, smaller exporters have difficulties dealing with
FCIA insurance programs because the administrative costs bite
into the profit margin of a small shipment, and private
insurance for small transactions is typically hard to come
by.

State governments have begun to respond to the gap in
financing between the private sector and the federal
government.  According to a recent survey by First Washington
Associates; as of June 1989, export-financing legislation had
been passed in 31 states and 24 states have operational
programs.  Most state export development programs have the
specific goal of helping small and medium-sized non-exporters
to enter foreign markets.  Unlike export credit agencies in
other countries; they are designed and operated to meet local
needs, independent of federal management or financing.

A diverse array of state programs has been developed, ranging
from pre- and post-shipment lending to state guarantees,
insurance and financial advice.  Some state agencies have
limited their involvement to counseling and documentary
assistance.  For example, the Massachusetts Industrial
Finance Agency (MIFA) provides export finance counseling and
assistance in administrative aspects of Exim and FCIA loan
applications.

Other programs, like Minnesota's Export Finance Authority
(MEFA), play a larger role in the transaction.  MEFA
encourages bank involvement by arranging export insurance and
loan guarantees, as well as providing Eximbank packaging
assistance and financial counseling.  MEFA supported $4.3
million in export sales last year.

The ultimate success of the state programs lies in their
ability to bring the private sector back into export finance.
Illinois was a pioneer in working with commercial banks to
provide direct loans to exporters.  In 1984, the state passed
legislation to create the Illinois Export Development
Authority (IEDA), a state export finance program.  The
program provides fixed-rate loans to local exporters, whose
exports have a minimum state content of 25%.  The loans will
cover 90% of an export transaction, with a maximum
transaction size of $500,000.

The California Export Finance Office (CEFO) is one of the
most successful state export finance agencies.  The program
has supported over $160 million of export sales since its
inception.  The majority of the office's activities have
since been focused on providing pre-export guarantees for
working capital loans.  For a guarantee fee of 1%, the agency
will guarantee 85% of the export transaction, to a maximum of
$350,000.  The program may soon be moving into post-shipment
finance lending.  Administrators of the fund are currently
experimenting with the possibility of a foreign accounts
receivables lending program.

Some state agencies have also been playing a more direct role
in providing direct working capital loans to support exports.
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority recently began
to offer a one-year revolving line of credit of up to
$100,000 for state exporters.  The line will cover the
exporters costs of materials and production for foreign
sales.  A confirmed letter of credit from the buyer or
coverage by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association is a
prerequisite for state participation.

State and local governments have also begun to work together
with the federal government to bring Eximbank programs down
to the level of city government.  In 1987, experimental
Eximbank City/State Agency Cooperation Programs were launched
in three states and three cities.  The programs, designed as
distribution vehicles for federal export finance programs,
offer training for state and city personnel by Exim staff
members.

The City of Los Angeles has implemented the program in a
particularly innovative manner.  Loans to local exporters are
approved by the city; guaranteed by the state program or
Eximbank; and financed by a $15 million credit line provided
by Imperial Bank, an L.A.-based regional bank.  Initiated in
1987, the program is the largest municipal export finance
program in the nation.

Despite the demonstrated success of state programs in
bringing new exporters into the market, critics of the
lack of federal participation argue that the fragmented
approach is not adequate to remedy America's trade imbalance.

Howard Lewis, vice president of the National Manufacturers
Association, is skeptical of the federal government's
tendency to leave export finance problems to the states.  L.
Fargo Wells, head of the California Export Finance Office,
emphasizes the fact that state programs are meant to
supplement, not replace, Eximbank programs.  States are
restricted by size, budgetary restrictions as well as
political realities, so they can not be expected to solve
America's deficit woes single-handedly.

With current budget considerations, however, it is unlikely
that the Bush administration will revitalize a currently
'defunded' Eximbank.  By design or default, the state
agencies remain at the forefront of public sector export
finance.

development and export finance in your state, contact your

Export Development, Southern-Style

Southern States Adopt Unified Strategy

The Southern Growth Policies Board held a key conference in
New Orleans on December 8-9, 1989 to set an international
agenda for the southern states from 1990 to 1995.  Attending
were over 70 high ranking representatives of twelve southern
state governments, legislators, regional organizations,
universities, research organizations, the federal government,
and others from the public and private sectors.  Uppermost on
the agenda was the subject of how the region could encourage
the growth of exports and international investment using a
variety of new programs and policy approaches.

Export finance and other trade promotion program were a
special focus of attention.  The conference noted the
limitations of existing statistics on international trade,
discussed the major issues affecting export success, and
agreed on a variety of research projects which would help
southern legislatures and administrative agencies decide
which policies and programs could be most helpful to their
states.

The Southern Growth Policies Board will play a catalytic and
coordinating role in seeking to implement the research
projects endorsed by the conference and will share the
results between all members.  This is the first time that a
regional grouping of states has gotten together for the joint
planning of comprehensive research and development efforts
that will lead to increased international trade and
investment.  In the past this had always been done by the
individual states with consequent duplication of effort and
suboptimal utilization of the results.

The Services Trade Deficit

House Export Task Force

Subcommittee Hearing Summary

By Craig Pena, staff member of the House Export Task Force.

The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy and Trade recently conducted a hearing on the
services trade deficit.  The deficit was the first of its
kind in thirty years.

Chairman Sam Gejdenson, in his opening statement, explained
that there are two components to the service trade balance,
investment and sales.  Investment, the larger of the two
components, compares the earnings of foreigners' investments
in the U.S. with the earnings of Americans' investments
overseas.  That portion of the service balance is currently
in deficit.  The second factor of the services trade balance
is sales performance.  Here the U.S. ran a $5 billion surplus
in the second quarter of 1989.

The purpose of Friday's hearing was, according to the
Chairman "to find out the story behind America's newest
deficit." Comments from some of the witnesses are as follows:

From C. Fred Bergsten. Director, Institute for International
Economics:

1.  Foreign investment in the U.S. has become greater than
U.S.  investment abroad.  However, on a per dollar basis,
U.S. investments overseas still outperform foreign
investments in the United States.  (Generally the foreign
assets held by the U.S. are older investments which are
reaching a maximum yield.  When the foreign held assets
mature, the services trade deficit can be expected to
worsen.)

2.  To alleviate the federal deficit, Bergsten argues that a
tax increase will have to exist and recommends a value added
tax (VAT) or an across the board consumption tax.


From The Honorable Linda Powers.  Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Services, United States Department of Commerce:

1.  The services trade deficit of the past provided a
substantial "offset to the merchandise trade deficit."

2.  "Lack of comprehensive trade data on services is indeed
frustrating to U.S. government efforts to formulate and
execute trade policy for the service sector".  Quite often
many "service trade and income flows do not pass (sic)
generally pass through gateways where they can be easily
counted.  Accordingly, the system of collecting data on
services trade must be based largely on surveys of service
companies."

3.  Powers states that "true traded services have not moved
into a deficit but show a growing surplus with exports
exceeding imports by approximately 6.8 billion dollars during
the second quarter of 1989."  Of these "true services" it is
travel and transportation that acquired the sizeable
deficits.  These deficits are offset by growing surpluses
from technology licensing and other royalties and licensing
fees which bring the entire "true services" balance to
surplus.

4. "A recurring problem for exported-minded U.S.  service
providers is the persistence of a multitude of foreign trade
barriers to services.  One example is the European
Community's television broadcast directive...  [However], the
development of trade rules and procedures for the progressive
elimination of services barriers is a major component of the
Uruguay Round trade negotiations."

From The Honorable Richard Self, Deputy Assistant U.S.  Trade
Representative:

1. Self agreed with Powers that there is no deficit in the
U.S. services sector.

2. "...the problem reflected by the data appears to stem from
increased foreign investment in the U.S. rather than poor
performance of the service sector."

3. "It is the role of the U.S. government to establish and
maintain a suitable international climate to enable U.S.
service industries to gain access to markets and compete
fairly."

From Gordon Cloney. President, International Insurance
Council:

1. "International Trade Statistics for insurance are
fragmentary because insurance transactions between countries
do not pass through the equivalent of a customs house where
recording can take place."

2. Cloney lists three types of trade discrimination practices
faced by the insurance industry:

a. The practice of simply closing a market to the U.S.
insurer by nationalization or domestication of the market."

b. "...making it impossible to set up, license and organize
an effective establishment to operate in the market."

c. Those [practices] which cripple the commercial operations
of the foreign insurer even when they are admitted and
permitted to organize.

3. "The U.S. must be sure it provides its international
insurers with as good a commercial base for global operations
as possible.  Industry and government should cooperate to
identify and reduce or eliminate domestic disincentives to
doing an international business from the U.S.  Our state
regulators are beginning to pursue this worthwhile
objective."

All witnesses, while having varied points of view, agree that
as time progresses it will be the ever growing income from
U.S. assets held by foreigners that will lead to a further
deterioration of the services trade balance in the future.

Governors Create Export Database

The NGA has created a database that will be useful for
tracking the growth of exports state by state. While it
does not answer the question of how many exporters there are
in each state, the new database does allow states to track
the growth of export industries in their state year by year.

This database is necessary because the Census Bureau does not
have the funds to provide trade statistics below the national
level, in fact, the only detailed statistics are from the
1987 trade year. In 1989, the Shipper's Export Declaration
database of transactions will be compared with the Census of
Manufacturers' database of establishments to indentify the
number and type of exporters in each state, at the four digit
SIC level.  Even so, it will not be possible to update the
Census Bureau data.

The new service being offered by the National Governors
Association, in cooperation with DRI, will make it possible
to distribute national trade statistics to state activity at
the more detailed three digit level SIC classification,
through the use of an input/output table. The service is
called Expolink.

Expolink contains the value of US exports to more than 141
countries by state-by 3 digit SIC industry-for the fifty
states and the District of Columbia.  Estimated from several
sources, including the US Commerce Department's Origin of
Movement data series, Expolink contains the files of total
exports as well as a breakdown by mode of transportation (air
and sea).

EDIA - 21st Conference

National EDI Systems Conference and Exhibit

The Maturation of EDI

By R.T.Crowley

Once again, as they have for the last score of years, the
members of the EDI community made their annual pilgrimage to
Washington, DC to participate in the TDCC: The Electronic
Data Interchange Association's two-and-a-half day conference.
Actually, as any regular attendee to this event knows all too
well, the conference itself may last only two-and-a-half
days, but the other related meetings and happenings scheduled
by other groups in conjunction with it stretch things out to
a full week.  While many of the usual rites of this regular
week long "mating season" of EDI were observed, there were a
number of notable new twists and additions that point the way
to the future evolution of EDI as we now know it.

I am fond of saying that to be involved in EDI is to be
passionately in love with change.  EDI represents a
monumental change to the way that mankind will communicate
and do business, but EDI itself is changing in many ways.
The first TDCC conference, twenty-one years ago, consisted of
a little less than one-hundred fifty individuals who came
together to discuss the, then "brand new", technology of EDI.
Most attendees were either traffic managers from transport
companies or production managers from manufacturing companies
with a small sprinkle of computer professionals from the same
companies to advise them about the technical aspects of the
discussions.  Over the intervening years, the cast of at-
tendees has undergone a subtle change which was quite
apparent in the over two thousand people who came to
Washington, DC this year.

Traditionally, in our society, the twenty-first year
represents the point of passage from adolescence to
adulthood.  This twenty-first year saw the coming of age of a
new type of individual that can now take their place as the
EDI Professional.  These individuals are the consultants,
neo-consultants, and semi-consultants who work for many types
of companies, and specialize in EDI as a profession.
Conferences like this one are the places where these people
come together to learn their trade, sharpen their skills, and
share ideas.  This conference showed that EDI is no longer a
sideline, but a primary job skill that needs to be treated as
such by business and industry.

This process of maturation is good for EDI as a whole.  For
most of its life, EDI has been something that has been
relegated to the systems departments of many companies with
the advice of the commercial management to identify the
needs of the company.  EDI now has to be taken as a primary
corporate function with roots extending into both the
commercial and systems side of any enterprise.

This change in the complexion of EDI was evident in the types
of sessions presented at the conference.  In the past, these
sessions were devoted to discussions of the specific
application of EDI in specific industries.  This year that
accent changed to a more general view of the use of EDI in
business as a whole.  The subjects presented included such
topics as "EDI Support Requirements for Smaller Trading
Partners," "EDI: An Academic Perspective," and "Legal
Considerations in Planning, Establishing and Managing EDI
Programs."

All of these topics address the real business needs and
theories that underlie the true purpose for the use of EDI.
EDI is not simply a means of automating specific business
tasks, but a way of integrating the flow of information,
material, and product through a chain that starts with raw
materials, progresses through transport and manufacturing,
and ends at the ultimate consumer of the product.  This true
nature of EDI was well evident at this year's conference.

The exhibition area also reflected the view of EDI as a
profession in itself.  More exhibits than ever before showed
the tools of the EDI trade, rather than the specific
applications of EDI that are available for doing business
with specific companies.  A myriad of generalized software
packages, communications networks, and consulting services
could be seen in the exhibition area, that allow any company
to become EDI-capable in short order.  It was obvious that
EDI is now available to all levels and sizes of business, and
at a reasonable cost.

The most significant event of the conference, however, was a
luncheon address by The Honorable Esteban E. Torres, United
States House of Rep-resentatives (D-California).  Congressman
Torres used this forum to announce the proposal of a
Congressional initiative to encourage the use of EDI in small
business.  In his position as Chair of the House Small
Business Subcommittee on Environment and Labor, he stated
that he would hold a series of field hearings during the
summer of 1990 on the impact and application of EDI in the
small business community of the United States.

The Congressman also stated that he would investigate
legislation that would provide a tax credit for the use of
EDI for both small business and big business in their
interaction with small business.  These two initiatives will
go a long way to encouraging the use of EDI to an even
greater extent, and is supported by an EDIA Task Force
directed toward the Small Business Community of the United
States.  The EDI community should welcome this announcement
with open arms, and support it to the best of their ability.

We have always spoken of EDI as a concept that will lead us
all to a bright future.  I suggest that future has now
dawned, and we will move into it during the 1990's.  Many are
fond of talking of how different this world will be at the
impending change of millennium in the year 2000.  The
shifting of the world political climate, the 1992 accords in
Europe, and the proliferation of EDI both nationally and
internationally will all contribute to this.  We, in EDI, can
look with pride to the significance of our own contribution
to this change.

EDI and Third Party Managers

Middlemen on the Fast Track

By Donald R. Greenwood

The historical role of the freight forwarder and broker must
be singled out if one is to understand the dynamics of
international trade.  This market segment has traditionally
been comprised of numerous small and medium sized companies,
the majority of which employs less than five people.

Until quite recently, most of these forwarders and brokers
used little automation in their day-to-day activities.  Their
primary means of communication consisted of the telephone,
facsimile, telex, couriers, and mail.  With the introduction
of the mini- and micro- computers, many of these companies
began to automate their back office functions (i.e.,
accounting and financial functions).  However, due to a lack
of off-the-shelf software and the high cost of people to
develop new software applications, these computer systems
were rarely used in the day-to-day operation of managing the
in and outbound international shipments.

The emergence of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and its
associated value-added computer applications, has sparked a
demand for more accurate shipment information and processing.
As a result, a new player-called the logistics management
company-is emerging.  These new full-service logistics
companies manage the physical and information flow of
shipments-from the purchase order all the way through to
final delivery.

Logistics management companies are making investments in
computer hardware, application software, and communications
to support their primary business.  This investment, in turn,
is forcing changes on the forwarders and brokers to automate
their own operations.  The need for expensive technology is
making survival difficult for small and medium-sized
forwarders and brokers not servicing a niche market.

The emergence of sophisticated third party managers has
led to several acquisitions and mergers within the industry.
The resulting influx of investment capital is allowing these
companies to expand both vertically and horizontally, with
the resulting larger companies increasing their services and
locations worldwide.  If the current trend continues, it
appears that fewer and larger forwarders, or "mega-
forwarders", will be managing the movement of international
shipments.  This trend is occurring within Europe, as well as
in North America.

If one were to forecast what changes are likely to occur in
the industry in the future, I would venture to say that
the Electronic Forwarder will emerge in the mid-1990's.  The
Electronic Forwarder will be a fully automated
forwarder/broker who has access to a worldwide communications
network for the electronic exchange of documents and
shipment-related information.

It will be possible to exchange information instantaneously
between clients, carriers (both domestic and international),
ports, government agencies, off-shore forwarders and brokers,
as well as ultimate consignees.  This information will be
available totally electronically and will provide immediate
accessibility from mainframe, mini-, and micro- computers
located around the world.

New products will include applications that address both the
operational and customer support needs of the industry.  They
will meet the needs of both back-office support systems as
well as the primary activities of the companies in the
international trade industry by integrating software with a
worldwide communications network that provides:

-shipment tracking and tracing (international and domestic)
-transportation scheduling
-electronic booking
-equipment tracking and management
-export/import documentation generation and exchange
broadcast messaging EDI with full standards support.
-electronic payments
-manifesting systems
-bay plan management

Although initially these applications wil be developed for
access via micro, mini, and mainframe computers, addressing
voice response systems via a handheld telephone handset will
be addressed.  These are just a few of the applications the
GE Information Services are developing to address the needs
of the industry.

Mr. Greenwood is a senior consultant on trade and
transportation services at GE Information Services.  For more

EDI Standards

Edifact and CEN Join Forces
(Reprinted from EDIFACTS, the bulletin of the Western
European EDIFACT Board.)

In Helsinki, at a meeting held on the 27-28 September 1989,
the WE/EB arrived at an agreement with the European standards
body, CEN, which will give it associated body status.

Cen, the European Committee for Standardization, is made up
of the national standards bodies of the 18 EC and EFTA Member
States.  It works to implement harmonized standards in
Europe.

Once standards have been issued by CEN, they must be adopted
by the CEN members as national standards.  CEN has already
adopted some of the components of UN/EDIFACT, issuing the
data element directory as EN27 372 and the syntax rules as
EN29 735.  In the future, it will issue relevant UN messages
as European standards.

The signing of this new agreement will strengthen the
standards - making the role of the WE/EB, putting European
companies one step ahead in their preparations for the
integrated market place of 1992.

Technical Help To Exporters

European Certification Update

A look at what has happened to approval marks over the last
seventeen years.

In June 1972, Technical Help to Exporters' Quarterly Bulletin
featured an article on approval marks.  It looked at a range
of European marks then in existence, and the extensive use
which many European manufacturers made of them to sell into
different countries. Seventeen years on, an understanding of
the need for approval marks in the markets of different
countries remains just as important, despite moves towards
European harmonization.  All the marks shown in the 1972
article are still in existence; in fact, a few have been
added-particularly in Germany where the need for some third
party indication that a product is safe is most widespread.

It must be admitted that most serious exporters are much more
aware of the need for some sort of an approval mark than they
were seventeen years ago.  But many still think that the
'Common Market' and the approach of '1992' will obviate the
need for them to do much about it.

Directives from the European Commission on subjects such as
construction products, toys, personal protective equipment,
and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are now illustrating
a European CE mark which is intended to indicate compliance
with the directives.  In some cases a manufacturer can put
this mark on his product and thus make his own claim of
compliance.  In other cases some test results from a
'recognized' laboratory must be available to support the
claim.  This raises many questions:-Will the need for
national marks go away?  Will national marks be obsolete
after 1992? Will national marks still be applied in addition
to the CE mark, or will national marks come to mean more than
they mean today, having 'quality', 'performance', or 'fitness
for purpose' connotations?  The German government's GS mark
which means 'tested for safety' is in fact used together with
the mark of the organization which did the testing, such as
VDE, TUV, BG, RAL, etc.

In the UK the British Standars Institute (BSI) Kitemark which
has existed since 1902 and the Safety Mark which was
developed in 1973 both mean something to purchasers in
Britain.  Both require a product not just to be safe but also
to be backed up, by BSI, as an indication of established
quality control.  The license has to satisfy BSI that his
manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing a
product made under quality controlled conditions.  Other
countries' marks indicate a similar process and are
recognized as such by purchasers in these countries.  They
are not, therefore, going to disappear overnight in 1992 just
because the Commission publishes a directive which
promulgates a CE mark.

Maybe one day we shall see fewer certification marks than
there are today but, as in the USA, it will be the market
place that will determine which, or even if, a certain mark
is needed.  Exporters can not ignore the need for
certification now and in the future.

Standards Europe

Report of US - EC Standards Discussions

Report provided by the Department of Commerce

On October 4 and 5, 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce and
U.S. private sector experts met with experts on standards-
related matters from the European Community Commission and
the Committee for European Standardization (CEN) and the
Committee for European Electrotechnical Standardization
(CENELEC) to discuss U.S. concerns arising from the EC's 1992
initiatives to harmonize European standards, testing, and
certification.

Mandate and Objective

This was the first meeting between the United States and the
European Community that brought government and private sector
experts together for a detailed review of standards-related
matters.  In recent months, representatives of U.S. and
European private sector standards interests met on these
issues.  However, there was a growing and an overwhelming
expectation from the users of standards that governments
needed to formally engage on this matter to develop a broad
and balanced review.

It was expected that this meeting would clear up confusion
and misunderstanding and relieve concern stemming from the
EC's EC 1992 initiatives in standards, testing and
certification.  It was further expected that, where problems
were identified, the governments and their private sectors
would determine the appropriate next steps.

The meetings resulted from a May 31 agreement between U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher and the EC Commission
Vice President Martin Bangemann.  At that time the U.S. and
the EC governments agreed that they:

-share the goal that the EC's single market should contribute
to sustaining an effective liberalization of trade and
investment.

-commit to the work of international standardization bodies
and the principle of transparency in standardization, testing
and certification.

-afford imports equal access to testing and certification
procedures as enjoyed by domestic products.

-encourage the recently-initiated exchanges between European
and United States standards bodies that advance these goals.

-meet and formally discuss any issues of mutual concern
regarding regulations, private sector standards activity, or
access to testing and certification for products.

Standards Development In The European Community

The European Community has devised a series of sectoral
strategies to terminate trade barriers within the EC market
due to standards-related practices.  These strategies follow
two general frameworks-one for regulated products and one for
non-regulated products.

The European Community intends to regulate food, drugs,
autos, and tractors by issuing mandatory harmonized European
technical specifications legislated entirely by the EC
Commission.  Any product meeting these legislated standards
is guaranteed the free circulation of the entire EC market.

The European Commmunity also intends to legislate harmonized
essential requirements covering safety, consumer protection,
and the environment for a wide range of products listed in
the Annex.  Products able to meet these essential
requirements are guaranteed free circulation throughout the
European Community.

The essential requirements and the criteria to meet these
essential requirements differ widely from product to product
depending on the level of risk and commercial factors.  Each
EC product directive specifies these differences.  Directives
are published in the EC Official Journal.

These product specific directives mandate the criteria to be
applied for declaring conformity to the mandatory
requirements, types of testing, and the nature of the
certification required in order to market the product in the
European Community.

The EC Commission has asked the European standards entities,
CEN and CENELEC to develop voluntary product standards that
in general are presumed to meet the mandatory requirements in
the EC directives.  In the case of construction products, the
EC Commission is developing "interpretative documents" and
code-type standards that concern the general safety
requirements of the building and engineering works themselves
which will ultimately be regulations.  At the same time,
CEN/CENELEC is developing voluntary standards for the
products that fall under this sector.

For telecommunications equipment and software, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute is developing
harmonized standards for terminal equipment and software.
These standards must be adopted by telecommunications
administrations in Europe.  Any product meeting these
standards is free to circulate in the European Community.

All other products not covered by directives are unregulated.
Technical specifications associated with the sale of these
products are those specified between a willing buyer and a
willing seller.  Such unregulated products are guaranteed
free circulation throughout the community.

Freedom of circulation in the EC Community for regulated and
unregulated products is supported by the legal principle of
mutual recognition.  That is, any product that is able to be
sold in one EC member state market is guaranteed access to
all other EC markets.

For the regulated products listed in the annex, the
CEN/CENELEC needs to develop 900 product standards by
January 1, 1993.  In the event that harmonized CEN/CENELEC
standards are not completed by that date, the European
Community will adopt an interim standard until the
CEN/CENELEC work can be completed.  This interim standard
will probably be selected from the existing European
standards which most closely approximates the requirements in
the EC legislation.  The EC could select a non-EC standard.
The EC probably will not allow the mutual recognition of
existing national standards as the transition.

Although the EC Commission has no intention of changing
product standards legislation already adopted, in certain
instances current legislation will be amended to simplify
requirements within product groups and improve consistency of
approach for companies.  For example, the machinery directive
will be amended to include small forklift trucks and lifting
and loading equipment which were covered by previous
legislation.  In like manner, the EC is reevaluating the
consistency of approach for electrical products which could
result in amendments to recent directives and the termination
of older directives.

Because the EC product directives were developed over a
period of 5 years or more, there are a variety of
inconsistent requirements for products regarding testing,
certification and marking.  The EC Commission can be expected
to develop various amendments as the system evolves.

For telecommunications equipment and software, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute is developing
harmonized standards for terminal equipment and software.
These standards must be adopted by telecommunications
administrations in Europe.  Any product meeting these
standards is free to circulate in the European Community.

All other products not covered by directives are unregulated.
Technical specifications associated with the sale of these
products are those specified between a willing buyer and a
willing seller.  Such unregulated products are guaranteed
free circulation throughout the community.

Freedom of circulation in the EC Community for regulated and
unregulated products is supported by the legal principle of
mutual recognition.  That is, any product that is able to be
sold in one EC member state market is guaranteed access to
all other EC markets.

For the regulated products listed in the annex, the
CEN/CENELEC needs to develop 900 product standards by
January 1, 1993.

In the event that harmonized CEN/CENELEC standards are not
completed by that date, the European Community will adopt an
interim standard until the CEN/CENELEC work can be completed.
This interim standard will probably be selected from the
existing European standards which most closely approximates
the requirements in the EC legislation.  The EC could select
a non-EC standard.  The EC probably will not allow the mutual
recognition of existing national standards as the
transition.

Although the EC Commission has no intention of changing
product standards legislation already adopted, in certain
instances current legislation will be amended to simplify
requirements within product groups and improve consistency of
approach for companies.  For example, the machinery directive
will be amended to include small forklift trucks and lifting
and loading equipment which were covered by previous
legislation.  In like manner, the EC is reevaluating the
consistency of approach for electrical products which could
result in amendments to recent directives and the termination
of older directives.

Because the EC product directives were developed over a
period of 5 years or more, there are a variety of
inconsistent requirements for products regarding testing,
certification and marking.  The EC Commission can be expected
to develop various amendments as the system evolves.

The European Community requires all member states to regulate
further national standards development so that new standards
activity does not interfere in the EC internal market.
Generally, member states must notify the EC of new national
standards development proposals and the EC Commission must
decide if it wants to intercede with a proposal for the
development of an EC-wide standard.  Also, under the Single
European Act, EC member states may keep a previously existing
essential requirement more stringent than the EC proposal if
the EC Commission agrees.  These are the only exceptions to
the harmonization process.

International Standardization and EC 1992

In order to complete its work by January 1, 1993, CEN/CENELEC
has stated that it wants to use international standards (ISO
and IEC standards) where these standards are appropriate to
meet the EC's essential requirements and the standards can be
developed in a timely manner.

The United States stated that sole reliance on ISO/IEC
requires effort to make the ISO/IEC activities and procedures
relevant to manufacturers and professionals in the respective
markets.

The United States stated that it was interested in using the
ISO/IEC forum as one of the ways to participate in the EC
standards development. In some products, the EC had adopted
IEC and ISO standards.  However, in many product areas there
was no international work, international work had been
blocked, or international work was not being used.

The United States government and the EC Commission agreed to
review the ability of their respective private standards
bodies to live up to their commitment to use international
standards.

Transparency of EC Commission and CEN/CENELEC

The EC Commission will not share early drafts of EC
directives.  The only official access to information on
essential requirements is in the EC Official Journal.

The EC Commission is willing to consult with U.S. interests
at any point over its regulations.  CEN/CENELEC stated that
it has recently instituted several changes to make its
process more transparent to non-members. CEN/CENELEC
publishes draft standards and monthly activity reports that
summarize working group activities.  These publications are
available through ANSI New York City.

CEN/CENELEC has agreed to accept comments from U.S. interests
through ANSI in New York City.  Comments may be made at any
stage of standardization.

ANSI intends to submit all U.S. comments on CEN/CENELEC
standards activities to review by the Technical Advisory
Groups (TAGs) before being submitted to CEN/CENELEC.  In
the absence of TAGs, ANSI intends to submit comments directly
to CEN/CENELEC.

CEN/CENELEC have encouraged their working groups to accept
oral presentations from non-EC interests.

ANSI reported that its proposal to ISO to have members of the
ISO technical committees participate in the standards
development work of the CEN/CENELEC had been refused. ANSI
reported that CEN agreed to joint review of work plans.

The US government and the EC Commission agreed to review the
effectiveness of these methods of transparency worked out
between CEN/CENELEC and ANSI.

Testing and Certification

For regulated products, on the date of implementation of EC
product directives, the European Community intends to allow
only the sale of such products that bear a CE mark of
conformity to EC essential requirements.  Regulated products
without this mark cannot be sold in the EC.

The ECE mark will signify that the regulated products have
complied with the EC essential requirements and will be
allowed free circulation in the EC.

The CE mark signifies that the product conforms with the
essential requirements in the EC directives in a manner
specified in the applicable EC product directive.

While many of these product directives rely on CEN/CENELEC
product standards, other standards may be recognized and in
some product directives adherence to standards are not
expected.

No mark is required for non-regulated products except those
agreed by a willing buyer and seller.

Additional marks will continue to be affixed to products as
"quality" marks signifying performance or safety levels more
stringent than that specified by the CE mark.  Absence of
those national "quality" marks does not affect the legal
right to market a product.

For the most part, the date of implementation of these EC
product directives is in 1992 but no later than January 1,
1993.  (Toys, pressure vessels and electromagnetic
compatibility are implemented in 1990 and 1991).

EC product directives covering products listed in the annex
specify the means of proving conformance.  These mandatory
procedures offer some flexibility to manufacturers to choose
among options to show compliance but the specific directive
dictates the type of conformance procedure and these
requirements must be met.

Proof of conformance requires that the CE mark be affixed to
the product.  Depending on the EC product directive, the CE
mark can be affixed by the manufacturer or an approved body.

Interpretation of essential requirements related to EC
product directives summarized on the previous pages and the
interpretation of compliance with European Norms or standards
generated by CEN/CENELEC rely upon approved bodies to perform
tests, certify compliance, audit quality control systems and
so on.

At this time, member state governments are the only entities
that can approve these testing and certifying bodies to
perform the services required in the EC directives.

The EC Commission states that approved bodies in the EC must
carry out the third party intervention in a non-
discriminatory manner.

At this time, member states will only approve entities to
perform services required by the EC directives that are
located within their national boundaries.  Member states also
are required to accept the approvals of all other member
states in the products covered by the directives.

Selected EC product directives rely on accreditation of
quality assurance techniques in manufacturing plants as the
means to show compliance with an essential requirement.
CEN/CENELEC has adopted EN29000 series standards on quality
assurance to advance harmonization.  EN29000 is the European
version of ISO 9000.

In like manner, EC testing labs, inspection and certifying
bodies follow EN45000 standards on establishing competence of
bodies.  CEN/CENELEC is developing sectoral elaborations for
these rules as well as EN29000.

It is EC Commission's recommendation that in the future
foreign bodies be approved to perform regulated activities
called for in the EC product directives outside the EC.  In
order to have any force in the marketplace, the EC Council
must adopt the EC Commission recommendation.  Council
adoption may come as soon as January 1990.

The EC Commission has recommended that foreign testing and
certifying bodies be required to satisfy the same criteria
for becoming an EC approving authority as is inherently
applied to the EC testing and certifying authorities.
Therefore, foreigners must be prepared to:

-guarantee adherence to the EC essential requirements

-adopt EN29000 and EN45000 series of standards as the basic
technical instruments for performing regulated activities.
(Any sectoral adaptations to these basic series developed by
the EC must also be complied with.)

-competence must be maintained on a continuous basis.

-guarantees must be developed for equivalent and equal access
to the market provide for mutual benefits under the systems.

In the case of foreign approvals the EC will look for a
national system that can guarantee that approval bodies meet
EC requirements.  This does not have to be the U.S.
government nor does it have to be a single system for all
products or approvals.

The EC Commission expects that the approved bodies notified
under the directives will carry out the negotiations with
third country entities to establish mutual recognition
agreements.  EC Council will approve these agreements before
they can be implemented to assure that the objectives of the
EC have been met.

All existing bilateral agreements between EC member state
testing and certifying bodies and third country bodies will
have to be transposed (renegotiated) as EC-wide bilateral
agreements when the EC product directives are implemented
under the conditions stated above including "mutual
benefits."

In addition to the CE mark, many EC directives require
additional product labels that give an EC contact point for
the manufacturer.  In virtually all directives, the European
standard developed by CEN/CENELEC carries additional weight
that aids the manufacturer to establish conformity to the
essential requirements in the EC product directive.

Administration, Washington D.C. 20230.

1992 Center in the U.S.

George Mason University Center

Focus on 1992

George Mason University's Center for European Community (EC)
Studies, which opened last month in Norfolk, Virginia, is no
ivory tower enterprise.  The Center was established with the
explicit purpose of providing the business community with
information and assistance in understanding developments in
European efforts to establish a single market by 1992.

GMU's designation as a European Documentation Center, by the
European Commission in Brussels, will help it to accomplish
this goal.  The Center will receive all EC official
publications and will have unlimited access to EC databases
in Brussels and Luxembourg.  With these resources, it will be
a unique information base for Northern Virginia and the
greater Washington area; both of which generate a strong
demand for international economic information.

The colleges of George Mason University will also benefit
from the center's resources, as well as its promotion of
research, conferences, and seminars on EC issues.  The
undertaking of collaberative research projects between
European and American academics will also benefit the rest of
the University.

Another GMU program of particular interest to exporters is
the Entrepreneurship Institute.  Established in 1986, the
institute has focused its efforts on encouraging
entrepreneurial approaches to business.  On the international
level, the institute aims to promote export expansion,
particularly amongst small, high-technology companies.  The
European center will give impetus to their efforts by
providing access to information about the latest developments
in the European market.

The EC Center will also house the headquarters of the
European Community Studies Association (ECSA), an association
of European scholars and researchers in the United States.
The organization held its first conference in May 1989 with
its second planned for May 1991.

European Community Studies, George Mason University, Suite

Predex Forecast

Update of a Ten-Year Forecast

Provided by Predex Corp.

The Rand

Ten years ago a client asked us to forecast the rand ten
years out.  Last March the Financial Mail reported the
results (see below), and wondered how the model, updated with
data of the past decade, would forecast the next ten years.
Under the conditions described below, this simple model sees
the rand recovering in 1990-91.

How bad can a worst-case scenario be?  Worse even than a
forecaster's wildest expectations.  A 10-year projection on
the rand, made in 1980 by U.S. currency analyst Charles
Ramond, plotted a series of alternative outcomes based on 12
different scenarios-and failed to come up with any estimate
as bad as reality.

Though Ramond, president of Predex Corporation, "oldest
independent forecaster of currencies," correctly interpreted
the trend, he failed to foresee the strength of the forces
working against the rand.  His worst-case prediction was
pitched at a rand of around US75 cents in 1988 - instead of
the 43 cents it actually averaged last year.

Why was reality so much worse than expected?

Within the confines of the model, two assumptions turned out
to be grossly understated.  The predictions thrown out by
what Ramond describes as a naive model were based on two
factors: the real price of gold (the price adjusted for US
inflation), and US inflation in relation to the SA inflation
rate.

When the forecast was written in 1980, says Ramond, the rand
had been worth between $1,15-$1,40 for most of 14 years.
"Inflation was raging worldwide, US long rates were nearing
20% and a Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman named Volcker was
about to throttle that inflation with the deepest US
recession since World War 2."

As a result of Volcker's success, Ramond was wrong in two of
three assumptions. Though he correctly predicted SA's
inflation rate was likely to be higher than that of the US if
it was not the same, he did not foresee:

-The real gold price falling, as it has uninterruptedly up
until the present; or

-The wide divergence between inflation rates in the US and
SA.

Ramond estimated the lowest year-on-year change in US CPI
would be 5%. "It actually reached 2% before rising again.
Similarly for SA, the highest CPI we assumed in any year was
14%-which it has exceeded for the past four years."

Factors not taken into account by the model, which exerted a
powerful influence on the rand in recent years, were capital
flight and credit sanctions.  The effect of these is
illustrated in the graph which carries a forecast based on
actual gold prices and relative inflation rates of the US and
SA, contrasted with what happened in the years to 1988. The
discrepancy is due to factors outside the model.

Crucial to the future course of the rand is the continuing
success of US monetary policy.

On this score Ramond has some reservations.  He says, in
a recent presentation on the US economy, present Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan referred to an (unidentified) economic
indicator which has been flashing warnings of inflation for
several years.  And, as a result, he has been attempting to
choke back growth in M2 since last March.

Ramond believes Greenspan's attempts to hold down
inflationary forces may be undermined by monetisation of
debts of the devasted savings and loan industry.

What is bad news for the US may then bring a measure of good
to SA.

Political Risk Letter

Country Updates

Political and Economic Forecasts from PRS, a division of IBC
USA.

Changes in Eastern Europe

This article is a summary of a special report in the
December 1989 issue of Country Forecasts, which contains
detailed analysis and comparative rankings of the countries
of Eastern Europe.

Irreversible Momentum for Economic Liberalization:

The introduction of market mechanism in the Soviet Union and
most of the other Eastern European states is irreversible.
At the same time, the movement toward open economies will be
slow and tortuous.  Many pockets of political and
bureaucratic opposition remain to disrupt reform, so that the
rules of the game will be altered frequently.  The key
elements will be ability of Gorbachev to remain in power in
the Soviet Union and the progress made in East Germany toward
economic coordination with West Germany.

Political reform, on the other hand, will proceed at a much
slower pace, with movement toward liberalization intermixed
with repression.  Political liberalization may even be
stymied, particularly if nationality conflict increases
substantially in the Soviet Union.  However, even a return to
widespread political repression, would only slow, not
reverse, economic liberalization.

Business Prospects Are Improved, But Limited:

Within the next 3 to 5 years the risks of unexpected and
unusual costs outweigh the potential for profits except for
the sale of products and services that improve the base for
long-range economic development.

Key Risk Factors:

-A chronic shortage of foreign currency.

-Poor training, experience, and attitude among both labor and
management.

-An entrenched bureaucracy resistant to change.

These problems are similar to those that plague most Third
World countries.  The difference with Eastern Europe is that
its economies, while under-developed, contain much more
potential than those of Africa and Latin America.  The
workforce is relatively educated and the underclass is
relatively small.  In addition, the economic development of
Eastern Europe is a much higher priority to the countries of
Western Europe than economic development in Latin America or
sub-Sahara Africa is to the industrialized countries.

Better business prospects are by no means certain.  In any
case, the opportunities will not be uniform throughout
Eastern Europe. Continued improvement depends on several
economic and political conditions, including avoidance of
nationallity conflicts and territorial disputes; continued
cooperation between the United States and the USSR; the
coming to power of competent leadership in Eastern Europe;
and adequate aid and investment from OECD countries.

If these conditions were to develop, the economies of most
Eastern European countries could be equal in strength and
business potential to some of the newly industrialized
countries by the year 2000.

Pre-1945 Economic Performance Will Be A Guide To The
Future:

In estimating the varying strengths and weaknesses of the
economies of Eastern Europe, the health of the economies
prior to World War II is a better guideline than the current
political attitudes toward reform.  It is easier to change
political leaders, official government policies, and even
ideology than the attitudes of potential business managers,
the discipline and skill of the labor force, and economic
infrastructure.  In addition to these crucial long-term
economic factors, it is also necessary to look at each
country's debt, hard currency positions, and experience with
private market mechanism during the last forty years.  Based
on these political, economic, and financial considerations
Eastern European countries are ranked below-from the best to
worst-with respect to climate for international business over
the next ten years:

(1) East Germany
(2) Czechoslovakia
(3) Hungary
(4) Poland
(5) Romania
(6) USSR
(7) Bulgaria
(8) Yugoslavia

The events in Eastern Europe will have a variety of effects
on other parts of the world.  Most important is in Western
Europe, especially West Germany. German firms already have a
head start on trade and investment in Eastern Europe, and
will be able to move quickly to take advantage of the new
opportunities in the region.  The movement toward EC 1992
will not be significantly slowed by recent events, as long as
the question of German reunification does not become a
stumbling block.  Firms from North America and Japan will
find it much more difficult than European firms to capitalize
on developments on the continent.

Bulgaria-Slow Economic Reform

After resisting pressure for reform from both the Soviet
Union and within the country, Bulgaria's long-term leader,
Tidor Zhivkov, stepped down in November.  The government had
permitted more dissent in recent months despite occasional
crackdowns, and had allowed some private activity in the
service sector at the urging of the Soviet Union.  However,
events in East Germany in November appear to have convinced
the leadership that Zhivkov had to go and that economic
reform had to be pursued more vigorously.

Poor economic conditions and resistance from within the
bureaucracy and party will limit the speed of economic
reform.  The new leadership itself is drawn from those who
were influential in the Zhivkov regime.  The new Communist
party leader is Petar Mladenov who was the Foreign Minister
udner the previous regime for 18 years.  The most crucial
factor, however, will be the degree of economic progress in
the more reformist Eastern Europe.  Bulgaria will continue to
follow rather than lead in dismantling the state control of
its economy.

Brazil-Collor Slight Favorite

The first state of the voting has left a clear choice for the
Brazilian electorate which votes on December 17th.  The
front-runner in the first round was the forty year old former
state governor, Fernando Collor de Mello, who will face the
labor leader Luis Inacio da Silva, popularly referred to as
Lula. Collor is advocating privatization and austerity and
openness to international business while Lula is calling for
strong central government control, land reform, and less
openness to international business.

With a television debate and stronger party base for Lula,
Collor will have a tough time winning the election despite
his strong showing in the first election.  However, support
from the center and right along with his youth should enable
him to win a close race. Because the two houses of Congress
are likely to be hopelessly divided among several parties,
whoever wins the presidency is likely to pursue policies less
extreme than the positions they currently advocate.
Nevertheless, a victory by Collor is much preferred by the
domestic and international business community.

China-Business Conditions Decline

Despite an attempt to attract new foreign investment with
promises of more open-door policies, the government will be
unable to reverse declines touched off by the student
uprising in June 1989.  Foreign exchange reserves are
drastically down, from $19 billion in April to $14 billion in
June.  Foreign debt service payments to reach peak in the
1990-1992 period, although the debt service ratio is still
low compared with other Third World countries.  China will be
paying higher interest rates because of a reduced credit
rating by international financial institutions.

Japanese businesses have maintained their investments in
China, but Japanese banks are not likely to put in more
money.  Several joint-venture automobile factories have been
forced to close because of reduced domestic demand and
bureaucratic inaction.  More restrictions on imports can be
expected to protect foreign reserves.

Tough austerity measures have slowed growth and halted what
was becoming a runaway inflation.  However, popular
dissatisfaction with the measures will require tight
political control, which will further reduce worker morale.
The replacement of troops with police at key points in
Beijing will likely be followed by other symbolic acts on the
political front, such as the removal of martial law, in order
to reduce human rights pressure.  Business interests have
lost influence among the leadership, and the ascendance of
the hardliners is likely to last for some time.

Shipping Regulations

Report on the 1984 Shipping Act

The following has been abstracted from an executive summary
of the Section 18 Report on The Shipping Act of 1984,
published by the Federal Maritime Commission, September 1989.

Overview

Under the 1984 Act's new agreement review process and
standard, the Commission experienced (a) an increase in the
average number of agreements and modifications filed each
year; (b) a reduction in average processing time per
agreement; and (c) a decline in the cost of proceedings
before the Commission.  These changes freed more Commission
resources for expanded enforcement actions which brought
about significant increases in penalty collections.

These procedural improvements also enabled the Commission to
devote more time to address foreign government restraints on
shipping.  The Commission instituted more proceedings under
section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, since enactment
of the 1984 Act than at any other comparable period of time.
These Commission actions have had a positive influence on
trading conditions in the US foreign commerce.

The 1984 Act's reforms did not bring about the negative
consequences that some observers predicted.  The creation of
"superconferences" and the increase in rationalization
agreements did not result in sharp rate increases,
curtailment of shipping services, or loss of independent
carrier competition.  The 1984 Act did not have a significant
impact on rate levels, service frequency, and the strength of
independent competition.  The US trades remained open and
competitive.

The popularity of the IA and the service contract provisions
of the 1984 Act led to a disagreement about whether common
carriage obligations should be relaxed.  In particular, major
shippers have called for a greater role for contract
carriage.  These shippers would like Congress to establish a
clear distinction between common carriage under tariff rates
and carriage under service contracts.  They would (a) require
that the terms of service contracts be kept confidential; and
(b) prohibit conferences from restricting the right to their
members to enter into service contracts.

Carriers, on the other hand, assert that these steps would
ultimately undermine the tariff system, the conference
system, and the principle of common carriage in ocean
shipping.  Instead, they advocate continued filing and
publication of the "essential terms" of service contracts and
the availability of those terms to similarly situated
shippers.

The Impact of the 1984 Act on the International Shipping
Industry

As required by the 1984 Act, the Commission collected and
analyzed information on the Act's impact on rates, service,
independent carriers, and regulatory proceedings.  In
addition, the Commission conducted a series of annual surveys
to solicit the views of the maritime industry on the
consequences of the 1984 Act.  These survey results were
supplemented by policy papers presented by industry
representatives serving on the Section 18 Study Advisory
Committee.

The major conclusions to be drawn from this information are
as follows.

Data and Analysis on the Impact of the 1984 Act

(1) The Commission experienced an increase in the average
number of carrier agreements and modifications filed each
year, and a reduction in the average processing time per
agreement.

(2) Changes in the agreement review process and standard of
review made easier the creation of superconferences and the
use of conference intermodal authority.

(3) The 45-day agreement effectiveness provision in the 1984
Act decreased the average processing time for agreements to
become effective to less than one-third of that required for
approval prior to the 1984 Act.  The total cost of major
proceedings declined as well.

(4) Following implementation of the 1984 Act, there was a
decline in the number of major proceedings before the
Commission coupled with a modest increase in the average
length of those proceedings.  The Commission was able,
therefore, to concentrate its resources on more complex
proceedings and other issues, including enforcement cases and
strategies.

(5) Independent action rates and service contracts expanded
the commercial options available to the shipping public.  In
some trades, port-to-port tariff rates became the exception
rather than the rule.

(6) The main factors that explain freight rate structures
(value, tonnage, distance, direction, stowage, refrigeration)
did not change appreciably as a result of the 1984 Act.
Where change was noted - in the significance of the direction
variable (i.e., outbound US versus inbound US)- the most
likely cause appeared to be trade flow imbalances, rather
than provisions of the 1984 Act.

(7) Quarterly rate data on the major moving commodities in 18
US trades between 1976 and 1988 indicate that fluctuations in
the supply of and demand for liner shipping services - not IA
and service contract provisions -were the basic cause of the
rate changes that occurred after implementation of the 1984
Act.

(8) A comparative study of rate stability in 18 US trades
before and after implementation of the 1984 Act indicates
that only six US/Pacific trades experienced a decrease in
rate stability.  However, that decrease began in 1982,
suggesting that changes in the international economy were the
primary cause.

(9) A comparison of shipping capacity growth rates before and
after implementation of the 1984 Act showed that, of the six
US trades studied (North Europe, the North Pacific, the South
Pacific, Italy, Australia and Brazil), three trades exhibited
no dramatic changes in growth; two trades showed significant
increases in capacity growth; and one trade, the Australia
trade, showed a decrease in capacity growth.  These results
suggest that the prevailing economic conditions in specific
trades, rather than particular provisions of the 1984 Act,
were the important influences on the level of capacity
provided to shippers.

(10) A comparison of the largest US trade, the Pacific trade,
with the largest non-US trade, North Europe/Far East,
involving nine basic service parameters, revealed broadly
similar patterns of change during 1984 to 1988 period.  These
results further support the view that factors other than the
1984 Act were mainly responsible for changes in service
levels.

(11) Data from the six trades studied indicate that no
contraction in the average number of direct ship calls
occurred between 1984-1988.  In fact, the average number of
calls made annually in the US port regions studied increased
slightly.

(12) As inland transport costs declined relative to all-water
transport costs, service concentration at the US range
closest to the foreign destination increased.

(13) The relative strength of independent carriers, as
reflected in the proportion of total shipping capacity
provided, has changed little since the implementation of the
1984 Act.  In some individual trades, such as the North
Europe trade, independents made significant market share
inroads.

(14) Independent carriers made significant gains in terms of
tonnage carried in the largest US trade, i.e., the Pacific
trade.

(15) Comparisons of value-to-tonnage ratios between
conference and independent carriers show that in most US
trades, conference cargo mixes yield a higher ratio.  But
figures also show that independent carriers reduced the
difference between their ratio and those of the conferences
in most US trades.  Independents appear to be increasing the
proportion of high-valued cargo in their cargo mix.

(16) The Brazil trade, with its bilateral maritime agreement,
revenue pooling agreements, and cargo reservation laws, is
characterized by high conference market share with no
independent action on rates.

Industry Views on the 1984 Shipping Act

The views offered by various industry segments affected by
the 1984 Act varied widely.  They varied both across
industries and within each industry.  A presentation of each
industry group's views is contained in Chapter 7.  To the
extent that consensus exists on some key points, the
following broad conclusions can be drawn:

(1) There is industry support for retaining an "open"
conference system in the US trades.  Alternative approaches,
such as prohibiting conferences or allowing "closed"
conferences, had little support.

(2) A majority of the international ocean shipping industry
supported the proposition that tariffs continue to be filed
with, and enforced by, the FMC.

(3) The revised agreement review process in the 1984 Act has
proven beneficial.

(4) The more controversial 1984 Act provisions are (a) the
mandatory independent action provision, and (b) the provision
permitting service contracts.  Generally, shippers tended to
endorse shorter notice periods for IA and the extension of IA
to service contracts, while carriers tended to prefer the
opposite.

Volume and Mass Tariff System

(1) In response to Commission surveys, neither users nor
providers of tariffs favored a system of tariffs based solely
on volume and mass (i.e., weight or measure) or a
freight-all-kinds system.

(2) An analysis of the economic implications of adopting a
system of tariffs based on volume and mass suggests that such
a system could cause distortions in the existing
transportation system.

(3) Volume and mass tariffs might lead to a simpler system,
and therefore require less regulatory oversight.  Such a
system could also:

(a) reduce the movement of low-valued cargo in the US trades;

(b) increase the impact of IA on conferences;

(c) create distortions in the choice of ports if Canada, for
example, does not impose a similar system; and

(d) complicate intermodal ratemaking.

(4) Based on both data and theory, it is difficult to make a
case for adopting a system of tariffs based on volume and
mass of shipment.

(5) There was some support, especially among shippers, for a
lump-sum per container system.  This suggests support a more
simplified tariff structure.

(6) There is little data to support the contention that the
current rate structure results from conferences' exercise of
monopoly power.

Antitrust Immunity for Ports and Marine Terminal Operators

(1) The regulation of marine terminals was a reaction to the
pricing policies of railroad-owned marine terminals and their
effects on competition among shippers lines.  The current
system of terminal control and coordination by state-
sponsored public port authorities does not present similar
threats to competition.

(2) The need for antitrust immunity to lessen excessive
competition depends on one's theoretical point of view.  The
neoclassical economic interpretation concludes that there is
no strong case for antitrust immunity.  On the other hand,
the Austrian economic view states that a case can be made for
granting antitrust immunity.

(3) Public or quasi-public agencies are not motivated solely
by economic considerations, and antitrust principles based on
the traditional ideas of competition may not be fully
applicable.  Interport conferences that include members from
two or more states generally are not successful in reducing
interport competition.

(4) There is no clear public benefit in allowing private
marine terminal operators to collectively fix rates and
charges within a port.  Granting antitrust protection for
such purposes may not be necessary or economically
justifiable.

(5) The need to provide antitrust immunity for port
authorities and private terminal operators to allow "parity"
with carrier conferences is questionable.  Carriers'
bargaining strength over terminal leases or services is
generally due to port-related geographical and logistical
factors and the availability of alternative ports-of-call,
not to the carriers' 1984 Act antitrust immunity.

(6) Public port authorities may enjoy protection from US
antitrust laws even without 1984 Act antitrust immunity.
However, not all ports may enjoy the same level of immunity.
This could result in a nonuniform application of antitrust
immunity.

(7) Whether to retain the current 1984 Act antitrust immunity
provisions dealing with marine terminals, or to limit them
only to public port authorities, or to remove them
altogether, requires a value judgment that balances all
regulatory concerns.  These include economic analysis,
antitrust policy, state and federal regulatory
responsibilities, and established industry practices.

FMC Tariff Filing and Enforcement

(1) The historical record reflects a continuing reliance on
tariff filing and enforcement.

(2) Based on annual survey responses, a majority of the
shipping industry favor the continuation of the existing
tariff filing and enforcement system.

(3) Surveys indicate that carriers believe they should
continue to have the right to file excepted commodity rates,
but oppose IA on these rates.  Shippers are divided on the
filing issue but favor mandatory IA on excepted commodity
rates.

(4) Surveys of the tariff filing and enforcement practices of
foreign governments reveal a trend towards increased tariff
regulation.

(5) The commission would find it difficult to meet its
legislatively mandated responsibilities in the absence of
tariff requirements.

(6) Of the policy options considered, only the existing
system ensures a nondiscriminatory ocean transportation
system.

(7) The existing tariff filing and enforcement mechanism, in
an open conference environment, can promote market
efficiency, ensure fair treatment of shippers by carriers,
and preserve just competition between carriers.

Summaries of Supplementary Reports

Service Contracts

(1) Service contracts have had a significant impact upon the
maritime community.  During the period of study, carriers and
conferences filed 17,103 service contracts and substantial
amounts of cargo moved under those contracts.

(2) Sixty-nine percent of service contract filings were by
independents (or individual conference carriers), and 31
percent were by conferences.

(3) Evergreen Line filed more service contracts (2,333) than
any other carrier or conference.  The Asia North America
Eastbound Rate Agreement ("ANERA") had the second highest
total (1,317), and the North Europe-U.S. Atlantic Conference
was third (1,253).

(4) There was a wide variation in rates between service
contracts and tariffs for similar commodities carried by
conferences.

(5) Industry opinions are mixed on both effects of service
contracts and the extent to which the service contract
provisions of the 1984 Act should be amended.

(a) Since 1986, carriers have increasingly indicated that
service contracts have had a positive impact on their firms.

(b) Shippers, especially those who have successfully
negotiated them, view service contracts favorably.

(c) Majority support existed in the maritime community for
continuing to require that the essential terms of service
contracts be made publicly available.

However, a significant number of shippers prefer confidential
contracts.

(d) Carriers oppose, while shippers support requiring
independent action on service contracts.

Independent Action

(1) IA allows conference members to offer lower rates and
more responsive service to shippers.  IA enhances the
competitiveness and flexibility of conferences because the
members are able to compete both among themselves and with
independents.  If intraconference competition becomes too
intense, the ability of the conference to stabilize rates can
be threatened.  Although mandatory independent action may
have expedited changes in tariff rates, market conditions
determined their ultimate levels.

(2) The large number of IAs taken by two conferences in the
Pacific trades, the Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement
("TWRA") AND ANERA, may reflect the level of competition from
independents in those trades.  The recent decrease in the use
of IAs by TWRA carriers may be explained by growing US
exports that have served to reduce excess shipping capacity.
Slowing imports may be the reason for the growing use of IA
by ANERA carriers.

(3) Mandatory independent action in conference agreements was
not subject to as much debate as was the length of the
maximum IA notice period.  The current ten-day maximum period
was opposed by carriers and supported by shippers.  While the
ten-day notice period may have facilitated carrier rate
reductions, it did not cause them.  The cause was more likely
overtonnaging.

(4) Service contract rates were affected by IA on tariff
rates because tariff rates were often the basis for
negotiating service contract rates.

(5) It is difficult to formulate specific conclusions
concerning IA on service contracts (i.e., a member's right to
enter into individual service contracts), because of the
minimal amount of such activity under the 1984 Act.  The
impact of service contract IA on the conference's ability to
establish uniform rates in an overtonnaged market could last
longer than for IA on tariffs, because a service contract
effectively diverts at least a portion of a shipper's cargo
from other carriers for the duration of the contract (rather
than for a single voyage).

Technical Adjustments, Clarifications, and Anomalies

The Commission has identified certain provisions of the 1984
Act which are unclear or might create unintended effects.
these provisions are discussed in the Section 18 Report's
final chapter.

KENNEDY, D'AMATO ADD LIBYA TO IRAN OIL
SANCTIONS BILL
Bill lacks the real teeth that proponents claim

The Senate on December 20 passed the Iran Oil Sanctions Act of 1995
(S. 1228), a bill sponsored by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) to
impose discretionary sanctions on  foreign companies that invest over
$40 million in the Iranian oil industry in any year.  The bill is a
watered-down incarnation of other foreign sanctions bills advanced by
D'Amato earlier in the year, and is unlikely to be enforced frequently
enough to ignite disputes with U.S. trading partners.  In a last-minute
maneuver, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) made Libya an additional
target of the sanctions bill.

The Senate passed the bill with the blessing of the Clinton administration,
which had opposed previous D'Amato proposals to cut off all U.S. trade
with foreign companies that pursue trade with Iran. The purpose of these
proposals was to bring bout an international embargo against Iran by
forcing foreign companies to choose between trading with the U.S. and
trading with Iran.

The new bill is much narrower-both in terms of the activities that trigger
the sanctions and the sanctions themselves. The administration would be
obliged to impose at least one of the following sanctions against foreign
companies that invest over $40 million in the Iranian oil industry in one
year:

*  Denial of U.S. Export-Import Bank assistance;
* Denial of export licenses for products to be shipped to sanctioned
persons;
* Prohibition on loan assistance from U.S. financial institutions
exceeding $10 million in any 12 month period; and
* Ban on the operation of financial institutions that contribute to Iran's oil
development

According to Senator D'Amato, several major European corporations will
be affected by the measure.  These companies include but are not limited
to Repsol-Spain, Agip-Italy, Total-France, Petrofina-Belgium,
OMV-Austria, and Veba-Germany.

According to Washington, D.C. attorney Eric Hirschhorn, a partner at
Winston and Strawn, the bill represents a victory for the Clinton
administration, which can now avoid the political heat of vetoing a bill
that purports to punish terrorist states. "They were going to go off a cliff
on this one," said Hirschhorn, "this is a short drop compared from the
legislation that started.  Do I like it?  No.  It is a pointless exercise and
may cause retaliation from overseas, but it could have been a lot worse."

Here's what the bill does not do and where it has been narrowed:

* It only applies to "investments" (not just trade) of over $40 million in a
12 month period;
* It no longer denies entry into the United States of executives who work
for companies subject to the bill's sanctions; and
* It no longer prohibits the importation into the United States of items
from companies subject to sanctions

The amended version of the bill was fittingly passed on the eve of the
seventh anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.  "Despite U.N. economic sanctions which have been
in force since 1992, the Government of Libya has refused to turn over
suspects, and the two suspects remain in Libya under the protection of
Colonel Qadhafi," said Kennedy on the Senate floor when introducing his
amendment.  As with Iran, the sanctions will not prohibit foreign
companies from doing business in Libya.

Hill sources claim that the House will consider similar legislation but
may attempt to make it stricter, most likely by lowering $40 million
trigger and by including import sanctions against any foreign company
that trades with, not just makes investments in, Iran.

But any attempts to beef up the bill may be more trouble than they are
worth. Administration sources say that though the administration was
originally not very excited about the bill, the final product is about the
type of bill they expected, and is one they will support.  Further, the
administration expects that the House version will closely resemble the
Senate bill.

CWC-FREE AT LAST!
Senate expected to ratify by late spring '96

Responding to pressure from exporters, the  Clinton administration and
the press, Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) has agreed to consider allowing
Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty, a
ground-breaking arms control agreement that Helms has kept bottled up
for months in the Senate Foreign Relations committee, which he heads.
Helms was keeping the CWC, along with other critical foreign policy
items-like ambassadorial nominations and the START II treaty-hostage to
his plans to downsize the State Department and its affiliated agencies, the
Agency for International Development and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.  It was unclear whether Helms had secured
concessions from the Clinton administration in return for his about face.

In a brief statement, Helms asked that the treaty be placed on the Senate
calendar by May 1 unless his committee reports it out before then.
Furthermore, he pledged to begin committee hearings on the treaty in
February.  Although Helms in the past has pilloried the treaty for weak
enforcement provisions and the possibility of non-compliance by Russia,
his committee will almost certainly deliver the treaty to the Senate floor
with a recommendation for ratification.

Republican presidential front-runner Bob Dole, eager to show deft
foreign affairs leadership, promised speedy Senate action on the treaty.
Ratification, which requires approval by two-thirds of the Senate, should
be a mere formality.

Reaction from industry was swift.  "We finally got a date certain," said
Mike Walls of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  Fred
Webber, CMA president, applauded the move: "[t]he Senate has cleared a
major hurdle and opened the way for the United States to join 44 other
nations in ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention early next year,"
he said in a press release.  "We are, today, one step closer to realizing the
treaty's goal for a future free of chemical weapons."

BXA gearing up for implementing regulations

Imminent ratification set off sirens at the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), which must coordinate treaty
compliance with U.S. chemical companies.  Larry Christensen, BXA's
regulatory guru, said that his reg-drafting team will step up its CWC work
in January and February. Christensen's office must churn out a set of
regulations that mirror the CWC's host record keeping and reporting
requirements.  Christensen said his goal is to finish the regulations
quickly to allow industry to gear up for compliance.  The sample
compliance forms that BXA has already circulated have drawn a
favorable response from chemical companies.

Had Helms not relinquished his control over CWC, U.S. producers would
be burdened with controls parallel to those that will be put on pariah
nations such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea.  Of equal
importance, the United States will now be a participant, rather than an
observer, on inspection teams.  United States officials will also be eligible
to hold positions on the CWC's Secretariat when it is established.

The treaty is widely recognized as one of most comprehensive arms
control agreements ever negotiated. It not only bans chemical weapons
,but also asserts strict control over the production and trade of chemical
warfare precursors, which include commonly traded commercial
chemicals used to make consumer goods such as clothing and paint. The
jurisdiction of the treaty is so broad, in fact, that its compliance
requirements bind companies that do not produce chemicals but merely
use them as inputs in manufacturing.

Politically, the newly pronounced action on CWC will save the United
States from international embarrassment-it was the United States that
initially led the charge for the treaty.  Once the Senate gives its
ratification, other countries will be sure to follow, pushing to ratification
total safely above the 65 countries needed for the treaty to enter into
force.  Currently, 43 countries have ratified the treaty.

But the challenge of ratification is trifling compared to the treaty's
calling: Stemming the spread of chemical weapons.  As calamities in the
Middle East and Japan over the past decade have shown, chemical
weapons are the equal opportunity equalizer of poor, technologically
backward terrorists and two-bit dictators the world over.  The CWC,
despite its lofty aims and well-conceived provisions, can no more hope to
stop rogues from acquiring chemical weapons precursors than to prevent
them from acquiring the rudimentary scientific expertise to convert them
into chemical weapons.  The hope, however, is that the treaty will act a
deterrent by strengthening the chorus of international condemnation of
chemical weapons.

ENCRYPTION AT A CROSSROADS-THE FIRST OF MANY
Industry calling for more liberal export criteria

Industry and government officials went at it again over encryption export
criteria this month at a December 5 meeting at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST).  After the government bureaucrats
and industry techies had said their piece, and the banter was finished, it
was not difficult to tell exactly what came out of the meeting. Though
there was an admirable exchange of thoughts and comments between
government and industry, one left the NIST center feeling that the whole
day there was a fruitless exercise with little impact on how the
government will control the export of sensitive encryption software.

According to one industry source who requested anonymity, despite the
change in the proposal's language (see last month's Practitioner for the
most recent draft), the government is basically sticking with its August 17
proposal as the answer to the matter and will not accept anything else.
"Basically, that is the deal" said the source.  The two sides will certainly
clash again before any final resolution is reached.

64 Bits Just Won't Do It

The most critical issue remains the number of key length bits that the
government will allow producers to export.  The debate centers around
requirement number seven of the government's latest draft for key
escrow encryption export criteria.  Requirement number seven reads as
follows:  "7.  The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall use
an unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length not to exceed
sixty-four (64) bits."

Industry is becoming increasingly more insistent that the government
increase the permissible export level to at least 80 bits, if not more.  To
put all this in context, it is important to understand the industry standard
for judging encryption.  Industry generally considers 40 bit length
encryption as "weak" encryption; 64 bit encryption is "good" encryption;
and "strong" encryption is considered to be encryption key lengths of 80
bits or more.  This includes Skipjack, 80 bits, and triple DES, with
approximately 112 bits depending on which operational mode you use.
Note that since the French broke the Netscape Navigator's 40 bit
encryption system in November, 40 bit encryption has not even been
considered "weak" encryption by many.

This all brings us back to industry's request to increase the level of
encryption key length bits that can be exported.  Banks, for instance, need
to protect millions of dollars in overseas financial transactions. The
chemical and petroleum industry have similar interests.  Though the two
sides can discuss the exact procedures regarding how a key escrow agent
will interface with government law enforcement agents, and other
logistical issues, the government, the National Security Agency in
particular, will not show any public willingness to go above  64 bits.

Other problems with the 64 bit level involve issues concerning
competitiveness rather than security.  For instance, under the latest draft's
requirements, U.S. industry will be at a great competitive disadvantage
when facing competition from unescrowed systems with over 64 bits
manufactured overseas.  Moreover, there has been a greater demand for
triple DES, a feature that is prohibited under requirement number eight in
the latest draft.

At least one industry source in the know, however, indicated that
government officials have privately expressed a willingness to consider
larger symmetric encryption key lengths.  This is conditioned, of course,
that the encryption system and the accompanying escrow arrangements
are hardware-based products that are designed to make them
tamper-proof.  Trusted Information Systems (TIS), of Glenwood, MD has
requested that the government consider for export a hardware-based
system with key lengths up to 128 bits when it is accompanied with such
a tamper-proof system.  TIS claims that the government has expressed a
willingness to discuss the request, but has not gone much further than
that.

As the debate over key length intensifies, it is becoming more apparent
that 64 bits will not satisfy industry's concerns.  In any event, encryption
software producers may be well advised to take the best arrangement they
can get from the government and start marketing their products to see if
they will actually be able to sell them.

European Officials Meet to Discuss Encryption Issue

In a related development, European industry representatives and
European government officials met at a two day conference in
mid-December to devise a global encryption policy.  It was the first time
leading European business associations and government officials
discussed the growing number of encrypted electronic messages sent
internationally.  At the conference, officials analyzed the use and
safekeeping of keys to encrypted messages, and the conditions under
which governments will be allowed to access the messages.

The two sides also attempted to assign the liability in the case of misuse
or material loss  under any encryption methods.  OECD government
officials participated in the conference along with representatives of the
International Chamber of Commerce, the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee of the OECD, and information technology associations
covering Europe, Canada, Japan, and the United States.

Both U.S. government and industry officials would be well advised to
keep abreast of their European counterparts' activities.  Once all sides
have finished their bantering, any rules adopted in the United States will
need to be consistent with procedures overseas.  If U.S. criteria end up
being more liberal than other country's criteria, it will be of little use
because U.S. producers will have nowhere to sell their product.  If U.S.
criteria is too stringent, then U.S. producers will not be able to compete.

WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT (A.K.A. "NEW FORUM") TO TAKE
PLACE OF COCOM
The United States and its allies commence post cold war export control
regime

The United States and 27 other nations, on December 19 reached final
agreement on a new trade control agreement to restrict the transfer of
weapons to rogue states.  The  group includes Russia and nations of the
former Soviet Union.  The arrangement was first called the "New Forum"
when its countries announced in September that they had agreed in
principle on a regime.  But naming an international regime "New Forum"
begged the question: What do you call the treaty ten years from now?
The Old Forum, The Aging Forum, The Adolescent Forum?

This must have been on the top of the drafters' minds as they crossed the
t's and dotted the i's on the new export control regime's final declaration.
Now given the lengthy title of The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies,
the agreement will replace the now-defunct Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The agreement is known simply
as The Wassenaar Arrangement: a ten word title does not easily lend
itself to an acronym.

The length of the treaty's title was almost as long as the text of its final
declaration.  It is obvious from the declaration's few sentences that there
is more work to be done, said one administration source.  The declaration
only named the member countries and announced that each of the
countries would submit initial elements of the new arrangement to their
respective governments for approval.  The declaration also established a
preparatory committee that will begin work in January 1996.  The
Secretariat will be located in Vienna, Austria, and the first plenary
meeting will be in Vienna on April 2 and 3, 1996.

Impact for shippers

Though the administration can declare victory for the agreement, there is
little practical impact for exporters.  The agreement does not provide a
specific list of countries to whom members cannot ship goods.  Rather,
the agreement prohibits the shipment of arms and dual-use items to the
four generally recognized pariah states: Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and
Libya.  But even these seemingly politically uncontroversial parties are
not named in writing.  It is difficult to fathom member countries agreeing,
much less committing, to prohibit exports to other countries.

No list of controlled goods, well there is a list, it just is not public.

Enforcement mechanism: The Wassenaar Arrangement (one Freudian
slip and it's the Weimar Arrangement) lacks the type of system under
COCOM where member countries reviewed sensitive exports to pariah
countries.   Though this might change, there is no strong enforcement
mechanism as of yet.

State Department officials hail the agreement as a long overdue
replacement of COCOM, and as an agreement more suitable and
responsive to the post-cold war world.  The arrangement will aim to
respond to new security threats posed by rogue countries.  Indeed, a
central part of the regime is its members' commitment to stop the
acquisition of armaments and sensitive dual-use items by such countries.

Building on the lessons of the Iraq war, the Wassenaar Arrangement
seeks to prevent the accumulations of conventional arms around the
world.  "The Iraq war taught us that indiscriminate exports of
conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies can pose
serious threats to our interests, foreign policy goals, and to international
security," said a State Department fact sheet.

Little burden on exporters

The Wassenaar Arrangement will require exporters to furnish little, if
any, additional information, said a State Department official.  Though
there may be some items that will require reporting in the future, for the
time being most of the information will be captured through
congressional reporting requirements, the licensing process, and
Shipper's Export Declarations.  There may be a very small set of general
license items that will have to be reported in the future. High
performance computers, for example, are one likely target of the regime's
reporting requirements.

Any new reporting requirements will be published in the Federal Register
by the Bureau of Export Administration.  These new regulations will
most likely require shippers to send in a summary of the designated items
on a periodic basis (e.g. quarterly). The Wassenaar Arrangement's
dual-use and munitions list essentially parallel U.S. law, so there is really
no need for exporters to be aware of additional lists.

The central goal of these new reporting requirements is for each member
nation to have information at its disposal to share with other member
countries.  The regime provides  a context where countries will be privy
to information to which they previously did not have access.

Administration cautiously optimistic on regime

The regime meets the Clinton administration's goals of moving forward
and beginning cooperative efforts with other countries.  Administration
officials are generally pleased with the results, though they candidly
acknowledge that they would have preferred a setup that featured
stronger restraint provisions and more mechanisms for openness and
transparency.  In any event, sources say, the Wassenaar Arrangement will
provide a context and mechanism where such matters can be debated at
greater length.  And debated they will surely be.

ANTICIPATING THE FINAL FORMAT OF NEW BXA
REGULATIONS

While it may cripple national parks and museums and delay issuance of
government paychecks and entitlements, the federal shutdown has not
blanketed the dank halls of the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
in a black haze of dormancy.  Nope, as this Practitioner goes to press,
BXA's regulations policy group is working away, churning through
interagency comments, to bring you the revised version of the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by January 1996, as well as trying to
hammer out the much-anticipated computer decontrol that President
Clinton announced on October 7, 1995.  Because the government is
closed and official meetings between important inter-agency players are
hamstrung, these regulatory changes are not expected in the Federal
Register before the end of the year, and may even not be out until much
later.

A sign of recent progress, however, did appear in the mailboxes of the
ever-shrinking ranks of Distribution Holders in the form of a December
15, 1995 letter from Acting Office of Export Licensing (OEL) Director
Eileen M. Albanese.  The letter authorized DL holders to adopt the major
reforms in computer export controls and raise the level of computer
eligibility on their special licenses.

Using the grouping of countries that President Clinton gave, the
following is a breakdown of how the countries will be grouped:

* Country Group A-no CTP restrictions:  Japan, U.S., Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, The
Holy See, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.K.;

* Group B-CTP up to 10,000 Mtops:  Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Brunei,
Chile, Colombia, The Czech Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Hungary,
Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Poland, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea,
Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela; and

* Group C-up to 2,000 Mtops, and for civil end-users only, up to 7,000
Mtops are permitted under the Distribution License, as long as shippers
meet certain conditions and the procedures are updated appropriately in
the Internal Control Program:  Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,
Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, India, Israel, Kuwait, Morocco,
Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates,
Vanuatu and Yemen.

These conditions are similar to the supercomputer safeguards plan from
the current regulations and are as follows:

For all three groups-(1) No physical or computational access may be
granted to nationals of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria,
Sudan, and Somalia.  (2) Appropriate measures and checks must be
established to ensure that physical and computational access to the
computer and computer using facility will be limited to authorized
persons.  (3) The computer may not be used for military (Weapons of
Mass Destruction), cryptography, or clandestine activities.  (4)
Appropriate monitoring of the use of the computer (any indications of
improper or unauthorized use or requests for runs will be promptly
reported to the government of the importing country).

* For Group A-No reexport outside Group A.
* For Group B and C-No reexport or intra-country transfer without prior
written authorization from the Bureau of Export Administration.
* For Group C-Security measures will be established to protect the
computer against theft or unauthorized use at all times.

The current regulations, which prevent delivery of higher level computers
for destinations not eligible in this listing for these higher level computers
without an approved individual validated license or "other appropriate
export authority," remain in effect.

This notice should provide a good hint of what the final computer
decontrol will look like.

In another harbinger of how upcoming regulations may affect exporters,
BXA on December 7 notified DL holders that the regulatory reform
effort would include the new Special Comprehensive License, which will
expand the slate products and countries eligible for special license
exports.

Deborah Kappler, head of special licensing and compliance at BXA,
noted that when the new EAR is adopted, there will no longer be several
distinct special licenses, such as the DL, the service supply license, the
project license, and so on. Instead, these licenses will be consolidated into
one Special Comprehensive License (SCL).  DL  holders should refer to
part 752 of the EAR draft, which will be effective upon publication in the
Federal Register.  No changes in action or use of current special licenses
is required for 12 months.  But after that time, holders who wish to
continue will be switched to the SCL and will have to go for a new
pre-license consultation, reapply on new forms, and submit a copy of
their Internal Control Programs.

PARIAH RESTRAINT
Sanctions and Sanctimony on the Banking Committee
by E.J. Prior and Michael Schaffer

Score one for democracy.  With a vote balance resembling the majorities
commanded by Brezhnev in the Supreme Soviet, and a public hearing
which made the politburo look like a rancorous debating society, Senator
Alfonse D'Amato's Senate Banking Committee this month took a
courageous stand, they say, against dictatorship.  Making up in
self-congratulation and blatant bandwagon opportunism for what the new
bill, sponsored by D'Amato (R-NY) and ranking committee Democrat
Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), lacks in political daring, the Banking Committee,
with the passage of the Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995 (S. 1228),
has further tightened the thumbscrews on a reliably crowd-pleasing foe:
Iran.

The committee's December 12 hearing was not burdened with intricate
legislative maneuvering or political nuances.  Foregoing the
number-crunching details of a traditional public mark-up, D'Amato,
Sarbanes, and the paltry two other committee members who bothered to
attend instead rushed through fifteen minutes of pro forma gushing
before adjourning in time for the Senators to listen to Israeli Prime
Minister Peres' address to Congress.  The hearing proceeded as follows:
Committee chair D'Amato inveighed against Iranian terrorism and
praised Sarbanes' assistance in crafting and pushing this crucial piece of
legislation.  Sarbanes inveighed against Iranian terrorism and praised
D'Amato's leadership on the committee.  D'Amato, digressing briefly to
inveigh against Iranian terrorism, then praised Senator Barbara Boxer
(D-CA) for her crucial assistance with the bill.  Boxer, for her part,
inveighed against Iranian terrorism before launching into an adulatory
speech about D'Amato that may even have outdone her Democratic
colleague.

This celebration of committee backslapping and groupthink was a fitting
harbinger of the uncontested December 18 Senate vote that passed the
Iran Oil Sanctions Act. Still, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) added a
dose of drama the next day when he sponsored an amendment pulling
Libya, another oil-rich pariah, into the sanctions party.

All of this was timed perfectly to coincide with the seventh anniversary
of the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
and the same-day announcement that a Scottish businessman had been
indicted in Boston for selling over $250,000 worth of U.S. computer
equipment to Libya.  Rhetorical politics at its best: two terrorist birds
with one legislative stone.  Clearly, this is one bill whose target
constituency is unconcerned with the details, just so long as the bad guys
are getting it.

But what does all this mean for industry?  Lost in the posturing and
hoopla were the details of the bill, and what it suggests about future
government involvement in trade with politically profitable yet
economically marginal foreign targets. (Tremendously profitable China,
like Iran a dictatorship and an irresponsible world citizen, would never be
singled out for such treatment.)  Fortunately for exporters, the bill will
not require the imposition of U.S. trade sanctions against foreign
companies that do any trade-even in sweaters and garden hoses-with
Iran, as was previously contemplated. Removed from the bill were bans
on imports from any country that dealt in oil equipment with Iran, and a
ban on travel to the United States by executives of companies engaging in
such activity, two measures that would have signaled a drastic change in
American policy.  Also, the bill only penalizes those who invest more
than $40 million supporting oil refining procedures in either country over
any 12 month period.

So much for the good news.  The bill still requires the President to
impose one of four types of sanctions: Deny assistance from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank; Withhold export licenses of the foreign corporations
U.S. subsidiaries; prohibit commercial bank loans above $10 million;
and/or ban the operation of financial institutions that support oil
development projects in Iran or Libya.

The Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995 should alert industry that
they need to keep a watchful eye on Congress.  Though the stigma of
arguing against punishing pariah nations such as Iran and Libya could be
damaging from a public relations standpoint, industry should have
lobbied much harder against the measure, lest next time they are not so
lucky.

Senator D'Amato's stated goal-a laudable one-is to stop Iranian
terrorism. The problem is that this bill bears no relation to its fulfillment.
Instead, it will be greeted with rolled eyes by a domestic and foreign
public already cynical about U.S. policy's being subject to unpredictable
lurches to and fro at the whim of publicity-minded legislators, making
people still more unsure of what American policies really are, and less
likely to take us seriously when we do something we mean.  Usually The
Practitioner would skewer such a measure as an unreasonable
extraterritorial assertion of U.S. law that will end up hurting U.S.
industry.  But we won't waste our time on this one. That's because the
bill will be passed, signed by President Clinton and then tucked away in
the drawer of some mid-level NSC bureaucrat and forgotten for good.
The only folks that will hear about it again are the voters of New York
State, who will hear that their senator's impossible-to-implement
sanctions bill underscores his nails-man approach to Middle East
terrorism.

VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE
Third in a four-part series

The Export Practitioner has asked three leading practitioners to provide
their thoughts on four hypotheticals involving voluntary disclosure of
export violations.  Each of these individuals has asked to remain
anonymous so as not to affect cases they are handling for their respective
clients.  Their advice contains general legal guidance and should not be
construed as specific legal advice.

Subscribers are welcome to contact The Practitioner directly if they have
any specific questions regarding these essays.  The Practitioner again
thanks each of the three authors for the time and thought they have taken
in preparing these essays.

For eight years, Knowledge, Inc. a Huntsville, AL.-based computer firm
has been supplying general purpose computers to Enhanced Production
Concepts Inc. (EPCI), an Indian research firm.  When Knowledge filled
its first order to EPCI, it completed a comprehensive customer profile and
learned that EPCI was a reputable firm that assisted Indian companies
with enhancing their manufacturing operations.

Accordingly, Knowledge has made over 40 computer shipments to EPCI
since 1988 and has enjoyed a warm relationship with EPCI's principals.
Staff at the two companies routinely trade E-mail messages on topics
ranging from curry chicken and seafood gumbo to Himalayan treks and
how to buy gifts for people who have everything.  The E-mail traffic
omitted mention of export controls, for Knowledge's computer shipments
always fell under the Commerce Department's export licensing
thresholds.

However, a recent E-mail from EPCI set off the export compliance sirens
at Knowledge:  An EPCI engineer revealed that for the past three years
the company had been working on a project with the Indian government
to enhance the production of its line of Prithyi ballistic missiles.

Knowledge's export compliance officer, John Noblinders, plunged
immediately into a tizzy of panic.  He recalled the time at a 1992 BXA
seminar when Bill Clements scared him and his peers with his discussion
of Commerce's "know" controls, which require licenses for any shipment
that the exporter "knows" is destined for illicit weapons activities.
Noblinders comforted himself with the notion that he did not know about
the EPCI contract.  Then he E-mailed the entire sales staff and told them
to put on hold any new contracts with EPCI.  He got a response from the
South Asian sales manager saying that EPCI had briefed him on their
missile contract two years ago.  The manager added that some of the
recently shipped computers may have assisted with this project.

Is there a violation that merits voluntary disclosure by Knowledge, Inc.?

Essay number one

Knowledge, Inc. definitely has a problem that demands self-disclosure,
but the situation may not be as bad as its export compliance manager,
John Noblinders, believes. Clearly, Knowledge, Inc. has been violating
the Export Control Regulations by doing business with the Indian
company, Enhanced Production Concepts, Inc. (EPCI) for the past two
years, ever since Knowledge's South Asian sales manager was briefed on
the nature of EPCI's business.  Obviously, the incriminating information
passed on to the sales manager, who was an officer of Knowledge, Inc. at
the time, is the equivalent of "knowing" that EPCI was a company to
which any computers shipped would require a license, since any
knowledge gained by any officer can be imputed to the corporate entity.

Nonetheless, while low performance computers may have helped EPCI in
its design work on Prithyi ballistic missiles, it can be argued that they
were not at all integral to that work, and they did not advance the design
or production of such missiles in any unique way.  Therefore, the
self-disclosure-which should be made promptly and in full detail-could
argue that while there was a technical violation of the Export

Administration Regulations (EAR), the violation was incidental and
inconsequential.

Recent changes in the EAR/EPCI regulations recognize that not all
shipments to prohibited sites and prohibited activities are equal, that the
shipment has to in some way advance the design or production of the
proliferation-related product.  Particularly, in today's world, where
computers have been all but decontrolled (with only very high
performance supercomputers having any restrictions at all), it could
easily be argued that the computers that were shipped to EPCI over the
past two years were no more significant to the production of ballistic
missiles than other word processing and calculating devices, such as
pencils and slide rules.  While that argument may seem bizarre to those of
us who practiced export controls during the Cold War, it would be
difficult for a Government that has just decontrolled almost all computers
to almost all destinations around the world to argue that somehow these
particular low performance computers shipped by Knowledge, Inc. pose a
danger of undermining the antiproliferation objectives of the United
States Government.  This is not to claim that Knowledge, Inc. did not
violate the EAR, only that the penalty should fit the crime (which in
today's world is insignificant).

Essay number two

Knowledge, Inc. may have violated the EAR and, if so, is required to
disclose such violations to the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
and the Census Bureau.  Under the Enhanced Proliferation Control
Initiative, an exporter must obtain a validated license for products
otherwise eligible for general license treatment only if BXA informs the
exporter that a validated license is required because there is an
unacceptable risk of use or diversion to missile projects (15 C.F.R. sec.
778.7(C)(2)); or if the exporter "knows" that the products are destined for
a missile project listed in Supplement 6 to Part 778 (15 C.F.R. sec.
778.7(C)(1)(i)); or if the exporter "knows" that the products will be
"directly employed" in the design, development, production, stockpiling,
or use of missiles (15 C.F.R. sec. 778.7(C)91)(ii); 58 Fed. Reg. 68029,
68030 (1993)).

BXA never informed Knowledge that a validated license was required for
exports to EPCI.  The Prithyi project is listed in Supplement 6 to Part 778
but, assuming that EPCI employed the computers at EPCI's facility and
not at the Prithyi facility, the products were not "destined for" a listed
project.  Nevertheless, Knowledge may be deemed to have had the
requisite "knowledge" that EPCI's computers would be directly
employed in missile design, development, or production.  The theory of
such violation would be that Knowledge's failure to inquire after seeing a
"red flag" constituted impermissible self-blinding.  If the goods in fact
were to be directly employed in missile design, development, or
production, Knowledge would be deemed to have had knowledge and
hence to have violated the EAR by exporting the products to EPCI under
a general license.

For the past two years, Knowledge's South Asian sales manager has
known that EPCI was assisting the Prithyi missile project.  Even
assuming that the sales manager did not have actual knowledge that EPCI
was "directly employing" Knowledge's products in the project, he had
sufficient information to raise a "red flag" concerning EPCI's activities.
Because the sales manager's knowledge almost certainly would be
imputed to Knowledge, this gave rise to a duty on the part of Knowledge
to inquire further.  If EPCI in fact was using the products to enhance the
production of missiles, a violation of the EAR occurred when Knowledge
shipped computers to EPCI after the sales manager learned about EPCI's
activity on the missile project.

Knowledge has stopped exports to EPCI and hence has no prospective
duty to inquire under the "know" provision of the nonproliferation
regulations.  But Knowledge probably has a duty to inquire under another
provision of the EAR.  Section 778.5(a)(3) requires exporters to notify
BXA and other cognizant agencies upon receipt of "information which
would lead a reasonable prudent person to believe that a change of
material fact or intention [previously represented to a federal agency] has
occurred."  This requirement is separate from and additional to the
nonproliferation validated license requirements of Parts 771 and 778.

When Knowledge exported its products to EPCI, Knowledge presumably
submitted Shipper's Export Declarations (SED) to the Census Bureau
(through the Customs Service) stating that the products were eligible for
export under general license.  Although Section 787.5(a)(3), like the
nonproliferation rules, is triggered by knowledge (i.e. "has occurred")
rather than such lesser thresholds as reason to know or reason to believe,
the presence of the "red flag" could constitute "knowledge" for purposes
of this provision in the same manner as for the nonproliferation
provisions.  That is, the "red flag" information gained by the sales
manager would mean that Knowledge must inquire whether the goods
required a validated license (and thus made "general license"
representation on the SEDs inaccurate).

If the inquiry yields positive information about such use, there is a
change in previously represented material fact or intention and Section
787.5(a)(3) requires Knowledge to file an amended SED with the Census
Bureau and to also advise BXA as well.

Essay number three

The EPCI "catch-all rules" present perhaps the stickiest of all voluntary
disclosure questions.  At this point, it is not yet clear whether Knowledge,
Inc. has committed a violation, but the facts indicate a strong possibility.
The question is whether the provisions of EAR 778.7(c) (1) were
violated; did someone in Knowledge, Inc. know that they were exporting
products that would be used in a listed missile project in India or that
would be used in design, development, production, or use of missiles in
or by India.  BXA published very helpful guidance on the catch-all rule
on December 23, 1993, clarifying that one must "know" that such
activities are transpiring for such a violation to occur.  (58 Fed. Reg.
64550; knew about EPCI's missile contract, and said that some of the
recently shipped computers "may" have assisted with the project.  A
more thorough investigation is required to determine whether they were
directly employed in such missile activities and whether anyone from
Knowledge knew this.  Careful interpretation of this murky law applied
to the facts learned is in order.

Knowledge, Inc. needs to take the following basic steps:

*  place further shipments to EPCI on hold pending results of the
investigation
*  alert the general counsel, CFO, or other appropriate person pursuant to
the company's compliance program so that a decision can be made at
appropriate levels of "shared responsibility" on this delicate matter;
*conduct a more thorough investigation (under the auspices of counsel to
retain the privilege) to determine whether there have in fact been any
violations;
* set up some type of screening program so these questions can be
ferreted out in advance, not two years after they should have arisen;
* train sales and other appropriate personnel on the EPCI catch-all rules,
instructing them to refer any questions to Noblinders, as export
compliance administrators are otherwise unlikely to know about such
information to supply their screening checklists effectively.

Whether or not there was a clear violation, Knowledge, Inc., should
seriously consider whether making some sort of voluntary disclosure is
nevertheless in its best interests.  The adverse publicity from dealing with
a missile manufacture can cause much worse collateral damage to a
company's reputation and thereby its sales and even its stock
performance than the potential export control law penalties.  If the
investigation shows clearly that employed in applicable missile activities,
so there was no violation of law, a report to BXA can help demonstrate
this fact and also show concern of the "good citizen" corporation in
bringing the matter to the attention of appropriate government officials
become a cause celeb, such a disclosure and consultation could provide
useful cover for the company and put it in a better posture than having no
action.

Unfortunately, a disclosure of no violation can also have the practical
effect of putting all future sales to EPCI on hold until BXA responds with
the requested advice, which could take a very long time (years in a few
cases).  The various agencies addressing EPCI problems have not
developed a sound process for answering these hard questions in the four
and a half years that the catch-all rule has been in place if there is a
problem, but the application is unclear, or they do not want to disclose
sources and methods of intelligence gathering.  Thus, if one wants to do
business with entities like EPCI, it is often better to make your own
decisions and thoroughly document your files than to file an end-user
check with BXA and see whether they are allowed by other agencies to
provide a meaningful response.

Clearly, this is a sticky wicket.  All advice in prior hypotheticals applies.
Further advice should await discovery of all the facts, and application of
the judgments of experienced counsel based on the benefits and
detriments of disclosure versus nondisclosure as applied to that company.

FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT

BXA Enforcement Heads Declare Victory on Efforts in 1995

In 1995, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) set a new high
water mark for enforcement of export control regulations, according to
John Despres, BXA's chief enforcement official. Despres commended
enforcement field agents and his higher-ups in the Clinton administration
for a record year both in terms of fine totals and related convictions for
export control violations.

But what does a successful 1995 mean for '96?  For starters, BXA plans
to hire new investigators in its various field offices.  Also, enforcement
officials plan to target foreign representatives of U.S. companies with a
hard-hitting message: Just as in 1995, export control violations in 1996
will bring dire consequences for their perpetrators.

Computers and Software Remain Targets for '96

Continuing a sift begun immediately after the conclusion of the Cold
War, BXA's enforcement efforts in 1996 will focus on nonproliferation
controls.  Despite the administration's imminent liberalization of controls
on computer hardware and technology, the Office of Export Enforcement
(OEE) will ply the country's ports for diversion of computer technology
to pariah nations such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, all of which
remain subject to U.S. embargoes.  This claim has credibility in light of
the recent arrest and indictment of a Scottish businessman for attempting
to send computers to Libya (See related story below).

So how can enforcement agents tell the difference between a 486
computer and one that operates in thousands or tens of thousands of
MTOPS?  Simple: They compare information from computer
manufacturers with information from shippers and other sources.

Of course, no way is as good as two of the most historically tried and true
methods:  Following the money, and the anonymous tip. The first of these
has been particularly helpful, says Despres, in cases involving high-grade
encryption software.  Any party interested in purchasing such software
generally seeks a continuing relationship with its supplier. The mere fact
that encryption software may be available on the Internet as freeware is
almost meaningless.  If a company wants reliable encryption software it
will buy it from a company, not download it off CompuServe.

Voluntary Disclosure a Mitigating Circumstance

Though it may never appear in writing, OEE wants exporters to know
that it welcomes voluntary disclosures and will consider them a
mitigating factor in enforcement cases.  "There is a strong and recurrent
interest on the part of exporters to know what the advantages are for
disclosing infractions," says John Despres. "We encourage this."  In
recent years, exporters have pressed OEE for written guidance on how
voluntary disclosures will be considered. Barring a reversal of existing
policy, OEE will not issue such guidance, but Despres said that the
awards of voluntary disclosure "will be very substantial."

Frustrated by industry pleas for concrete data on mitigation levels, Frank
Deliberti, BXA's deputy assistant secretary for enforcement, pointed to
the commendable record of voluntary disclosure mitigation. "There is a
real piece of information that could put this to bed," said Deliberti. "Over
99.8% of the cases end up in a warning letter, an information letter, or a
do-nothing letter."

AES Predeparture Certification Requirement Key to Enforcement Efforts

The big hang-up for Customs' Automated Export System (AES) is the
debate over its predeparture approval procedure.  Exporters are
convinced it will hang up their shipments.  Customs, for its part, says
they have nothing to worry about.  For BXA's enforcement folks,
moreover, AES-and especially predeparture certification-is a valuable
enforcement tool.  And Deliberti notes that the threat of having shipments
held up "is nothing new, and it could still be held up based on current
regulations."

In whatever way AES is implemented, it will provide critical information,
potential leads, and answer questions for investigations in a more timely
manner.  As opposed to the current system, under which agents sift
through piles of paper SEDs, they will now have at their disposal a much
more comprehensive and timely set of information to be used in
investigations and enforcement actions.  Industry doesn't want to hear
this, and will let the government hear it vociferously once the first
shipment is unnecessarily delayed and an exporter loses business as a
result.

Scottish Businessman Stung Trying to Ship Computer to Libya

David McKeeve had no idea what he was in for when he traveled from
Scotland to Boston to clear up some paperwork problems with the Boston
seaport supervisor. McKeeve explained to the official that an October
1995 shipment of computers were destined for Cyprus or Ethiopia. After
McKeeve signed documents swearing to this, the seaport supervisor
revealed his true identity-a Customs enforcement official-and arrested
McKeeve for conspiring to export computers to Libya in contravention of
the U.S. embargo.

The indictment, unsealed on December 19, charges that McKeeve, along
with associates of his company, McNeil International, attempted to export
$335,000 worth of computers from Boston to Libya in October by
falsifying the ultimate destination of the shipments.

U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern, who is prosecuting McKeeve, praised the
Customs Service for its action: "The Customs Service did an excellent
job in getting him back into this country, so that he cold be arrested and
face an American court." If convicted, McKeeve faces a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $550,000.  The computer
equipment is also subject to forfeiture.

Filtration and Pumping Equipment Manufacturer Hit with Antiboycott
Violation Penalties

An administrative law judge this month affirmed Commerce Department
charges against Illinois-based Serflico, Ltd., a commercial filtration and
pumping equipment manufacturer and its President, Jack H. Berg, for 25
violations of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration
Regulations.  Serflico was penalized $118,000, while Berg was set back
$90,000 in civil penalties.  The judge also barred Serflico for one year
from exporting to Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of
Yemen.  Mr. Berg could not be reached for comment.

The judge found that between January and July of 1989, Serflico and
Berg had violated the antiboycott prohibition by furnishing business
relationship information in responding to a boycott questionnaire from a
distributor in Iraq.  Serflico also failed to report to Commerce its receipt,
on seven different occasions, of boycott-related requests.  The antiboycott
regulations require companies to report all such requests to the
Department of Commerce or be subject to civil penalties and denial of
export privileges.  The antiboycott provisions also prohibit providing
information on a company's business relationship with a boycotted
company, or with any person known or believed to be restricted form
conducting business with a country that participates in the Arab boycott
of Israel.

LOGISTICS LOG

Harbor Maintenance Fee Collection Prohibited-But Court Stays its
Decision

The New York-based Court of International Trade will allow the Clinton
administration to continue collecting the Harbor Maintenance Fee
(HMF), a levy that it struck down in October as an unconstitutional tax
on exports, until the administration's appeal is heard.

The appeal may take years, and in the meantime exporters should follow
one of two courses to have their HMF payments refunded. First, continue
to file quarterly HMF statements and pay the appropriate fees.  Then file
for a refund in accordance with Customs' refund filing procedures.
When Customs denies this request, file a formal protest with Customs.
Once the formal request is denied, file directly with the Court of
International Trade.  Under the alternative approach, file directly with the
Court of International Trade.

In addition, the judge handling the case will entertain briefs on whether
interest should be refundable along with the fees, and, if so, when the
interest should begin accruing.  According to Munford Page Hall II, a
partner at Dorsey and Whitney in Washington, D.C., who represents an
interested party in the case, the judge will have to decide whether interest
will start accruing for the prejudgement period, the postjudgement period,
both, or neither.

AES Team Remains Unfazed by the Court's Decision

For Customs' Automated Export System (AES) Team, it is business as
usual.  Though HMF collection was once trumpeted as one of AES'
greatest benefits, Customs is moving ahead regardless of the court's
decision.  This decision is as much budgetary realpolitik as a defense of
the HMF.  AES officials are convinced that even if the court's decision is
upheld on appeal, Congress, obsessed more than ever with tax revenue,
will not tolerate the loss of HMF revenue.

To make up the difference, AES officials think that lawmakers will draft
an HMF that will withstand constitutional scrutiny.  The long-term view
is to build a system to collect fees because Customs is sure that there will
eventually be a "legislative fix," says Peter Baish, Customs' Outbound
Process Director.

Editor's Note:  Almost immediately upon announcement of the trade
court's decision, opponents of HMF universally changed its language and
began calling it HMT.  The "T" standing for tax rather than "F" for fee.
In accordance with the industry standard, and to emphasize the
Practitioner's support of the court's ruling, the Practitioner will from this
point forward use the convention HMT when discussing the issue.

AES Hints at Plan for Early '96

Customs will be conducting random checks on business travelers to
verify compliance with export controls on hand-carried items such as
laptop computers and cellular phones. The compliance checks will focus
on flights to countries where demand for high-tech products is great and
that are subject to tight U.S. export restrictions.  Customs will be
examining whether such checks are worth the effort-a determination
that will take one year to make.

Through AES, Customs will also reportedly attempt to "help" smaller and
uninformed companies prevent unintentional violations.  It remains to be
seen whether this is a public relations effort or whether Customs is being
a truly charitable government agency.  In another effort, Customs hopes
to use AES to identify odd transactions.  One place that AES will help,
explains Baish, is when there is a suspect export of, for example, farm
equipment from the Bronx to Columbia.  Having such information
available electronically rather than on a paper SED will enhance
enforcement efforts.

Discussing another long-range '96 plan, Dorleen Pilachowski of the AES
Team confirmed that Customs will attempt to include all export forms
into the AES system, such as export licenses.   The idea is to present "one
government face" to the export community, says Pilachowski.  They will
reportedly do this, however, only after a lot of inter-agency consultation.

Customs had better start consulting soon: Bill Reinsch, The Bureau of
Export Administration's chief export official, is already on record in last
month's Practitioner as saying that even though he supports the general
notion of AES, he would be against it if Customs attempts to include
license applications in the system.  "We think that a system to file export
licenses would be a bad idea," said Reinsch.

INSIDE BXA

What Shutdown?

Yes, the government is shut down and its employees furloughed until
further notice.  But as the public goes without its national parks and the
Vermeer exhibit, BXA, like the pink Energizer Bunny, just keeps going
and going and going with what is little more than a skeleton crew.  Credit
for BXA's continued operation lies squarely with its Under Secretary,
William Reinsch, who has been charged with the multiple-hat duties of
emergency export license administrator, enforcement agent, public
relations officer, etc.  If you place a call to BXA while the shutdown is
still in effect, don't be surprised if the BXA chief answers the phone too.

Nevertheless, according to Reinsch, the shutdown has had a severe
impact on export licensing.  BXA typically approves an average of 35
licenses a day at a value of  $32.5 million.  Each day they also receive
over 400 calls for information.  During the shutdown, none of that is
happening.  Additionally, 1,027 pending license applications worth $2.3
billion are in administrative limbo because they are not being acted on.
"I object in principle to holding hostages," said Reinsch in an interview,
"The President is prepared to negotiate to achieve the result everybody
wants.  [Congress'] actions are incomprehensible."

Other than licensing issues, BXA has held onto its computer personnel,
two assistant secretaries, and its enforcement agents.  BXA's enforcement
agents are deemed essential, just as any other federal law enforcement
personnel.  So your chances of sneaking unlicensed goods out of the
country are the same as they are in normal times.

The biggest change in BXA's game plan for the shutdown this month-as
compared to handling last month's shutdown-was its retention of the
11-member export regulation rewrite squad.  As the deadline for the new
Export Administration Regulations (EAR) neared, BXA went to its
official-in-the-clutch to get the job done in time for January's big
event-the exporter's Super Bowl-Update West.  With the clock running
out, BXA sent EAR veteran Larry Christensen, sidelined during last
month's shutdown, dashing onto the regulatory playing field to lead the
rewrite team to San Jose with something to show: a new EAR.

Christensen was not quite able to get the new regulations out by BXA's
initial goal of January 1, and had to bring the agency's efforts into
overtime so that participants at Update West would have a new EAR to
take home with them.  The unofficial revised goal of getting the new regs
to the Federal Register is now set for January 12.  It is not yet known
whether the EAR will be in hard copy format or on diskette.

In addition to its presentation at Update West, BXA is preparing outreach
presentations around the country to explain the new regs to exporters
(See schedule at bottom of this column).  The presentations will include
written training materials, charts, visual materials and the like.  It is yet 
to be determined if these materials will be mailed out to interested persons
or whether the parties will have to attend the presentations

In any event, the rewrite has undergone no further adjustments of great
magnitude since the  November draft version.  "There are no deal killers.
Nothing will torpedo it," said one BXA source.  According to Eric
Hirschhorn, a partner at Winston and Strawn law firm in Washington,
D.C., the new regulations will make life easier for the first-time exporter,
but they will disorient veteran exporters steeped in the arcane ways of the
long-standing regulations. Further, foreign reexporters face an even more
difficult task with the new regulations, which will not even include a
chapter to reexports, as the current regulations do.

Control List Makes Switch to EU Numbering System

The Euro trend has reached the untrendy world of export controls. As
part of an interim rule to overhaul dual-use export control regulations, the
Bureau of  Export Administration (BXA) will convert all Export Control
Commodity Numbers (ECCN) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) to
the format used by the twelve countries of the European Union.

To assist exporters in bridging the transition between the two formats,
BXA will place a "slashed-out" version of the current ECCN entries
alongside the new Euro versions. The most obvious difference between
the two versions is plain to see: The European ECCNs are one character
longer than the long-standing CCL versions. Still, the new ECCNs should
scarcely pose an intellectual challenge even for the most blockheaded
exporter. For example, the current ECCN 3A01A under the new format
will be 3A001.

In other changes to the CCL, BXA is adding entries to CCL category 10
(Miscellaneous) covering items on the International Atomic Energy List
(a.k.a. the "Trigger List"). Also, the "related controls" and "related
definitions" sections have been added to every entry. If neither applies to
a particular entry, the term "N/A" is used.

Executive Order Expedites
Licensing   Sort of

On December 5, President Clinton dusted off and then signed Executive
Order 12981, a year-old initiative that purports to streamline the
interagency processing of export license applications. "Early on, this
Administration committed itself to a broad interagency review process,
but one which provided accountability," said Bill Reinsch.  "This
Executive Order accomplishes both of those goals.  It is good for U.S.
business and the American people."

For exporters, the order promises a more responsive export control
regime, as it reduces to 90 days from 120 days the government's deadline
for reaching decisions on export license applications. If a decision is not
passed down within the deadline, the case is automatically referred to the
president for final resolution. The order's effective date is February 6,
1996.

The order allows all federal agencies access to export license applications
submitted to BXA on the condition that the agencies deliver their
recommendations within 30 days of receipt. Should they fail to issue a
recommendation, BXA may assume that they support the application.
BXA officials argue that the inclusion of all agencies in the licensing
process will protect national security, foreign policy and nonproliferation
interests.

In the event that an agency recommends denying  a license application, it
must clearly state the recommendation's statutory or regulatory basis.
The order also requires agencies to adhere to strict review deadlines.
Here's a quick look at the time frame under which agencies will have to
operate:

Within nine days of registration:
* additional information must be requested if needed
* the license must be referred interagency
* it must be Returned Without Action (RWA) in the event a license is not
needed
* an intent to deny must be issued
* classification of an item must be verified and the license must be
granted if there is no referral

Other agencies that request referrals will have only 10 days to request
additional information and 30 days to recommend approval or denial.  An
interagency review board will resolve disputes among the relevant
agencies. Under the order, a subcommittee of  the Advisory Committee
on Export Policy (ACEP), which consists of representatives of the
departments of State, Defense, Energy, and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, must resolve disputes over applications within 14
days. The subcommittee's decisions may be appealed to the ACEP chair,
the Under-Secretary of Export Administration, who must make a final
decision within 5 days of the decision.

If an agency fails to give its recommendation in the allotted time frame,
the agency will be considered to have no objection to the issuance or
denial of a license.  In other words, acquiescence is acceptance.

The interagency review process will need some fine tuning, however.
According to Eric Hirschhorn, former head of what is now BXA, the
order still does not apply to the Central Intelligence Agency, which is the
biggest dilatory culprit when it comes to license applications. In addition,
licenses that under the old system would be reviewed in less than 10 days
may now take longer, as various agencies get in on the act of reviewing
the dwindling number of applications submitted to BXA.


New Computer Regulations Near Completion

The computer export decontrol announced by President Clinton in
October will appear as a final rule in the Federal Register by early
February, according to BXA officials (see related article page 8).
Implementation of the decontrol has reportedly been hung up over a
dispute with Japan over whether the decontrol violates the 1991
U.S-Japan agreement to jointly regulate exports of supercomputers.
President Clinton introduced the initiative as a unilateral measure after
Tokyo balked at approving the radical level of decontrol that it set forth.
According to administration sources, however, recent negotiations with
Tokyo have patched up the differences.

BXA to Play Role in CWC Implementation

With the Chemical Weapons Convention now moving through Senator
Helms' Foreign Relations Committee (see related article page 5), BXA
will now be responsible for developing and maintaining a database of
domestic chemical production, says Bill Reinsch.  In addition, BXA will
be preparing the treaty's regulations so that exporters will be able to
prepare for the treaty's requirements.  BXA will also be responsible for
organizing the logistics for approximately 15 to 20 regular inspections
(inspections with advance notice) per year.  They expect two or three
challenge inspections (inspections without notice) per year.  The
Bureau's officials will accompany inspectors and will organize outreach
efforts.

Commerce Includes Software and Semiconductors Under General
License GLX

The Commerce Department announced on December 13 that it has
expanded eligibility for General License GLX to include commodities
such as virus protection software and semiconductor items.  The
expansion also includes mobile telephones that contain encryption
technology, a change that eliminates cumbersome validated licensing
requirements for U.S. exporters. GLX authorizes license-free exports of a
wide range of dual-use commodities for civil end-users in China, the
former republics of the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe.

Industry applauded Commerce's announcement.  "This modernization of
export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless and costly
licensing delays and burdensome paperwork," said Thomas W.
Armstrong, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

Producers had long claimed that such items were widely available in the
international marketplace and that U.S. restrictions hampered their efforts
to compete globally.  Statistics show that less than one-third of some 139
billion semiconductors and 33 billion integrated circuits were made in the
United States.  Mobile telephone producers-such as Motorola and
Nokia-will benefit from the change.

"This expansion of the GLX category is a prime example of our efforts to
eliminate controls that are no longer necessary and to help U.S. business
compete globally," said BXA chief Bill Reinsch.  "This expansion will
lead to new export opportunities for U.S. businesses, and increased
opportunities for U.S. businesses and increased exports mean a stronger
U.S. economy and jobs for our citizens."

Hong Kong bank granted branch status 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Deborah Shen

     The Ministry of Finance on Oct. 15 approved a proposal by the
Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's largest bank, to upgrade its
representative office in Taiwan to branch status.
     The BEA is the first bank with mainland Chinese investment to be
permitted into the Taiwan market. Also, it is only the second Hong
Kong-based bank allowed to set up a branch on the island. The first
such branch was opened in 1984 by the Hongkong Bank, also known as
the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd.
     But as the Hongkong Bank relocated its headquarters to London
several years ago, the BEA can be seen as the only bank truly
headquartered in Hong Kong to operate a branch here on the island,
the ministry noted.
     The ministry expects that approval of the BEA's upgrade proposal
will encourage the Hong Kong government to gradually give the green
light to each of the seven similar proposals made by Taiwan-based
banks. The Taiwan banks have applied to either set up representative
offices in the British colony or upgrade their existing offices there
to branch status.
     The BEA had applied to the ministry more than a year ago to
upgrade its representative office, which was set up in Taiwan in
April 1993. But as the bank failed to meet the ministry's request for
concrete data on its mainland Chinese ties, the ministry postponed
approval of the application.
     The move in turn caused the Hong Kong government to also delay
approval of the applications by the seven Taiwan-based banks,
according to the ministry.
     The situation improved a few months ago when the BEA presented a
list of its shareholders to the ministry. After reviewing the
information, the ministry decided to approve the upgrade proposal, as
it was determined that the mainland Chinese stake accounts for only
11.77 percent of the bank's total capital. The figure is well below
the 20 percent ceiling imposed by the ROC government.
     However, because the BEA is a listed company, it is possible
that the percentage of mainland Chinese-owned shares could increase
over time. Thus, if the 20 percent ceiling should ever be exceeded,
the ministry said it will have to consult with the Mainland Affairs
Council at that time on how to handle the case.
     As of the end of 1995, the BEA had capital assets totaling
US$1.1 billion, ranking the bank as Hong Kong's largest. The bank has
74 branches in Hong Kong, in addition to six more branches and five
representative offices in mainland China.

Taiwan outward investment ranks as 2nd highest in Asia 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Kelly Her

     Taiwan's outbound investment last year ranked as the second
highest in Asia, according to a United Nations report cited locally
by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.
     Outward investment by Asian countries and territories in 1995
amounted to US$43 billion, representing 90 percent of such investment
by developing countries worldwide, the CEPD said, referring to the
report.
     Hong Kong was Asia's top supplier of foreign capital last year,
investing US$25 billion abroad, mainly in mainland China.
     Taiwan placed second with outbound investment totaling US$3.8
billion. Mainland China ranked third with US$3.5 billion, South Korea
fourth with US$3 billion and Malaysia fifth with US$2.6 billion.
     The same report noted that the mainland not only was the third
largest foreign investor in Asia, but was also the region's top
foreign investment site.
     But the pace of foreign capital coming into the mainland is
expected to slow after hitting a peak this year due to the mainland's
implementation of credit-tightening measures and gradual phasing out
of preferential treatments for foreign investors. Foreign investment
in the mainland is projected to fall below US$30 billion in 1997.
     However, the report said the mainland investment by Japan, South
Korea and the European Union will likely increase despite the general
slowdown.
     The report noted that as long as the mainland enjoys rapid
economic growth and opens new investment fields, it will remain a
major foreign investment site.
     According to the report, worldwide investment in developing
countries last year accumulated to US$99.7 billion on impressive 15
percent annual growth. Two-thirds of this investment capital headed
to Asia, with the mainland absorbing the most, or 38 percent.
     Investment capital injected into Asian countries from throughout
the world reached US$65 billion in 1995, representing an increase of
21 percent from a year before. Ninety percent of the investment funds
were destined for Southeast Asia and East Asia.
     Foreign investment during the year in the mainland, Malaysia and
Singapore reached US$37.5 billion, US$5.8 billion and US$5.3 billion,
respectively. Projects in Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong totaled
US$4.5 billion, US$2.3 billion and US$2.1 billion, respectively.

High-speed railway bidding to open 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Kelly Her

     The Ministry of Transportation and Communications is scheduled
to make a public announcement at the end of October inviting private
firms to participate in Taiwan's high-speed railway project.
     Different from in the past, the ministry will divide the bidding
into two phases by first selecting qualified applicants and then
conducting thorough evaluations of their detailed investment plans.
     Qualified applicants must possess considerable financial assets
and technological capabilities. On the financial side, a bidder needs
to have either a minimum paid-in capital of US$363 million or annual
revenues of more than US$1.09 billion. Sound financial performance
over the past three years is also required of an applicant.
     The ministry's guidelines permit several companies to pool their
efforts and bid collectively in the form of an alliance. An alliance
bid must have a combined paid-in capital of at least US$363 million.
Each investor in the partnership is required to have paid-in capital
totaling US$72 million or more.
     The 330-kilometer rail will provide an express link between
Taipei, the northern business center of the island, and Kaohsiung, a
major port city in the south. The high-speed transportation system is
slated to become operational by the year 2003.
     As designed, the large-scale railway project will cost around
US$16 billion. Also, it has been decided that private capital must
account for more than 40 percent, or US$6.42 billion, of the
project's total investment.
     Participation is open to private firms on a
build-operate-transfer basis. The categories available for private
investment include rail installation, station construction,
electrical engineering and maintenance operations.
     As such, the project is expected to add vigor to Taiwan's
construction, electrical engineering and financial service sectors by
bringing ample business opportunities to them.
     But opportunities exist in more than only the construction
phase. Private firms will also have the opportunity to take charge of
the management, operation and maintenance of the transportation
system after its completion, according to the ministry's Provisional
Engineering Office of the High-Speed Rail.
     This aspect explains why such strict financial conditions have
been imposed on bidders, the office noted.
     In the days ahead, the office plans to organize several
investment seminars targeting leading domestic and foreign
conglomerates in an effort to spur their eagerness to participate in
the high-speed railway project.

Visa's card for stored value introduces electronic cash 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Deborah Shen

     Visa International Service Association will cooperate with eight
banks in Taiwan to issue "Visa Cash" cards on the island at the
beginning of next year.
     The move will mark the first entry of an international-standard,
microchip-based, stored-value purchasing card into the Taiwan market.
In addition, it also ushers in a new era of purchasing with
electronic cash in Taiwan, according to Visa, which already issues
the No. 1 credit card on the island.
     The U.S.-based company and the eight local banks held a joint
news conference in Taipei on Oct. 15 to announce the launching in
Taiwan of a Visa Cash pilot program. The partnership expects that
200,000 disposable Visa Cash cards will be available on the market in
early 1997.
     So-called Visa Cash is an alternative purchasing medium for
everyday low-value products and services like newspapers, bus fares
and cups of coffee. The microchip embedded in the stored-value card
automatically deducts the amount of each purchase to keep track of
the card's remaining value.
     "Visa Cash will revolutionize the way Taiwan people pay for
small-value purchases," according to Raymond Chan, executive vice
president and general manager of Visa's North Asia, Asia-Pacific
region.
     As cardholders do not need to authorize transactions by using
personal identification numbers or signing their signatures, Visa
Cash is nearly as convenient to use as regular currency, Chan noted.
     Since Visa launched a pilot program in Hong Kong in August of
this year, more than 100,000 Visa Cash cards have been issued in the
British colony, according to the company executive.
     Chan said Taiwan is an ideal market for the service, as the
average local consumer spends about US$7,275 annually on daily
necessities.
     The eight local banks participating in the program include
Citibank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank,
International Commercial Bank of China, Chung Shing Bank, Far Eastern
International Bank, Grand Commercial Bank and Taishin International
Bank.
     In the first phase of the Taiwan pilot, the eight banks will
issue 200,000 disposable Visa Cash cards in denominations of NT$1,000
(about US$36) and NT$500, according to Albert Shiung, vice president
of Visa International Asia-Pacific and the company's country manager
in Taiwan.
     Shiung further explained that the success of the initial phase
will lead to the issuance of value-reloadable purchasing cards.
     The firm said 5,000 Visa Cash purchase-processing devices will
be installed at convenience stores, food courts in department stores,
fast-food restaurants and supermarkets across Taiwan.

A booster shot for democracy 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p6

by FCJ Editors

     The National Development Conference scheduled for December holds
out promise for the continued advance of democracy in the Republic of
China on Taiwan. But much work must be done beforehand to ensure that
the forum concentrates on the promotion of genuine political
communication. Five days, while a fair amount of time for
brainstorming ideas, can rush by in a blur when it comes to searching
for agreement on bedrock issues.
     Fortunately, work began weeks ago. A Presidential Office task
force established a broad-based preparatory committee to organize the
conference, and seminars throughout the Taiwan area have been planned
to sound out grassroots opinion before the forum actually convenes
Dec. 23 in Taipei. The preparatory committee's initial work has been
hopeful. On Oct. 11, committee members from all three major parties
agreed on an ambitious aim for the conference: to build a consensus
on the major topics of future national development in order to
formulate policies and put them into practice.
     The three main topics--constitutional reform and party politics,
economic development, and relations between Taiwan and mainland
China--have fundamental importance. ROC parliamentary bodies, though
crucibles of democratic debate, sometimes cannot escape gridlock. The
economy has been sluggish. And intermediary agency talks between
Taiwan and mainland China have been on hold for 16 months. Sharply
contested political issues cluster in thickets around all of these
topics. The 150 conference delegates, meeting outside established
government structures, will attempt to break pathways into the clear.
     President Lee Teng-hui introduced the idea of the National
Development Conference in his inaugural address May 20, and the
meeting of course has a historic precedent. In the summer of 1990,
after his first-term inauguration, Lee convoked the similarly named
National Affairs Conference. It gave birth to several agreements that
built the framework for Taiwan's democratization, such as the direct
election of the provincial governor and Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors.
     In addressing the preparatory committee last week, Lee set the
tone for the forthcoming conference. He pointed out that national
development reached a new stage with the direct presidential election
this year and asserted that "how to concentrate the experience and
wisdom of our people" is the key to the future.
     The ROC's political landscape has indeed changed in six years.
New democratic institutions are in place. The rule of law has been
strengthened. The government is more representative and more
responsive. Yet progress, while it leaves old roads behind, also
presents new and uncharted regions ahead. The National Development
Conference can at the very least help light the way.

Religious group scandal leads to cult crackdown 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p4

by Christie Su

     ROC law enforcement agencies have launched an island-wide
crackdown on religious cults whose illegal activities threaten social
stability and undermine public morality in Taiwan.
     The operation targets religious cults and temples across Taiwan
which are not registered with the government, swindle money out of
followers through fraudulent means, or have ties to gangster
organizations.
     Moreover, the Interior Ministry has announced its intention to
establish an interministerial task force that will focus on
strengthening the management of affairs related to civilian groups on
the island.
     The various measures are part of the government's wide-ranging
war on crime. The cleanup campaign comes in the wake of a major
religious scandal involving "supernatural" shenanigans, political
figures, gangsters, enormous sums of money, and thousands of duped
people in Taiwan and in mainland China.
     The scandal surfaced last week when Taipei City Councilor Chu
Mei-feng accused a Taipei-based cult, the Sung Chi-li Miracle
Association, of swindling money from people.
     Chu, a member of the New Party, announced in an Oct. 9 press
conference that she had received complaints from around 40 people who
claimed cult leader Sung Chi-li had cheated money from them through
fraudulent acts.
     Meanwhile, several association members went to the police with
similar charges against Sung.
     Councilwoman Chu also named Frank Hsieh, the Democratic
Progressive Party's vice presidential candidate in the elections this
past March, as being associated with the cult. Moreover, Hsieh, a
former legislator, was accused of having received about US$580,000 in
campaign donations from cult leader Sung.
     Hsieh, however, denied receiving any such donations and
clarified that his only tie to the association is that he has served
as its legal consultant.
     It was also reported that some government officials in Taiwan,
including the deputy director-general of the National Police
Administration, Yu Yu-tang, might be associated with the mystic cult.
     On Oct. 10, the Miracle Association issued a statement refuting
all charges against it. The statement emphasized that the association
was a registered private organization devoted to helping people by
teaching them how to discover their real selves through philosophical
learning. The group further stressed that it had no links to illegal
businesses.
     But an extensive police investigation and an explosion of media
coverage on the case suggested otherwise, resulting in the arrest of
Sung and several core members of the association on fraud charges.
     The police investigation revealed that the cult leader, whose
real name is Sung Chien-lin, had a string of previous convictions on
fraud and violations of the so-called negotiable instruments law.
     Using trick photography, Sung had convinced his association
members that he possessed the ability to separate his body and soul
and miraculously manifest himself at different points on the globe
simultaneously. This purported supernatural power of his can be used
to help his followers ascend to paradise after death, he had claimed.
     But during police interrogations a few days after the scandal
broke, Sung finally admitted that the manifestation photos were fakes
and he did not possess any supernatural powers.
     Police reports said Sung had bilked association members out of
about US$7 million. The illegal fortune was amassed through several
sources: the sale of books, video tapes and photographs about Sung's
so-called miraculous manifestations, donations from the cult leader's
followers, and fees Sung charged to people who wanted to meet him in
person to learn how to develop supernatural powers for themselves.
     Reportedly, one photograph showing a haloed image of Sung
floating in the sky above a range of mountains was purchased by a
cult follower for US$3,000. Personal meetings with Sung, however,
came with a price tag of US$363,000 each, according to media reports.
     The ill-gotten gains afforded Sung a luxurious lifestyle. He
reportedly had vast real estate holdings, including the elaborately
decorated association temple. The gaudy-looking temple has since been
razed by the Taipei City Government for building code violations.
     Taipei police authorities also have alleged that Sung and his
association maintained links to underworld organizations.
     Police reports said Sung's group set up money-soliciting
branches in mainland China as well as Taiwan. Members of the mainland
branches included college professors and ranking Chinese Communist
officials.
     The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office said it has frozen the
assets of the association pending completion of the investigation.
     Hsieh, the former lawmaker accused of receiving political
donations from the association, on Oct. 14 filed slander charges
against Councilwoman Chu.
     News analysts suggested that the allegations of Hsieh's close
relations with the cult will probably become a hindrance in his
political future. Hsieh had recently announced that he wanted to run
for the mayor's office in Kaohsiung in two years.
     The campaign to ensure propriety in religious activities also
includes inviting religious leaders in Taiwan to discuss how to break
down potentially harmful superstitions in society, said Chao Shou-po,
secretary-general of the Executive Yuan.

Open telecom door prompts a surge 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by Kelly Her

     The opening of Taiwan's telecommunications market has encouraged
leading foreign investors to launch new projects on the island,
resulting in a dramatic rise in the overall inward investment during
September.
     Approved investments in Taiwan by foreign nationals and overseas
Chinese in September totaled US$345 million, a sharp rise of 78
percent over the previous month.
     In its report, the Investment Commission of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs attributed the surge in inward investment to the
liberalization of Taiwan's telecommunications market.
     Representing the biggest of September's foreign-funded
telecommunications projects, the Taiwan affiliate of U.S.-based
Southwest Bell Corp. funneled US$123 million into a joint venture on
the island.
     As for in the first nine months of the year, the Investment
Commission approved 344 foreign investment projects on the island, up
15 percent from the same period of the previous year. These projects
were valued at US$1.64 billion, down 5 percent from the year-earlier
level.
     Despite a downturn in sales in the semiconductor sector, the
electronics and electrical products industry still attracted the most
foreign investment of all industries in Taiwan in the
January-September period. Even so, the industry's investment total
was a substantial 50 percent lower than the year-earlier total, the
commission reported.
     The period's other leading investment areas included the
island's banking and insurance, wholesale and retail, food and
beverage, and service industries. Together with the electronics and
electrical products industry, these industries accounted for 55
percent of the total inward investment between January and September.
     The commission said the government's campaign to build Taiwan
into an Asian Pacific operations hub is helping to attract foreign
investment into the five industries.
     Looking at September's outbound investment in areas besides
mainland China, the commission's report said Taiwan enterprises
poured US$156 million into 32 projects overseas. The value figure
represented a hefty 62 percent increase over the non-mainland
outbound investment of the same month a year ago.
     In the first nine months of the year, non-mainland outward
investment by Taiwan firms climbed to US$1.49 billion, up an
impressive 49 percent from the year-earlier period.
     The most popular investment areas of the Taiwan firms were the
banking and insurance, electronics and electrical products, and
service industries. Projects in the three industries made up 62
percent of the island's total outbound investment between January and
September.
     A particularly strong increase was noted in Taiwan firms'
establishment of investment holding companies overseas in the period.
The commission said this was a reflection of the trend by the
island's investors to update their information and technologies as a
means of accelerating their internationalization and bolstering their
competitiveness.
     The report also evaluated investment targeted at the other side
of the Taiwan Straits. In September, the commission gave the green
light to only 16 mainland investment proposals filed by local firms,
a decrease of 48 percent from the number of proposals in August and a
record single-month low.
     The aggregate value of September's mainland projects was US$46.4
million, down 62 percent from August and the lowest value in 20
months.
     The slowdown indicates that the mainland investment fever of
Taiwan enterprises has subsided significantly in response to
President Lee Teng-hui's call for the government to review its policy
on cross-Straits business exchanges, according to the commission.
     In the first nine months of the year, the number of approved
mainland proposals decreased 24 percent from the year-earlier period.
However, the value figure increased 15 percent. The commission
attributed this phenomenon to the fact that the average size   of
Taiwan companies' mainland projects is getting bigger, even though
the number of projects is dwindling.
     In an attempt to lure more foreign capital to the island, the
Economics Ministry has targeted 10 newly developing industries in
Taiwan for active investment promotion. The 10 include the consumer
electronics, communications, precision machinery, semiconductors,
aerospace, pharmaceuticals, high-end materials, health care
equipment, pollution prevention equipment, and bio-technology
industries.
     Chou Yen, director-general of the ministry's Industrial
Development and Investment Center, said the IDIC will encourage
foreign firms to inject capital into these industries.
     To help formulate measures for promoting such investment, the
center will survey foreign firms already operating on the island to
see whether they plan to launch new or expansion projects, he added.
     Also, the center already has sent out correspondences to leading
firms around the world, introducing Taiwan's investment environment
to them and inviting them to gear up local projects, Chou said.
     Ministry statistics show that since 1952 a total of 7,705
foreign-invested projects, worth around US$36 billion, have been
approved by the government.

Production drain to mainland 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by FCJ Editors

     Thirty percent of the Taiwan investors with projects in mainland
China have completely ceased production here on the island, according
to a survey report released Oct. 14 by the ROC Mainland Affairs
Council.
     The council commissioned the Chinese Professional Management
Association of Taipei to conduct the survey on some 300 Taiwan
investors on the mainland.
     According to the survey, many of the investors who no longer
manufacture their products in Taiwan continue to receive export
orders and conduct research and development work here on the island.
     However, about 10 percent of Taiwan's mainland investors have
withdrawn their operations from the island entirely. Of these
companies, 40 percent are now engaged in agriculture, fishery or
mining on the mainland. Many others operate service businesses there.
     More than 60 percent of the investors surveyed are focusing on
the mainland's domestic market.
     Some 89 percent of those surveyed said they continue to purchase
the materials they need for mainland production from plants in
Taiwan. However, a declining trend is foreseen, as half of the
investors said they plan to reduce their Taiwan materials purchases
in the days ahead. Explaining the reason for the expected change,
they noted that more upstream and midstream Taiwan factories are
deciding to relocate to the mainland.
     About 30 percent of those surveyed said they think the products
they produce in Taiwan and on the mainland are of the same level of
quality. This is seen as a sign that the production technology on the
mainland has improved.

UPS opens regional center 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by FCJ Editors

     The U.S.-based courier United Parcel Service opened its
Asia-Pacific regional center at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport on Oct. 10.
     UPS said the northern Taiwan center will bolster its service
to regional customers and eventually hook up with the company's
European base to form a worldwide delivery network. More than that,
the opening of the first phase of the UPS center is seen as a step
toward Taiwan becoming a regional air shipping hub.
     The inauguration of the US$400 million center, however, was
marred by a demonstration by 100 members of the Taipei Air Cargo and
Warehousing Industrial Union, who said the inroad gained by UPS will
enable the U.S. firm to seriously undermine their businesses.
     The union companies said the privileges granted to UPS will
enable the major international courier to elbow many of them out of
the market. This, in turn, will result in closures and the loss of
local jobs, they warned.
     UPS is the first foreign express courier that the government has
permitted to establish an Asia-Pacific freight center on the island.
The company also has been given special treatment, including 24-hour
customs clearance and quarantine and certification services.
     In December, UPS filed an application to set up the
multimillion-dollar center at the CKS airport. The government gave
the green light earlier this year despite protests from local
couriers which feared they would not be able to compete with the U.S.
delivery giant.

WTO talks end with Australia 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by Deborah Shen

     Following 14 rounds of bilateral negotiations, the ROC has
finally reached a consensus with Australia on the terms applicable to
the ROC's bid to enter the World Trade Organization.
     Australia now becomes the 11th WTO member country to have
completed bilateral talks with the ROC on membership terms, Lin
Yi-fu, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, said.
     The two sides are expected to sign an accord on the agreed-upon
package of entry terms in the next few weeks. The finalized accord
will help speed up the ROC's admission into the trade body, Lin said.
     Lin was the chief ROC negotiator in what now appears to have
been the final round of WTO talks with Australia. During the Oct. 7-8
negotiations in Taipei, the two sides failed to resolve a major
sticking point which had lingered since the bilateral talks began
several years ago. That would be the ROC's tariff rate on imports of
Australian beef.
     At the conclusion of the Taipei negotiations, the Australian
delegation, headed by Graeme Thomason, said it would need to consult
with its government on proposals made by the ROC in the meetings. The
proposals included reductions on the tariffs which the ROC applies to
imports of Australian beef.
     Australia is the largest source of imported beef in Taiwan.
According to the Council of Agriculture, the island imported more
than 57,000 metric tons of beef and beef products last year, of which
about 30,000 metric tons came from Australia.
     Even so, Australian negotiators have long complained in the
bilateral WTO meetings that the ROC applies discriminatory treatment
to imports of Australian beef. In that the ROC classifies imported
beef from the United States as "special grade" and beef from
Australia as "ordinary grade," the Australian product falls into a
category with a higher tariff. This makes Australian beef less
competitive in the Taiwan market, they noted.
     Currently, the ROC government taxes special-grade imported beef
at a rate of NT$22.1 (US$0.80) per kilogram. Ordinary-grade imported
beef faces a duty of NT$30 (US$1.09) per kilogram.
     The ROC's initial stance was that it would not cut tariffs on
imported agricultural products until after gaining membership in the
WTO. The nation's negotiators decided to yield ground, however,
following President Lee Teng-hui's call for WTO talks with related
countries to be completed by next March so that the ROC can enter the
trade body before Hong Kong goes over to mainland China rule in July
1997.
     The nation's negotiators drew up a package of WTO entry terms,
adding in a key element--the beef tariff reductions long sought by
Australia. The proposal was presented to the Australian delegation
during the Taipei meetings in an effort to secure Australia's full
support of the membership bid.
     On Oct. 11, Australia notified the ROC that it had decided to
accept the beef tariff reductions as well as the rest of the entry
terms. The package of proposals is expected to boost the value of
Australia's overall exports to Taiwan by US$23.7 million annually.
     Under the accepted terms, the ROC will cut its tariffs on
Australian beef by 10 percent, lowering the duty from the current
NT$30 (US$1.09) per kilogram to NT$27 (US$0.98) per kilogram before
being admitted into the WTO. After membership is gained, the ROC will
further cut the beef tariffs over a period of six years to NT$15
(US$0.55) per kilogram.
     In other areas besides beef imports, ROC negotiators also agreed
to open the Taiwan market to 2,000 Australian-made compact cars for
the first time ever, beginning in 1997. After membership in the WTO
is granted, the quota will be gradually increased to 6,000 cars.
     The ROC also promised to double the annual import quota of 1,200
metric tons of Australian apples and allow Australian peaches, plums
and oranges to enter the Taiwan market for the first time ever, at
annual quotas ranging from 600 to 1,000 metric tons.
     The package of membership terms also includes measures to open
up Taiwan's financial and legal services and other service markets.
     The ROC applied to join the WTO's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1990 under the name "Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." Currently, the ROC
maintains observer status in the trade body.
     The 11 countries with which the ROC has completed talks under
the WTO framework include South Africa, Turkey, Malaysia, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the Philippines, El Salvador, Colombia
and Uruguay as well as Australia.

Trade group arrives from mainland 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Weiling Liu

     A high-profile mainland Chinese trade delegation arrived in
Taiwan this week to meet with business leaders, tour industrial sites
and promote investment in the mainland.
     The 14-member delegation led by Guo Dongpo, chairman of the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, was invited
for a weeklong visit by the China External Trade Development Council,
or CETRA, Taiwan's top trade promotion organization.
     Guo's position is equivalent to the rank of vice minister in the
mainland government, and the make-up of his delegation made it the
most influential to visit Taiwan since both sides began exchanges of
trade professionals last year.
     Other delegation members include Wang Wende, director of the
Office of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; Zhang Yuqing, director of the
same ministry's Treaty and Law Department; and Xu Mang, director of
economic affairs of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
     Guo said upon arrival that he hoped the trip would help to ease
tensions between Taiwan and mainland. "The main purpose of my
weeklong visit here is to call on my old friends as well as to make
new friends," he said. "I hope to meet with as many Taiwan business
and industry executives as possible to facilitate future development
of cross-Straits trade ties."
     Asked to comment on President Lee Teng-hui's recent warnings
about the risks of overreliance on trade and investments in the
mainland, Guo smiled but said nothing.
     During an Oct. 14 dinner hosted by CETRA Chairman Wang
Chang-ching, Guo said he wanted to understand Taiwan better and
intensify industrial and commercial exchanges. He said he had no
special intention to meet any high-ranking officials in the Mainland
Affairs Council, the ROC government's top agency for mainland policy.
     MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian had said three days earlier
that MAC officials would not hesitate to meet with the mainland
delegation. But Kao did not attend the Oct. 14 dinner even though he
had been invited. The MAC said that pressing matters had detained Kao
and that he would attend a party for Guo toward the end of the visit.
     MAC officials also did not attend CETRA's Oct. 15 welcoming
reception for Guo's delegation. Asked at the reception whether he
would like to meet with Kao, Guo replied: "I will follow the schedule
arranged by my host." Asked whether Guo's trade promotion council
plans to set up a liaison office in Taiwan, Guo said the council has
already built up regular dialogue channels with CETRA.
     Taiwan's intermediary agency for cross-Straits talks, the
Straits Exchange Foundation, which is affiliated with the MAC, also
appeared to keep its distance from the mainland delegation. Although
Chiao Jen-ho, SEF vice chairman and secretary-general, attended the
Oct. 15 reception, he stayed only briefly.
     Analysts suggested the response by the MAC and SEF reflected the
ROC government's decision to cool down trade and investment exchanges
with the mainland. In response to such suggestions, the mainland's
Wang said that massive amounts of capital from all over the world
have been funneled into the mainland's infrastructure market and that
Taiwan risks missing out on a golden opportunity.
     The delegation on Oct. 15 toured the Taipei International
Electronics Show at the Taipei World Trade Center and the next day
visited the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, the heart of
Taiwan's computer chip industry. On Oct. 17 the delegation planned to
tour the Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. and call on Kao Chin-yen,
chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries.
     The schedule for Oct. 18 included a seminar with Taiwan business
leaders and a meeting with SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu. A meeting with
Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry
and Commerce, was planned for the following day. The delegation was
scheduled to depart Taiwan on Oct. 20.

Opposition bars premier from power plant report 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Virginia Sheng

     A test of wills between the ruling and opposition parties
unfolded this week as Premier Lien Chan was blocked from entering the
Legislature to explain why the country needs a fourth new power
plant.
     On Oct. 15, Lien made several attempts to enter the Legislature,
where he planned to appeal to restore funding for the power plant
project. But on each attempt he was blocked by a human wall of
Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers.
     "It does not make any sense," Lien said in reaction. "The
Cabinet should be respected." He also made a thumbs-down gesture to
express his disappointment.
     Government Information Office Director-General Su Chi later
quoted Lien as saying that the incident was "a dark day for
democracy" in Taiwan. "They should try to convince people with
reason, but not through force," Lien said.
     Su added that the government welcomes any reasonable discussion
of policy but not irrational behavior. He said the denial of Lien's
entry has deprived the public of its right to learn about the
controversial project.
     At the core of the conflict is the project proposed by the
state-run Taiwan Power Co., the sole power supplier on the island, to
build a new nuclear power plant in the coastal township of Kungliao
in Taipei County.
     The project was first proposed in 1980 but was shelved in 1981
because the 1979 Three-Mile Island accident in the United States
focused public attention on safety.
     Safety concerns grew in the mid-1980s, prompted in part by fears
generated by the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl plant in former
Soviet Union and in part by operational flaws at Taipower's three
existing nuclear power plants.
     The proposal for the fourth plant won a legislative nod in 1992.
Two years later lawmakers approved a budget to cover the project for
the next seven fiscal years. Each year since then opposition
lawmakers have tried to block the funding.
     In a surprise move this year, the DPP and New Party lawmakers
teamed up on May 24 to pass a resolution that scrapped the budget.
Undaunted by the setback, the Cabinet on Oct. 8 sent the power plant
project back to the Legislature for reconsideration.
     The ruling Kuomintang is expected to override the opposition's
resolution on Oct. 18, as it needs the support of only one-third of
the lawmakers present to do so. The KMT controls 83 seats in the
164-seat Legislature.
     Furthermore, Lien said, the Legislature's original approval
should stand lest the nation's major policies be subject to constant
change by the lawmaking body at the expense of responsible politics.
     Suspension of the power plant project would mean a heavy
financial loss, would inevitably hurt the ROC's credit rating and
would erect an unnecessary barrier to Taiwan's bid to join the World
Trade Organization, Lien said.
     The Legislature was originally slated to hear Lien explain why
the plant was necessary on Oct. 15, discuss the issue on Oct. 17, and
then vote on the reconsideration proposal on Oct. 18. But the row
outside the Legislature disrupted this schedule.
     The row also had political implications beyond the power plant
itself, as it reflected a looming constitutional showdown between the
executive and legislative branches over Lien's serving simultaneously
as vice president and premier.
     But the opposition tactic itself came under heavy criticism, as
some said it used the letter of the law to violate its spirit. The
blocking tactic was carried out by through provisions in the law that
permit street demonstrations.
     Some feared that the Oct. 15 confrontation would build tensions
and close off room for discussion and peaceful settlement of domestic
political differences in Taiwan.
     While the power plant issue has been debated for more than 10
years without reaching a consensus, they said, the greater damage may
be to the island's democratic spirit.
     After Lien returned to his office, the Legislature approved a
motion raised by opposition lawmakers to adjourn the session. Among
the 145 legislators present, 75 supported the motion, 68 opposed and
two abstained.
     But before opposition deputies claimed victory, Legislative
Speaker Liu Sung-pan announced that the lawmaking body would vote on
the project on Oct. 18 without further debate.
     The announcement by Liu shocked the opposition lawmakers, who
accused the speaker of repeatedly violating the neutrality of his
position.
     The opposition also pointed to legislative rules. If the Cabinet
wants to reverse a legislative decision, they said, the premier must
first report to the lawmakers on why he wants the change before a
vote is taken.
     KMT legislators countered that Lien had intended to do so but
was barred by the opposition.
     "You opposition deputies have chosen to skip the review session
by dismissing the meeting," one KMT lawmaker said. "Although the
premier could not come into the Legislature to deliver his report, he
did send in a written report."

Justices open dual-status hearing 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Virginia Sheng

     The Council of Grand Justices on Oct. 16 heard arguments on
whether it is constitutional for the vice president to serve
concurrently as premier.
     The hearing, presided over by all 16 grand justices, was
prompted by a petition from the opposition parties claiming the dual
status violates the ROC Constitution.
     President Lee Teng-hui announced in June that he had retained
Lien Chan as premier after Lee and Lien were sworn in as president
and vice president in May. Lien had submitted his resignation as
premier to Lee, not the Legislature, and in retaining Lien as premier
the president did not seek legislative approval.
     The opposition lawmakers objected and petitioned the grand
justices to rule on the issue. In the meantime, opposition lawmakers
last month prevented Lien from making his administrative report to
the Legislature. This week they barred him from explaining the
Cabinet's energy policy.
     Before the Oct. 16 hearing began, the opposition insisted that
President Lee participate. The justices decided it would be
sufficient to send Lee a letter asking his opinions on the issue.
     Because the petition concerns the Presidential Office rather
than the Cabinet, the opposition also questioned whether it was
proper for Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao to defend for the
president since he is a Cabinet official.
     Liao, for his part, asserted that the grand justices should not
be ruling on the question in the first place because the dispute is
purely political and not constitutional.
     Citing former Vice Presidents Cheng Chen and Yen Chia-kan as
precedents, Liao said that serving in two posts at the same time
causes no difficulties in practice. Chen served as premier from 1958
to 1963 and Yen from 1966 to 1972. Liao also pointed out that the
Constitution does not state an objection to a dual status such as
Lien's.
     The opposition said the two precedents took place during the
martial law period, when some provisions of the Constitution were
frozen. They said the government is responsible to establish
constitutional precedents in the time since martial law was lifted in
1987.
     The opposition also urged the grand justices to rule not on the
basis of whether the dual status is practical, but whether it is
just. It is not a matter concerning Lien's ability to serve in two
positions at the same time, they said, but whether Lee has the right
to retain Lien.
     Justice Minister Liao emphasized that the ROC government is
neither a full parliamentary system nor a full presidential system.
Thus, he said, the grand justices must take political realities into
account. He said that the duties of both positions are clearly
defined in the Constitution and that there is no problem concerning
the compatibility of Lien's dual roles.
     Hu Fo, an academic and constitutional expert representing the
opposition parties, argued that the precedents do not make a valid
case. According to the Constitution, Hu said, the vice president is a
backup for the president while the premier should be held responsible
to the Legislature.
     What matters is that in retaining Lien without legislative
approval, the president acted without any check and balance, the
opposition argued. The opposition added that, should a president be
unable to finish his term, the vice president would succeed him and
in such a case confusion would arise if the vice president and the
premier were the same person.
     Lien resigned as premier in January, as required by the
Constitution, before the newly elected Legislature convened Feb. 1.
Lee then renominated him as premier and the nomination won
legislative approval.
     Lien resigned again before he was sworn in as the vice
president. In June, Lee announced that he had retained Lien as
premier. The opposition complained loudly because Lee's choice for
premier was not submitted to the Legislature for approval.
     The nine-hour hearing before the grand justices Oct. 16 ended
without any conclusion and was scheduled to resume Nov. 1, with
arguments centered on the relationship between the president and vice
president, the president and the premier, and the original design of
the Constitution. A ruling is expected in two months.

     A Lafayette-class missile frigate, the Hsi Ning, was
commissioned Oct. 12 at the Tsoying naval base near Kaohsiung in
southern Taiwan. The 3,600-ton frigate, the second of six ordered
from France, is armed with torpedoes, U.S.-built surface-to-air
missiles, ROC-developed Hsiungfeng II anti-ship missiles, the Phalanx
rapid-fire gun system and advanced reconnaissance equipment. The
warship's surfaces are clad in high-tech composite materials that
make it far less detectable by radar, earning it the nickname
"stealth frigate." The ROC Navy ordered the six frigates from France
in 1991 as part of a 10-year plan to modernize the fleet. The Navy
has also leased Knox-class frigates from the United States and
ordered locally built Cheng Kung-class frigates patterned after
U.S.-made Perry-class frigates.

     The Russian Foreign Ministry has notified the ROC Foreign
Ministry that it will open a liaison office in Taipei in late
November. The Moscow-Taipei Cultural and Economic Coordination
Commission will be authorized to issue entry visas to ROC citizens
who want to visit Russia. Russia will thus become the 45th country
without formal diplomatic ties with the ROC to open a representative
office in Taiwan. Victor Trifonov is expected to be named the first
representative in the ROC.

All-party meeting sets up national conference plan 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p1

by Virginia Sheng

     The consensus-building conference proposed by President Lee
Teng-hui in his inaugural address this spring has been scheduled for
five days in late December, a top presidential aide said.
     Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general to the president, said the
National Development Conference will be held Dec. 23-28 at the Taipei
International Convention Center with the aim of building a consensus
on key concerns in order to formulate and implement policies.
     These and other details were agreed on during an Oct. 11 meeting
of the conference preparatory committee. Huang is executive director
of the 29-member committee, which was established on Oct. 5 by a
Presidential Office working group.
     Lien Chan, ROC vice president and premier, is the preparatory
committee convener. Deputy conveners represent each of the three
major political parties in Taiwan.
     The deputy conveners--the Kuomintang's Vincent Siew, the
Democratic Progressive Party's Chang Chun-hung, and the New Party's
Lee Ching-hua, said the first preparatory meeting was conducted with
mutual respect and a comprehensive exchange of opinions. Huang called
the meeting "harmonious" and the discussion "heated."
     President Lee told the committee that the conference will
fulfill the pledge in his May 20 inaugural address to invite opinion
leaders and representatives from all quarters to exchange views on
matters of far-reaching importance to the Republic of China.
     "After we accomplished the direct presidential and vice
presidential election on March 23 ... national development has strode
onto a new stage," Lee told the committee. "In the new system, how to
concentrate the experience and wisdom of our people to seek long-term
prosperity for the nation is the key to whether we can launch a
wide-ranging development program and enter the next century."
     The conference agenda will fall under three major topics:
constitutional reform and party politics, economic development, and
relations between Taiwan and mainland China.
     Possible subtopics include the governmental structure, electoral
system, taxation, financial liberalization, public facility
improvement, social security programs, balancing economic development
and environmental protection, cross-Straits relations and national
security, and the parallel policies of developing Taipei-Peking ties
and carrying out pragmatic diplomacy.
     About 150 delegates, including political figures, scholars and
other opinion leaders, will be invited to the conference. Vigorous
debates are expected on such issues as the relationship between the
president, the premier and the Legislature, the abolishment of the
provincial government and the policy toward the mainland.
     The committee also decided to hold 15 forums throughout Taiwan
to gather suggestions from the general public. Forums among overseas
Chinese were rejected owing to disapproval by opposition committee
members.
     In general comments, Chang of the DPP argued that the government
should consider the conference a forum to establish national policy.
If the conference is not empowered to lead to changes, he added, then
the DPP will withdraw from it.
     The New Party's Lee characterized the conference as a forum for
negotiation or coordination between political parties. He said the
meeting in effect will serve as another advisory board to President
Lee rather than as an extraconstitutional mechanism affecting
government operations.
     While the DPP favorably recalled the National Affairs Conference
in 1990 for laying down a good foundation for subsequent
constitutional amendments, the New Party disagreed. The New Party
also insisted that four subtopics be included on December's agenda:
administrative neutrality, judicial independence, military
depoliticization and media fairness.
     Such particulars and other matters--such as whether to frame the
conference around panel discussions and whether to prepare study
papers in advance--will be taken up in future preparatory meetings.
The next is set for Oct. 22. Committee members agreed that subsequent
meetings should be attended both by party-recommended representatives
and nonpartisan experts.
     As preparatory committee convener, Lien was praised for giving
all members plenty of time to express themselves, though some said
this led to inefficiency. The meeting exceeded its original two-hour
time frame by 90 minutes.

India: Solanki offers to resign AICC post

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  AICC general secretary, Mr. Madhavsinh Solanki,  today  took
the lead among the AICC office-bearers by offering to resign from
his post to enable the new party president, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, to
reconstitute  the AICC. According to sources, in a  brief  letter
addressed to the newly-appointed Congress president, Mr.  Solanki
has offered to demit office to enable Mr. Kesri to choose his own
team of office-bearers.

Mr.  Solanki's  offer  is bound to put  pressure  on  other  AICC
office-bearers to follow suit though all indications are that Mr.
Kesri has no intention at this juncture to reshuffle the AICC.
Another  general  secretary, Mr. Devendra Dwivedi,  had  gone  on
record  that the new president should have a free hand to  choose
his  own  secretariat. The observation of Mr.  Dwivedi  triggered
speculations that the AICC general secretaries may resign.
But the issue did not figure at the first formal meeting  between
the general secretaries and Mr. Kesri earlier in the day. Neither
any  of the general secretaries nor Mr. Kesri made any  reference
to the subject.

In  the course of the meeting the general  secretaries  discussed
the  issue  of  rescheduling  of  the  organisational  elections.
Immediately  after  the  appointment  of Mr.  Kesri  as  the  new
president,  the Congress represented to the  Election  Commission
seeking  extension  of  time till February end  to  complete  the
organisational elections.

Sri Lanka: 100 LTTE cadres killed in fighting

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. d

From Amit Baruah

COLOMBO, Sept. 26.

At  least  100 LTTE cadres were killed and scores of  Sri  Lankan
soldiers feared dead or wounded as the Tigers and the Army fought
their most fierce battles in the Vanni mainland during the  five-
day-old Operation Sath Jaya-III (True Victory-III) today.
A  military source said that the security forces, who claimed  to
have repulsed a massive LTTE counter-attack this morning west  of
Paranthan, had the bodies of some 100 Tigers in their possession.
Apparently, the security forces have also taken heavy casualties.
No details were, however, available of military dead or  wounded.
The Defence Ministry here maintained total silence on the  course
of fighting this morning.

An  official release merely said this morning:  "Latest  reports
indicate  that  the terrorists had launched  a  massive  counter-
attack during the very early hours of September 26 on the  troops
advancing  along the western flank. This counter-attack has  been
repulsed very effectively causing very heavy casualties among the
terrorists."

Earlier,  the military claimed that it continued to advance  both
east  and west of Paranthan in the Vanni mainland  amidst  fierce
resistance  from  LTTE cadres as 13 soldiers and 30  Tigers  were
killed in the last 24 hours.

"On  the  western  flank,  troops  captured  an  important  road
junction  by  the afternoon of September 26.  Terrorists  offered
heavy  resistance during this confrontation prior to the  capture
of the road junction," the Defence Ministry said in a statement.
According  to  the  release,  Sri  Lankan  troops,  after  having
captured  the Murasumoddai area east of Paranthan,  had  advanced
one more kilometre.

Meanwhile, the LTTE denied Government statements regarding  Tiger
casualties.  "There is no truth to the Sri  Lankan  Government's
claim  that  its troops have either killed or  wounded  100  LTTE
fighters on Tuesday..." the Tigers said.

According  to a Tiger release from London, the "actual  number"
of LTTE fighters killed in battle between Sunday and Tuesday  was
26.  Fourteen cadres were killed on Sunday, three on Tuesday  and
nine on Wednesday.

The  Tigers  also alleged that five persons were  killed  and  15
wounded  when  Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) aircraft  "attacked  a
large  crowd  of fleeing civilians"  moving  from  Puthumurippu,
Kilinochchi, yesterday.

India: Strategy for last phase of Jammu & Kashmir polls

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

DODA, Sept. 26.

A  strategy has been worked out to ensure orderly,  peaceful  and
free  and  fair  elections  for the rest of the  six  out  of  87
Assembly  constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir in the  fourth  and
final phase of elections.

This is keeping in view the increasing number of bomb explosions,
attacks on the lives of candidates of pro-India political parties
and  their activists currently engaged in electioneering in  Doda
district to disrupt the conduct of elections on September 30. The
district is most prone to militant violence.

According  to  official sources, Army jawans  and  officers  will
command  and direct anti-militant operations in  the  mountainous
district  of  Doda spread over 11,600 sq. km. The  BSF  has  been
asked to continue anti-militant operations in close  coordination
with  the Army. But the maintenance of law and order will be  the
sole  responsibility of the State law and order  authorities  who
have  already  got deployed more than 500 companies of  the  BSF,
CRPF,  ITBP  and the Jammu and Kashmir Armed  Police.  They  will
provide  security cover to candidates and their  activists,  poll
conducting officers and all polling booths.

The Hindu-Editorial: Towards justice in Bosnia: "It is in the interest of
the former belligerents (in the Bosnian war) to have those guilty (of war
crimes) convicted" and to get rid of "these embarrassing figures"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. c

By Vaiju Naravane

THE  war  in  the  former  Yugoslavia,  a  particularly  barbaric
conflict,  lasted  from  1991 to 1995 and  claimed  an  estimated
100,000  lives. Thousands of people both Serbs and  Muslims  were
tortured  or  detained in concentration camps,  women  were  mass
raped  and an estimated half a million people were driven out  of
their  homes.  In  1993  the  United  Nations  Security   Council
established  the International Criminal Tribunal for  the  former
Yugoslavia in an attempt to punish the Serbs, Muslims and  Croats
guilty of the worst atrocities. So far the Tribunal has  indicted
75 persons of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Of these 51
are  Bosnian  Serbs. These include the Bosnian Serb  leader,  Mr.
Radovan  Karazdic  and General Ratko Mladic who  are  accused  of
having  ordered, the massacres in Srebrenica where  an  estimated
5000  Muslims  were  killed. In addition Mr.  Karazdic  and  Gen.
Mladic  are  charged with genocide and  crimes  against  humanity
arising   from  atrocities  perpetrated  against   the   civilian
population  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  for  the  sniping   campaign
against  civilians  in  Sarajevo  and  for  the  taking  of  U.N.
peacekeepers as hostages and their use as human shields.
The President of the International Criminal Tribunal, Dr. Antonio
Cassese, an eminent Italian jurist, spoke to The Hindu on how the
tribunal has gone about its tasks and the problems it has  faced.
Excerpts from the interview:

The  Hindu:  This is the second time since World War II  that  an
international court has been set up to try war criminals. What is
the difference between this tribunal and that of Nuremberg?
Mr. Antonio Cassese: There are several differences. At  Nuremberg
you  had what has been called Victors' Justice. We  are  carrying
out  Victims' Justice. We can do this because this Court  is  not
the  projection of the four great powers which won the war as  in
the  case  of  Nuremberg,  but  the  expression  of  the   entire
international community. Of the 11 judges, only two are European.
The  others come from countries as far flung as Australia,  Costa
Rica,  China or Canada. The Nuremberg judges were  nominated.  We
were elected by the international community.

Secondly,  the  Nuremberg  court was set up at a  time  when  the
victors  had  total power and control over defeated  Germany  and
judges only had to demand documents or summon witnesses for it to
be done. This court was set up by the U.N. Security Council  when
the war was still going on. Since we don't have a judicial police
we  have to rely on the justice ministries and police  forces  of
the nations concerned to obtain evidence.

The  final difference with Nuremberg is that those  sentenced  by
this  court can appeal. For us a fair trial has become  something
of  an  obsession.  I always say that it is in  the  interest  of
Radovan  Karazdic  and Ratko Mladic to stand trial  because  they
will  be  assured of a fair trial and if they are  innocent  they
will be acquitted.

What are the instruments at your disposal?

We  don't have the kind of marvellous documentary evidence  which
was available to the Nuremberg prosecutors where every order  was
sent  in  quintuplicate. For certain crimes  committed  in  1990,
1991,  1992,  for  instance  in the case  of  mass  rape,  it  is
difficult  to gather direct medical evidence. Our  investigations
are therefore conditioned by the type of evidence we are seeking.
With little documentary evidence available we rely, above all, on
eyewitness  accounts. But often people who have witnessed  crimes
are  afraid  to testify because of possible  repercussions.  Fear
prevents  many  from coming forward. We do not have the  kind  of
eyewitness  protection programmes which exist in the U.S. We  can
protect  our  witnesses  only when they are here  in  Holland  by
disguising their voices or keeping their identities secret. I  am
now trying to set up a network of Non-Governmental  Organisations
which can help eyewitnesses before and after they testify. So  it
is very difficult to gather proof.

Of  the  75 persons accused of war crimes and/or  crimes  against
humanity only eight have been brought before the Court. How  does
the Court intend to see that justice is done?

Not  all  those  who  have been  arrested  are  minor  criminals.
Blaskic,  for  instance, is a general in the Croatian  army.  The
prosecutor  is  going  ahead with investigations and  no  one  is
excluded even at the highest levels. Secondly, we have invented a
special  procedure called Article 61, by which there will  be  no
trial  or  sentencing in absentia. Under this  procedure,  if  an
accused  fails  to  appear before the court,  we  call  upon  the
prosecutor  to  make  not  just the  charges,  but  the  evidence
gathered  against them public. Against Karazdic, for instance  we
have  the testimony of a Muslim who remained buried under a  heap
of bodies at Srebrenica. And we can make this evidence public. If
a  three-judge bench decides that the proof  presented  indicates
that the accused may have committed the crimes, an  international
warrant  is  issued via Interpol for the person's  capture  which
goes out to 200 countries around the world. And then we address a
letter  to  the head of the U.N. Security  Council  naming  those
States which have offered them protection or shelter. Last week I
sent  a  letter  to the U.N. Security Council  stating  that  the
Republic  of Croatia and the Bosnian Croat Federation had  failed
to arrest Ivica Rajic, a Bosnian Croat military leader. The  same
is true in the case of Karazdic and Mladic. The Security  Council
took  note of my letter and condemned the Governments  concerned.
Over a period of time such initiatives have a cumulative effect.
Who can arrest these criminals?

The  Dayton  accords have strengthened the Court.  They  make  it
binding   upon  the  Republika  Srpska  and   the   Bosnian-Croat
Federation  to cooperate with us and to give free access  to  our
investigators. This obligation has only been partly observed.  In
addition,  Article  9 of the accords forbids  anyone  accused  or
indicted by the Court to hold appointed or elected public office.
This  is  the  case of Karazdic. Croatia has now  adopted  a  law
calling  for cooperation with the Court and convinced Blaskic  to
appear  before the court. Drazen Erdemovic (charged with  killing
hundreds   of  unarmed  Bosnian  Muslims,  after  the   fall   of
Srebrenica)  was handed over by Belgrade. So something has  moved
since Dayton. The States concerned tend to look upon the  handing
over  of  their  citizens  as  extradition.  We  say  it  is  not
extradition, it is surrender. Last May we signed a memorandum  of
understanding  with NATO under which NATO forces have the  right,
not  the  duty,  but  the right,  to  arrest  these  alleged  war
criminals.  But NATO forces cannot easily arrest  these  accused,
who  always go about heavily armed or protected, without  risking
innocent human lives. And this I understand.

Prosecutor  Richard  Goldstone  (South  Africa)  left  the  Court
accusing  NATO  of "pusillanimity" for not  having  helped  you
complete your work. Do you share this view?

IFOR  or the U.N. implementation force has been in existence  for
the  past  nine months. And their mandate, which depends  on  the
politicians,  has  not  been revised or updated.  However,  I  am
confident  and  optimistic that the next few months  will  see  a
change.  This  view is based on several factors  including  talks
with relevant people. But I cannot tell you more.

I  would  want to see the arrest of all the big fish -  not  just
Karazdic  and Mladic. And I say that the arrest of  these  people
will have a salutory effect even on the peace process.

Will it be difficult to prove their responsibility?

Many  of these leaders never gave written orders. So  documentary
evidence,  unlike in the Nazi trials, is hard to find. But  there
is the concept of command responsibility or the responsibility of
the commanders, that is to say, besides the military  commanders,
the  heads of state or government who could be held  responsible.
They  could  be  accused  of crimes  of  commission  or  even  of
omission,  of  having failed to punish those  who  committed  the
crimes.  And it is here that the evidence produced at the  trials
of the small fry becomes important. This is how we can  construct
the  pyramid which leads to the very top. It will take us a  long
time, at least five to seven years to complete our work.
How do you respond to affirmations that the arrest of Karazdic or
Mladic will get the war going again?

This was true before the elections. I believe that the  elections
will  bring about a stabilisation of the political situation  and
perhaps  even  an  attempt at integration. I feel it  is  in  the
interest  of the various former belligerents to have  the  guilty
convicted by our Tribunal, to apportion blame, to rid  themselves
of  these  embarrassing  figures. It will be  in  their  economic
interest to do so because donor States could make development aid
conditional  to  the  resolution of this question.  Even  if  the
arrest of these figures leads to minor tension or friction in the
short run, it is better this way than to have war later on, since
most   of  the  persons  indicted  for  war  crimes   are   ultra
nationalists.

The Hindu-Editorial: A challenging Task

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. b

DESPITE  THE  SHORTFALL it experienced in  raising  the  targeted
internal  and  extra budgetary resources (IEBR) in  1995-96,  the
Karnataka  Government  has opted for a 40 per cent  rise  in  its
Annual  Plan outlay for 1996-97 at Rs. 4,360 crores.  Apparently,
the overall performance of the State's economy has encouraged the
Government to take an optimistic view on the prospect of  raising
IEBR  to the tune of Rs. 1,000 crores. The growth rate  in  State
domestic  product (SDP) is expected to go up to 5.3 per  cent  in
1995-96  from 4.8 per cent in 1994-95. Although its  debt  burden
stood at a staggering Rs. 8,704 crores at the end of 1994-95, the
State's  record in debt servicing has been fairly impressive.  As
the  ratio of interest payments to the State's  revenue  receipts
was about 10 per cent, the Government appears to be confident  of
its ability to raise both internal and extra budgetary resources.
The  step up in the Plan outlay calls for a budgetary support  of
Rs.   3,359.45  crores,  a  daunting  task  indeed.  As   Central
assistance and market borrowings have more or less been pegged by
the  Planning  Commission, the Government has to strive  hard  to
make  good  the shortfall by tapping its  internal  and  external
budgetary resources.

The  State Plan for 1995-96 was set at Rs. 3,575 crores, but  the
Government  stepped  up the outlay to Rs.  3,758.28  crores.  The
revised  Plan  called  for a budgetary support  of  Rs.  2,903.29
crores and mobilising IEBR of Rs. 854.99 crores. Following a huge
shortfall in the IEBR, the Government had to cut the Plan size to
Rs.  3,100  crores. The budgetary support also had to  be  scaled
down to Rs. 2,675.78 crores. Although some buoyancy was marked in
the tax and non-tax revenue receipts, the actual mobilisation  of
resources  fell far short of the targets. Failure of  monsoon  in
the  catchment  area hit the hydel power  generation  stations  -
Karnataka relies largely on hydel power - obliging the Government
to  raise  its  budgetary support to the power  sector  from  Rs.
220.84   crores  to  Rs.  344.51  crores.  The  resource   crunch
inevitably  led to scaling down the outlay on the  energy  sector
from  Rs.  689.06  crores  to  Rs.  515.98  crores.  The   actual
mobilisation of IEBR at Rs. 424.22 crores was barely half of  the
budgeted  estimate. Even as Karnataka claims to have the  highest
per  capita  Plan  expenditure, the shortfall  in  the  budgetary
support   in  funding  last  year's  Plan  had  undoubtedly   hit
developmental projects in the priority sectors.

As  the infrastructure projects claim a lion's share of the  Plan
outlays,  the Government has taken initiative to tap the IEBR  to
implement  them.  The  recent revision of  the  power  tariff  is
expected  to yield about Rs. 400 crores to the State  electricity
board.  The Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam has yielded Rs. 300  crores
and the Government appears to be confident of raising another Rs.
200  crores for the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) for  which  World
Bank assistance was expected earlier. With the Central assistance
pegged  around Rs. 378 crores, the State Government hopes  to  be
able to raise about Rs. 59 crores under different programmes. But
it is the irrigation sector that claims a major share of the Plan
outlay.  As the State is under considerable pressure with  regard
to  the  deadline to utilise the Krishna waters,  the  irrigation
sector  has  been  allocated  Rs.  1,168  crores.  The   proposed
expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crores on the UKP and Rs. 300 crores  on
the Cauvery basin project has far reaching political implications
for  the State. The increase in the size of the  district  sector
plan  to Rs. 732 crores from Rs. 620 crores  envisages  increased
responsibilities  for the Taluk panchayats in  rural  development
projects. Given its acute infrastructural problems, it remains to
be  seen whether Karnataka has learnt its lessons  in  mobilising
resources  and implementing its ambitious Plan without  cost  and
time over-runs.

The Hindu-Editorial: Arbitrary exercise of power

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. a

THE  SUPREME  COURT'S  strictures  on  the  former  Minister   of
Petroleum and Natural Gas, Mr. Satish Sharma, on his  "arbitrary
and  mala fide" orders of allotment of 15 petrol pumps not  only
reveal a shocking state of affairs governing the conduct of  some
public  functionaries in the discharge of their duties  but  also
expose the role played by them in distributing favours to all and
sundry  including friends, thereby violating all norms of  decent
public behaviour. Mr. Satish Sharma was one of those high profile
Ministers  who was considered a blue-eyed boy of the  late  Prime
Minister,  Rajiv  Gandhi, and was therefore in a position  to  do
whatever  he liked without being questioned. The allotment of  15
petrol pumps on the face of it is but a very small affair and yet
it  would  only show to what depths a Minister could  descend  in
using  his powers. Mr. Sharma could not have made any profit  out
of  these  transactions considering the fact that they  were  all
given  to  the relatives of Ministers and officials. And  it  was
precisely  keeping  this  fact  in mind  the  Supreme  Court  had
observed  that  no public servant could arrogate to  himself  the
power to act in a manner which was arbitrary.

There  was no doubt that the allocation was absolutely  arbitrary
in  nature  because no attempt was made to fix any  criteria  nor
were  particular rules and regulations governing such  allocation
observed  at all. Which in effect meant that the former  Minister
went about this business as if he was dealing with a matter which
had  no public ramifications and that the departments  under  him
were  treated  as his private domain where his will was  law.  It
goes  to  the credit of the Supreme Court that it had  come  down
heavily on the misuse of his powers in the field of  distribution
of  Government  wealth in various forms. The problem  of  ethical
conduct  for public functionaries, in fact, arises by  virtue  of
the power and influence they command and the commitment they have
to undertake of loyal and disinterested service to the public. If
on the other hand every public functionary at all levels begin to
feel that they have a right to use their powers either to  enrich
themselves  or  their close associates, the  administration  will
crumble.

The  Ministers  do have certain discretionary  powers  which  are
given  to them on practical considerations, to  avoid  procedural
delays and to achieve quick action by cutting red tape. These are
laudable objectives but it also means that such powers should  be
used  in  a  manner  totally consistent  with  the  values  of  a
democratic regime. It is often said that ethics in Government can
be no better than they are in society, that it is a reflection of
the values set within the community. This is taking an  extremely
cynical  view  of the real issue involved.  Public  functionaries
like  Ministers who claim to represent the people at large  could
well set the tone for the rest of the society. Lack of  integrity
and  probity  in  the discharge of public duties  and  the  utter
disregard  for  social  responsibility by  persons  in  authority
should  be effectively dealt with in the interests of creating  a
just  society in which every person enjoys the right to  equality
of  opportunity.  Mr. Satish Sharma must pay the  price  for  his
indiscretion.  The Supreme Court has pronounced its  verdict  and
the  question is whether Mr. Sharma has any chance of  explaining
his  conduct  in defence of his actions which have been  held  as
"utter  violation  of the law laid down by this Court  and  have
also  infracted  Article 14 of the  Constitution."  This  aspect
deserves  a deeper consideration especially when  the  allotments
are  stated to be within the category of "discretionary  quota"
given to the Minister as distinct from discretionary powers which
in  any case would have to be exercised in a  strictly  judicious
manner.

Heritage Day observed sans rancour in South Africa

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 11, Col. b

From M. S. Prabhakara

CAPE TOWN, Sept. 26.

The observance of Heritage Day (also known as Shaka Day,  marking
the anniversary of the assassination of King Shaka), which is one
of the 12 national holidays in the new South Africa, on  Tuesday,
was  notable  for the absence of rancour and  controversies  that
marked its observance in 1994 and 1995.

In  1994, the controversies arising out of the decision  of  King
Goodwill Zwelithini to invite the President, Mr. Mandela, for the
event  without routing that invitation through  his  `traditional
Prime  Minister' Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, marked the  open  split
between  the King and his kinsman, introduced a new element  into
the  fractured  and  tension-ridden  politics  of  KwaZulu-Natal,
further  embittering  relations all around. Following  this  open
confrontation  and  some ugly incidents, Mr. Mandela  decided  to
stay away from the ceremonies.

Last  year,  the King, now more alienated from his  kinsman  than
ever,  decided  not  to  take part  in  the  public  observances.
Addressing  a rally at Stanger in KwaZulu-Natal on that  day,  Dr
Buthelezi  said that the day would be remembered in  history  `as
the  day of the Zulu covenant'. "We are now moving  towards  our
liberation as one nation with one kingdom and one purpose.  Today
is  the  day of unity and the beginning of our  liberation,"  he
said.

On Tuesday, however, the King shared the stage at the King's park
stadium  in  Durban with the Premier of the  province,  Dr  Frank
Mdalsose  (who is also the National Chairman of the IFP) and  Mr.
Jacob  Zuma of the ANC. Observers believe that this marks  a  new
and more positive stage in the relations between the King and the
IFP. In the province itself, the relations between the leadership
of the IFP (which leads the coalition government) and the ANC  (a
junior partner) have been more visibly amiable for some time.
The highlight of the Heritage Day celebrations was the  unveiling
of  a memorial to Enoch Mankayi Sontonga, the composer  of  Nkosi
Sikelel  Africa  (God  Bless Africa), the moving  anthem  of  the
liberation movement, at the Bramfontein cemetery in  Johannesburg
by  Mr.  Mandela.  Mr.  Mandela  also  conferred  the  Order  for
Meritorious Service, Gold Class on the composer and presented the
award to Santonga's granddaughter; and named a park and street in
the vicinity of the cemetery after Enoch Santonga.

Little  is  known  about  Enoch  Santonga  though  his  song   is
universally  recongised by the African people on  the  continent,
and not merely in South Africa. Indeed, the anthem invokes divine
blessing on the continent and its people, and transcends national
identies; and is acknowledged and sung in many African  countries
as an anthem of struggle.

Sontonga  who was a priest and teacher died unhonoured  nearly  a
century  ago and buried in an unmarked grave.  Burial  registers,
where  he is identified only by his first name with  the  further
information that he was a `kaffir' (the pejorative term by  which
both the segregationist British colonial rulers and the apartheid
regime  which  further  refined on  its  predecessors'  cruelties
referred to the black people), record that he was buried on April
19  1905;  and  that he was 32 years of age at the  time  of  his
death.  Extensive  research undertaken after the  country  became
free  succeeded in locating the unmarked grave in the  segregated
section  of the cemetery. Indeed, this feature of  spatially  and
racially segregated burial sites is likely to continue in the new
South  Africa  far into the foreseeable future  even  though  the
Separate  Amenities Act and all other apartheid legislation  have
been scrapped.

India: Pak. trained ultra held

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 9, Col. b

From Our Staff Reporter

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  Special  Cell of the Delhi police claimed to  have  arrested
Kuldeep  Singh  alias Bitta alias Chaudhary,  a  Pakistan-trained
militant  belonging  to  the Khalistan  Commando  Force  (Panjwar
group) from a hotel in Paharganj. Kuldeep had come to the Capital
to  strike  here and eliminate important people. Nearly 3  kg  of
RDX, two timers and two detonators were recovered from him,  said
the police.

Addressing a press conference here today, the Deputy Commissioner
of  Police (Special Cell), Mr. B. S. Bhola, the suspect had  been
assigned  the task of killing moderate Akali leaders,  especially
Mr.  Prakash Singh Badal and those involved in the November  1984
riots.  Acting  on  this  information,  the  police  stepped   up
vigilance  and  started  checking hotels  and  guest  houses  and
managed to arrest Kuldeep.

During  interrogation Kuldeep told the police that  the  militant
leaders  like  Paramjeet Singh Panjwar, Lakhbir  Singh  Rode  and
Wadhwa  Singh  were  under tremendous  pressure  from  the  Inter
Sevices Intelligence of Pakistan to indulge in a major strike  in
India.  To  step up action, various Sikh  militant  organisations
have  come together and working under close cooperation with  the
Kashmiri militants including Lashkar-e-Toiba of Pakistan.
Mr.  Bhola said Kuldeep had entered India through  Chammb-Jhorian
border  in  Jammu  region in August 1996 with 10 kg  of  RDX,  10
timers and 10 detonators. The material was buried under sand near
Akhnorr  border  on the Indian side and he was asked  to  get  in
touch with other activists and establish hideouts for himself  in
Punjab  and Delhi. He was directed by Paramjeet to check in  some
hotel in Delhi and inform him about his location so that he could
direct other militants.

Kuldeep  had  been asked by Paramjeet to conduct a recce  of  the
vital installations, residences of the VIPs and those involved in
November 1984 riots. Mr. Bhola said Kuldeep had gone to Sofia  in
Bulgaria in 1990 on a genuine passport. From Sofia he shifted  to
Germany  and  subsequently to Belgium in search of job.  Here  he
came  in  contact with Prasan Singh, president  of  International
Sikh Youth Forum who motivated him to join the movement.
Mr.  Bhola  said he was sent to Pakistan in June 1992 on  a  fake
passport along with Sukhvinder Singh and Surjeet Singh Bhalla. At
Lahore  they were received by the Pak ISI agents and Bhai  Nishan
Singh  of KCF (Panjwar). Kuldeep Singh was imparted three  months
training  from June 10 1993 to August 30, 1993 in "Ilaka  Gair"
along  with 25 other activists. They were trained in handling  of
assault  rifles, pistols, LMG niper rifle, rocket  launchers  and
other explosives.

India: Malabar varsity to be called Kannur University

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Sept. 26.

The Malabar University's name was changed to Kannur University by
the Assembly this evening.

An official amendment moved by the Education Minister, Mr. P.  J.
Joseph,  for the purpose at the fag end of the discussion on  the
Bill  lead  to  noisy scene in the  House,  with  the  Opposition
registering its strong protest.

The  UDF members alleged that the change was being made  with  an
eye  on  the impending Thalassery byelection in which  the  Chief
Minister,  Mr.  E. K. Nayanar, is a contestant and  that  it  was
against the guidelines of the Election Commission. They said that
the  Education  Minister's  failure to disclose  at  the  Subject
Committee meeting that there was such a move was an insult to its
members and the House at large.

They alleged that it was also part of a move by the Government to
appropriate the parentage of the law. They asserted that whatever
the  Gvoernment  did,  the Bill would remain a  creation  of  the
previous  UDF  Government and its Education Minister, Mr.  E.  T.
Mohammed Basheer.

The ruling LDF, however, strongly defended the change saying  the
name  Malabar University was inappropriate for a university  with
jurisdiction  over only two districts and a taluk of the  Malabar
area.

They  also said that the Government did not need such as  gimmick
to ensure Mr. Nayanar's victory from Thalassery and that he would
win by a handsome margin anyway.

The  Education Minister too stoutly defended the name change.  He
said the name Malabar University was inappropriate as only two of
the  nine  taluks  of  the  old  Malabar  area  came  under   the
University.  Besides,  the old Kannur district consisted  of  the
area now brought under the University.

Mr.  Joseph also claimed to have held informal discussions  about
the  name  change at the Subject Committee meeting and  with  the
leaders of the Opposition parties. He added that the present Bill
was  more  democratic than the one drafted by  the  previous  UDF
Government.  The present law provided for election of members  to
the  various  University  bodies unlike the  earlier  Bill  which
envisaged nomination.

The Opposition, however, insisted on division and the name change
was accepted by the House by 63 votes to 34.

The Hindu-Editorial: Central Asia eyes Afghan corridor

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. e

From C. Raja Mohan

TASHKENT (Uzbekistan), Sept. 26.

Five  years after emerging as an independent nation,  Uzbekistan,
the  largest of the Central Asian republics, is striving hard  at
gaining  access to the sea. The quest for a reliable corridor  to
the  outside  world  has begun to influence  the  foreign  policy
thrust of the Uzbek Government here, most notably in Afghanistan.
Uzbekistan hopes that peace in Afghanistan will open a gateway to
the Indian Ocean through Pakistan.

As the land-locked Central Asian Republics struggle to  integrate
themselves into the world economy, the search for access roads to
the  sea has become one of the most important preoccupations  for
the  newly-independent  nations. Whether it is to  transport  the
abundant  oil  and natural gas riches of the region or  to  build
strong trade links with the rest of the world, securing  reliable
access lines to the sea has become vital for Central Asia.
The  problem  is  most  acute for  Uzbekistan  that  is  "double
landlolcked." It has to go through at least two countries before
touching  any  sea  port. On the  northern  side,  Uzbekistan  is
bounded by Kazhakstan and Russia. To the West, Uzbekistan has  to
pass  through Turkmenistan, the Caspian Sea - which is  itself  a
landlocked water body - and the Caucasus before it can reach  the
Black  Sea.  To  the East it has to  go  through  Tajikistan  and
traverse the entire territory of China to touch the Paciffic.  To
the South it has two options for getting to the Indian Ocean:  go
through  Turkmenistan  and Iran or go down  via  Afghanistan  and
Pakistan.

Centuries  ago, the fabled "Silk Road" of Central Asia was  the
artery  of trade between Europe and China as well as  the  Indian
sub-continent.  But once the sea routes between Europe  and  Asia
opened  up, and the Central Asian Khanates were  integrated  into
Czarist Russia and later the Soviet Union, the Silk Road lost its
glory. With Central Asian republics re-emerging after the fall of
the Soviet Union five years ago, rebuilding transportation  links
to the outside world is at the top of the agenda here.

While the travellers on the Silk Road had to face the unforgiving
elements  and  punishing bandits, trading along these  parts  now
faces  equally  daunting  obstacles:  many  national  boundaries,
transport tariffs and conflicts over agreements on anything  from
freight  forwarding paperwork to visa applications  for  drivers.
The  Central  Asian  governments as  well  as  international  aid
agencies  are helping develop new transportation projects in  the
region.  The focus is on creating multiple routes out of  Central
Asia  in order to limit the vulnerabilities of relying on  anyone
particular outlet.

As  part of its strategy of defining a new political  profile  in
the  regional and the international arena, Uzbekistan is keen  to
diminish  its  current dependence on the  Russian  transportation
networks  to the north. And Tashkent is looking at access to  all
the three seas - to the Black Sea in the west, to the Pacific  in
the  east  and the Indian Ocean to the south. The  Europeans  are
said  to  be enthusiastic about the routes between West  and  the
East  through Caucasus and Central Asia that will develop a  land
access  to  the Chinese market. The proposed network  could  also
include  spurs  to  the  South  through  Iran,  Afghanistan   and
Pakistan.

The  indications here are that the Uzbek Government has  set  its
sights on realising the Afghan-Pak. corridor to the Indian Ocean.
Officials and academic analysts here believe that the Afghan-Pak.
corridor  is the simplest and most attractive - economically  and
politically  -  to hook up with the rest of the world.  It  would
help  the  Central Asians with an important  alternative  to  the
current  dependence  on the Russians. Transportation  links  from
Uzbekistan  and Turkmenistan into Afghanistan and  Pakistan  will
also  help the Central Asians avoid a total reliance on Iran  for
access to the south.

The  dream of reaching the warm water ports of the  Indian  Ocean
faces  just  one obstacle: the instability  in  Afghanistan.  Nor
surprisingly,  Tashkent  has  stepped  up  its  efforts  to  draw
international  attention to the Afghan crisis. It has  taken  the
initiative  to call for an arms embargo against Afghanistan as  a
first  step  towards peace. Rapid developments on the  ground  in
Afghanistan  in the form of the recent military advances  by  the
Pakistan-sponsored Taliban against the Kabul Government, however,
may  have complicated the prospects for the Uzbek  proposal.  But
corridor is likely to be enduring.

International oil companies are also interested in developing the
Afghan-Pak.  corridor to transport the huge oil and  natural  gas
reserves in Central Asia. A western oil executive told The  Hindu
here  that  building  an oil  pipeline  through  Afghanistan  and
Pakistan could be "the catalyst for the economic  transformation
of  the  region." Road and rail infrastructure  could  be  built
along  the  pipeline  routes linking  Central  Asia  to  Pakistan
through  Afghanistan. An American oil company, Unocal,  has  been
pushing  the  proposal in Washington as well as  in  the  region.
Unocal  appears  bullish on the project, despite  the  widespread
scepticism about the prospects for peace in Afghanistan.
India will have to carefully consider the efforts to link Central
Asia  with Pakistan through Afghanistan and the  consequences  of
such   a   fundamental   geopolitical   restructuring   in    our
neighbourhood.  The first thing New Delhi needs to do is  to  pay
immediate   diplomatic   attention   to   the   developments   in
Afghanistan, that could emerge as the hinge between Central  Asia
and the subcontinent.

India: Andhra Pradesh releases water into Poondi canal

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Staff Reporter

HYDERABAD, Sept. 26.

The  Andhra Pradesh Government has formalised the  dedication  of
the Telugu Ganga Project, a canal dug up to convey Krishna waters
to  Madras  for drinking purpose.  It released  Srisailam  waters
into  the Poondi canal, the last segment. The waters, drawn  from
Somasila  project but stored in Kandaleru, a balancing  reservoir
midway,  were released into the Poondi canal.

The release was made on Wednesday as announced earlier. The water
so  released  will reach Uthukottai, near  Poondi  reservoir,  on
September  29  and  the  Chief Minister of  Tamil  Nadu,  Mr.  M.
Karunanidhi,  will  receive the delivery of water at  the  border
village and, in turn, formally release into the Poondi  reservoir
at  a function to be attended by Mr. Manohar Joshi and Mr. J.  H.
Patel, Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively.
Later  in  the  day, at another function  at  Madras  the  Andhra
Pradesh  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  N.  Chandrababu  Naidu,  will  be
felicitated  as  a  token  of gratitude  to  Andhra  Pradesh  for
implementation of the project against heavy odds.  The Tamil Nadu
Minister  for  Public  Works, Mr. Dorai  Murugan,  came  here  on
Thursday,  to  invite the Chief Minister,  the  Major  Irrigation
Minister, Dr. K. Sivaprasada Rao, and others.

Dr. Sivaprasada Rao questioned the propriety of some  Rayalaseema
politicians  belonging to the Congress(I) raising a bogey of  the
Government giving waters to Madras city without meeting the needs
of  their region. He blamed them for "the strange  inconsistency
in their stand" because the successive Congress Governments  did
not  oppose  the proposal and,  instead,   accepted  the  amounts
given by Tamil Nadu Government for implementation of the project.
"Had  they  been  sincere in their stand, they  would  not  have
accepted the money from Tamil Nadu in the first place," he said.
Dr.  Sivaprasada  Rao also said the agreement providing  for  the
Telugu  Ganga  Project was achieved between  the  three  riparian
States  of  Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka  and  Maharashtra  at  the
instance  of Indira Gandhi and in the original project which  was
envisaged as a tunnel, there was no irrigation component at  all,
much less to benefit Rayalaseema. If the Congress leaders at that
time  had  been sincere enough about  serving  Rayalaseema,  they
would  have  prevailed upon Indira Gandhi for  inclusion  of  the
irrigation  component.  "But  they are raising  the  issue  now,
having kept silent then," he said.

Referring  to  the farmers of the region who were  agitated  over
conveying water to Madras, Dr. Sivaprasada Rao made it clear that
what   was  being  sent  for  the  present  was  3   tmcft,   the
contributions made by Karnataka and Maharashtra. Making reduction
in their original share by 5 tmcft each, these two upper riparian
States  had  already released that much quantum  into  Srisailam.
Andhra Pradesh would add its share only towards the fag end.
The  Minister  said it was not true that water was not  given  to
Rayalaseema  altogether  because an extent of  47,000  acres  was
already served with the Telugu Ganga in the region - 37,000 acres
in Kurnool district and 10,000 acres in Cuddapah. The  Government
would  need  at  least Rs. 1,000 crores to  complete  the  entire
project in its present form and it would fully spend the Rs.  100
crores allocated under the present budget.

Asked about the contributions made by the Tamil Nadu  Government,
the Minister said that what it owed towards the project was  less
than Rs. 10 crores.

India: How much water for Madras?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. e

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

With  the  arrival  of  Krishna water  almost  a  certainty,  the
question  uppermost in the minds of people in Madras is how  much
extra water they will get.

At  present, 260 million litres of water is supplied to the  city
residents  daily. If three tmc ft comes, it means an addition  of
240 million litres daily (mld).

In  fact,  when Krishna water was scheduled to come to  the  city
last December, Metrowater had planned to increase the quantum  to
380-400 mld.

It is not known whether the authorities will now be able to stick
to  the  earlier plan as many aspects on water  availability  are
still not sorted out.

For  instance, officials are not clear on how much Krishna  water
will  be actually available for the distribution network and  how
long  the water will continue to flow as there are only a  couple
of  weeks left for the onset of northeast monsoon.  Moreover,  as
the  Kandaleru-Poondi  canal is a newly  constructed  one,  there
might be some teething problems and this could affect the pattern
of inflows.

In  view of these and other factors, any decision on increase  of
daily  supply will be dependent on the pattern of inflows. It  is
likely  that  the  officials will raise the supply  in  a  phased
manner.  Apart  from  the  quantum,  hours  of  supply  will   be
increased.

India: Shifting of refugees begins

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. c

RAMANATHAPURAM, Sept. 26.

The shifting of refugees from the Mandapam camp, which is getting
filled  up due to the recent influx, began on Thursday  with  the
transportation  of  421  Sri Lankan Tamils to  various  camps  in
Tiruchi and Pudukkottai districts. The refugees, belonging to 100
families, were transported with armed escorts in seven buses.
The  Special Deputy Collector (Rehabilitation), Mr.  V.  Subbiah,
told  The  Hindu  at the Mandapam camp that  the  Government  had
planned  to accommodate the refugees at the camps  in  Kamarajar,
Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, South Arcot-Vallalar, Dharmapuri,
Tiruchi,  Pudukkottai,  Tiruvannamalai-Sambuvarayar,  Coimbatore,
Vellore-Ambedkar,  Salem,  Thiruvalluvar,  Periar  and   Dindigul
districts.  The  refugees  would  be shifted  in  batches  of  50
families to each district. Fifty per cent of Thursday's  despatch
included  those who had already been living in the Mandapam  camp
for  the past few years. Mr. Subbiah said about 300 families  had
expressed their willingness to go to the camp at Kottapattu  near
Tiruchi as most of their relatives were living in that area.

India: Effluents treatment: High Court direction to SIV

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. a

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

The  Madras  High Court has granted time till October 16  to  the
South  India  Viscose industries, Coimbatore, to  show  that  the
Lindox  Reactor  plant  installed by it  for  treating  effluents
reached  its optimum operation level and BOD would be reduced  to
the maximum extent.

A  Division Bench comprising the Chief Justice, Mr. K. A.  Swami,
and Mr. Justice A. R. Lakshmanan, passed this interim order on  a
writ appeal seeking immediate closure of the pulp unit of the SIV
at  Singanallur on the ground that the industrial effluents  were
polluting the waters of the Bhavani.

The  Bench said on October 17, a qualified engineer of the  Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and also an engineer of  the
King  Institute,  Madras, should inspect the  industry  and  take
samples of water from the discharge point and also at each  point
of  100 metres upto 1,000 metres. They should test the  same  and
submit  a report with regard to the contents showing whether  the
BOD, COD and colour had been reduced and if so to what extent and
whether they were within tolerable limits.

Both the Board and the King Institute should submit the report to
the  court  in five sets on October 28. It was also open  to  the
industry  to  collect  the samples of water  and  have  the  test
conducted and submit its report also in five sets.

Referring  to the Board's plea for immediate closure of the  pulp
unit,  the Bench said in these cases, it was always the  question
of balancing public interest and the interest of the industry and
its  workmen.  The  Judges  pointed out  that  the  industry  had
employed over 3,000 workers and was in existence for a long time.
Moreover, 300 similar industries were functioning throughout  the
country. As the time sought for by the industry was not long, the
Bench  accepted  the request of the company to  grant  time  till
October 16, when the reactor would reach its optimum level.
Initially  the  SIV filed a writ petition  challenging  the  show
cause  notice issued by the Board on February 15, 1995 as to  why
the pulp unit should not be closed. Disposing of the petition,  a
single  Judge  directed the Board to give an opportunity  to  the
petitioner  to put forth its proposal for effluent treatment  and
to comply with the conditions imposed by the Board.

The  Bhavani  River Protection Joint Council,  which  got  itself
impleaded in the writ petition, preferred an appeal and submitted
that  it was high time the pulp plant was directed to  be  closed
down immediately to prevent pollution of the Bhavani river water.
It  said it was necessary to stop further discharge of  effluents
into the river to prevent injury to public health.

On  behalf of the SIV it was submitted that steps had been  taken
for effluent treatment by installing the Lindox Reactor Plant  at
a cost of Rs. 50 crores. It was making further efforts to  ensure
that  the  effluent was treated to the required  extent.  If  the
factory  was  ordered to be closed about 3,000 workers  would  be
rendered  idle. An opportunity might be given till October 16  so
that  the plant after reaching its maximum operation  bring  down
the BOD content to the tolerance limit which would in turn reduce
the COD and consequently the colour of water.

The  Board submitted that even if the strategy suggested  by  the
industry  was fully implemented, the COD would not be  completely
reduced  and  further  efforts  had to  be  made.  There  was  no
justification to permit the pulp plant to continue to operate any
more.

India: Parties flouting poll code

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 3, Col. b

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

That  the civic polls are round the corner has been evident  over
the  past  couple  of  days  with  political  parties  and  their
candidates  putting  up flags, festoons and  even  an  occasional
`arch' in various parts of the city.

Flags  are  tied  to  ropes  and  hung  across  many  roads.  The
Corporation  lamp posts have come in handy for the  purpose.  The
parties do not seem to have taken the model code of conduct  laid
dawn  by the State Election Commission, for the elections to  the
urban local bodies, seriously.

Section  11  (General)  in  Booklet 3  says  that  'no  party  or
candidate  shall permit its/his followers to use any  private  or
public  property  for erecting flag staffs or  cut-outs,  pasting
notices, posters or writing slogans or suspending banners without
the written permission from the owner of the property  concerned;
and  where such permission is obtained, a copy of the same  shall
forthwith be sent to the District Election Officer and in case of
Corporation to the Returning Officer.'

But  Corporation  sources  said permission is  not  accorded  for
erection  of  structures  across roads,  putting  up  banners  or
festoons.

A  trip  round the city reveals that parties have not  taken  the
rules seriously. Flags tied to ropes have been hung between  lamp
posts across the road Dr. Radhakrishnan Salai, Gopalapuram,  Anna
Nagar 2nd avenue, Nelson Manickam Road, Sterling Road, Muttukkadu
Road,  L.  B. Road, Greenways Road, V. K. Iyer  Road,  Royapettah
High  Road  and Srinivasa Avenue (RA Puram).  The  barricades  on
medians have also come in handy to install the flagstaff.
The ruling party flags and festoons are the most `visible' of the
lot; followed by the TMC, the odd Rajni Rasigar Mandram flag and,
at a couple of places, AIADMK.

Loudspeakers,  especially  the cone type, too have  been  working
overtime  - either blaring music or the voices  of  propagandists
canvassing votes for a particular candidate. The code of  conduct
(Section 13, General) says that "loudspeakers shall not be  used
to  transmit  music or songs".

China may back India for U.N. Council seat

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. f

From R. Chakrapani

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26.

In  the forthcoming elections for the non-permanent seats in  the
Security Council, the United States is known to be backing  Japan
but  India is not altogether without support from  the  Council's
permanent members.

Russia  is  believed to have indicated to  the  External  Affairs
Minister, Mr. Inder K. Gujral, that it will vote for India.
Another  surprise  development  is said to  be  that  China  will
support India. There are signs that relations between Beijing and
New  Delhi are warming up with a projected visit to India by  the
Chinese  President, Mr. Jiang Zamin. The Chinese  relations  with
Japan  are not at its best currently. A Chinese statement in  the
General  Assembly  also showed that Beijing is concerned  at  the
dangers  inherent  in  a unipolar world if it  was  going  to  be
dominated  by a single super power - the United States. The  same
statement,  delivered by the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr.  Qian
Quichen also gave his support to the Non-Aligned Movement voicing
the concerns of developing countries.

Mr. Gujral was asked about the chances of India succeeding in its
efforts  to get elected to non-permanent seat falling  vacant  to
the Security Council from the start of the new year. "We have  a
fighting  chance  to win" replied Mr. Gujral. "If  we  did  not
win,"  he  said,  there  was no reason  why  India  should  feel
disappointed. "But I do think our chances of getting elected are
reasonably good."

Delhi to host NAM meet

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. e

From R. Chakrapani

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26.

The  next  meeting  of the Inter-Ministerial group  of  the  Non-
aligned  countries will be held in New Delhi, it was  unanimously
decided at a meeting of the group here on Wednesday. The meeting,
which  could be held in April or later, will be  of  significance
because  it  will  define  issues to be  brought  up  before  the
Nationalised Summit meeting, probably to be held in South Africa.
At  a  meeting  of  the  ministerial  group  held  at  the   U.N.
headquarters,  and  attended  by a  large  number  of  Nonaligned
Foreign  Ministers,  the  External Affairs Minister,  Mr.  I.  K.
Gujral,  offered  to host the Inter-Ministerial  meeting  in  New
Delhi  and this was readily endorsed by Egypt and  several  other
countries.

About  40  Ministers participating in the  discussions  made  the
point  that  the  Nonaligned  movement  had  not  only  lost  its
relevance in the post-Cold-War era.

Earlier,  Mr. Gujral spoke of the "new challenges"  that  would
confront the Nonaligned movement in the post-Cold-War period  and
it would be necessary for these countries to face them  unitedly.
"These   challenges,"  he  said,  "are  posed  by  forces   of
extremism,  ethnic  discord, terrorism  and  growing  disparities
across  the  globe.  To these challenges, we must  add  those  of
nuclear disarmament, and economic and social development."
He recalled the struggle of the nonaligned countries in the  area
of  nuclear  disarmament,  and explained why  India  opposed  the
Comprehensive  Test  Ban  Treaty. It would  be  apparent  to  any
impartial  observer  that  the  CTBT text  did  not  reflect  any
meaningful  commitment  to the cause of global peace  or  nuclear
disarmament.  The  treaty,  in  its  essential  form,  sought  to
perpetuate the discriminatory and highly unequal status quo "for
all times".

It was necessary for the Nonaligned movement, Mr. Gujral said  to
work for a world free of nuclear weapons and the Nonaligned forum
was   the  most  appropriate  platform  to  achieve  the   common
objectives and shared visions.

Mr.  Gujral also referred to India's bid to seek a  non-permanent
seat in the U.N. Security Council in the vacancy to be caused  by
Indonesia's exit. He sought the support of Nonaligned  countries,
pointing  out  that  if India lost the fight,  it  would  deprive
representation for the movement.

Mr.  Gujral exchanged views on bilateral and multilateral  issues
with  more  visiting  Foreign Minister,  including  Russia's  Mr.
Primakov and Ministers from the European Union.

India: High Court rejects Rao"s plea for anticipatory bail

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. d

From Our Staff Reporter

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  Delhi High Court today dismissed the former Prime  Minister,
Mr.  P. V. Narasimha Rao's petition for anticipatory bail in  the
$100,000  Lakhubhai  Pathak cheating case, in which he  has  been
summoned  by a trial court here to appear before it on  September
30.

Mr. Justice S. K. Mahajan dismissed Mr. Rao's petition  observing
that it was not maintainable. "It should be left to the  regular
court  to  deal with the matter on the accused  appearing  before
that court," he observed.

"As  only  summons  have  been issued by  the  trial  court  for
appearance  of  the petitioner (Mr. Rao) on September  30,  there
cannot be any apprehension of his arrest before he appears in the
court," Mr. Justice Mahajan noted in a four-page order.
The  Judge passed the order after hearing arguments by Mr.  Rao's
counsel,  Mr. Kapil Sibal, and counsel for the CBI, Mr.  S.  Lal.
The  court  was packed to capacity during the  proceedings  which
lasted for 25 minutes.

The Special Judge, Mr. Ajit Bharihoke, on September 21  dismissed
an application by Mr. Rao seeking recall of the summons issued to
him earlier by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mr. Prem Kumar,
and issued new summons to him to appear in his court on September
30.

Arguing on the application today, Mr. Sibal submitted that  since
the offence was non-bailable, the former Prime Minister would  be
arrested immediately on his appearance in the trial court and  he
would  have to make an application for bail. Mr. Sibal  expressed
fear that the trial court might not grant bail to Mr. Rao when he
appeared before it on September 30.

In  this regard, Mr. Justice Mahajan observed in his  order  that
"the  contention of Mr. Sibal that even in a case where  summons
have  been  issued  by  the  trial  court  for  appearance,   the
petitioner  is entitled to move this court for anticipatory  bail
is not correct".

"It  is  only in the case of non-bailable warrants  having  been
issued  and  in  the case of apprehension by the  accused  to  be
arrested  before  he appears in the court, which had  issued  the
non-bailable warrants, that there is an apprehension of arrest by
the  accused.  In the present case, in my opinion,  there  is  no
apprehension of arrest of the petitioner till the time he appears
in the trial court."

Opposing  Mr. Rao's petition, Mr. Lal contended that there  could
be  no  apprehension on the part of Mr. Rao as it was  a  summons
case.  The petition of Mr. Rao seeking anticipatory bail was  not
maintainable, he submitted.

About Mr. Sibal's submission that Mr. Rao be granted anticipatory
bail  by the High Court as was granted to the BJP leader, Mr.  L.
K. Advani, in the multicrore Jain hawala case, Mr. Lal  contended
that  the  case  of  Mr. Advani  was  different  as  non-bailable
warrants had been issued against him by the court.

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  former  Prime Minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao,  and  three
others, including the self-styled godman Chandraswami, were today
chargesheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the
St. Kitts Forgery case.

The  CBI  also named the former Minister of  State  for  External
Affairs,  Mr.  K. K. Tewary and Mr. Kailash Nath  Aggarwal  alias
"Mamaji,"  close  associate  of  Chandraswami  in  the  15-page
chargesheet  filed in the court of Mr. Prem Kumar, Delhi's  Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate.

A. P. Nanday, former Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate and
George D. McLean, Chairman of the First Trust Corporation Bank in
St. Kitts, also figure in the chargesheet. However, the two  have
since died and the proceedings against them have terminated.
Mr.  K. L. Verma, former Director in the Enforcement  Directorate
and  Mr. Larry J. Kolb, a relative of the arms dealer  Mr.  Adnan
Khashoggi, were named as accused in the chargesheet but there was
no  sufficient evidence against them. The CBI has  requested  the
Court  that the two may be discharged. The chargesheet will  come
up  for further consideration before the Court on October 1.  The
judge   directed  the  CBI  to  file  supporting  documents   and
statements before the next date of hearing. Both Chandraswami and
Mr.  Aggarwal  are now lodged in the Central Tihar Jail  here  in
connection with the Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case.

The  chargesheet came a day before the scheduled hearing  of  the
St.  Kitts  case tomorrow in the Supreme Court. The  CBI  had  on
September 9 told the apex court that it would be in a position to
apprise   the   court  of  "definite   actions"   relating   to
investigations in the case.

According to the chargesheet, the CBI investigation revealed that
the  persons accused, in conspiracy with each  other,  fabricated
evidence with the intent and knowledge to cause the former  Prime
Minister, Mr. V. P. Singh and his son, Mr. Ajeya Singh, convicted
of  the offence under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  (FERA)
and  the  Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and  to  harm  their
reputation in the eyes of the public.

The  chargesheet  refers to the report of the  auditors  who  had
scrutinised  the accounts of the First Trust Corporation Bank  in
the  Carribean island of St. Kitts. It says that the account  was
opened  on  September 16, 1988 and closed on February  13,  1989.
Incidentally, both the days were public holidays in St. Kitts.  A
total amount of $21 millions was deposited and withdrawn from the
account.

The four accused, including Mr. Narasimha Rao, have been  charged
under  Section 120-B read with Sections 195, 469 and 471  of  the
Indian   Penal  Code.  The  provisions  relate   to   conspiracy,
fabrication  of false evidence with intent to procure  conviction
of  offence punishable with imprisonment of seven years or  more,
forgery and using forged documents.

The  chargesheet said that as the Minister of State for  External
Affairs,  Mr.  Tewary  had called for  the  file  containing  the
application  for  passport  of  Mr.  Ajeya  Singh  to  trace  his
signatures  which  were  allegedly  forged  later.  This  showed,
according  to  the chargesheet, that Mr. Tewary  knew  about  the
conspiracy right from the initial stage.

The chargesheet was filed six years after the CBI registered  the
FIR in the case on May 25, 1990. The Supreme Court had pulled  up
the  CBI in April last for dragging the investigations.  It  said
that if the situation had reached a stage where no candid  result
could be achieved, the Court might be forced to record a  finding
that the investigating machinery had come to a grinding halt.
The case had been gathering dust until the end of last year  when
the Supreme Court had brought it back to life following a  public
interest petition moved by Mr. Anukul Chandra Pradhan,  advocate,
seeking  the Court's directions to the CBI and other  authorities
to conduct an expeditious probe.

The  FIR had referred to the alleged role of Mr.  Narasimha  Rao,
then  External Affairs Minister in the Cabinet of Prime  Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, as well as of Capt. Satish Sharma and others in the
forgery conspiracy but none of them was mentioned as "accused."
The  St. Kitts case relates to the opening of a bogus account  by
alleged  forgery of bank documents to show that Mr.  Ajeya  Singh
had  stashed  away  a large amount of forex in  the  secret  bank
account.  The documents pertained to the bank account alleged  to
have  been  in  the name of Mr. Ajeya Singh,  maintained  in  St.
Kitts.  The  whole exercise, according to the CBI, was  aimed  at
defaming Mr. V. P. Singh, potential rival of Rajiv Gandhi.
On  the role of Mr. Narasimha Rao, the FIR said that  during  his
stay  in  New  York between September 25 to October  5,  1989  in
connection  with  the  U.N.  General  Assembly  session,  he  had
instructed  Mr.  R. K. Rai, then India's  consul-general  in  New
York,  to  authenticate  certain  documents.  Telephonic  contact
between Mr. Rao and Mr. Khashoggi reportedly took place at  23-06
hours on October 3 and at 09-42 hours, the Counsellor had met Mr.
Rao in his hotel suite.

The  entire  exercise  was  allegedly done  at  the  instance  of
Chandraswami  alias Nemi Chand Jain who had urged the  Government
to  send a team of officials to probe the alleged account of  Mr.
Ajeya  Singh in St. Kitts. A team, comprising the then  Chief  of
the  Enforcement  Directorate,  Mr. K. L. Verma  and  the  Deputy
Director,  A. P. Nanday, had visited the island and  returned  to
New  York with photocopies of some documents which were  attested
by George McLean.

Nanday  was deputed by the Rajiv Gandhi government in  September-
October 1989 to inquire into "reports" that Mr. Ajeya Singh had
a foreign bank account. He conducted investigation in the  "full
knowledge"  of  Chandraswami, Mr. Aggarwal,  George  McLean  and
Larry  Colb.  Nanday had also avoided  Indian  Embassy  officials
throughout  his  stay abroad and was  Chandraswami's  guest.  The
godman  was  staying in Mr. Adnan Khashoggi's  apartment  in  the
Olympic Towers.

While  in  New  York, the officials sought  directions  from  the
Government and were told that the documents should be attested to
by some officials of the Indian Embassy in the U.S.  Accordingly,
the help of Mr. Narasimha Rao was sought as he happened to be  in
New York as part of his scheduled visit. He then asked Mr. Rai to
attest  the documents which would be brought by the officials  of
the  Enforcement  Directorate.  The  allegation  was  that  while
Chandraswami's  secretary was the "master forger," Mr. Rao  had
ordered Mr. Rai to authenticate the documents.

According to the chargesheet, Mr. Rao who was staying at the U.N.
Plaza hotel was contacted on telephone by Chandraswami on October
3,  1989. A day later, Mr. Rao contacted Mr. Prakash  Shah,  then
Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, in connection
with the authentication of the documents.

The  chargesheet  said that on October 6, 1989 Mr.  Aggarwal  had
called Mr. Shiv Kumar, Indian High Commissioner in Port of Spain,
and  introduced him as a family friend of Mr. Narasimha  Rao.  He
asked the official to go to St. Kitts and meet the Prime Minister
there and inquire about the affair. He had also made a  telephone
call to Mr. S. C. Gupta, then Second Secretary in the Indian High
Commission  in Port of Spain, and virtually dictated a letter  to
him to be sent to St. Kitts.

India: Villagers flee as Pak. firing intensifies

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. a

From Our Correspondent

SRINAGAR, Sept. 26.

The hostilities on the India-Pakistan border in northern  Kashmir
has  intensified  in  the last three days,  leaving  hundreds  of
people homeless.

Most  of  the projectiles fired from across the  border  hit  the
civilian  targets,  creating  panic among the  masses.  When  the
firing  did not stop on Tuesday, the people had no option but  to
flee. Large-scale migration started on Wednesday.

Indian fiscal deficit is unsustainable: Camdessus

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. b

From Sridhar Krishnaswami

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.

The  Managing  Director of the International Monetary  Fund,  Mr.
Michel   Camdessus,   has  termed  the  Indian   fiscal   deficit
`unsustainable' and has called upon New Delhi to cut this in half
over the next five years.

Answering  a  question  at a press conference  this  morning  the
Managing  Director of the IMF made the point that while India  in
the  last  few years had solved a few problems such  as  external
financial  vulnerability  and  reducing inflation,  the  pace  of
fiscal  consolidation  seemed  to be  concentrated  only  on  the
Central  Government side. The overall public sector deficit  that
would  have to include the Centre and State governments  and  the
public sector enterprises came to over nine per cent of the Gross
Domestic  Product  and this was not  sustainable,  Mr.  Camdessus
remarked.

The  issue  of fiscal deficit is expected to figure high  on  the
agenda  in  the  meeting between Mr.  Camdessus  and  the  Indian
Finance Minister Mr. P. Chidambaram during this year's meeting of
the World Bank and the IMF.

The argument of Mr. Camdessus has been that if the problem of the
fiscal  deficit  was  not addressed  this  would  jeopardise  the
investment  needed for sustained high growth, and if  allowed  to
continue  there  was  the  potential  of  the  risk  of  external
vulnerability re-emerging.

The  IMF Managing Director said that while there was no  dramatic
solution to the problem, the fiscal deficit could be halved  over
the  next five years. Last week a senior official of the IMF  had
suggested that the programme of halving the fiscal deficit over a
five  year  period could be done at the rate  of  one  percentage
point a year. Today Mr. Camdessus argued that while taking  steps
to  come  to  grips with the fiscal  deficit  India  should  also
simultaneously develop efforts on the structural side that  would
help  do  away  with the quantitative  restrictions  in  imports,
continuing  the  financial reforms and the reform of  the  public
enterprises, besides opening much more broadly the big domain  of
public infrastructure to private investment.

India: PM takes oath as RS member

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The Prime Minister, Mr. H. D. Deve Gowda was today sworn in as  a
member  of  the Rajya Sabha. He had been elected  unopposed  from
Karnataka.  The Prime Minister was administered the oath  by  the
Secretary General of the Rajya Sabha, Mrs. V. S. Rama Devi in the
chamber of the Rajya Sabha Chairman, Mr. K. R. Narayanan.
Besides the Vice-President, Mr. Narayanan, the Railway  Minister,
Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, the Information and Broadcasting  Minister,
Mr.  C.  M. Ibrahim, the former Finance  Minister,  Dr.  Manmohan
Singh, Mrs. Margaret Alva and Mr. S. S. Ahluwalia (all  Congress)
Mr.  Satish Aggarwal and Mr. T. N. Chaturvedi  (Bharatiya  Janata
Party) attended the oath-taking.

Mr.  Gowda,  thus  became  the  first  Prime  Minister  to  enter
Parliament  through the Rajya Sabha. In 1966, when Indira  Gandhi
was  elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, she  was
already a member of the Rajya Sabha. In 1991, Mr. P. V. Narasimha
Rao  chose to enter the Lok Sabha by contesting from the  Nandyal
constituency.

`No threat to Govt.'

The Prime Minister was reported to have said that there could  be
no threat to his Government owing to the change of leadership  in
the  Congress. According to Mr. Gowda the decision to  support  a
non-BJP  formation was taken by the Congress  Working  Committee.
The  implication  was  that it was not  a  private  understanding
between  Mr.  P.  V.  Narasimha Rao and  him;  rather  it  was  a
political  commitment  made  in a particular  context  which  had
remained unchanged.

India: BJP to move High Court on irregular land deals

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE, Sept. 26.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to approach the High
Court through public interest petitions challenging the irregular
land and other deals which had resulted in huge loss to the State
exchequer   as   the   Government  seemed  to   be   unmoved   by
representations and agitations.

This  was stated here today by Mr. B. S. Yediyurappa,  Leader  of
the Opposition in the Assembly.

The  party would come out with a "public  chargesheet"  against
the   Government  about  the  several  irregular  deals   to   be
distributed  among the public as it had done successfully  during
the Chief Ministership of Mr. S. Bangarappa.

Mr.  Yediyurappa mentioned of a transaction involving  about  300
acres  of  Government  land estimated to cost  around  Rs.  1,000
crores near Bidadi coming under Ramanagaram Assembly constituency
represented  by  the Prime Minister, Mr. H. D.  Deve  Gowda,  and
"misuse of funds" in road laying in new Bagalkot town.

Participating in a meet-the-press programme, Mr. Yediyurappa said
only  two years ago the authorities had spent Rs. 4.5 crores  for
laying a 7.5 k.m. stretch of metal roads in the new Bagalkot town
which  worked out to Rs. 63 lakhs per k.m. This was  the  highest
rate ever paid. The authorites had invited tenders for a  similar
road for which the cost specified was Rs. 23 lakhs, which clearly
indicated misuse of at least Rs. 3 crores earlier.

Mr.  Yediyurappa said several such cases had been highlighted  by
him  during  the discussion on the no-confidence  motion  in  the
Assembly  recently,  but  the House  had  been  adjourned  amidst
confusion without a reply.

Describing  the 118-day-old Government headed by Mr. J. H.  Patel
as  one  that lacked political stability and direction,  the  BJP
leader  said it was "an orphan" supported neither by the  Prime
Minister  nor the Ministers and legislators of the ruling  party.
The  hope  that  with  Mr. Patel  becoming  Chief  Minister,  the
Congress  culture would go had been belied as he was  looking  to
Delhi  for  everything  and was in the clutches  of  the  excise,
granite and land grabbers, he added.

Mr. Yediyurappa said the only strength of the Janata Dal, both at
the  State  and in the Centre, appeared to be  the  weakness  and
factional   fight  in  the  Congress.  The  Prime  Minister   was
blackmailing  the  Congress leadership and even hijacking  it.  A
beginning had been made with the weaning away of Mr. Ajit Singh.
He  said  the  State Government was  not  taking  the  Opposition
parties into confidence while dealing with important issues  such
as  river water. Even an attempt was made to mislead them on  the
nature of talks and the understanding arrived at with Tamil  Nadu
during  the  Cauvery water talks recently. The  talks  themselves
were  stage-managed to save the chair of the Prime  Minister  and
the  State Chief Minister. Similarly, the Alamatti Dam issue  was
being treated as if it was a party affair, he said.

Mr.  Yediyurappa  said he recently visited the  Tungabhadra  left
bank  area where an aqueduct had collapsed. The canal itself  had
been  repaired 176 times in the last 45 years. One  estimate  put
the current crop loss at Rs. 500 crores.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who has just returned from a tour of the  State,
said  he was confident his party would win at least four  of  the
six  Assembly seats it was contesting. The party  was  supporting
independents in two constituencies as its aim was to see that the
Janata Dal was defeated.

Mr.  Ramachandra Gowda, MLC and vice-president of the State  unit
of the party, said that completion of 118 days in office was  the
only  achievement  of  Mr.  Patel.  The  ruling  party  was   not
concentrating  on  administration  as it was not  sure  when  the
Government would come down because of instability.

Replying  to  a  question, Mr. Yediyurappa  said  the  party  had
decided to support any candidate to be fielded by the Congress or
the  Rashtreeya Nava Nirmana Vedike in the election to the  Rajya
Sabha.  But  because  of  the decision of  the  Congress  at  the
national level not to field a candidate and the difficulty of the
latter  in fielding a candidate without involving an  element  of
risk  to  the ruling party legislators  supporting  the  nominee,
there was no choice except to keep out of contest.

Mr.  Yediyurappa denied there was any understanding  between  the
Prime  Minister and the BJP president, Mr. L. K. Advani,  not  to
field  a  BJP  candidate against Mr. H. D. Deve  Gowda.  He  also
denied  there was any alignment with the Vedike. It was  only  an
understanding  to  defeat the Congress and the Janata  Dal  which
were two sides of the same coin, he added.

To  another question, Mr. Yediyurappa said Mr. Hegde had his  own
contribution  to the Janata Dal coming to power in the State  and
Mr.  Gowda  becoming the Prime Minister. In the  State  political
interest,  the BJP had to support his stand.  The  meet-the-press
programme  was organised jointly by the Press Club  of  Bangalore
and Bangalore Reporters' Guild.

The Hindu-Editorial: Hares, hounds and lawyers: Lawyers must consciously
project the counter image that they are mediators of accountability and
not for political, financial or any other kind of hire in public interest
litigation

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. c

By Rajeev Dhavan

JOKES about lawyers are increasing. If earlier 'legal` joke books
carried  innocuous  titles like 'Laughter and the  Law`,  today`s
anthologies  are  more direct and vicious, sporting  titles  like
"Lawyers as reptiles." Jokes tell us a lot about how a  society
thinks.  But, not all jokes reflect public opinion. Jokes  are  a
powerful  weapon to embarrass, oppress and type-cast  people  and
communities. If they occasion humour, they also defame; and,  may
damage  the  psyche of those at the receiving  end.  Jokes  about
lawyers  are  typically about their ruthlessness, their  lack  of
scruples in inventing arguments for whoever is willing to  reward
lawyers, their money mindedness. Lawyers are supposed to have  no
qualms  about running with the hares and hunting with the  hounds
with equal aplomb. And, the jokes tell it all.

Despite this reputation, people resort to lawyers. Perhaps,  they
have  no  other  choice but to turn to the  most  'artful`  in  a
society  in  which disputes abound and the rule  of  law  suffers
injury  from constant attack. Some interesting questions come  to
the fore in the recent exchange between Mr. Anil Diwan who is the
Supreme Court`s amicus in the Hawala case and Mr. Ram  Jethmalani
who  was  involved in the public interest case which led  to  the
Supreme Court`s investigation and subsequent orders; but who  now
appears  for  one  of  the accused, Mr.  L.  K.  Advani,  who  is
allegedly  a friend and political ally. Since  both  involvements
were  pro bono (without any payment), the issues are not  clouded
with  any accusation that any appearance was for  personal  gain.
The  argument is over the application of professional  norms  (if
any) to public interest law (PIL) counsel. The narrower issue  as
to  whether  it is proper for Mr. Jethmalani to  appear  for  Mr.
Advani  leads to questions about wider issues  concerning  public
interest  lawyers, PIL and the judicial activism that  has  grown
out  of it. Is PIL a public trust or a matter for the  individual
perception of the PIL lawyers involved?

PIL is a powerful instrument of accountability but it must not be
abused  as  it  has  been  in  many  cases.  Mr.  Jethmalani   is
responsible  for assisting the courts on many  crucial  questions
about who may represent the public interest. Any doubt about  the
legitimate  use of PIL can only give the enterprise a  bad  name.
Controversy  abounds.  One strand of the controversy  is  whether
'libertarian`  lawyers  can  ever  appear  for  those  who   have
allegedly abused human rights. Several lawyers (including myself)
have  been criticised for doing so even where it has been  argued
that  there  were public interest reasons for appearance  on  the
other  side.  This new controversy goes further, it  involves  an
allegation  of  'floor  crossing` in the same  batch  of  related
issues. It is particularly important because of the status of the
counsel and because it is not muddied by financial considerations
but  it is about the scope of the public interest insofar  as  it
concerns PIL lawyers.

The  exchange  between Mr. Anil Diwan and Mr.  Jethmalani  is  as
embarrassing  as it is troubling. Why should two  senior  counsel
quarrel  in  public  over  this  issue?  Discounting  personality
clashes  and differences, the issue needs examination. The  facts
seem  to  be  documented in an exchange of  letters  between  the
protagonists  which  have been made public. In  response  to  Mr.
Jethmalani  having declared that he will appear for  Mr.  Advani,
Mr. Diwan issued a press statement on September 22, 1996 (the day
the proceedings were to start) with "extreme reluctance and only
from a sense of public duty," expressing his discomfiture  which
relates back to March 26, 1996 when he had earlier written to Mr.
Jethmalani  expressing  'alarm` and 'distress` about  the  latter
appearing  for  Mr.  Advani.  It  transpires  that  it  was   Mr.
Jethmalani  who had involved Mr. Diwan in this case. There is  no
dispute about Mr. Jethmalani`s involvement with the PIL case that
led to the Hawala proceedings. In fact, in his letter of April 3,
1996,  Mr. Jethmalani forthrightly states: "I am quite clear  in
my mind that I am the architect of the petition, the moving force
behind  it  and  a  constant  participant  and  advisor  in   the
deliberations." So the issue was not whether he was involved  in
the  PIL  case but whether having been involved he  was  free  to
appear  for one of the accused. After explaining why  the  charge
against  Mr. Advani is totally untenable, in the same letter  Mr.
Jethmalani makes it clear that he has "no intention of appearing
for accused other than Mr. Advani."

Mr.   Jethmalani  justified  his  stance  by  referring  to   the
Advocates` Conduct Rules (which he claims to have drafted)  which
make  a  lawyer bound to accept any brief (except  under  special
circumstances, see R. 11) and to argue fearlessly by all fair and
honourable  means  (R.  15) as long as he  does  not  breach  the
confidence  of the client (R. 17 and 24). But, who is the  client
in the PIL case? Are PIL lawyers their own clients even when they
appear  for others? Mr. Jethmalani`s April 3, 1996 letter  became
redundant  because his junior wrote to Mr. Diwan on April 9  that
Mr. Jethmalani would not appear for Mr. Advani. Mr. Diwan replied
by drawing attention to another rule (R. 33) that anyone who  has
advised  or drawn pleadings for one side shall not plead for  the
opposite  party, pointing out that Mr. Advani`s name  appears  in
the PIL petitioners` pleadings. Equally, having used the  diaries
as a leverage, could any PIL lawyer cross over to the other  side
and  question any part of the case on which the PIL  petition  is
founded?  The  fact  that PIL cases  are  non-adversarial  cannot
foreclose  the  issue. Those affected by the PIL  and  are  being
brought  to book are on the other side. Anyhow, the death of  the
controversy  in April did not prevent a September  revival,  with
Mr.  Jethmalani  informing Mr. Diwan by letter on  September  17,
1996  that he was appearing for Mr. Advani and Mr.  Diwan  making
his press release. Mr. Jethmalani had fairly told Mr. Diwan  that
he  hoped  that Mr. Diwan would not create  controversy  but  Mr.
Jethmalani would understand if he did.

This  controversy is important because the distinguished  counsel
did  what  they did for clear reasons which  are  documented.  It
affects  cause  lawyering in India and may set patterns  for  the
future.  Mr. Jethmalani`s stance appears to be that  the  purpose
behind  the Hawala PIL case was to expose corruption and nab  the
guilty  and  not  oppress  the  innocent;  and  that  it  is  not
inconsistent with the public interest but fulfils its purposes to
defend Mr. Advani against whom there is no case in law. But, if a
personally judgmental stance of this nature were to be  accepted,
every PIL lawyer would be free to make exceptions, jump the fence
and  defend  whom  they like. This is not  to  suggest  that  PIL
lawyers  should not be discerning about whom they  are  attacking
and exposing. Indeed, it is their public duty to ensure that  the
PIL case does not result in a miscarriage of justice. But, once a
PIL case starts, it is for the Court to determine who is innocent
and who is guilty.

However  great  a criminal lawyer a person may be,  a  prosecutor
cannot cross over and be defence counsel even though it is always
open to the prosecution to submit that there is no case against a
particular  accused. Such withdrawal can only take  place  within
the discipline of the law. PIL lawyers are no differently  placed
than prosecution counsel. In environment cases, PIL lawyers often
distinguish between real and wrongly accused defaulters. As  long
as  this  is  honestly  done to  the  Court  concerned,  this  is
unexceptional.  But, these are the farthest limits to which  they
can go. But, just because they feel that one of the persons  they
are  proceeding against is innocent, they cannot appear in  mind,
spirit or fact for the allegedly innocent either in that case  or
any  other  related  proceeding. If this rule  of  thumb  is  not
respected,  lesser  professionals would, even with  the  best  of
intents, run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.

What  complicates  the  present  imbroglio  is  Mr.  Jethmalani`s
closeness  with the BJP, his appointment as Law Minister  in  the
ill-fated  BJP  Ministry, his ire  against  particular  political
parties  and  persons and his frankly declared  political  views.
This  must,  perforce, leave behind the impression  that  a  very
important  PIL case was not without political undertones even  if
it  was conceived in the public interest. This would  affect  the
enterprise of PIL as a whole. Properly interpreted the rules  are
reasonably  clear  cut. Involvement in a case (albeit  by  giving
advice or settling legal documents) is enough to prevent  lawyers
from  appearing for anyone in that or in any related  case  where
there may be a potential conflict of interest. This rule must  be
applied  in  an all or nothing fashion; and,  with  even  greater
rigour in PIL cases where the public is the client.

Jokes  about lawyers underline public suspicion about how  artful
lawyers  can be. But, before the jokes take their  toll,  lawyers
must  consciously  project  the  counter  image  that  they   are
mediators  of accountability and not for political, financial  or
any other kind of hire in PIL cases. Even the best of  intentions
may produce the worst of results. Nothing should be permitted  to
undermine  faith in the law at a time of moral cholera.  If  this
means clearer rules about cause lawyering, so be it. All the more
so,  because two senior counsel and 'eminent jurists` seem to  be
unsure about the rules and the right course of action.

Attitude of our athletes has to change: Amritraj

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. a

MADRAS, Sept. 27.

Vijay Amritraj sees India's poor record in the world of sport  as
a puzzle. And he quietly sets about putting the pieces together.
"All  the  pieces are there," he says, with a  smile  quite  as
radiant  as a child would flash after putting together its  first
plastic alphabet puzzle.

"It's  the attitude," says Vijay, raising his voice  just  that
bit  for theatrical effect as he picks up the last piece  of  the
puzzle.  "The attitude of our athletes has to change. They  seem
to  settle  for less, they seem to be contented with  less,"  he
says.

It  is  another  one  of  the  globe-trotting  former  Davis  Cup
captain's    meet-the-media    mornings   and    the    celebrity
player-turned-commentator is talking about why India should be so
backward in the world of sport.

"If  you look at the kind of money that has gone into  the  game
(tennis) in the last five years and then look at the results,  it
doesn't  match  up.  We  really have  to  demand  more  from  our
athletes," says Vijay.

He  is  tremendously impressed by Leander  Paes's  bronze-winning
effort  at Atlanta but feels that it is not enough in the  larger
context of Indian sport.

"Why settle for one bronze. I think if we make a serious effort,
if  we  shortlist 10 or 15 sports where we are fairly  good,  and
then  bring in sponsorship and scientific training, there  is  no
reason  why  we should not win at least five golds  in  the  2004
Olympics," he says.

"From  a  very  young age you have to aim for  the  sky,"  says
Vijay,  who was recently elected to the Board of the Tennis  Hall
of Fame at Newport, Rhode Island.

Quickly  the  conversation  veers towards his  pet  project,  the
Britannia  Amritraj  Trust programme. And Vijay says  that  "BAT
cannot always be the answer. It is only an example, a  yardstick.
Others have to follow."

He  is happy that BAT has moved to its own facility at  Mogappiar
on the outskirts of the city. "We'll continue to put in our  bit
but  you can never teach anyone to win. If you ask what  does  it
take to win, the answer is, there is no answer. Some do it better
than the others," he says.

In his time, he did it better than any other Indian of his era.

Film Review: "Subhash"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 26, Col. e

It  has now become a standard theme for the heroine to  wish  the
hero  to  be a national personality to ask for her hand  and  the
latter  doing  so  in a trice on  the  screen.  Sivasri  Pictures
"Subhash"  is no exception and with that format is included  an
interesting  twist  in  the form of the brother of  the  hero,  a
minister,  being hand in glove with anti-national elements  which
puts the hero in a dilemma to arrive at a decision.

Director  R.  V. Udayakumar, who has displayed  his  flourish  in
dealing with love themes set in rural areas, ventures into  areas
of  action.  His handling suffers to some extent in  the  opening
portion  the  Indian  army  men  are  at  the  receiving  end  in
containing  the infiltrators on the border, only  Col.  Subhash's
line  of  communication being `active'. The viewer is  given  the
impression  that  the  other two wings of the  Indian  team  have
failed  to  stop the aliens. But actually one sees  some  half-a-
dozen  automatic  weapons  carrying  thug  like  persons  running
helter-skelter  in the forest; the hero, with a pistol  on  hand,
goes  bang bang. Then a commander at the  headquarters  announces
`Thank  God, the country has been saved (by Subhash), the  entire
segment  of the dialogue here being mostly in English.  What  had
happened  to  the  other two wings of the Indian  forces  is  not
known.  This  sloppy work of the director is compensated  by  the
good  camera  work of Shiva and the director comes into  his  own
when he moves into the drama of hearts.

As usual it is the timid Shastri girl Savithri (Revathi) for whom
the  hero  Subhash (Arjun) falls in love though he has  a  svelte
shapely  lass Anitha (Monica Bedi) almost begging for  his  love.
Subhash's father (Jai Shankar) is a rich influential lawyer while
his  first  son Rajasekhar (Siddique) is  a  respected  minister.
Rajasekhar  and  his wife (Sudha) treat the hero like  their  own
son. The wooing of Savithri by Subhash gives rise to some  tender
moments  nicely  handled  by  the  director,  particularly   when
Savithri  says she does not love him and asking him to stay  away
from  her,  all told in gentle manner. The timid  nature  of  the
character  is  adequately brought out by Revathi with  her  voice
modulation. She further catches the attention in the scene  where
she  firmly  states that she wants a life partner  who  had  done
something  for the country, making the hero join the  army.  Then
Revathi  is sidelined till the end when the minister's  moves  to
safeguard  his position occupy the frames. Manivannan, the  party
worker with ulterior motives and with a cheeky tongue, cashes  in
on  the  opportunities  in  the  toppling  game  played   between
Rajasekhar  and  his  arch  rival in  politics  but  best  friend
Arumugamy  (Prakashraj). Siddique and Prakashraj are made  up  on
the  same lines and one has to make sure who is going to die  and
who  isn't. Siddique plays the cool customer villain  with  quiet
efficiency.

Arjun shows remarkable agility in the action segments,  indulging
in  clashes  atop  a moving goods train in a  ghat  section,  the
camera  of Shiva again doing the trick and the stunt men  of  the
Subbarayan team essaying the action with vigour. In the  face-to-
face  meeting with his brother on the train Arjun is quite up  to
the task. Monica Bedi is at ease in the romance areas  performing
the dances with elan. (Arjun has rendered a song with Sujatha  in
"Chutti  Ponnu" and all the lyrics for the six songs have  been
written by the director). The other two reasonably good tunes  of
Vidyasagar  are  "Thendral vanthu" (SPB  and  Chitra),  "Mugam
enna" (SPB and Swarnalatha).

The Vadivelu-Vivek comedy is nothing much to enthuse about  while
adequate support is extended by Jai Shankar, Y. Vijaya, Sudha, K.
R.  Vatchala,  Prakashraj,  Hemanth  (the  bogus  swamiyar)   and
Prasanna.

`Mission: Impossible'

Watching  director  Brian de Palma's creations  is  like  piecing
together  a giant jig-jaw puzzle. The way he unfolds  the  drama,
the  close-up, tight editing and the depiction of  incidents  all
make  the  viewer's grey matter work overtime. And if  the  theme
happens to be connected with undercover agents as in  Paramount's
"Mission: Impossible" then the intrigue and suspense will  grip
the viewer till the last.

The  theme  about  double agents is not new  but  the  director's
inimitable  style  of  narration  makes  every  twist  and   turn
engrossing.  Ethan  Hunt's  (Tom Cruise) entire  team  headed  by
veteran  Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is killed while on a top  secret
mission  to retrieves a list of CIA agents stolen by the bad  man
Golitsyn.  Now Golitsyn wants to steal another list of  the  real
names  of  the agents. The top brass suspects Etham, who  is  the
sole  survivor and he is suspended. The escape of Ethan from  the
posh  aquarium-cum-restaurant  where  he  meets  the  CIA  chief,
Kittridge  (Henry Czerny) is an interesting scene. Ethan goes  to
Jim's  place  to learn the identity of the culprit  and  that  is
where he gets the first clue - "Job: 14," a code connected with
the  Bible - and learns about the dealer Max (Venessa  Redgrave),
an old woman with deadly connections. He makes a deal with her to
get  the identity of the seller of the first list by offering  to
get the second list.

For  this piece of operation, he gets the help of  Krieger  (Jean
Reno)  and Luther (Ving Rhames) and breaks into a  high  security
chamber  of  the  headquarters.  The  trio  escape  the  security
measures  by  entering the chamber  through  the  air-conditioned
duct.

With  the  information  in hand, Ethan  prepares  for  the  final
meeting with Max when a "dead" Phelps makes his appearance. The
unbelievable  happenings atop the fast moving train offer  a  new
experience to the viewers.

Top  Cruise is a co-partner of the movie shot by Stephen H.  Brum
with the special visual effects provided by Industrial Light  and
Music.

India-Film: Humane, down to earth: Vijayalakshmi

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 26, Col. d

Right  from her childhood, she had the burning desire to  act  in
films.  Born into an indigent agriculturist's family of Eluru  in
Andhra  Pradesh  Vijayalakshmi knocked at the  doors  of  several
producers  before she bagged a couple of roles in Malayalam.  Her
persistence  paid  off  when  she  was  cast  in  a  Tamil  film,
"Vandichakram" directed by K. Vijayan. Overnight  Vijayalakshmi
became a star with a new name `Silk' Smitha.

There  was no looking back for Smitha after  "Vandichakram".  A
dance number by her became mandatory in almost all Tamil films. A
song  with Kamal Hassan in AVM's "Sagalakalavalavan"  became  a
big  hit and boosted her popularity immensely. She acted  as  the
heroine in four films - "Silk Silk Silk" and "Police  Police"
in Tamil and "Veeravikram" and "Premachesudu" in Telugu. When
she was riding the crest of a success wave, two films produced by
her bombed at the box office.

A  frustrated Smitha quit acting in films for two years. She  re-
entered the film industry through Maniratnam's "Geetanjali".
Smitha   was  a  humane  person.  Every  year,  on  Pongal,   she
distributed free clothes to the poor. Her views on marriage  were
firm.  She once said that no one would be interested in  marrying
her. "He may ask me why I wear this dress and that. As far as  I
am  concerned, marriage is not for me. So I am not interested  in
it."  Her biggest regret in life was the film she produced.  "I
did  the biggest blunder in my life by producing films. I do  not
know  anything about production. But I produced three  films  and
lost what I had earned through acting."

India-Music: A mesmeric touch: Sanjay Subramaniam

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. a

SVK  on  a  concert where there was enough  musical  material  to
tickle the admiration of listeners.

In  the  concert  by Sanjay  Subramaniam  for  the  Maharajapuram
Viswanatha Iyer Trust, the joy he created in the alapana and song
was  a palpable entity. His imagination was not vitiated  by  the
usual intellectual mechanism. Massive in manodharma, energetic in
exposition, sumptuous in sensitivity and replete with  refinement
his  Bhairavi raga alapana brimmed with  fascinating  sentiments.
The  values  he  cherished  in  elaborating  the  raga  made  his
presentation  first class. He gave primacy to raga swaroopa  even
while  sticking to present day cutcheri formulations.  There  was
enough  musical  material  in  it to  tickle  the  admiration  of
listeners.  The  characteristic feature of his technique  is  his
lesser  desire  to please the rasikas by the voice  than  by  the
grandeur of the raga structure.

Sanjay  Subramaniam believes in an assertive salesmanship of  his
musical  wares.  In the very first song `Vallabha  Nayakasya'  in
Begada, the pace and punch were overpowering. He gave a  mesmeric
touch  to  this  song  and the  others  `Kartigeya'  (Thodi)  Oh!
Rajeevaksha  (Aarabhi) and "Upacharamulanu"  (Bhairavi).  There
was ostentation and pomp in the way he rendered the kirtanas, but
refinement in approach made for their instant appeal. The Aarabhi
raga  alapana glistened with elegant sancharas. While  diligently
eschewing  obesity in vinyasa, the delineation looked  aggressive
with  the janta sancharas, a distinguishing label, gaining  great
prominence  at  his hands. The Bhairavi  coming  immediately  was
couched  in  salubrious  tenderness. Perhaps  the  very  mood  of
Bhairavi  induced  him to soften his voice  particularly  in  the
sthayi  range  when he emphasised the beauteous light  and  shade
manoeuvres. Sriram Kumar on the violin had not much difficulty in
framing the alapana lines of Aarabhi and Bhairavi because  Sanjay
earlier had laid the highway well and truly. The movement of  the
sancharas  was smooth and the low modulation made  his  rendering
soft  and  flexible. Arun Prakash as  the  mridangam  accompanist
contributed to firmness of percussive support without sacrificing
the gentleness of laya's place in a concert.

In the 5 O'Clock session Sasikaran presented his musical training
through  emphasis  on  songs. If Sanjay sought  to  win  audience
appreciation  through Begada, Aarabhi and Bhairavi (all  familiar
ragas)  Sasikaran  somehow seemed to place his  faith  on  Chaya,
Tarangini,   Kannadagowla,  Bhoopalam  and   Chandrajyoti   often
provoking  some members of the audience to ask the vocalist  what
raga  it was. A cutcheri built on such a selection  could  hardly
enthuse the rasikas. Towards the end came Madhyamavati (`Palinchu
Kamakshi')  while  his  presentation of the raga  picture  was  a
scale-model.  B. Gayatri, violinist, played with such  depth  and
delicacy that one could easily differentiate the approach of  the
vocalist  and  the  appeal of the violinist. It  was  a  luminous
Madhyamavati   that  Gayatri  presented,  luxurious   in   loving
sancharas. There was enough expressional maturity in her handling
of  the  raga. Sasikaran sang "Sri Maha Ganapathe"  (Abhogi,  a
composition  of N. S. Ramachandran) "Kripa joo chutaku"  (Chaya
Tarangini)   `Orajoopuchu'  (Kannada  Gowla)   `Sadaachaleswaram'
(Bhoopalam)  and "Bhagyanayya" (Chandrajyoti).  Familiar  ragas
and songs are the surest and easiest way to woo rasika attention.
J.  Balaji  was  the mridangam accompanist who  nursed  his  role
competently.

Being brought up in an atmosphere of excellent musical  tradition
gives a head start to a young aspirant like Master Ramprasad, the
grandson of Palghat Mani Iyer. Striving to live up to the demands
of  such a tradition requires not merely well-learnt songs,  raga
alapana techniques and swaraprasthara methods. These are  aspects
of  music  that  many youngsters in the  field  today  are  quite
conversant with and climb the dais with confidence. But only when
the  most  elusive  feature of refinement  in  interpretation  is
achieved,  the advantages of an ennobling traditional  atmosphere
can  be  said  to have conferred noteworthy  excellence.  In  the
absence of such refinement, music becomes formula-ridden.
Singing  for  Raga  Tarangini  the  performing  style  of  Master
Ramprasad gave rise to these thoughts. He has memorised the songs
well  and presenting them to the audience with competence he  put
his claim to due recognition on that score. He seems to feel that
a  stepped-up  kalapramana  to  songs  contributes  to   cutcheri
liveliness.  In  that attempt, in singing fast  sangatis  or  the
second kala swaras he bit more than he could chew. Each  avartana
of  the  second  kala swara to the  songs  "Chani  Todi  Theve"
(Harikambhoji)  "Tulasidala" (Mayamalavagowla)  and  "Ennaganu
Rama  Bhajana" (Pantuvarali) was a race to the  starting  point.
The  same  haste  was  to be noticed  in  the  mel  kala  neraval
passages.  Nowadays  cutcheries  centre mainly  round  these  two
segments  of swara and raga speeds. Ramprasad too seems  to  have
fallen  into  this trap. With many years before him he  would  do
well  to gradually understand that visranti is the atman of  good
music. Pantuvarali raga lines were okay, but the Mukhari  alapana
attempt  was not so satisfying. Mukhari and Begada are two  ragas
whose  scales  alone do not bring out their beauty.  One  has  to
sense  a  feel  of the ragas. "Emani Ne"  was  the  kirtana  in
Mukhari.  T.  R. Rajamani kept his role of a  violin  accompanist
well  both  in raga alapanas, neraval and swaras.  Ganapathi  Ram
playing  on  the mridangam gave lustrous  support  through  well-
nourished korvais and cross-beats to embellish the songs.

India-Music: Marked by refinement: Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. a

With  his  artistic  talents  directed  strenuously  towards   an
intuitive  search for and interpretation of the features  of  the
classical  music of the South in a state of old time  excellence,
Neyveli  R. Santhanagopalan succeeded in sustaining the  interest
of  an appreciative audience. Featured by Tambaram Music Club  at
Sita Devi Garodia Hindu Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School in East
Tambaram,  his vocal recital gave much satisfaction to lovers  of
serious music.

The  vocalist's  involvement  in conveying the  contents  of  his
recital  in a reasonably refined style was discernible  right  in
his  faithful  execution  of  the  opening  piece,  the   varnam,
`Viriboni'  in Bhairavi set to ata tala. His exposition  of  this
monumental  varnam  with concentration on the projection  of  its
classical  strength  evoked keen listening. Though  he  chose  to
render  the first line of his extempore swaras for this piece  in
the  slow  tempo with an earnestness to extend  the  raga's  mood
refreshingly  and forcefully, the instinct to engage  himself  in
exciting progression of swaras in the accelerated middle pace had
a sway and made him spurn the slow pace instantly.

Santhanagopalan's  rendition  of the piece,  "Girirajasuta"  of
Tyagaraja  in  Bangala was adequately reflective  of  the  song's
scintillating  musical  setting in a happy mood.  The  piece  was
suffixed  interestingly with a set of colourful swara texts.  The
vocalist's  outline of Panthuvarali had a smart course  with  its
familiar phrases touched upon with a commendable insight into its
swarupa.  The  piece that succeeded it  was  `Aparamabhakthi'  of
Tyagaraja  extended elegantly to an engaging session  of  neraval
and swaras for `Lakshmidevi' etc.

Following  an attractive representation of Marukela of  Tyagaraja
in  Jayanthasri,  Santhanagopalan  presented  a  fairly  detailed
description  of Bilahari with a clear perception of its  Carnatic
identity. The piece, `Sri Chamundeswari' in it came in a pleasing
diction.

Tiruparkadal  S. Veeraraghavan's accompaniment on the violin  was
comfortable. His profile of Bilahari had an enjoyable traditional
flavour.

T.  K.  Murthy offered lively rhythmic support on  the  mridangam
with  powerful  percussion  patterns.  Srirangam  Kannan   played
gleefully on the morsing.

The  veena  recital of Prabhavathi Ganesan featured  by  Tirumala
Tirupati Devasthanams Information Centre at its auditorium in  T.
Nagar on the day of the birth star of Lord Venkateswara formed  a
delightful  display  on  her  accomplishment  as  a  sufficiently
sensitive artiste.

Opening  her  recital with a  tasteful execution of  the  varnam,
`Vanajakshi' (Kalyani, adi tala), she played `Vallabha Nayakasya'
of  Muthuswamy  Dikshitar  in Begada with a zest  to  expose  its
moving  musical  contents through hearty gamakas.  The  artiste's
recital of the piece, `Orajupu' (Kannadagowlai) of Tyagaraja came
in a mellow style of veena artistry.

Her sketch of Panthuvarali was tentative and it was followed by a
convincing  diction of `Aparamabhakthi.' The piece was  completed
with a tidy session of neraval and swaras.

Following an enjoyable exposition of `Kshirasagara' of  Tyagaraja
in  Devagandhari,  the artiste rendered `Manavyala' of  the  same
composer in Nalinakanthi in an agile instrumental version. It was
in  her  detailed delineation of Karaharapriya  that  Prabhavathi
Ganesan revealed the strong foundation laid for her artistry in a
rigorous  school.  The  essential  features  of  this  raga  were
communicated by her in an immensely satisfying emotive mode.  Her
diction of the piece, `Pakkala' (Tyagaraja) in it was neat.
Nanganallur  Sriram  (mridangam)  and  Rajesh  (ghatam)  provided
affable percussion support.

India-Art: Based on Nature: T. C. A. Gopalakrishnan

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. c

T.  C. A. Gopalakrishnan was a member of the Madras Art Club  and
learnt painting from artists who were also in the faculty of  the
College  of Arts and Crafts, Madras.

Even  though the Club is no longer functioning he continues  with
his  hobby  in a very keen manner.

All his themes are based on nature and the paintings such as  the
"Serene forest" and "The glowing forest" evoked cool and calm
feelings in the viewer.

Even   when  expressing  abstract  emotions  like   "Suspicion"
Gopalakrishnan   uses  birds  and  animals  to  illustrate   such
feelings.

In all the water colour paintings exhibited recently at the Lalit
Kala  Akademi,  he uses the same style of filling the  area  with
thin  lines of colour using 0 or 00 brushes instead of  giving  a
wash;  of course in the pen and ink drawings - some of  his  were
also  shown  -  this  is a  practice  adopted  by  many  artists.
Gopalakrishnan admitted to using the same technique in oils  too.
His works are pleasing and decorative:

He  has participated in many National exhibitions, and the  shows
of Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, Hyderabad Art Society,  Bharat
Kala  Parishad, Hyderabad in which he was  "Highly  commended,"
All India Prints Exhibition, etc.

He  also participated in a camp organised by the Tamil Nadu  Ovia
Nunkalai Kuzhu and his work can be found in the Madras Museum and
private collections.

Dance: Confident display

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 28, Col. d

Sri   Parthasarathy  Swami  Sabha,  the  96  year  old   cultural
institution conducted a dance series recently, featuring artistes
from different schools.

S.  Meera, disciple of S. K. Kameswaran and Saroja, performed  on
one of the evenings, marking her out as a sincere follower of the
Vazhuvoor  tradition. Guru S. K. Kameswaran, gave  vocal  support
for  the  recital  which was conducted by  Mahalakshmi  who  ably
handled the nattuvangam.

Meera  has  a  charming personality  and  very  expressive  eyes.
Technically she scored fairly in the Jatiswaram (Kalyani) and  in
the    following   varnam,   "Naadanai   Azhaithu    Vaa"    of
Tiruveezhimizhalai  Sri  Nataraja Sundaram  Pillai.  The  typical
theermanams  of Vazhuvoor school were fulfilled skilfully by  the
dancer.  But her abhinaya one hopes, will improve with  time  and
experience.

Also  there  seemed  a wrong notion  in  her  presentation  that,
throughout  the recital a dancer should keep a pleasant face  and
that  too  with  a full smile always  flashing  the  teeth.  This
appeared  totally  unrelishable, especially when the  dancer  was
emoting  for the lines - "Vedanai Tuyarile" -  meaning  "while
experiencing  the pangs of agony".

A calm face would bring the necessary dignity. The ideas of Bhava
abhinaya,  without  dramatisation or overdramatisation,  and  the
feeling  of sensitive element of divine approach to this  section
of  Bharatanatyam  seem  to  have lost  their  values  when  such
presentations are witnessed.

Earlier  in  "Brochevarevarura"  (Khamas)  scenes  of  Gajendra
Moksha  was  overdramatised. Subtlety is the keynote  to  achieve
skill in abhinaya.

Meera,  on the whole, appeared composed and confident  throughout
the performance.

Neat job by veteran director: "Nerukku Ner"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 29, Col. a

Seething  with the memories of humiliations and grievances,  they
shun each other, one man's name spelling anathema to the other.
In  `Nerukku Ner', the ultimate confrontation is not between  the
usual duo - friends whose goodwill has soured or brothers who are
deadly enemies. The clash is between an elderly father-in-law and
his  only middle-aged son-in-law. Nursing a deeply felt sense  of
wrong  done, and allowing emotional wounds to fester, they  avoid
each other's company. Until compelled by circumstances and  their
own impulses to forget and forgive, to bridge the gulf.
One  of the few quality plays to be witnessed recently  "Nerukku
Ner"s strength was the completely natural way in which the story
and  theme was dealt with. Writer K. S. N. Sundar showed  a  good
grasp of human psychology and built up the drama in neat, logical
steps.  Veteran  director K. S. Nagarajan had done  a  fine  job,
handling  the  story  in a crisp, capable  fashion  not  allowing
himself  to  be sidetracked into irksome comedy or  padding.  The
result was wholesome fare that captured the essence of the milieu
it was set in - the Brahmin middle-class - without distortion  or
caricature.

Even  after a quarter century has passed, Raghavachary (K. S.  N.
Sundar)  rages  at the insults heaped on him  by  his  son-in-law
Varadarajan  (V.  Chandru)  years  ago. When  his  only  son  and
daughter-in-law perished in an accident, Raghavachary had  sought
refuge for his year old orphaned grandson, in Varadarajan's home.
The   son-in-law  ordered  him  out  as  he   held   Raghavachary
responsible  for his mother's heartbreak and  death.  Varadarajan
also forbids his wife Vaidehi from having anything to do with her
father.

Determined  to cope on his own, Raghavachary, a widower,  manages
to bring up his grandson. At 25, Madhavan (Akshay Kumar) is now a
smart  executive  and the apple of his  grandfather's  eye.  When
Vaidehi  (S. P. Srimathi) seeks to get her daughter  Mala  (Indu)
married  to  Madhavan  using her son Mukundan (G.  Arun)  as  go-
between,  Raghavachary opposes the match tooth and nail. So  does
Varadarajan.

After  attempts to fix up matches elsewhere for the girl  by  her
father fizzle out, the two antagonists finally meet. And sundered
ties are mended and harmony is restored in the family.

The  play owed its vitality to the excellent acting by  the  lead
artistes.  Sundar was matched in word and gesture by Chandru  and
together they kept the two decade enmity at full steam.  Srimathi
as  the  one who feels unhappy and frustrated  by  the  obstinate
attitude of husband and father, put in a convincing  performance,
her  face  reflecting  her anxiety well.  Her  nine-yard  costume
wrapped around her Egyptian mummy-like struck the only artificial
note  in the drama. Indu, the obedient daughter and Arun  as  her
rational  elder brother filled the bill. Akshay Kumar,  the  duty
conscious, affectionate grandson is the same in every play -  not
for  him  the  nuances of a character  or  slight  variations  in
portrayal.  Ramji who played the portly officer who does his  bit
in aiding the reconciliation, was adequate.

A  delightful portrayal was put in by V. Ramani as  Rangudu,  the
little-educated next door youth who makes it big in the political
scene.  His astute questions (on economic liberalisation,  hawala
deals  and benami) and answers were pertinent statements  on  the
contemporary  scene,  and  also  lightened  the  atmosphere.  The
success of the characterisation was largely due to the casual and
natural delivery of the lines by Ramani who made the absurd sound
plausible.

The  play  sagged in the middle with the `I hate him'  and  `Mala
must marry Madhu' incantation becoming tiresome; a little editing
would help.

The  manner in which the foes make up in the end, each  eager  to
apologise to the other and take on the blame was true to life.
Sadly,  for  a  good effort there were hardly 25  people  in  the
Mylapore  Fine Arts Club auditorium where Kala Nilayam  presented
the drama under the auspices of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.

World record break by Russell: Causier pips Gilchrist at the post

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. a

By G. Viswanath

MUMBAI, Sept. 26.

Fifty-eight seconds ...59... seconds and bang. The finishing  and
triumphant  stroke  was rammed in by David Causier  in  the  last
second. It was sudden death for 1994 World professional champion,
England's Peter Gilchrist. It was akin to a last ball finish in a
cricket match.

The  cue  ball  (white) was close at hand  and  the  object  ball
(yellow) perched at the mouth of the top right hand pocket begged
to be sunk in. But the clock could have beaten the young Causier.
The  18-year-old literally counted the closing seconds  with  his
eyes  on the neon clock lights ticking away as fast as his  heart
beat.

"The white (Causier's cue ball) stopped at 1 hr 58 seconds and I
hit  it," said Causier who, after playing the finishing  stroke,
marched towards Gilchrist in a jiffy with an extended right hand.
Gilchrist  could not believe he had lost the  quarterfinals,  but
the  cruel reality was that he was beaten by a quirk of  fate  in
the Gold Flake World professional billiards championship here  on
Thursday.

Sethi to meet Shandilya

Top-notcher Mike Russell embellished his comfortable 2391-821 win
over  Devendra  Joshi with a world record break of  753  compiled
under  the  baulkline rule. Russell will take on Causier  in  the
semifinal on Friday. Three-time champion Geet Sethi shrugged  off
his first session diffidence to get past Chris Shutt in the  last
of  the  quarterfinals.  Sethi  plays  Shandilya  in  the  second
semifinal.

The man to mark is Russell who was the first cueist to break  the
500-barrier in the championship. He smashed a 676 against  Mukesh
Rehani  in  the first round. Russell's skill was evident  in  the
first  session  when he carved out three century  breaks  in  the
first  session, including the 291 on his 27th visit.  He  started
the second with a 148 and then firmly placed himself on top table
to amass 753 in less than three quarters of an hour. The previous
best was his 713 against Sethi in the British Open. It was a one-
sided affair all the way with Joshi making two century breaks  of
133 and 120.

Sethi,  playing on the disputed table with a coarse  cloth,  came
into  his  own in the second session. Down by 39  points  at  the
interval,  Sethi carved out two big breaks of 183 and 190 to  eke
out a win by 331 points.

Last  year in the qualifier at Leeds, Causier was beaten  by  the
clock and Gilchrist scraped through by four points. A year  later
the story was reversed in a classic quarterfinal match watched by
a capacity crowd.

In  another quarterfinal, Ashok Shandilya, trailing  behind  Alok
Kumar by 251 points after the first two-hour session, turned  the
heat on his opponent in the second session to win 1402-1178.
The  match between Causier and Gilchrist on Thursday never  threw
the  prospect of a humdinger. Causier, playing with a  free  mind
and  with  a  fixity of purpose, began with  a  197.  Three  more
century  breaks of 115, 164 and 109 put him ahead at 766-369  and
it  seemed Causier was determined to deal the knock-out punch  to
Gilchrist. But the 1995 world champion showed splendid resilience
with a masterly 244.

Gilchrist  was far from his best in the first 30 minutes  of  the
second  session,  but moved into top gear from  his  10th  visit.
Causier slammed a 193 and collected two more breaks of 86 and  92
to  lead by 269 points. Gilchrist hit back with a 210 to  whittle
down  the  lead and the match was really opening up.  There  were
exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds left when Gilchrist came for his
last  visit and all he needed was 104 points. While Causier  kept
chewing away at his fingernails, Gilchrist moved on to top table.
Gilchrist  was focussed and he measured every shot. Referee  Ajay
Rastogi's baulkline warning at 80 reminded Gilchrist that he  had
after  all an encumbrance to meet before playing a shot  at  100.
His  hand ball crossed the baulkline on effecting a red  pot  and
the  immediate target was 104 which he met in seconds. The  crowd
applauded and Gilchrist thought he had already gone past 104.  He
looked  at the clock and wasted a few seconds. At exactly 1  hour
55  seconds he bent low to play a thin in-off on the object  ball
(white) with the red on spot. He missed contact.

Three  seconds left and Causier got the godsend  opportunity  for
survival in the championship. He rammed his cue in a split second
to sink the yellow. He got the crucial two points which made  all
the  difference  and helped him progress to the  semifinals.  The
verdict  was clear. "The beep went off after Causier struck  the
ball.  We saw it on the replay on the television monitor,"  said
an official. "I don't want to play another match like this...  I
feel  sorry for Peter, " trailed off Causier making the sign  of
the cross.

Alok  Kumar,  the  surprise packet of the  championship,  was  in
control in the first two-hour session. "I was hitting the  wrong
sides - the in-offs and canons - in the first session. I did  not
get  my rhythm. But in the second everything went right, "  said
Shandilya after his win. Shandilya recovered with breaks of  169,
76,  54, 96 and 85. But it was a 198 on his 12th visit which  put
him ahead of Alok Kumar for the first time in the match. And a 94
proved  to be the clincher. Alok Kumar made a 127 in  the  second
session, but nerves played on him in the last 30 minutes.
The  results: David Causier (Eng) 1432 (197, 115, 164, 109,  193)
bt  Peter  Gilchrist  (Eng)  1430 (110,  244,  210,  104);  Ashok
Shandilya  (Ind)  1402 (120, 169, 198) bt Alok Kumar  (Ind)  1178
(104, 102, 127); Geet Sethi (Ind) 1496 (126, 111, 183, 125,  190)
bt  Chris  Shutt 1165 (102, 204); Mike Russell (Eng)  2391  (117,
182, 291, 148, 753, 132) bt Devendra Joshi (Ind) 821 (133, 120).
Final to be telecast live

Doordarshan will telecast live the final slated for Saturday  at.
The telecast begins at 2-20 p.m. on the National network (DD  1),
according to a Doordarshan press release on Thursday.

Sleek and modern

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 29, Col. d

You may be a writer, a designer, an architect or an engineer. You
may  also  have a table to work on. But the moment  you  want  to
work,  you conveniently shift all your accessories to the  dining
table  where  spreading  everything  from  paper  and  pencil  to
reference items is easy. Lack of space prevents you from buying a
table as big as a dining table for your study. So the only option
available  is  a change in the work area,  and  unfortunately  it
happens quite too often.

It  is  for  such professionals that Nirja  Lath  of  Jaipur  has
designed  a special kind of utilitarian and space saving  writing
table. The table has all the small utility spaces and drawers  to
keep books, writing things, pins, papers, etc. The long table top
fixed  temporarily  to  the tall structure  can  be  pulled  down
whenever one needs large work area, and once the table comes down
one has plenty of space to spread sheets of paper, draw, write or
do whatever one wants to.

Many  in  Madras might have seen the space  saving  furniture  of
Nirja Lath at the Central Cottage Industries Emporium in  Madras.
Her  designs  are unconventional and very modern.  Naturally  her
target  customers are the modern day urban Indians whose life  is
extremely  fast  paced, who live in small houses but  would  like
keep  them  elegant,  neat and orderly.  None  of  the  furniture
designed  by her has any frills, ornamentation or  grandeur,  but
look dignified, in harmony with the present day world. There is a
quiet  smoothness in their lines, a rhythmic and fluent  flow  in
their curves and a clarity in their finish.

You might be involved in your work when your baby is crawling all
over the room and trying to overturn whatever she can cling onto.
At  least for a while, you can keep her amused with some toys  in
the chair designed by Nirja. There is a box like structure  which
can accommodate the chair inside in case of such emergencies. And
as  the child grows up, this structure can be turned sideways  so
that  it  becomes  the little one's eating  table,  or  even  her
drawing  and  studying  table. Of course  the  chair  which  once
trapped her can be hers to sit in front of the table. This is one
of the most innovative and attractive designs in the show.
A stylisitically created cot which is just a few inches high from
the  floor  looked  extremely restrained in its  lines,  and  can
provide  grace  to  a child's room. The  child  can  roll  around
without  the fear of getting hurt on falling down from  the  cot.
The back rest of the cot has adequate space where the mother  can
store  bed  sheets,  pillow covers,  etc.,  without  wasting  the
precious space inside an almirah.

The piece-de-resistance was the dressing table cum clothes  stand
cum  cupboard.  It  is said to be fastest moving  item  on  show.
Another  item which looks very simple and plain is a divan  whose
head  rest can be raised when you want to rest and enjoy a  movie
on the television, and later on it can be lowered to function  as
a cot also. A useful item for avid television watchers who prefer
the lying down position to the sitting position!

"We  haven't provided any fine work which can attract  dust,  so
cleaning  or dusting the furniture is not a big problem  for  the
urban  working  woman. Even though there is a  great  demand  for
ornamental  furniture these days, we saw a lot of interest  among
people  in  the  kind  of space  saving  furniture  that  we  are
offering," one of the organisers said.

An  exhibition of these stylish designer furniture  organised  by
Akar Prakar of Jaipur was on show at the Vimonisha Art gallery.

Lanka scores a convincing win

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. e

By S. R. Suryanarayan

DOHA, Sept. 26.

Sri  Lanka ended its campaign with a 3-0 win over Philippines  in
the  FIFA World Cup Asian Zone group 10 qualifying tournament  at
the Khalifa Stadium here tonight.

Roshan  Perera (two) and Chaminda Steinwell were the scorers  for
the Lankans who led 1-0 at the half-way stage.

The  Filipinos  also finished their engagement with  their  third
defeat.  The  new  comers  to the  World  Cup  qualifying  phase,
Filipinos had a nightmarish experience, conceding as many as  ten
goals in their three matches and not having scored any.
Tonight  the  team  had a chance or two  to  score,  but  clearly
finesse was missing when most needed.

Sri  Lanka now awaits India's match tomorrow to know  whether  it
will be placed second or third finally in the league table.  With
a win and a draw to its credit, the team has four points.
This  has  been  a tournament devoid  of  public  interest.  Even
matches involving Qatar did not attract fans. So today it was not
a surprise to see a near empty stadium for what essentially was a
match  of only academic interest.  Both the teams are out of  the
race.

The  interest if anything was only is seeing whether  Philippines
would be able to gain its first point or whether Sri Lanka  would
be  able  to pump in many goals, something that could  stand  the
island  nation in good stead in case there is a tie for a  second
place with India.

Expectedly,  the  Sri  Lankan attack looked  lot  more  incisive,
something  that was to energise the handful of Lankan  supporters
who were quick to begin their cheering efforts.

Roshan  Perera and Antony  Silva had Chaminda Stenwell  today  to
add  sharpness  to the Lankan offensive. The  Filipinos  held  on
precariously  with  goalkeeper  Edmundo looking  totally  out  of
sorts. He nearly messed up a straight forward collection of a try
by  Silva and conceded a flag kick. Silva took the kick from  far
side and Chaminda rifled his header perfectly to beat the crowded
defence for the Lankan breakthrough.

It  must be said that the Filipinos were not mere  spectators  in
this match. There were attempts to make combined moves,  inspired
by  Eduardo  from the middle. As usual Viliran and  Lobaton  shot
ahead showing good speed to cause concern in the Lankan  defence.
Viliran  once did essay a crisp waist-high shot, but straight  to
goalkeeper Lalith Weerasinghe.

But  what  almost undid the Lankan joy was the run by  the  rival
captain  Vincente in a flash counter attack. The  Lankan  defence
had  advanced  too far to check him. Seeing  the  danger,  Lalith
rushed out of the box to challenge Vincente. He succeeded even if
in  the process he conceded a free kick and also earned a  yellow
card for touching the ball outside the penalty area.

It was a lucky escape for Sri Lanka, nonetheless.

Play  became lot more pedestrian after the change of ends.  This,
despite the Filipinos success now in working a few positive moves
engineered by Vincente and Edurardo.

This  was  the  first occasion when the Filipinos  were  able  to
exhibit  a  bit  of their ball skills. But  the  enthusiasm  thus
worked  up  finally gave way to trouble at its own  end.  A  long
clearance  from  Dudley Steinwall saw Roshin rushing  ahead  with
none  really to challege him. A quick trapping and placement  saw
Roshan getting the second goal.

Another  phase of dullness followed before Sri Lanka  earned  the
gift of a spot kick when Talavera used his hands to stop a  Silva
try.  Roshan converted to help Sri Lanka record its best  win  in
this tournament.

It  was  yet  another day of  poor  refereeing.  The  Kazhakistan
official, Ordabaev, allowed several fouls to go unnoticed.

Unusual combinations

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 30, Col. d

Marien Mathew visits a restaurant where one can enjoy the food of
his choice  watching his favourite star in action.

Visualise  this.  It  is  the year  2000.  After  long  extensive
research,  scientists  have made a pathbreaking  discovery.  They
have  identified the genes that make Tamilians so susceptible  to
films.  Yes,  it  has  to be in the  genes.  There  is  no  other
explanation  for the incomparable effect the celluloid magic  has
on us.

Elsewhere  in  the  world  when  media  experts  talk  about  the
potential  of the visual medium we already have a list  of  Chief
Ministers to prove the point. Here in Tamil Nadu the stars,  ones
on the silver screen not the astral variety, have more  influence
on ordinary, mortal beings.

So how about celebrating it? Let us succumb to the spell of those
lavishly  mounted  glittering sets, where the  hero  and  heroine
prance  about  singing  songs,  a  practice  continued  from  the
pioneering days of S. S. Vassan and A. V. Meyyappa Chettiar.  The
Taramani  Talkies  is  all  about this.  The  restaurant  in  the
premises  of MGR film City takes care of your  entertainment  and
food.

The  ambience is unmistakable. You have to walk past  the  ticket
counter  or  reception to the multi-cuisine restaurant.  The  big
screen  showing  the  hero and the heroine  gyrating  to  a  song
dominated  the  room. Isn't this bliss, watching  your  favourite
actor/actress and enjoying the food of your choice. The  Taramani
Talkies  offers Indian and Chinese food, while the Baalcony,  the
rooftop section has Chettinad cuisine alone.

The  Baalcony,  opened a few months ago, doesn't have  any  filmi
frills.  The  only  embellishment is the sky, the  moon  and  the
stars,  that  is  if  it is a clear night.  The  brief  menu  was
predominantly non-vegetarian.

Though  two  soups  are  mentioned in the  menu,  both  were  not
available. For the maincourse, there were Kallu Dosa, Idli, Appam
and  Idiyappam,  very much the homefare. The  Idiyappams  (string
hoppers)  were  as soft too as the homemade ones. One  is  a  bit
apprehensive  about  ordering idiyappams at restaurants  as  more
often than not, they come dry. Then no amount of soaking in gravy
make their journey down the throat easy.

What  makes Chettinad cuisine so interesting is its not so  usual
combinations.  Idli and dosa, which make the very  foundation  of
South Indian vegetarian food, acquire non-vegetarian flavour also
here. So besides Sambar and Chutney, we have Mutton Kola  Urundai
Kozhambu  or Chettinad Kozhi or Meen Varuval as side dishes.  The
result  is,  if the crisp, thin light brown dosa,  hot  from  the
tava,  is  irresistible with sambar, it becomes a  knockout  when
touched  up  with  meaty/fish flavour. The  Baalcony  has  Mutton
Kheema Dosa and Prawn Dosa to substantiate the point.

Chettinad  Cuisine  comes  from the royal  kitchens  of  merchant
princes,  the  Chettiars.  The key word here  is  royal,  for  it
explains the characteristic richness of this culinary style.  The
wedding feasts of the Nagarathar Community are almost  legendary.
On  these occasions which run into days, the guests are feted  by
exemplary food and excellent music and dance.

Aattukal Paya, a rather mild mutton curry with coconut milk, went
well  with  the  idiyappams. Varutha Kozhi also  was  nice.  What
struck one most was the meagre inclusions of vegetarian dishes on
the  menu. There was only one semi-fried mixed  vegetables  dish,
vegetable  Chettinad  which  had  at  least  something   remotely
Chettinad about it. The other vegetarian items listed on the menu
were  Mulagutawny  Soup,  which  is of  British  Raj  origin  and
vegetable Kuruma.

But  at  the end of the meal, when you get a bill  of  less  than
three   hundred  bucks  for  a  couple  who  is  bothered   about
authenticity and lack of choice? And the food is quite nice too!

Specialist openers, need of the hour

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. d

By R. Mohan

TORONTO, Sept. 26.

Life's  journey from celebrated years as the well feted whiz  kid
to  middle  age can be very long. It is, perhaps,  the  curse  of
Sachin  Tendulkar  that  the experience of life,  like  his  lost
childhood, should be so compressed.

In  terms  of  cricket, he has already attained  middle  age.  If
anyone wishes to pick an argument about that, it is quite  likely
he  may not have seen the stony expression on the skipper's  face
when  he  went up to receive the loser's cheque in  the  deciding
game of the Sahara Cup on Monday.

"It was disappointing," he said in a kind of under statement at
the press conference. "We were very confident about chasing  214
but   we  could  not,"  he  said.  A  dead  giveaway  that   the
vicissitudes  of the captaincy are catching up with him  even  as
expectations turn into disappointments so quickly.

The captaincy, much like the rose, comes with the thorns. But  he
hardly  needs to blame himself so much because had the toss  gone
the  other way it was likely that the match and the Cup may  have
gone the other way, too.

The toss matters a lot on wearing pitches because chasing on them
is never going to be fun. His predecessor learnt a bitter  lesson
at  the Eden Gardens and Sachin accepted that the most  important
thing  he  learnt from the Sahara Cup is chasing is  never  easy.
Leaving  aside  for the moment the matter of chasing  or  setting
targets, let us examine where India really went wrong.

Notwithstanding the desire to be tactically flexible, the team is
erring  in  believing  the batting order  is  everything.  Sachin
himself  may  have brought about a seminal event in  opening  the
innings at the Eden Park in Auckland two years ago. But he should
know by now that changes in the batting order form only a part of
tactical innovativeness.

Results should be more even irrespective of the batting order  or
the availability or absence of leading batsmen through injury  or
disciplinary action as in the famous case of Navjot Sidhu.
A  32-16-2 (win-loss-no result) head-to-head record in favour  of
Pakistan  in  one-day  Internationals  exists  despite  all   the
tinkering  with the batting order that captains and their  think-
tanks have done over the years.

The  problem  right  now for India is the absence  of  a  regular
opening  partner for Sachin Tendulkar. It is another matter  that
it should not be assumed that Sachin should always be the  opener
in  the  limited-overs game. Such a  supposition  also  militates
against tactical flexibility.

This may be solved when Sidhu can return to the side in time  for
the  triangular  series  in the middle of  next  month.  But  the
selectors,  the  captain and whoever constitutes  his  think-tank
then should decide straightaway that the need for a specialist to
do this job is very urgent.

It is possible to compromise on the opening slot in home  cricket
where the fastest bowlers, be they white, black or brown, are  so
defeated by the conditions that they can be rendered pathetically
ineffectual.  But  the moment the Indian team  steps  abroad  and
comes across unfamiliar pitches, any tactical change of the order
can get horribly undone.

For  instance, Mongia is never likely to succeed  against  clever
fast bowlers like Wasim Akram. And Jadeja is unlikely to ever fit
the  role  of an opener again even if he succeeds at the  job  on
flat pitches as he has in Asia.

There  is one simple rule when it comes to opening batsmen.  `And
that  is - `Find specialists'. Don't ever compromise  unless  the
opener is a quality player of the calibre of Sachin Tendulkar who
can cope with the technical demands of playing the new ball  even
when  it comes to adapting oneself to the aggressive way  of  the
one-day game.

What is the point in carrying a Vikram Rathore in the squad if he
is  not  to  be used even in the one-day game.  Whatever  be  his
technical weaknesses, he can still cope with the requirements  of
the  one-day  game. Use him or Sidhu, not Jadeja, or  Mongia,  or
even Saurav Ganguly even if he is good enough a player of the new
ball to be considered for the job.

The  easy solution to team balance that Manoj Prabhakar  used  to
offer  as opener spoiled the Indian team thoroughly. The  era  of
the  all  rounders  is  well  behind us  now.  There  is  no  use
pretending that every Tom, Dick and Harry is an all rounder until
the  era of the true all-rounder comes again. The solution  would
then lie in giving a run to the specialists like Sidhu and  leave
it  to  them to work out how active they should be in  the  early
overs.

Krish  Srikkanth was a natural at the job of striker. The  nation
is  not going to find too many like him. Pinch hitters at one  or
two drop may fare well enough. But not too many converted openers
can  shine all the time as the specialists like Gordon  Greenidge
and Desmond Haynes did. We do not have to seek far to see why the
West Indians were so great as a one-day team in the days of their
absolute dominance. They always used specialist openers. They did
not believe in sending some hit-and-giggle batsmen in first.
Bring on Sidhu or give Rathore a fair run. But do not  compromise
on  the  opening  slot even in home  cricket  merely  because  it
becomes  convenient  to do so. The number of  times  Kapil  Dev's
promotion in the order failed is reason enough to suggest not all
are equipped to come out and bat first.

It  would  even  make sense to send in  a  quality  batsman  like
Azharuddin  to  open  the innings. But it  would  be  foolish  to
persist with the likes of Jadeja and Mongia.

Mrunalini earns IWM norm

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. c

By Arvind Aaron

YEREVAN, Sept. 26.

India's  Mrunalini  Kunte  made her  maiden  International  Woman
Master norm with a quick draw against WGM E. Zayac of Belarus  in
the tenth round of the 32nd Chess Olympiad here at the Sports and
Concert  Complex here today. The Indian women drew  1.5-1.5  with
Belarus.

Mrunalini Kunte, born on December 23, 1973 near Bombay, is a post
graduate  in  Commerce from Pune. She is  the  reigning  national
women's  champion  and should be able to get her other  norms  in
such strong opposition. Mrunalini's real strength in chess is her
ability to draw games against tougher opponents.

Mrunalini  said, "I am happy," as she was filling the form  for
norm  application  this  evening. She spent  the  last  48  hours
calculating  rather  than preparing for the match.  The  off  day
tomorrow would be the time to celebrate.

For  the Indian women IWM Saritha Reddy did the scoring,  beating
A.  Sorokina  in  43 moves with  the  white  pieces.  Bhagyashree
Thipsay  was beaten by untitled T.Zagorskaya in a  Dutch  defence
game.  Bhagyashree lost a pawn with the black pieces and  lost  a
couple more to resign in 44 moves.

India: Madras Stock Exchange online trading inaugurated

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 19, Col. a

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

The  screen-based  trading  on  the  Madras  Stock  Exchange  was
formally inaugurated by Mr. Suresh Krishna, Chairman and Managing
Director, Sundram Fasteners.

Speaking  on the occasion Mr. Suresh Krishna said this  marked  a
new  chapter  for  MSE which had a good carrier in  the  last  60
years.  He wanted the MSE to enter into new areas  of  operations
such as derivative trading.

The  first deal on online trading was put through by selling  100
shares of Sundram Fasteners by Mr. Suresh Krishna at Rs. 700  and
Mr. Prem Sundara Iyengar, President of the MSE was the buyer.
Mr.  Suresh Krishna left a word of caution that only quality  and
prompt delivery schedule would pave the way to success. He  cited
the  examples of multinationals like General Motors and  Ford  in
maintaining quality.

He  said  the  same  accepted business  norms  applied  to  stock
exchanges  and brokers also. He said "we cannot be operating  on
the  same  way  that  we  were  doing  and  have  to  adopt   new
technologies.  It  is  very important  to  build  confidence  and
quality  and without quality and trust stock exchanges  will  not
survive."  He  hoped  the MSE would live up to  its  ability  to
satisfy  the  most discerning customers and Mantrra  would  offer
efficient service to the investors.

Mr. S. Sadagopan, Chief General Manager, Madras Telephones,  said
that  they would be able to complete the job of  providing  lease
lines  in a short time and said the  international  communication
traffic  to  Madras was growing at a fast pace. He was  happy  to
note  that the trading system through leased lines network  would
be  one  of  the largest of such networks  for  mission  critical
applications in the Asia Pacific region.

Earlier, Mr. Prem Sundara Iyengar, President of the MSE said  the
screen-based  trading would be fully operational from  October  7
and appreciated the efforts taken by the members of the  Exchange
and  the  software  professionals involved in the  work  and  the
Madras Telephones in providing the lease lines.

Mr.  Chandra Balaraman, Chairman and Managing Director of  Indigo
Technologies,  which executed the project for  Tandem  Computers,
said  the  system  was very  reliable  with  parallel  processing
facilities.   He   said  TESA   (Tandem   Electronic   Securities
Architecture),  the software, being in use in  several  countries
had been customised by Indigo Technologies for MSE. He added  the
system  based on wide area network using leased lines  was  user-
friendly and cost effective.

Mr. Frank Dorrian, Regional Director of Tandem Computers for Asia
said it was a major step forward in automation of equity  markets
in India.

India-Corporate Results: MAC Industries

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

MAC  Industries  has  successfully  implemented  the  scheme  for
absorbing MAC Property Development and MAC Civil Engineers  after
getting  the  approval  of the shareholders and  the  High  Court
effective  from April 1, 1995. The working results  for  1995-96,
even  though they include the turnover of the merging  companies,
were  not  satisfactory because of the poor contribution  by  the
aquaculture  division.  The impact of virus disease in  both  the
farm  areas  in Tamil Nadu was so severe that  the  turnover  has
declined  to Rs. 127.41 crores from Rs. 158.11 crores  even  with
the contribution of Rs. 29.78 crores by the two merged  companies
referred to above.

The  gross profit before depreciation and interest  charges  also
dropped  abruptly  to  Rs. 930.96 lakhs from  Rs.  17.61  crores.
Interest  charges  were  lower at Rs. 554.22  lakhs  (Rs.  614.79
lakhs). The sum set aside for depreciation has been raised to Rs.
175.23  lakhs (Rs. 133.34 lakhs). The liability for  taxation  is
lower at Rs. 30 lakhs (Rs. 56 lakhs). The distributable profit is
only Rs. 171.51 lakhs against Rs. 956.27 lakhs.

The directors however have decided to maintain the dividend at 25
per cent, taxable. The prospects for the current year are  viewed
with  optimism. It was possible to maintain the dividend  because
of a larger amount brought in from the previous year. The  amount
required  is  Rs. 370.69 lakhs (Rs. 283.84 lakhs) as  the  equity
shares  issued in 1994-95 are eligible for a  full  distribution.
The  transfer  to  general reserve is Rs.  1  crores  (same)  and
debenture redemption reserve Rs. 165.67 lakhs (Rs. 53 lakhs). The
surplus  carried forward is Rs. 437.73 lakhs against  Rs.  969.73
lakhs brought in which includes Rs. 32.19 lakhs being net surplus
of amalgamated companies.

The paid up equity capital has increased to Rs. 14.82 crores from
Rs.  14.44 crores as a result of the merger while  reserves  were
lower  at Rs. 45.89 crores against Rs. 47.95 crores as the  outgo
in respect of dividend is more than available profits.

The  palm  plantation in Andhra Pradesh  is  making  satisfactory
progress  and an area of 1,025 hectares has been cultivated.  The
palm oil crushing mill has also commenced trial production.

India-Corporate Results: Shalimar Paints

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

Shalimar Paints has registered a net profit of Rs. 2.09 crores on
a  turnover of Rs. 120.02 crores in the 12 months ended June  30,
1996  against Rs. 1.03 crores and Rs. 107.79 crores  respectively
in 1994-95.

The  gross profit, before depreciation and interest charges,  has
risen to Rs. 11.43 crores from Rs. 10.89 crores. Interest charges
claimed  Rs. 7.35 crores (Rs. 7.29 crores). The amount set  aside
for  depreciation is Rs. 1.99 crores (Rs. 1.09 crores). In  1994-
95, an amount of Rs. 1.48 crores has been provided as bad debts.
The company has projected a net profit of Rs. 5.29 crores in  the
letter of offer when it issued partly convertible debentures on a
right basis. As the powder coating project has been deferred  and
there  was  also an increase in input costs, it could  achieve  a
lower  net  profit  of Rs. 2.09 crores. It  is  stated  that  the
company  has not availed itself of the term loan intended  to  be
raised for the powder coating plant.

India-Corporate Results: BPL Refrigeration

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

BPL  Refrigeration has been increasing its market share with  the
introduction  of  new  types  of  frost-free  refrigerators   and
increasing production. But for the fire accident in the  existing
factory at Bangalore the working results for the year ended March
31, 1996 would have made even better showing. As there is a  loss
of output for one week due to the accident and also a  slackening
in  growth  momentum  subsequently, it is  anticipated  that  the
progress in 1996-97 will be more impressive. New models also will
be  marketed  and  arrangements  are  being  made  for   complete
designing with engineers getting the requisite training from  the
Japanese collaborators, Sanyo.

Sales  have risen by 63.1 per cent to Rs. 215.96 crores from  Rs.
132.37  crores  and  the gross  profit  before  depreciation  and
interest  charges by 59.2 per cent to Rs. 28.68 crores  from  Rs.
18.02  crores  in 1994-95. Interest charges have spurted  to  Rs.
14.07   crores  (Rs.  6.80  crores).  The  sum  set   aside   for
depreciation  is  Rs. 450.69 lakhs (Rs. 314.89 lakhs).  There  is
again no liability for taxation. The residual profit has risen in
a less pronounced manner (25.1 per cent) to Rs. 10.11 crores from
Rs. 8.08 crores mainly due to heavier burden of interest charges.
The  dividend  has  been  maintained at  20  per  cent,  taxable,
absorbing Rs. 544.44 lakhs (Rs. 468.74 lakhs). The larger  amount
is  due  to  the equity shares allotted to  the  promoters  at  a
premium of Rs. 38.44 per share being eligible for a proportionate
distribution.  The  transfer to general reserve is  Rs.  1  crore
(same)  and debenture redemption reserve Rs. 2.25 crores  (same).
The  surplus  carried  forward is Rs. 378.16  lakhs  against  Rs.
236.38 lakhs brought in.

The  paid up capital has increased to Rs. 29.64 crores  from  Rs.
24.94  crores  as  a result of the allotment of  94  lakh  equity
shares  of Rs. 10 each at the above mentioned premium. These  are
paid  up  to the extent of 75 per cent. Reserves  amount  to  Rs.
87.52  crores after giving effect to the latest  allocations  and
taking  credit  also for the premium on  the  preferential  issue
against Rs. 64.78 crores.

a  larger turnover and net profit despite uncertain and  volatile
money market and tight liquidity situation. The company's focuses
on  consumer  finance  through  its  niche  product  Medipic  and
marketing  of Carpic has paid rich dividends and  this  accounted
for  nearly  70  per cent of its  current  year's  disbursements,
according to a company release.

During the period under reference, the company reported an income
of  Rs.  133.63 crores against Rs. 98.90 crores.  Other  receipts
were  lower  at Rs. 60 lakhs against Rs. 114.60  lakhs.  The  net

India: Procedures for NRI investments simplified

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. d

From Our Staff Correspondent

MUMBAI, Sept. 26.

The Reserve Bank of India has further simplified the policies and
procedures  for NRI investments. The present scheme for  100  per
cent   investment  by  NRIs  in  sick  units  will   be   further
liberalised.

The  RBI  will  give general permission for  interest  free  non-
repatriable  loans from NRI relatives for personal  purposes  and
for business activities. Interest free repatriable loans up to  $
2.5  lakhs with a maturity of seven years will be cleared by  the
RBI  automatically. Other cases will continue to be cleared on  a
case to case basis by the RBI.

NRIs/OCBs will be permitted to establish schools and colleges  on
the  same  terms  and  conditions as  a  resident  individual  or
corporate body.

The  existing  40  per cent scheme will  be  abolished.  In  non-
Annexure-III  industries, investments by NRIs/OCBs up to  51  per
cent in companies other than listed companies will be allowed  on
a repatriation basis.

The  condition  regarding  60 per  cent  turnover  from  eligible
activities  for  investment to be eligible under the old  40  per
cent and the proposed 51 per cent scheme will be waived.
NRI  participation in venture capital activity will be  permitted
on  the same terms and conditions as foreign investment  in  this
area.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and other  housing
finance institutions will be permitted to grant loans to NRIs for
acquisition  or improvement to the existing houses on  terms  and
conditions  as applicable to residents. All information  relating
to NRI or foreign investment will be put on the Internet.

Microbe capable of degrading oil isolated

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 17, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

TIRUCHI, Sept. 26.

A  microbe  existing in nature named pseudomonas which  has  been
found to be capable of degrading oil, has been isolated by Mr. P.
Raghavan a research scholar, working under Prof. M. Vivekanandan,
Head  of  Department  of  Bio-technology,  of  the  Bharathidasan
University, after studies for the past 30 months.

Oil  spilling both on land and sea in recent years, has  been  on
the increase, and is posing challenges to the  environmentalists.
Bioremediation  is  considered  to be the most  useful  and  safe
method to deal with oil pollution of any kind in view of the fact
that  it  was  considered to be  most  eco-friendly.

Genetically  engineered  strains though have  been  developed  to
fight  oil spillage, in view of the potential danger involved  in
using  such  methods,  the governments have banned  it.  In  this
context,  the utilisation of such naturally occurring oil  eating
microbes assumes very great importance.

The microbe Pseudomonas Sp was isolated from the oil-contaminated
site. The potential nature of this strain in utilising crude  oil
as  the sole source of energy was investigated. The  isolate  was
found  to degrade oil at 1 to 3% level with an efficiency of  60-
90%.   The  optimal  conditions  for  biodegradation   like   PH,
temperature, PO4, and salinity requirements were also worked out.
The  degree  of  oil biodegradation depends  on  the  quantum  of
emulsifying agent produced by the strain.

When  there was minimum surface tension, the quantum  of  biomass
and   biosurfactant  production  was  maximal  by  the   isolate.
Immobilised cells produce increased amount of biosurfactant.  The
nature  of  biosurfactant  was  identified  as  rhamnolipid.  The
electro-micrograph  of the oil-degrading strain showed  that  the
cells  growing in high concentration of oil, exhibited  a  larger
periplasmic  space and cell membrane evagiation.

The  antibiogram  of the strain also showed tolerance to  Hg  and
phenol.  The conjugation study of this strain with E. Coli  CSH57
revealed  that  the strain has the ability to transfer  only  the
antibiotic resistance and not the oil-degrading character.  Field
trial test involving the adapted microbial strain at oil spillage
site  will  be  a promising approach  which  is  being  currently
investigated.

India: Adult TV channel jinxed?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 16, Col. e

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The much-publicised adult TV channel, "Plus 21", is turning out
to  be a non-starter and its proposed launch on October  1  looks
extremely  unlikely  even as cable operators  are  besieged  with
enquiries about its contents, timings and how it can be accessed.
The  launch,  already  postponed several times,  may  be  delayed
further  for  a host of reasons,  including  non-availability  of
hardware  and two court cases seeking a ban on the channel  under
obscenity  laws. Sources in the cable industry say even  software
is not ready, and even if the channel takes off in a few weeks it
would  not be able to offer the full range of programming it  has
been promising.

At  least  three film-makers have contested the  channel's  claim
that they are making programmes for it and accused it of misusing
their names. Film Director B. R. Ishaara has denied making even a
single episode of "Kamasutra", which the "Plus-21" channel is
advertising as his creation.

Film actress and Director Neena Gupta too has dissociated herself
from  the  serial and expressed surprise that her name  is  being
used  to promote the channel. According to her, she was asked  to
make the serial but midway she fell out with the channel and  has
nothing  to  do with it now. Another Director, Ajit  Dewani,  has
accused  the  channel  of  illegally  appropriating  his   serial
"Abhinetri."

This  is  India's  first  own  "adult"  TV  channel  and  cable
operators  are  not  quite  sure if  they  can  beam  it  without
violating  the  Cable TV Regulation Act  1994,  which,  prohibits
telecasting any programme that "offends good taste or decency".
The sort of steamy stuff, it has promised, has already provoked a
strong  reaction  with  voluntary  organisations  threatening   a
nationwide agitation.

Council threatens stir

The National Consumer Awareness Council, which represents over 80
voluntary bodies, has gone to court and said it would take to the
streets  if the channel is allowed to go on air.  Besides,  cable
operators   in   some  cities  have  been  cautioned   by   local
"watchdogs"  and  according to the Federation of  Indian  Cable
Operators' associations, which represents 25,000 operators across
the country, its members are very reluctant to take chances.
"We  will not beam the channel unless we have the  equipment  to
trap its signal so that it is restricted to those homes which ask
for  it. Once we have this equipment we would give a code to  the
subscriber  so that he can lock the channel to  prevent  children
watching it", says Ms. Roop Sharma, president of the federation.
Unless  cable operators are able to "isolate" the  channel  and
restrict its use to individuals who have the code, it would be  a
free-to-air channel which once beamed by a cable operator can  be
seen  by  anyone. Major cable distributors such as  Hindujas  and
Siticable are also reluctant to "risk" the ire of those who are
opposed to "invasion" of their privacy.

According to the promotional material distributed by the  channel
it  would  be  on the air for four hours  every  night  (10  p.m.
onwards)  and would feature "adult jokes, sex news,  titillating
music, adult songs, adult comedies and serials such as Kamasutra,
Redlight,  Ek  Aur Silsila, Samjhauta, Brothel and  Bhog  Se  Yog
Tak". It has also claimed that it would "prominently  feature"
advertisements of "adult stuff".

Cable  operators  say  such  advertising  on  an  Indian  channel
violates the advertising code which they are expected to  follow.
They can also be hauled up for telecasting programmes which  have
not been censored as required under the Cinematograph Act.
A  senior executive of the channel has, however, denied  that  it
proposes  to air nudity and pointed out that in any case some  of
the programmes on foreign TV networks beamed to Indian homes  are
not fit for family viewing.

Even  as the channel appears to be in trouble even before it  has
kicked  off,  there  is a sense of anticipation  among  the  more
curious  viewers  whose appetite has been whetted  by  the  media
hype.

Rs. 3.3 crores  during the nine-day Brahmothsavam which concluded
on Monday.

Collections  from the hundi accounted for Rs. 2.53  crores  while

India-TV: Renuke Shahane: Choosy about her roles

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 32, Col. a

Who  is  not  familiar with her warm,  toothy  smile  and  bright
persona on the small screen? Renuka Shahane lights up the  entire
viewing  room  with her vivacious screen presence, be it  in  the
much-appreciated  "Surabi"  (with Siddharth Kak) or  the  much-
watched  "Antakshari" (with Annu Kapoor). Renuka is  now  being
seen more and more in serials too. You just cannot miss her on TV
any  given day of the week. She is "to hand" on one channel  or
another.

"To  think it has all come to me unsought!" notes Renuka, as  I
come face to face with this blithe spirit of the small screen  at
her Shivaji Park home in the Dadar sector of Mumbai. But whatever
is the matter, Renuka is not, right now, her known spirited self?
She  is  out  of sorts because she is nursing  a  rather  painful
abscess.  I  encountered  her a couple  of  weeks  before  Ganesh
Chaturthi.  And  the young lady is, literally, waiting  for  Lord
Ganesa to come and go, so as to be able to get rid of the pain in
which she obviously is.

"I  have  to be careful not in any way to upset my  tight  work-
schedule  in planning to go through the minor  surgery  needed,"
she  points out. "Therefore, this surgery has willy-nilly to  be
on Ganpati immersion day, the day when we busy stars at last  get
24 hours off."

She  had braced herself for the mini-ordeal ahead and is  not  in
the  ideal  frame  of mind to answer my query  about  why  Renuka
Shahane seems to be doing only a handful of serials while others,
who  came after her, look to be much busier. I put the  point  to
her,  none  the less, and Renuka takes it in her  petite  stride,
explaining  why,  if  she  is lagging behind,  she  is  doing  so
studiedly.

"I am not very ambitious by way of quantity, it is purely out of
choice I have restricted myself," says Renuka. "According to my
lights,  "too  much"  is not the yardstick by  which  a  viewer
should  be judging a performer's calibre. I would rather be  seen
in well-defined roles, in a few well-made serials, than be viewed
in  every  other tele-offering, frantically running from  set  to
set.

"It is important for me to be seen "doing" things in a  serial
as a character rather than be merely appearing in it. That is the
reason  I left "Yeh Huyi Na Baat." My character in it  was  not
developing  at  all, it seemed to be getting me nowhere.  On  the
other hand, I have enjoyed doing Kishan Sethi's "Ghutan,"  even
if  all  the  major roles in this serial  are  played  by  mature
artistes  like Raza Murad, Kiran Kumar and Smita Jaykar. Still  I
have a role to play as the motivating daughter of Smita and  Raza
who brings matters to a head."

Renuka Shahane has been appreciated for her "quietly" effective
performance  in  "9  Malabar Hill," the  Siddharth  Sen  Gupta-
directed  serial in which her's is the main role.  Notes  Renuka:
"I've  been very happy with "Imtehaan" and  "Sailaab,"  both
directed  by  Ravi Rai, who is a good script-writer too.  I  felt
particularly  happy with my role in "Imtehaan," it was  shaping
up  really  well and we looked poised for more  exciting  things,
when it was yanked off the screen at the end of the 26th episode.
Did I feel disappointed!"

Now  to the "role" in which she is so omnipresent on the  small
screen!  There  seems  to be a rather mixed  reaction  to  Renuka
Shahane  as Annu Kapoor's bubbly co-host in "Antakshari."  Some
argue  she  hogs  the show; others say she is  too  subdued;  yet
others feel her costuming, her get-up seem all wrong. But  Renuka
is  dismissive  of  the suggestion that either  she  or  Annu  is
domineering.

"You cannot," she reasons, "be dominant in a live musical show
like  "Antakshari"  where it is so much a matter  of  give-and-
take. Our first priority here is to put the participants at ease.
Annu  is very comfortable in Hindi, it is his mother tongue.  And
he  sees to it that at no point does viewer interest in the  show
flag,  at  no stage does any participant get a feeling  of  being
intimidated. The chalking out of the programme is done in a  very
congenial  and  friendly  atmosphere,  an  atmosphere  in   which
director Gajendra Singh, Annu and I, all three, take part in  the
discussion  freely. As for my costuming, it is the choice of  the
sponsors,  I cannot help it if certain viewers feel it  does  not
suit me."

For  Renuka,  everything in her professional  life  has  happened
naturally.  Even  that  Filmfare  award  for  her  Marathi  film,
"Aboli," came to her just like that. "I had no inkling I would
get  it ahead of so many talented and deserving  artistes,"  she
says, having grown up in a part of Mumbai known for its erudition
and achievement.

This  must  explain why Renuka is so choosy about what  she  does
even in a spot medium like TV. But viewers judge her,  instantly,
by  what  they see. From the moment she was picked  up  by  Gulan
Kripalani  to  play  Pankaj  Berry's  wife  in  that   rollicking
breakfast  serial, "P. C. Aur Mousi" (a show in which she  came
in  rewarding contact with Farida Jalal) to now (when  the  whole
viewing world is still toasting her as the charming elder bahu of
Rajshri's Hum Aapke Hain Koun), there is nothing Renuka has  gone
after for it to come to her."I am anxious only to the extent  of
being  conscientious  about  giving my one hundred  per  cent  to
anything  in hand, be it my work or studies. Never have I  sought
the easy way out where it comes to making the effort," she says.
One thing has led to another and Renuka feels happy to have  come
in live touch with some of the more creative talents of the small
screen.

"I  value my work in Vijaya Mehta's "Lifeline,"  says  Renuka.
"During  the  doing of "Surabhi," Siddharth  Kak's  guideline,
that  the  two  of us should not be talking down  to  people  but
chatting to the camera, came as a most timely tip. I have  reason
to  be  grateful  to Annu Kapoor for  his  protectively  friendly
smoothing over of certain awkward moments before the camera while
working  on  "Antakshari." I treasure,  too,  the  enlightening
hours  spent with director Pushkar Singh while doing  that  brief
but significant serial of just six episodes: "Akanksha"  (based
on  the  theme of adoption). Money, for me, is  not  everthing,"
concludes  Renuka by way of justifying her laid-back attitude  to
life and career.

Maybe  it is just the literary milieu in which she has  grown  up
that  enables  Renuka  Shahane to look upon  TV  star  status  as
something  that is not the end of the world. "For me, there  are
other  attractions  in life," says  Renuka,  still  attractively
single. "I like doing theatre, seeing good plays, taking in good
cinema reading, devoting time to literature, even plain relaxing.
All  this  is  invaluable for my well-being.  There  is  so  much
happening, so much to absorb."

A  sound head on slim shoulders - that is Renuka Shahane, the  TV
star with a difference.

India: Situation will be clear in 20 days: Waghela

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 16, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The political situation in Gujarat is expected to become clear in
the  next  20  days, immediately after the  by-elections  in  the
State. This was the view of the Gujarat BJP dissident leader,  Mr
Shankarsinh Waghela, who met the press here today on his way back
to Ahmedabad from Lucknow.

Mr  Waghela was confident that there would be no  difficulty  for
the  Mahagujarat Janata Party led by Mr Dilip Parikh  in  getting
the  support of at least four or five of the 18 MLAs  "virtually
kept prisoner" by the BJP.

"In  any case the Mehta Governments inning's are over. There  is
no  question  of the BJP making Mr. Suresh Mehta  Chief  Minister
again.  From  the very start it was Mr. Keshubhai Patel  who  was
chosen  for that chair, and again, the BJP will try to bring  him
back as Chief Minister," Mr. Waghela said emphatically.
He alleged that `private police' were used inside the Assembly on
that  fateful  September 18 and that  mediapersons  were  `beaten
mercilessly'. He said that many journalists were later threatened
that night and some feared for their lives. "The Deputy  Speaker
was also taken ill because threats were issued to him and in  the
hospital  he  was  given  a heavy  dose  of  sedation  making  it
impossible  for him to chair the next day's  Assembly  session,"
Mr.  Waghela charged, adding that "no one could prevent the  BJP
Government  from forming a government in Gujarat if  they  remain
sure  of their majority. They can go to Raj Bhawan  tomorrow  and
claim that they have the necessary support. Who can stop  them?"
he asked.

He added that on September 18, there were only 87 MLAs present in
the  House after police threw out the Opposition MLAs.  According
to him, only 87 votes were cast in favour of the so-called motion
seeking a vote of confidence.

He admitted that he had gone to Lucknow `to warn' the people  not
to  believe  the BJP and its leadership, and not be taken  in  by
their  promises.  He said that in Lucknow he did meet  `some  BJP
leaders,'  but refused to identify them, saying `they would  lose
their  jobs'.  In  response to questions, he  admitted  that  the
`promises'  made  to him by Mr Atal Behari  Vajpayee  after  last
September's  episode  were  not kept by the  party.  He  implied,
without saying this in so many words, that Mr Vajpayee was unable
to have his say in the party.

India: 14 airports to be developed for global operations

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 15, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

With  the expansion of private airlines in the  domestic  sector,
the  Government has decided to develop 14 airports including  the
12  model  airports,  for limited  international  operations,  in
addition to the major airports.

The  private  airlines  has  made it  necessary  to  provide  for
additional  parking  and  maintenance  facilities.  New  terminal
buildings  to serve the increased number of passengers are  being
commissioned  and  airports  made  consumer  friendly,  with  the
augmentation  of passenger amenities for better baggage  handling
and check-in facilities.

The  model  airports include Lucknow, Jaipur,  Nagpur,  Vadodara,
Kozhikode,   Coimbatore,  Indore,  Hyderabad,  Patna,   Guwahati,
Bhubaneswar,  Imphal, Goa and Ahmedabad. The airports  have  been
identified  by AAI from the economic and tourism point  of  view.
Modernisation  of  air  traffic  services  with  state-of-the-art
communication,  navigation and surveillance system will be  taken
up in a phased manner.

New  airports  are  being constructed  particularly  in  interior
places  such as Tura in Meghalaya and Lengpuri in  Mizoram  under
the State plans, and Kargil and Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir and
Andorth in Lakshadweep funded by the Central Government.
At the Kozhikode airport, a new international terminal block with
all  amenities for handling 400 passengers, was  commissioned  in
June  this year. At Ahmedabad, extension of runway from  9000  to
11,500  feet  has been taken up. At Hassan, an  airport  will  be
developed for the 50-seater aircraft operation over 295 acres for
Rs. 50 crores in the first phase. In the second phase the airport
will  be extended to 9000 feet with Rs. 60 crores more to  enable
Boeing 737 operation.

Dustin Hoffman: Cinema"s diminutive dynamo

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 25, Col. a

Thirty years after he became Hollywood's newest "Graduate",  he
remains  one  of its most skilled practitioners. A  look  at  the
memorable  screen moments of Dustin Hoffman,  honoured  recently,
for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival

"Mrs.  Robinson, do you think we could say a few words  to  each
other first, this time"

"Mrs.   Robinson,  if  you  don't  mind  my  saying   so,   this
conversation is becoming a little strange".

"Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me aren't you?"

"Maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson. Would
you like to go to a movie?"

The   increasingly  apprehensive  teenager  realises   that   the
middleaged  woman  (Anne Bancroft), who just happens  to  be  his
girlfriend's  (Katherine Ross) mother, is in fact practising  the
fine  art of seduction on him. Coming as it did, in  1967,  "The
Graduate",  unerringly tapped the mood of the swinging  Sixties,
mirrored  on the soundtrack, in the classic Simon  and  Garfunkel
songs  -  and became a milestone film, earning that  year's  Best
Director   Oscar   for   Mike   Nichols.   Nominated   -   albeit
unsuccessfully  -  was  the  chubby  faced  young  actor,  Dustin
Hoffman,  a diminutive 5 ft 6 ins, but at 31 much older than  the
character  he portrayed. Much imitated (Kamal Hassan  played  the
Hoffman  character in a derivative Tamil film), "The  Graduate"
continued to win new audiences in later decades via TV and video,
as a seminal Sixties product.

The film made Hoffman a star - and his style of studied, cerebral
acting,  a  cult. Over the next three decades,  this  deliberate,
sometimes eccentric practitioner of the now often derided art  of
emoting, has delivered some of cinema's most memorable moments.
At  the Venice Film Festival, earlier this month, Dustin  Hoffman
was  honoured  with  a special "Golden  Lion"  for  his  career
achievement  in  cinema. He quotes his guru  Lee  Straberg,  from
whose  "Method"  school  of acting  so  many  Hollywood  heroes
graduated: "There is no such thing as a juvenile, a villain or a
hero. We are all characters".

After "The Graduate", his very next bash at the big screen  was
a character, as eccentric as they came: the crippled,  aggressive
"Ratso",  who teams up with a gigolo (John Voight) as they  try
to  eke  out  a  living from the seedy  underside  of  New  York.
"Midnight Cowboy", became the first "X" rated film to win  an
Oscar - for its director John Schlesinger.

But  the  awesome histrionic talents in  the  pint-sized  Hoffman
frame  were  on display for the first time in 1970 when  he  aged
from a teenager - to 121 years, playing the only survivor of  the
infamous  Little Big Horn slaughter of American Indians. As  Jack
Crabb,  a boy brought up by the Cheyenne Indians,  Hoffman  plays
"Little Big Man", a witness to almost a century of exploitation
of  America's indigenous population by the whites. Arthur  Penn's
film   was  not  your  customary  hard  riding,   hard   drinking
"Western",  but  possibly the most sensitive portrayal  of  the
"Red" Indian way of life.

The  ultra  violent "Straw Dogs" which featured  Hoffman  (with
Susan  George)  in 1971 as an American research student  and  his
wife,  experiencing  the malevolence of the locals in  a  Cornish
village  in  Britain, was one of director  Sam  Peckinpah's  most
controversial  films.  The British, for one refused to  accept  a
plot where locals let loose a reign of terror including  multiple
rape in a sleepy village. It was never allowed into this country.
But the equally downbeat "Papillon" was. Based on a French best
seller,  the  story  followed the repeated attempts  of  a  penal
colony  inmate  (Steve  McQueen) to escape - aided  by  a  mousy,
myopic buddy (Hoffman). It was a star vehicle - and little  else.
High powered star power was in abundance, once more, when Hoffman
joined  Robert  Redford, in "All the  President's  Men'  (1976),
where  they  play the investigative duo Carl  Bernstein  and  Bob
Woodward,   who  cracked  the  Watergate  conspiracy  for   "The
Washington Post". The film had little to offer the  non-American
viewer who in any case was not so obsessed with this true saga of
President Nixon's downfall.

"My  dear  boy  have you ever tried  acting?"  asked  the  late
Shakespearean  thespian Laurence Olivier, of his co-star  Hoffman
during  the making of the bizarre often very convoluted  thriller
"Marathon  Man". But the old man's jibes apart, the film was  a
poor  showcase for either of them - and a nauseating scene  where
the neo Nazi Olivier does some unscheduled dental work on Hoffman
was only one of many violent moments.

But  acting talent was not a prerequisite for garnering Oscars  -
charisma  and star power could do the job - as Hoffman and  Meryl
Streep  proved  in  1979, playing a separated  husband  and  wife
battling over their kid in "Kramer versus Kramer". This  "four
hanky"  film won Hoffman his first Best Actor Award - and  other
honours  went to the film, to costar Streep, the director  Robert
Benton and the scriptwriters.

Never  one to rest on his laurels, Hoffman went on to take up  an
unusual  challenge, that would have daunted most macho stars:  In
the 1982 comedy "Tootsie" he appears in drag most of the  time,
playing  an  indigent actor who takes up female roles to  make  a
living.  This unlikely critical success was followed by what  the
industry  termed  a  "fifty million  dollar  flop":  "Ishtar"
teamed him with Warren Beatty. The two play a pair of second rate
songsters  writers  who  stumble on a spy  drama  in  the  Sahara
desert. Their constant companion is a blind camel. A wit said  at
the time, the film's audience had to be blind as well - to  enjoy
the film.

The  1988  Hoffman  starrer couldn't have  been  more  different.
"Rain Man" found him playing an autistic man - incoherent  most
of  the  time - who is left $3 million  dollars.  His  avaricious
younger  brother  (Tom Cruise) is only left a vintage car  -  and
hopes  to trick his sick brother out of his inheritance. They  go
on a long journey in the jalopy - and by film's end, the  younger
sibling  has learnt to appreciate the goodness of his  "savant"
brother. In a year when "feel good" films were in short supply,
"Rain  Man"  stormed the Academy Awards -  earning  Oscars  for
Hoffman, the film and the director Barry Levinson among others.
It was a different type of family bonding a year later:  "Family
Business"  was  about a bunch of  unlikely  crooks:  grandfather
(Sean  Connery),  father  (Hoffman) and  son  (Mathew  Broderick)
decide  to pull off a heist. It was a great comic idea -  but  it
barely worked.

The Nineties saw Dustin Hoffman make fleeting appearances on  the
screen.  Spielberg's Peter Pan update, "Hook" cast him  as  the
villainous  title  character  - but there was little  to  do  for
Hoffman  the  actor  in this special  effects  costume  drama.  A
glimpse of what he could do with a good script was provided  last
year  when  he appeared in "Outbreak" as a  conscientious  army
doctor  battling  against top brass  (Donald  Sutherland,  Morgan
Freeman) to control a rampaging viral disease. But encase Hoffman
most  of the time in a protective headgear (and high tech  drama)
and you curb his talents. He needs the pure acting environment to
thrive.  Chances  are his latest vehicle might just  provide  him
with this. "American Buffalo", casts him alongside Dennis Franz
of  "NYPD  Blue"  fame as a pair of crooks who try  to  pull  a
confidence trick on a friend - with disastrous consequences.  The
film  being  made earlier this year, is due to be seen  in  India
later this year.

If  his  appearances on screen are infrequent,  that  is  because
Dustin Hoffman can afford to pick and choose his roles. "I lived
below the official American poverty line till I was 31" he  says
(that  was  the year he appeared in "The Graduate").  Then  the
arithmetic  of success changed and today Hoffman swears by a  new
formula:  "Stardom equals freedom. It is the only equation  that
matters' he says.

As he slides into his sixties, it is an equation that adds up  to
some more cinematic delights to come from Dustin Hoffman.

A zest for life

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 25, Col. e

Khushboo  was  in Bombay last week. For old times'  sake  we  had
lunch  at a suburban restaurant. The restaurant was  too  crowded
for  confrontations  and confessions. But in  between  soups  and
sweet  dishes,  we  managed  to  cover  topics  ranging  over  26
alphabets.

***

Amitabh  Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar and Arvind  Swamy.  I
cannot  think  beyond these performers. Amitabhji,  for  being  a
phenomenon,  Aamir  for his sensitivity towards  his  characters.
Akshay for his stamina and Arvind for his courteous behaviour.
Bombay  - I just love the city. Biscuits - Even if I were  to  be
woken  up  at two in the morning and offered  biscuits,  I  would
finish the packet.

Clothes  -  I  love  them,  specially  cotton  saris  and  salwar
kameezes.  I like dressing up. My family and friends feel I  look
good  in  modern  outfits, but I  prefer  myself  in  traditional
clothes.

Dogs  -  I just love them. The Alsatian bitch I have at  home  is
adorable. We got her when she was a week old. Today she is  four-
and-a-half and my mom's chamchi. I cannot touch mummy when she is
in the room. She is fiercely possessive about her.

Entertainment  -  Films,  theatre, circus,  road  side  tamashas,
anything, but life would be unbearable without entertainment.
Family  and  friends - They have been with me during my  ups  and
downs  - Brinda, Anu, Subbu, Madhoo, Viji - life wouldn't be  the
same, if I lost any one of them.

God - I am god fearing but not a religious fanatic. I respect all
religions and visit various shrines when I feel like.

Holidays - I have never been on a holiday, a planned holiday.  It
is only when my shootings get cancelled at the last minute that I
take a few days off. My folks at home never take my proposal  for
a holiday seriously. I have let them down too often.

India - I am proud to be an Indian, proud of my culture. We  have
so  much variety in food and attire in all our States.  Not  many
countries can promise that.

Jashn  Ali Khan - My three-year-old nephew. He is the love of  my
life.... my absolute jaan. On the day he was born, I insisted  on
holding  him first. And I did. I remember the expression when  he
opened  his  eyes. Right now he is in Indonesia and  I  miss  him
badly.  He gurgles on the phone. I love the way he calls me  Bua.
Sometimes he calls me Khusphus.

Kites  -  I love watching colourful kites in the  sky.  There  is
something romantic about them. Ever since childhood, my  brothers
made  me hold the manja-phirki, while they flew the kites.  After
all these years, the practice has not changed.

Love - I thrive on love and cannot survive without it. I can live
without  oxygen, but not love. London - It is a city I have  only
dreamt of, never visited. Strange that I have travelled all  over
Europe, except London.

Mother - We fight so often, but I cannot live without her either.
She  is  very important in my life and she knows  it.  She  takes
advantage  of this at times, supports my brothers  in  arguments,
even when she knows they are in the wrong.

Marriage  -  I  was  miserable  when  I  had  to  break  off  the
relationship I had invested so much into. I can never forget that
day. It was the worst day of my life. I had to learn it the  hard
way that nobody is perfect.

Nagging - I hate being nagged, so I can guess what a torture I am
to others.

Oorvasi - She is Tamil Nadu's most versatile actress and has made
a  name  for herself in all the South  Indian  languages.  Today,
almost  every heroine-oriented script is written with Oorvasi  in
mind. I truly admire her spontaneity.

Perfection - I am not a perfectionist. No matter how hard I  try,
I  can never attain perfection. Something, somewhere always  goes
wrong. May be, It is temperament, but I am hoping I will be  able
to rectify this when I become a housewife.

Quiz  Master Derek O'Brien of "Bournvita Quiz Contest" - He  is
too good! I try and watch the show whenever I can.

Rickshaws - Whenever in Bombay, I love travelling by rickshaws. I
don't get to do it in Madras. I also enjoy the double-decker  bus
rides in Bombay. Down South, we don't have it.

Sundar  -  He  is selfless, generous, mature and  my  whole  life
revolves around him. He is the man responsible for my confidence.
The  motivating  factor to assert myself as a woman. I  love  him
deeply  and cannot think of a future without him. Shabana Azmi  -
is  the woman I admire greatly. If I can acquire even an iota  of
the fame and respect she has, I will consider myself lucky.
Tantrums  -  A common feature with newcomers on  the  sets  these
days.  Youngsters think its is fashionable to be  arrogant.  Real
stars  don't  throw  their weight around. On  the  contrary,  the
bigger the star, the more normal his behaviour.

Ubin Fernandez - My hairdresser and friend. I call her  "aunty"
and  she  has been my guide and companion for 14 years.  She  has
been an integral part of my career. She treats me like her  child
and is fiercely loyal.

Victory  - I hate the word failure. Last year, when I  was  going
through  a low phase, people said it was over for me. The  papers
referred  to me in the past tense. It hurt and I swore to  myself
that I would get back. I did and that is a victory for me.
Work  -  Work is worship. I would be completely lost  without  my
work.  I am addicted to it. I cannot sit idle even when I am  not
well.  When  I  am  not shooting, I  am  busy  cooking,  cleaning
vessels,  floors and cupboards. For someone so active, my  weight
is a mystery.

X'mas  - I look forward to Christmas every year. Ubin aunty  gets
me homemade rose cookies and I just love them.

Youth - I like the feeling of youth. I may talk and behave mature
but at heart I am a teenager.

Zest  - Is what keeps me going... When I want to, I can be  goal-
oriented. I am determined when I am motivated.

India: SPG cover: V.P. Singh reiterates demand

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  former  Prime Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, has  reiterated  his
demand  for immediate withdrawal of the Special Protection  Group
cover  to him and his immediate family members and said that  the
issue  of  withdrawal  of  SPG cover  should  not  be  linked  to
provision of alternative security cover.

Responding  to a letter written by the Prime Minister,  Mr.  H.D.
Deve   Gowda,  urging  him  to  consider  opting  for  "Z   plus"
alternative security cover, Mr. Singh has said that he will  keep
his options open.

"As for the alternative security cover suggested by you I keep my
options open for it will not be possible to accept an alternative
cover if it puts the same burden on the treasury and the poor man
as  the  SPG does at the moment must be costing  the  country  at
least  Rs.  60  crores a year for all the old  and  new  ex-Prime
Ministers,"  Mr.  Singh  has informed the  Prime  Minister  in  a
letter.

Mr.  Singh has said while he and his wife, Mrs. Sita Kumari,  are
signing  the letter, his two sons, Mr. Ajeya Singh and Mr.  Abhai
Singh, are at the moment abroad and will send similar requests on
arrival. "As no SPG cover is given to them abroad, the decks  are
cleared for immediate withdrawal of SPG".

India: End of the road for Narasimha Rao?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. b

From Harish Khare

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

With  legal troubles coming like a torrent, there seems to be  no
political  respite  for  the former Prime  Minister,  Mr.  P.  V.
Narasimha Rao. Having already stepped down from the office of the
president  of  the Congress Party, he will find his  position  as
Leader  of  the  Congress  Parliamentary  Party  untenable  after
today's legal rebuffs - first the Delhi High Court's rejection of
his  plea for an anticipatory bail and later the charge-sheet  in
the St. Kitts forgery case.

That he becomes the first former Prime Minister to have to face a
charge-sheet   is   in  itself  not   without   grave   political
implications.  There was no official Congress reaction;  nor  any
Congress leader wanted to say anything adverse about him. At  the
same time there was no enthusiasm to speak up in his defence.  In
fact,  there  was a sense of sadness among the  Congress  leaders
that  Mr.  Narasimha  Rao should get  badly  embroiled  in  legal
entanglements.

After  Mr.  Rao stepped down as Congress president, much  of  the
anger  and  bitterness  towards him has waned.  But  there  is  a
realisation that he cannot escape paying a price for the  forces,
some  clearly  unwholesome, he helped unleash  in  the  political
system.

Most  Congress  leaders have convinced themselves that it  was  a
deliberate political strategy on the part of Mr. Narasimha Rao to
entangle  rivals like Mr. L. K. Advani, Mr. Arjun Singh  and  Mr.
Tiwari  in  the hawala case. That  case  generated  unprecedented
divisiveness and bitterness in and outside the Congress,  leaving
Mr.  Rao with few friends and little goodwill once he  failed  to
lead the party to victory in the Lok Sabha elections.

If nothing else, there will be pressure on Mr. Rao to follow  the
precedent  set by other political leaders charge-sheeted  in  the
hawala scandal. It would be recalled that Mr. Advani had resigned
his    Lok Sabha seat  in January this year after he was  charge-
sheeted  (along with Mr. Arjun Singh, Mr. Madhavrao Scindia,  Mr.
Balram Jakhar and others). Mr. Advani had said that he would  not
contest  the  Lok Sabha elections unless he was  cleared  of  the
"trumped up charges." Similarly, Mr. Sharad Yadav of the Janata
Dal  was forced to step down as the leader of the Janata  Dal  in
the Lok Sabha.

Subsequently,  the  Congress  itself  denied  nomination  to  the
"charge-sheeted" leaders like Mr. V. C. Shukla, Mr. Jhakar, Mr.
Scindia  and  Mr. Arvind Netam. The principle  invoked  was  that
anyone "charge-sheeted" ought to get himself/herself cleared of
the  legal entanglement before the party would run the risk of  a
political endorsement/association.

The "charge-sheet" principle was invoked by Mr. Narasimha Rao's
supporters  themselves last week after he was issued  summons  in
the  Lakhubhai Pathak case. A statement signed by  four  general-
secretaries (Messrs B. P. Maurya, Janardhana Poojary,  Madhavsinh
Solanki and R. K. Dhavan) had noted:  "the general feeling among
the Congress leaders is that the issuing of summons by itself  is
not a reason for the Congress president to take this drastic step
[of  relinquishing  the  office]. In a number  of  cases  persons
against  whom  charges  have  been  framed  in  the  courts   are
continuing in their posts."

The  charge-sheet has come now. And though at the  last  Congress
Working  Committee, the party leadership had assured him that  he
would not stand alone in his legal battles, that scenario  stands
changed  after the St. Kitts charge-sheet. Unless  Mr.  Narasimha
Rao  demonstrates  an hitherto unsuspected fighting  ability  and
personal  stamina, his political career can be said to have  come
to an abrupt end.

India: Urea scam: CBI may send team to Geneva

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 15, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 25.

The  Central  Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is  giving  finishing
touches  to the requisite documents for pressing the  extradition
of  the  two top officials of the Turkish firm,  Karsan  Limited,
from Switzerland.

A  two-member CBI team had returned from Geneva about a week  ago
and  had taken up the exercise of preparing the documents  to  be
sent to the Swiss authorities.

According  to sources, the CBI may send its team to  Geneva  with
the  documents  seeking  extradition of  Karsan's  Chairman,  Mr.
Tuncay Alankus and its Executive Director, Mr. Cihan Karanci. The
duo  was arrested by the Interpol earlier this month.  They  were
stated to be still under detention in Geneva.

There is no extradition treaty between India and Switzerland  but
the  request  can  be made under  the  Swiss-British  Extradition
Treaty. The request has to reach the Swiss authorities within  30
days of the arrest of the two accused.

The  investigation  into the Rs. 133 crore urea  import  scam  is
likely to pick up and the CBI may succeed in its efforts to trace
the flow of funds from Karsan's account in Pictet Bank, Geneva.
The  Fertilizer  Ministry had refused to accept the  shipment  of
9006  tonnes of urea dispatched by Karsan as the  fertilizer  was
much below international standards. In the deal to supply 2  lakh
tonnes  of  urea to the National Fertilizer  Limited  (NFL),  the
Turkish company took the full advance of $37 million, but  failed
to supply the fertilizer by May as stated in the contract.

Asian tariffs impede growth: World Bank

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 14, Col. d

From Sridhar Krishnaswami

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.

India  continued to reap substantial benefits from the trade  and
investment  liberalisation reforms undertaken after 1991 and  the
South Asian economies that grew by about 5.3 per cent in 1995  is
estimated  to grow around six per cent, according to  the  Annual
Report of the World Bank for 1996. Since 1991, the average export
growth  rate for the region has exceeded 10 per cent compared  to
an average of 5.6 per cent for the years 1981-1990,but the export
of  goods  and non-factor services represented less than  15  per
cent  of domestic output, well below the average  for  developing
countries.  "Although recent reforms have succeeded in  lowering
trade barriers, South Asian tariffs remain far higher than  those
in  other  regions.  As a result, they remain  an  impediment  to
growth because in conjunction with other trade restrictions, they
create distortions and can lead to resource misallocation,"  the
Annual Report observes.

The  regional  perspectives of the Bank for South Asia  reveal  a
mixture of the positive fallouts of the reform process that  have
put  in place as well as in some of the  persisting  difficulties
that  stand in the way of development either as a result  of  the
perceived  lack  of reforms in particular areas or in  other  on-
going  political and civil developments in specific nations.  The
Report,  in  talking about the conditions in Bangladesh  and  Sri
Lanka, makes the point that political difficulties in the case of
Bangladesh  and  in the continuation of the civil strife  in  Sri
lanka have contributed to dampening private sector dynamism  and,
thereby, restraining growth.

Reform process pays off

On  the positive side, the Annual Report takes note of  the  fact
that   regional  cooperation  had  received  a  boost  with   the
ratification  of a trade agreement by members of the  South  Asia
Association of Regional Cooperation, or SAARC. The agreement that
included bilateral concessions brought about cuts in tariff rates
ranging  from  10  to  100  per cent  in  more  than  220  items.
"Although  the trade impact is likely to be small given the  low
share of intra-regional trade, the SAARC countries have indicated
their  intention to initiate negotiations towards establishing  a
free trade area in the near future," the World Bank notes.
The  Bank Assessment has been that the reform process and  active
engagement  in the world economy by the South Asian  nations  are
now paying off in terms of higher foreign investment with private
capitals  accounting  for close to 50 per cent  of  the  resource
flows  to  the  region as opposed to 25 per  cent  in  1990.  The
aggregate  resource flows may have fallen in 1995 due to  decline
in  overall  portfolio  flows following the  devaluation  of  the
Mexican  peso  in December 1994,but they were still  much  higher
than  in 1993. Foreign Direct Investment reached a record U.S.  $
2.8  billions  and  although  India  was  the  largest  recipient
(receiving about U.S. $ 2 billions) other nations also shared  in
the increase.

The  countries of South Asia, the World Bank notes, also saw  the
growth  of the export earnings outpace the increase in debt  with
all  countries  improving the  debt-to-export  and  debt-to-gross
national  product  ratios. The economies of the region  were  the
only  group of developing countries not to have restructured  the
debt in the past decade and having incurred almost no arrears  to
external  debtors. "But maintaining sound economic  fundamentals
and  pushing  ahead with economic reforms are  essential  if  the
region  is to take full advantage of the enormous  potential  for
further  growth  in private capital flows to  the  region,"  the
World Bank has said.

Poor social indicators

The  incidence and depth of poverty may have declined  since  the
1980s, but the number of poor has increased. The recent estimate,
according to the World Bank, is that 43 per cent of the  region's
population  lives on incomes of less than U.S. $ 1 per  day;  and
that  South Asia, which accounts for 22 per cent of  the  world's
population,  accounted  for 40 per cent of the  world's  poor  as
well. Aside from the fact that this underscored the importance of
policies that raised rural incomes, the Bank argues that high and
sustained growth rate that takes place in an environment of sound
economic  management was essential for the reduction of  poverty.
"But growth is not by itself sufficient to reduce poverty. South
Asia's  social indicators are very poor. Average life  expectancy
at birth is sixty years, half the adult population is  illiterate
and  children  under  the  age of  five  experience  the  highest
mortality rate in the world... These regional averages,  however,
mask  considerable  diversity, both across countries as  well  as
within countries. Sri Lanka and some Indian States, for  example,
have  social  indicators  that  are  comparable  with  those   in
countries with a higher income per capita," the Bank says.
The  annual report makes the point that achieving  major  poverty
reduction  is  feasible;  but to attain  more  rapid  growth  and
integration in the world economy in the coming years, nations  in
South  Asia will face tough policy challenges that would  include
addressing  the  deficiencies  in  social  areas,  infrastructure
bottlenecks,  reducing the still excessive trade  and  investment
barriers  and  extending  the scope of  competition  in  domestic
factor  and  product  markets. "The Bank  continues  to  support
policies   that   promote  sustainable  growth,   develop   human
resources, extend the benefits to currently disadvantaged  groups
(such as women), and overcome obstacles to the sustainability  of
growth,  particularly  in the environmental  and  human  resource
areas. The current operational strategy in the region  emphasises
ways   to   achieve  these   objectives   through   participatory
approaches,   decentralisation,  increased  involvement  by   the
private sector and a sharper client focus," the Report adds.
New action plan

On  the role of the private sector, the World Bank has taken  the
position  that  in  South Asia, severe  absorptive  capacity  and
implementation  deficiencies  coupled with  financial  restraints
have resulted in chronic underinvestment in infrastructure  where
the  public sector alone did not have the resources to  meet  the
needs  -  as, for instance, in the lack of available  finance  on
terms  commensurate with the typical long gestation  and  revenue
earning  capacity  of infrastructure projects.  "In  India,  for
example,  the  development of a long term  domestic  debt  market
requires a number of significant policy reforms in the  financial
sector,   particularly  as  regards  regulations  applicable   to
contractual  savings institutions. While such a reform  programme
is being formulated and until its key elements are implemented so
that  a  well-functioning  domestic  long-term  debt  market  can
emerge, domestic financial institutions have to play a major role
in  supporting private investment in infrastructure," the  World
Bank notes.

The Report, at a broader level, has to be seen in the context  of
the  global  changes that are currently taking place and  in  the
backdrop of the recent trends that would include the rapid growth
of  private  investments  and capital  availability  and  in  the
levelling   off  or  even  diminishing   official   developmental
assistance.  For instance, the total private flows to  the  major
emerging market economies totalled some U.S. $ 225 billions while
the official flows amounted to only U.S. $ 14 billions. In  terms
of  region,  the  Asia  Pacific accounted for  some  U.S.  $  123
billions of private financial flows, and U.S. $ 10.4 billions  in
official   flows  from  the  major  financial  agencies.   Senior
officials  of the World Bank take the position that the  flow  of
private investment is not to be taken as some kind of a `threat'.
For one thing the argument has been that private investment flows
are  directed  by  specificity  and  sector  dominated;  and  for
another,  the  point  is  being made that  the  flow  of  private
investment opens different arenas to the World Bank.

One of the critical aspects of this year's annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is in developing a
comprehensive strategy to meet the needs of the heavily  indebted
poor countries. Such a plan of action is said to be on the `brink
of  a  breakthrough', although serious questions  remain  on  the
extent  to which the industrialised world is willing to go  along
with finding additional resources to meet the challenge.
India returns more

PTI reports:

India  returned  to the World Bank $ 723 millions  more  than  it
received  from  the institution in fiscal 1996, ending  June  30,
thanks to repayments and interest on past loans.

The  Annual Report of the Bank shows that in fiscal  1996,  India
had undisbursed commitments of $ 9.43 billions. During the  year,
the  Bank  made  new  commitments  of  $  2.978  billions   while
disbursements   amounted  to  $  1.309  billions.  Against   that
disbursement,  India paid the Bank $ 1.149 billions as  repayment
and  $  884  millions  as interest, leaving  the  country  $  723
millions in the red.

India: Cauvery: Karnataka denies understanding

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 14, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE, Sept. 26.

The  Karnataka Major Irrigation Minister, Mr. K. N.  Nage  Gowda,
clarified  on Thursday that no understanding was reached  on  any
contentious  issue relating to the Cauvery water  dispute  during
the talks between the Governments of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
Mr.  Nage  Gowda told presspersons that what had  transpired  was
only loud thinking. It was not correct to say that the States had
agreed to build an additional water gauging centre at Biligundlu,
where  the  Central Water Commission-manned  gauging  centre  was
located.

Mr. Nage Gowda was endorsing the view expressed by the Tamil Nadu
PWD Minister, Mr. Durai Murugan, in Madras on Wednesday.
The  Minister  said  there  was  also  no  understanding  on  not
extending  the area under irrigation in the Cauvery  basin.  This
issue  was linked to the quantum of water that was to  be  shared
between the two States, which had not been agreed upon. Mr.  Nage
Gowda,  who convened a press conference in the morning,  said  he
had spoken to both the Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr. J. H. Patel,
and  Mr. Durai Murugan. The Chief Minister had told him over  the
phone  that  he did not say that both the States had come  to  an
understanding  on  setting  up an additional  gauging  centre  at
Biligundlu to monitor the water inflow.

He clarified that the Tamil Nadu had stuck to its stand that  the
Mettur  reservoir was the reference point and it  had  maintained
that  even  the Cauvery Tribunal had endorsed it.  The  Karnataka
Government  had  suggested  that  a  modern  gauging  centre   be
established at Biligundlu on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border.
Expressing   the  Government's  resentment  over   the   reported
statement  of the Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Minister that  Andhra
Pradesh  was not getting an adequate quantity of water  from  the
Tungabhadra  dam, Mr. Nage Gowda said the release of  water  from
that dam was monitored by the Tungabhadra Board, which was headed
by  the  Chairman  of the Central  Water  Commission.  The  State
Governments  of  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh had no say  on  the
issue. Farmers in Karnataka had not tapped water meant for Andhra
Pradesh.  The Tungabhadra Board had vindicated Karnataka's  stand
in  its  recent  letter. Tungabhadra water was  being  shared  by
Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh on the  basis  of  an  agreement.
Karnataka  was getting two-thirds of the water and the  rest  was
being  used  by  Andhra Pradesh. Describing the  remarks  of  his
Andhra  Pradesh counterpart as unfortunate, Mr. Nage  Gowda  said
such  `unverified'  and `unwarranted' statements would  harm  the
cordial  relations between the two States. If the Andhra  Pradesh
Government had complaints, it could raise them at the Tungabhadra
Board meeting scheduled for October 15.

He  termed as baseless the allegation of the Mysore  BJP  member,
Mr.  Ramdas, that the Prime Minister, Mr. H. D. Deve  Gowda,  had
settled contractors' bills relating to the Bagur-Navile tunnel of
the  Hemavathy  project, worth Rs. 1.19 crores, two  days  before
resigning  as Chief Minister. He maintained that these bills  had
not been settled for the last four to five years.

India: EC looking into BJP complaints against PM

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The Election Commission is looking into complaints received  from
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against the Prime Minister,  Mr.
H.  D.  Deve Gowda, charging him of violating the model  code  of
conduct  during  his  campaign for  the  Uttar  Pradesh  Assembly
elections.

The BJP's complaints relate to Mr. Gowda's reported announcements
that  his  Government was considering reservation  for  women  in
Central  Government jobs and also for extending  the  reservation
bracket to poor among the forward castes. Mr. Gowda had  promised
these in the course of his election meetings in U.P.

The Commission has called for reports from the Cabinet Secretary,
according  to  a  spokesman  of  the  Election  Commission.   The
spokesman  added  that  the Election Commission  has  received  a
report  from  the  Doordarshan and that a full  report  from  the
Cabinet  Secretary  was expected by this week end.  The  Election
Commission will take up the matter for a final verdict soon after
receiving the report, the spokesman added.

The  Commission  had  also taken up a  proposal  from  the  Uttar
Pradesh Government to give extension to one of its officers,  Mr.
Surendra  Mohan, who is due to superannuate on September  30.  It
was  decided  that  such an extension was not in  order  and  the
decision was conveyed to the Government.

In  another  instance of the  Commission's  intervention  towards
enforcing  the  model code, the Commission has  conveyed  to  the
Jammu  and  Kashmir Chief Secretary stating that a  September  23
decision to set up a Directorate of Tourism was not in order  and
that such a decision must be left to the elected State Government
that is expected to be in place within the coming fortnight.

A COALITION GOVERNMENT IS THE LIKELIEST OUTCOME

India has had ten general elections since it became independent in
1947. Four of them resulted in a change of government, but none
affected the basic continuity of its policies. So Indians should be
able to take the eleventh election -- likely to be held in April -- in
their stride. But there is an almost palpable nervousness in political
circles in New Delhi, for all the available evidence suggests that no
party will win the 273 seats needed to gain a majority in parliament.
This election, therefore, is likely to be followed by a period of
haggling between parties, from which a coalition may eventually emerge.

Congress, which has ruled India for all but three and a half of the
past 48 years, is no stranger to electoral setbacks. In 1989, under
Rajiv Gandhi, it gained only 198 seats. In the last elections it
improved its tally to 219 (though subsequently it managed to increase
its strength). In 1977, after Mrs Indira Gandhi had declared an
Emergency and jailed thousands of her opponents, the Congress won only
153 seats. But on all these occasions, the party retained its dominance
of Indian politics, a dominance inherited from 75 years of leading the
struggle for independence. When coalitions of other parties formed the
government, the public saw them as temporary occupants for they
contained parties who had united only to oust Congress from power.
Congress therefore remained the dominant force and continued to set the
agenda for the country.

This long era is drawing to a close. The reason why the next election
may bring it to an end lies in India's first-past-the-post system of
voting which systematically magnifies the proportion of seats gained by
the largest party in relation to its votes and diminishes the share of
seats of smaller parties. Congress has never secured an absolute
majority of the national vote. The closest it came to doing so was in
1984 when Mrs Gandhi's assassination generated a huge wave of sympathy
for the party and gave it 49.1 per cent of the vote. On other occasions
the Congress has received between 36.5 per cent (1977) and 47.8 per
cent (1957). However, this has usually been sufficient to give the
party a comfortable majority in parliament.

The Congress party could easily have lost its dominance as far back as
in 1984. In a string of 23 by-elections spread across the country in
May of that year, it received less than 37 per cent of the vote. But
then Mrs Gandhi was assassinated with the consequences mentioned above.
However, by 1989, when elections became due again, the party's vote had
dropped to 37.8 per cent once more.

Exactly the same thing happened in 1991, when Rajiv Gandhi was
assassinated in the middle of the elections after two-fifths of the
constituencies had gone to the polls. An analysis of the voting before
and after the event shows that Congress gained around 5.5 per cent of
the vote out of sympathy. This gave it 219 seats and over 38 per cent
of the vote. But that wave too has spent itself. Various by-elections
and, less ambiguously, the Congress' loss, between December 1994 and
March 1995 of state elections in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
Maharashtra, which had been its strongholds for the past four decades,
have shown that even holding 32 per cent of the vote will not be easy.

In a proportional representation system 32 per cent of the vote would
have given it around 180-185 seats -- or just enough to be sure of
emerging as the dominant partner in a future coalition government. But
under the first-past-the-post system, even this figures seems beyond
its reach. The voting system, which has so far worked in favour of the
Congress, is likely to turn against it. The reason is that, while all
of Congress's rivals are much smaller than it is, their vote is not
spread evenly through the country but is concentrated in small parts of
it. Like inkdots on blotting paper, these local concentrations of the
non-Congress vote have now spread till they cover most of the country.
In most areas, therefore, the Congress is in imminent danger of being
reduced to the second position, and in one, UP, which elects one-fifth
of the parliament, it has already been pushed down to third place.

Should this happen throughout the country, it is even possible that the
Congress could end with not even a hundred seats. But such a debacle is
unlikely. In two or three states where it fared poorly in 1991, the
political pendulum will have swung in its favour and this will give it
a majority of the seats. Judging by recent state election results the
states most likely to swing towards Congress are Orissa in the east,
Madhya Pradesh in central India, and the tiny Himalayan state of
Himachal Pradesh. The Congress is also expected to make significant
gains in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

It is also possible that a significant number of people will vote
differently in the national election from the way they did at the state
level. These are middle class voters who generally tend to make up
their minds at the last minute, and they may chose stability and
continued economic reform.

If all these factors work in favour of the Congress, it may win around
160 seats. With its long term ally, the All India Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam, a Tamil nationalist party from Tamil Nadu, the Congress could
command a stable 180 seats in parliament. While this would not be
sufficient for it to rule alone, it would virtually ensure that the
next coalition is led by it.

This is not, of course, a view shared by the Congress's main rival, the
Hindu-revivalist BJP. A recent internal review of its poll prospects by
the party is supposed to have shown that the party expects to win no
less than 260 seats (against the 119 that it has at present) and to
form the next government with the help of smaller groups that will
gravitate to it in quest of power. But this estimate flatters the BJP
unduly. More than nine-tenths of its support is concentrated in five
large and two mini-states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. This concentration
enabled it to get 23 per cent of the seats in parliament with 21 per
cent of the vote in 1991, but it will effectively prevent it from
adding many more seats to its tally in 1996. To do so it must break
into new areas with enough votes to get past the post first. But a
study of past elections shows that while the party has succeeded in
deepening its hold, it has not succeeded in broadening it. In 1989,
when it put up 86 candidates outside its traditional strongholds, 85 of
them lost their deposit. The most it can hope for in 1996 is to capture
a few more marginal urban constituencies, where the lower middle class,
from which it draws most of its support, predominates.

Between the two of them therefore the two major contenders are not
likely to capture more than 300 seats in parliament. To whom will the
remaining seats go? The short answer is that two states, West Bengal
and Kerala, are dominated by the Communists (now the Left Front) while
another three states, Bihar, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are likely to
stay with the Janata Dal and its electoral ally, the Telugu Desam. All
these parties are part of a loose coalition called the National Front-
Left Front (NF-LF) which succeeded in getting 118 seats in the 1991
parliament. There is every likelihood that this coalition, despite its
inchoateness, will profit from the general disenchantment with Congress
and the unwillingness of large segment of the population to support the
BJP. It could end in a close third place with about 110-120 seats.

Since neither the Congress nor the NF-LF is prepared to deal with the
BJP, if the former (with the AIADMK) does manage to nose ahead with 160
or so seats, a coalition between it and the Left Front, with all or
part of the NF is a likely outcome. Such a government will undoubtedly
carry on the reform policies of the Rao government. But the weakening
of the centre that coalition politics entails, will almost certainly
cause a shift in the relative roles of the centre and states. Till now
it has been the centre that has made the running in reform. After the
next election the initiative will pass to the states, and the centre
will be left to hold the ring. This could mean that its role will be no
more than to pass enabling legislation that facilitates the states'
search for private capital to finance its projects.

However, if the Congress collapses and fails to get more than a hundred
seats, the lead would pass to the BJP. Very likely the Congress would
split and a part of it would join the BJP in its quest for a share of
power. India would then enter, abruptly, a new era of two-party
politics. For economic reforms this would be a bad outcome, for the BJP
is a xenophobic party. While its top leaders say they welcome foreign
investment in hi-tech and infrastructure areas, they have still to
realise that foreign investors have requirements of their own, and that
cutting off Kentucky Fried Chicken could also cut off IBM and Sony.

ECONOMY:  POWER SHORTAGES TAKE THEIR TOLL

In recent weeks, both the finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, and the
commerce minister, Mr P.Chidambaram, have stressed repeatedly that the
fundamentals of the economy are strong and there is no cause for worry
about its future. They are both right and wrong. The fundamentals are
strong: the gross domestic product grew by 6 per cent in 1994-95; the
rate of inflation has fallen sharply from over 10 per cent recorded at
the beginning of the year to below 7 per cent; the growth of exports
has been strong, and the trade deficit this year is not likely to
exceed $4.5bn (1.3 per cent of GDP).

But the strong fundamentals today are no guarantee that they will
remain so in the coming months. A close look at the most recent
statistics suggests that the economy is weakening and could weaken
further. Frequent revisions of the official statistics make all
estimates of growth somewhat tentative, but the growth in industrial
production, which was nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter of this
year, fell to 8.6 per cent in July. Preliminary estimates, based on
figures for around half of all industry suggest that there have been
further falls during August and September. In the last of these months
the index for 24 industry groups seems to have risen by a bare 4 per
cent.

Exports have been growing at 24.5 per cent in the first half of 1995-
96, but a closer look at the month-by-month data shows that this too
has been declining -- from 33 per cent in July to 20 and 19 per cent in
August and September, and 12 per cent in October. Fortunately, imports
too have declined, and even more sharply, so that the trade deficit can
be financed.

Inflation has come down, partly as a result of tight monetary policy,
and partly because of the almost total halt of foreign portfolio
investment and other capital inflows. From an average of $1bn a month
between October 1993 and November 1994, these fell to an average of
$100m in January to October 1995, and to a mere $39m in November. There
has been a corresponding fall in the growth of money supply in the
economy. By contrast the government's spending remains buoyant. A
recent study by the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy
has estimated that instead of coming down to 5.5 per cent of GDP this
year, the centre's fiscal deficit could climb to 6.9 per cent against
the 6.7 per cent recorded last year. This is probably a far too
pessimistic a forecast, but there is no doubt that the high fiscal
deficit remains a source of future inflation.

The reasons for the slowdown, both in industrial growth and exports,
are not difficult to fathom. Thanks to a less than optimal south-west,
and a poor north-east monsoon, the country is now in the grip of a
severe power crisis. The output of hydroelectric power slumped by 19
per cent in July to September over the same period of 1994. The poor
north-east monsoon ensures that this shortage will worsen in the coming
months. There are power shortages everywhere, but the southern and
western states in particular are reeling under the severest power cuts
in almost a decade. These cuts have directly affected manufacturing
industries, and that in turn has begun to affect exports.

Apart from this, the combination of a lax fiscal policy and a tight
monetary policy has raised interest rates to very high levels. This is
helping to slow down the economy. Another factor is the anxiety among
investors, both Indian and foreign, over the political outlook. The
worry is not just the normal one that precedes a general election, but
has to do with the probability that this election may bring into power
a government that may not have the strength to complete the reform
programme. This is causing some loss of confidence, whose symptoms are
the fall in the value of the rupee, the inability of the stockmarket to
recover and feverish speculation in real estate.

DABHOL:  MAHARASHTRA FINALLY APPROVES ENRON PROJECT

After months of muscle flexing and dithering the Maharashtra government
has finally cleared Enron's power project at Dabhol. At the same time
the state government also cleared two other power projects in the
state, Reliance's 410 MW gas based plant at Patalganga and the Nippon
Denro Ispat-led consortium's 1082 MW coal-based plant at Bhadrawati.
The three projects will add a total of nearly 5,000 MW of installed
power generating capacity in the state.

While the clearance of the Dabhol project has ostensibly led to lower
capital costs reflected in a lower cost per unit of electricity, the
Maharashtra chief minister Manohar Joshi did not release all the
details of the renotiated deal. Under the revised terms offered by the
government and accepted in principle by Enron, the 695 MW first phase
and the 1390 MW second phase have been combined and total cost reduced
by Rs10.56bn to Rs80.04bn. Enron has also been permitted to hive off
its Rs15.8bn regassification plant into a separate company, a step
whose implications are not yet clear.

The plant will now be operated on naptha instead on LNG and the cost of
power has been reduced from around Rs2.10 per kWh for the first phase
to Rs1.86 per kWh for both the phases. The annual escalation of around
4 per cent has also been disallowed and Enron will supply power at the
same dollar rate for 17 years. However, costs have been calculated at
Rs32 to the dollar while the rupee is currently trading at over Rs35 to
the dollar and may decline further.

In another important decision the Maharashtra State Electricity Board
will now hold 30 per cent of the total equity in Enron's Dabhol project
for Rs5.78bn. Equipment for the second phase will now not necessarily
be bought from Enron's partners General Electric and Bechtel but will
be on open tender for which Indian companies can also bid.

Manohar Joshi claimed a savings of Rs250bn for the state over the
lifespan of the project but in the absence of details this is difficult
to verify. While welcoming the decision, Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron
Corporation, said, "We are willing to consider recommendations that
provide for a mutually satisfactory project".

The ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition in Maharashtra
will try to present the deal it has secured from Enron as a victory,
but it is no secret that a wing of the BJP is unhappy about the
outcome.

NARASIMHA RAO NAMES THE MONTH

The elections to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) will be
in April. Prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao stated this on January 6,
but declined to specify the dates. He also said that parliament will
meet once again in February to approve a vote-on-account for the year,
the regular Union budget being postponed until after a new government
settles in. The dates for the elections are fixed by the election
commission and the government in consultation with each other. Earlier,
the election commission had announced that the elections would be held
in either February or April, the month of March being unsuitable
because it coincides with the sowing season and university
examinations.

VIOLENCE IS EXPECTED DURING THE ELECTIONS

The airdropping of arms into a country is a worrisome development in
the best of times. When it comes just before a general election, there
is even greater cause for alarm. The discovery last month that small
arms, including several hundred AK47 rifles, were clandestinely dropped
near an abandoned airfield at Purulia in West Bengal by foreign
mercenaries has added a new element of uncertainty to the polls. Though
there is no clear indication so far whom the arms were meant for,
speculation has centred around a Maoist faction in Bihar, a
paramilitary Hindu religious organisation, or an attempt by a foreign
country to instigate violence during the elections.

Every successive election since the 1970s has witnessed increasing
violence in the form of intimidating voters or "capturing" polling
booths by musclemen to stuff ballot boxes. In the past two years,
elections have been better conducted because of the reforming zeal of
chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan. Now, the near certainty of a
hung parliament may encourage more violence. The mysterious arms drop
at Purulia has added a nasty edge to that possibility.

TWO STATES DISPUTE THE SHARE OF A SINGLE RIVER

In the past the Indian subcontinent has witnessed wars over the use of
river waters. More recently, though India has had disputes over the
sharing of river waters with three of it neighbours -- Pakistan, Nepal
and Bangladesh -- they have either been satisfactorily resolved or admit
of a possible solution. Within the country, the sharing of river waters
has led to conflict between neighbouring states through which a river
passes. When conflicting positions could not be resolved by the
concerned states, a tribunal has been set up to adjudicate and award
the sharing of waters.

Of the five such cases referred to tribunals, four (Narmada, Krishna
and Godavari in the Deccan, and Ravi and Beas in the north) have been
sorted out. The fifth, the sharing of the waters of the Cauvery, has
once again become a bone of contention between Karnataka and Tamil
Nadu, the two states which depend most heavily on its waters. The
Cauvery is one of the most intensively used rivers in the world with
some 92 per cent of its waters being used for irrigation by a system of
dams and canals. The roots of the century-old dispute lie in the fact
that, while Tamil Nadu has used most of the waters, Karnataka feels the
irrigation potential in the state was not allowed to be properly
developed by the British.

Karnataka wants a greater share of the waters and has been building up
its irrigation potential which has led to a reduction in the existing
supply to Tamil Nadu. The matter is so linked to the prosperity and
even survival of farmers in the two states that neither can see the
other's point of view. Coming as it does before the general election,
there were fears that passions may be aroused on both sides leading to
street violence as happened in 1991.

Karnataka, through which the upper reaches of the river and its
tributaries pass, was asked by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal to
release 205 tmc ft (thousand million cubic feet) of water to Tamil Nadu
annually but disputed this on every count. This year matters got worse
since the north-east monsoon (October to January) which normally gives
over half the annual rain to Tamil Nadu, failed. Over 1.3 million acres
of paddy were in danger of being lost. Tamil Nadu approached the
Supreme Court to order Karnataka to release 11 tmc ft of water
immediately to save the crop. The court passed on the buck to prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao asking him to ask the states to come to a
settlement, failing which he should do what he thought was best.

Rao appointed a committee of experts and decided that Karnataka must
release 6 tmc ft at once. Karnataka chief minister Deve Gowda agreed
reluctantly but there was an immediate backlash of anger in the state.
Tempers also ran high in Tamil Nadu and Rao was put in the sticky
position of mediating between two warring sides on the eve of an
important general election. If violence had broken out the Congress
party's prospects would have been affected in both states. With tempers
now having cooled, Rao can have the satisfaction of having made the
best of a bad job.

STOCKMARKET:  THE MONETARY BRAKES ARE STILL ON

In terms of value, Indian shares are currently attractive. For the long-
term investor, the market should be bought. But in the short-term there
are some impediments to the start of a bull market. For one thing,
money is very tight. This is increasingly threatening to stifle
economic growth. For another, the manner in which stockmarket reforms
are being conducted does not inspire confidence in investors.

Money is tight because the government has taken the virtuous path of
borrowing to finance its deficit instead of monetising it as it used to
do. This has kept inflation under check, but it is squeezing the
private sector. Many companies are finding it difficult to get money,
even at high cost. Financially sound companies are having to pay
interest rates at over 21 per cent. Some of them had raised money
through equity issues in India and abroad when their shares were in
demand; foolishly, many of them invested the proceeds in equities or
real estate. Companies are therefore short of money and many projects
are getting delayed. Even where they had received commitments to borrow
funds from domestic financial institutions (DFIs), they are finding the
going tough. DFIs themselves are starved for funds and are delaying
disbursements of loans.

The DFIs are scrambling to raise money primarily through the debt
route. ICICI, for example, managed to raise about Rs7bn recently,
through a five year bond, but had to pay a coupon rate of 16 per cent
despite the instrument being rated triple-A. That amount would suffice
for less than two months of its loan sanctions, after which it will
need to float another issue. All other DFIs are simultaneously planning
issues and the total works out at Rs50bn. The main subscribers are
provident funds, but their additional annual inflow is only Rs6bn.

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has
issued a warning that unless the monetary situation is eased, the
economy will slow down. Recently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has
helped a little by cutting CRR, in effect pumping some Rs25bn into the
system.

The second worry is the slow pace of stockmarket reforms. All the
systemic problems relating to settlement and delivery which plague the
Indian capital market system have their root in the absence of a
central depository. The trading systems have been largely modernised,
with the introduction of screen-based trading. However, post settlement
delays in registration of shares deter foreign investment. In a report
by James Capel entitled "Emerging markets investment strategies -- Q4
1995", the Indian market is given neutral weightage, despite scoring
high on valuation, primarily because of poor liquidity of shares.
Annual traded volume (on the assumption of 250 days trading) represents
only 8 per cent of market capitalisation. Compare that with the leader,
Taiwan, which stands at 194 per cent, or South Korea (59 per cent).

The government had, through an ordinance, introduced legislation paving
the way for a central depository. Unfortunately, the bill never got
passed in the upper house of parliament. It is to be re-promulgated. If
it is not approved before the current parliament is dissolved, it will
mean a six month wait.

Sebi, the regulatory body, seems incapable of enforcing discipline. It
recently suspended the largest merchant banker, SBI Capital Markets,
for its role as lead manager to the controversial MS Shoes issue -- it
did not prevent misleading TV advertisements from appearing. SBI
Capital Markets has refused to accept Sebi's verdict and promises to
appeal, right up to the Supreme Court if necessary. It knows that
judicial delays make a mockery of any disciplinary action.

In another episode, Sebi declared itself unable to prevent another
merchant banker, which had defaulted on an underwriting commitment,
from making a public issue. Sebi is also unable to take quick action
against companies consistently delaying transfer of shares. Though it
has instituted legal proceedings against five companies, the Indian
legal system is not capable of delivering justice quickly.

As long as the capital market system is unable to cope with investment
needs of millions of individual investors, it is inevitable that the
mutual fund industry will grow. The industry had recently been
restricted to the public sector, mainly the banks and the UTI. Absence
of competition has bred complacency, and returns have been inadequate.

Now Sebi has issued guidelines for the mutual fund industry. They spell
out things such as the basis for computation of net asset values. More
importantly, they seek to link fees payable to asset management
companies to the performance of the funds. It is imperative that the
mutual fund industry grows in order to fill the vacuum left by the
reduced role of the UTI.

The UTI has been under a cloud recently. In September 1994, it had
bought shares of Reliance Industries as a price of Rs385 per share, in
a private placement deal worth Rs7bn. The share now quotes at around
Rs200, entailing not only a sizeable monetary loss for UTI, but more
importantly, a loss of investor confidence. More recently, it has been
embroiled in the Reliance switching of shares controversy, although it
has had the shares replaced subsequently.

UTI's future is important for the stockmarket because it controls funds
totalling some Rs650bn. Its largest scheme, the US '64 scheme, is an
open ended one, in which it is largely exposed to the corporate sector.
If, because of the tight money position faced by the companies, they
make redemption calls en masse, the resultant selling by UTI would hurt
the equity market.

On a positive note, the figures for the seven months to October reveal
a healthy trend in many sectors where the market is well represented.
Production of cement is up 9.7 per cent, of saleable steel 10.3 per
cent, and the auto sector is doing well with a 23.6 per cent increase
in production of cars and 32.3 per cent in commercial vehicles.

The boom in the auto sector is riding on the back of easier credit
availability from auto finance companies. Kotak Mahindra Finance (KMFL)
has cut a good deal with Ford Motor Company, with which it has entered
into two separate joint ventures. One will be to finance vehicles which
Ford will produce in India. The equity will be held by Ford (55 per
cent), KMFL (35 per cent) and Mahindra and Mahindra (10 per cent),
Ford's partner.

The more interesting deal is the other JV, in which KMFL will hive off
its existing (non-Ford) car financing business. In this, Ford will hold
a 40 per cent stake, bringing in Rs1.4bn, whilst KMFL will hold the
balance, bringing in Rs6m. Over the next eight years, Ford will
increase its commitment to Rs5bn, as will KMFL proportionately, leaving
the ratio the same. The deal makes KMFL a good share to pick up. KMFL
will also receive Rs4bn as royalty for Ford over the next ten years.

In other corporate developments of interest, Yogi Deveshwar has taken
over as Chairman of ITC, India's largest tobacco company, despite the
objections of BAT, the largest single holder with a 31 per cent stake.
Devashwar's appointment was made possible with the backing of
government-controlled financial institutions, holding 37 per cent. He
has landed into a hot seat. At the start of the new year, the
government has re-opened an excise dispute and has claimed Rs8bn as
penalty for past excise defaults. The share price dipped from Rs242 to
Rs229 on release of the news, but quickly firmed up to end the
fortnight at Rs233, on reports that BAT had set aside $60m to acquire
an additional 6 per cent stake in the company (see page 15).

The BSE is to reintroduce a forward trading mechanism from January 15.
The market is hoping that this will bring back investors. But with
interest rates at such high level, forward trading will be expensive.

BUSINESS:  NEPC GOES INTO BATTLE FOR MODILUFT

Five years ago, the Madras-based NEPC group was practically unknown. It
was a new player in a new arena -- wind energy. And though the Khemkas,
who own the group, were thinking big even then, most corporate
observers were prone to dismiss their grand plans as just so much wind.

No longer. Last month, NEPC made an open offer for the Rs4bn (expected
1995-96 turnover) ModiLuft. With the company's promoter S.K. Modi not
only marshalling his defences but also taking the battle to the
opposition camp by threatening a suit claiming Rs25bn in damages, this
is a battle that has placed the Khemkas firmly on the front pages of
the financial press.

They have been there before. NEPC already has a successful airline --
NEPC Airlines -- a division of flagship NEPC-Micon. Earlier last year,
the company engineered a successful takeover of Damania Airways.
Initially billed as a management takeover, the Khemkas were later
forced to make an open offer to ordinary Damania shareholders by the
Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Along the way, NEPC also
picked up the Damania family holding in the company.

With the acquisition of Damania, the NEPC-Damania combine became the
largest private sector operator in the aviation sector. The ModiLuft
deal, if it comes through, should make this position unassailable. The
only big rival in the business -- East West -- is in no position to give
chase.  The company is still recovering from the shock of what is
alleged to be a gangland killing. Recently, its CEO, T. Wahid was shot
dead on the streets of Bombay while returning from work.

But ModiLuft is not going to fall in the Khemkas' bag without a battle.
The Khemkas had initially offered to take over 47.32 per cent of
ModiLuft's equity at a price of Rs29 per share. Curiously, the offer
was for exactly 47.32 per cent; the Khemkas weren't interested in a
lesser stake. Sebi is now looking into the legality of the offer which
S.K. Modi says is against the takeover code.

Besides, says Modi, he and his family control 60 per cent of ModiLuft's
equity. So the question of the Khemkas picking up 47 per cent does not
arise. NEPC chief Ravi Prakash Khemka, on the other hand, disputes
Modi's ownership figures. He claims to have done his homework and the
47.32 per cent figure has been carefully calculated: he is aware of the
ownership pattern and is confident of getting that much. According to
Sebi's norms, ModiLuft will have to reveal its shareholders list by the
end of January and the truth will out only then.

But some of the Khemka calculations have already gone awry. The
ModiLuft shares have spiralled past Rs29 (they were much lower when the
offer was announced) and the Khemkas are planning to raise their bid to
Rs35. This will mean an additional Rs180m to pick up the stake; at Rs29
the deal would have cost Rs870m. Khemka had initially suggested that
some large holders (including some foreign institutional investors)
were going to unload their holdings in his favour. But that does not
seem to be working out. Besides, NEPC has had its share of abortive
takeovers, particularly in the aviation arena. Last year, the promoters
of Sahara, a rival private airline, accused the Khemkas of slanting
takeover stories in the press. The Khemkas, however, explained that it
was only some sharing of facilities that was being discussed and the
media had put two and two together to make five. Later there was talk
of NEPC taking over two regional airlines -- UP Air and Gujarat Airways.
But these apparently didn't go through because of a change in the state
government.

But this time the Khemkas seem confident. Some critics, Modi amongst
them, suggest that the open offer is nothing more than a ploy designed
principally to scupper ModiLuft's expansion plans. ModiLuft has offered
its collaborator Lufthansa a 40 per cent stake and Khemka had sent
feelers to Modi that this holding be offered to NEPC instead. The
swadeshi card has also been dragged out in this connection; note that
the Singapore Airlines-Tata joint venture has proved stillborn because
there are many who feel that foreign airlines should not be given
significant holdings in the Indian aviation sector. Now it will be all
the more difficult for the government to approve Lufthansa's taking up
a 40 per cent stake in ModiLuft. Which means, in sum, that the Khemkas
have hamstrung what could potentially have been a major competitor.

But if Modi does decide to sell, do the Khemkas have the wherewithal to
buy him out? On the face of it, yes. The NEPC group is extremely cash
rich. The current value of the shares held by the Khemka family in
group companies is over Rs3bn and finding the Rs1bn or so required to
buy 47 per cent of ModiLuft should not be a major problem. Ravi Prakash
Khemka is, in fact, planning to fund the acquisition with his personal
money without taking recourse to his group companies.

But the group companies can well put up the funds if necessary. They
are all in fine fettle. NEPC-Micon (which has a tie-up with Micon of
Denmark) is a leading producer of electricity from windpower with a
marketshare of 80 per cent. NEPC Agro Foods, which was promoted in
1991, has established its Trupti brandname which is used for a wide
range of products from mineral water to basmati rice, packaged wheat
flour and spices. The group also has a presence in textiles with NEPC
Textiles (a textile unit in Coimbatore taken over in 1993) and paper
with NEPC Paper & Board (a paper mill in Muzzafarnagar, Uttar Pradesh,
acquired in 1994). And it is now entering the cement business by
acquiring the "sick" South India Cement in Karnataka at a cost of
Rs145m. The group has also gone into media with its own satellite
channel.

The Doubting Thomases, however, see in the Khemka saga many
similarities with that of takeover tycoon P. Rajarathinam who has
fallen upon hard times, with creditors baying for his blood and his
empire under siege. Both came out of the blue, both are known to be
close to a particular Tamil Nadu politician and both have a habit of
venturing into unrelated takeovers. Khemka has another cross to bear:
his younger brother Sashi Prakash has accused him of violating the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, forging share certificates and much
more. As is evident from Manu Chhabria's spat with his brother Kishore,
family squabbles often result in bringing high fliers down to earth.
Will Ravi Prakash Khemka prove the exception?

BUSINESS:  HOW RELIANCE LOST ITS HALO WITH INDIAN INVESTORS

Attack is not always the best form of defence. Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL), which took umbrage at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) suspending
its scrip for three days for a minor peccadillo, should attest to that
by now. By threatening to delist itself from the BSE and move to the
National Stock Exchange (NSE) and by sending a legal notice to a
financial daily investigating the matter seeking damages of Rs20bn, RIL
ensured just the reverse of what it wanted.

RIL is still listed on the BSE. But the company and its suspect deals
are being investigated by the Securities & Exchange Board of India
(Sebi), the department of company affairs (DCA), the income-tax
department and the BSE. The press has now passed the baton to the
investigative authorities, so there are no daily exposes. But RIL
clearly has its back to the wall. Opposition MPs have demanded the
arrest of Dhirubhai Ambani; banks, financial institutions and insurance
companies have been asked by the government to verify their portfolios
(though RIL has not been named, this instruction is clearly targeted at
the company); and the initial sympathy for the Ambanis has been
replaced by growing concern, confusion and disbelief at their
manoeuvres. A public familiar only with ordinary equity and preference
shares has learned some new categories. Consider:

Duplicate shares: This is where it all started. One Rajul Vasa,
Dhirubhai Ambani's physiotherapist, wrote to the company claiming that
she had lost 26,650 RIL shares. She was issued duplicate shares which
she proceeded to sell. Earlier, however, she had sold her original
shares, and at the time when the duplicates were being issued, these
were with RIL's registrars -- Reliance Consultancy Services (RCS).
Reliance made good the loss of Rs10.6m and thought it was a closed
chapter. The BSE, however, decided to suspend it on this ground. RIL's
explanation is that it followed all the norms in the issue of duplicate
shares and the fact that the original shares were with RCS was not
detected because there was no system of cross-checking. There are no
rules or guidelines on this issue, says RIL.

Switched shares: While the Rajul Vasa issue was hogging headlines, came
the revelation that Unit Trust of India (UTI), which had sent 2.4
million RIL shares to RCS in 1991 for transfer, had got back 870,000
shares which were not part of the lot it had sent. These switched
shares had been frozen by the special court looking into the securities
scam. UTI took up the matter with RCS and the shares were replaced.

It later emerged that switching was a common practice as far as RIL was
concerned. By last count, more than 7 million shares have been
switched. Involved are not just UTI alone, but Peerless and some banks.
The motive behind the switching has still not been ascertained. RIL
says all companies do it but other business houses disagree. The Sebi-
DCA probe is now investigating this angle.

Some feel that UTI and other bulk purchasers were used as a dumping
ground for "tainted" shares (shares involved in the 1992 securities
scandal). No transactions were allowed in such shares by the special
court, but UTI and other institutions would be unlikely to try and sell
them. This explanation has subsequently been replaced by another. It
has been conclusively proved that Reliance investment companies and
trading associates were involved in all these transactions. The theory
is that Reliance trading companies sold large lots of shares but did
not have actual scrips in their possession (this is a normal practice).
When they had to make delivery, they "borrowed" shares from Reliance
investment companies. When these shares were sent to RCS, the original
sellers (the trading companies) replaced them with other shares which
they had acquired in the meantime.

How does this help? The Reliance investment companies hold shares which
they bought a long time ago, some even at par value. If these shares
were sold, capital gains tax would have to be paid on the price
differential, which would work out to a huge amount. So these were used
for delivery purposes and the shares actually sold were picked up from
the markets at higher rates. The capital gains tax was thus nominal. Is
this legal income-tax avoidance or illegal evasion? That will probably
be a matter for the courts to decide.

Fake shares: There are several strands to this. Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) leader Jaswant Singh has written to the finance minister pointing
out that two sets of RIL share certificates held by Syndicate Bank have
the same distinctive numbers but different certificate numbers. These
were among a lot of RIL shares sold by Syndicate Bank through a
stockbroking firm in 1989. The firm returned the certificates to the
bank as these would be treated as bad delivery in the market. According
to government sources, it is not possible for two sets of certificates
to have the same distinctive numbers. The inevitable conclusion: one is
a fake. RIL says that its records do not tally with those in the
certificates in the name of Syndicate Bank.

There are also several RIL share certificates bearing distinctive
numbers that go beyond the official list of distinctive numbers of the
paid-up capital of the company. This gave rise to the suspicion that
the company had issued more shares than its paid-up equity capital. RIL
has an explanation for this, but not everyone is convinced.

Apart from the shares, several other issues concerning Reliance are
creating controversy. An investigation is on into the possible rigging
of the share prices of Reliance Polypropylene Ltd (RPPL) and Reliance
Polyethylene Ltd (RPEL) before their merger with RIL. The big buyers
prior to the merger were companies close to Reliance. Among the names
also figures Rajul Vasa. Inevitably, Reliance has also got sucked into
the major controversy of the day -- the telecom tenders. The
controversial Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) has been
discovered to be another major buyer of RPPL/RPEL shares. HFCL sources
say their purchases weren't significant and they actually made a loss
on the deal. True, it wasn't significant as far as the RPPL/RPEL equity
goes. But the investment of Rs167m was a big sum for a small company.
Inevitably, opposition MPs have alleged that HFCL is only a front for
Reliance.

Most of these charges will not hold water. But some action is bound to
be taken. RCF's licence may well be suspended and the trading
associates and investment companies in the Reliance stable could be
slapped with an income-tax notice. The real damage, however, is in one
of perceptions. Reliance, once the darling of the stockmarkets, is now
being looked upon with suspicion. Foreign investors are also aghast
that the system permits such machinations. For the Ambanis, BSE-bashing
has proved more damaging than they could ever have expected.

BUSINESS:  ITC'S MISFORTUNE MAY WORK TO BAT'S ADVANTAGE

On January 1, Yogi Deveshwar took over as chairman of ITC. He won the
post, despite opposition from principal shareholder BAT Industries,
because of government support which manifested itself through the
financial institutions. On January 2, it was another arm of the
government which gave him a New Year's gift. The commissioner of
central excise, Delhi, passed an order against the company claiming
Rs7,990m as duty due from ITC and its contract manufacturers. In
addition, the commissioner imposed penalties on the company and six of
its erstwhile directors taking the total excise claim to over Rs8,700m.

ITC will be going to the Customs, Excise and Gold Appellate Tribunal
(Cegat) to appeal against the order, but in many ways the die seems
cast. The case is actually of ancient vintage; the excise claims relate
to the period between March 1, 1983 and February 28, 1987. Besides,
according to excise officials, ITC has already moved both the Calcutta
high court and the Supreme Court and lost.

The issue, though it has done the rounds of the courts and government
departments for several years now, is actually very simple. Excise
officials claim that ITC cut its dealer and retailer margins and
printed a lower price on its cigarette packets. It paid excise on this
printed price. The retailers, however, sold the packets to consumers at
a higher rate to make up their margins. This was done with the full
knowledge of the company. The authorities feel that ITC should have
paid excise on this higher price. It is also claimed that the printed
price was fixed in such a way that the consumers would inevitably have
to pay more. For instance, the printed price on a ten-pack of the best-
selling Wills Filter is today Rs11.75. But they are sold at Rs12 at all
outlets; nobody returns the loose change.

Observers feel that the best ITC can hope for now is a reduction in the
amount it has to pay. The payment could also be staggered. A precedent
has been set in the case of another cigarette manufacturer -- Godfrey
Phillips India -- which faced similar excise claims and fines of Rs570m.
In December, Cegat issued a partial stay of the excise order but asked
the company to pay around one-fourth the amount within three months. If
the same is done in ITC's case, the company will have to find Rs2bn
quickly. Where is the money going to come from? ITC could sell some its
investments in sister companies and finance the rest from its profits.
But this would mean weakening its hold on these companies and -- this is
worse -- displeasing shareholders who may have to go without dividends
for a couple of years.

The other solution is to go hat in hand to BAT. But the UK parent will
obviously demand its pound of flesh -- a greater representation on the
board, a greater say in the management and even an increase in equity
to 51 per cent. According to the Economic Times, India's leading
financial daily, BAT has already begun to buy ITC shares in the market
and has earmarked $60m for this purpose. That strategy may not make too
much sense, as control over ITC is not really a function of BAT's
holding; it depends on the stand the financial institutions take. Other
newspaper reports say that the ITC brass is now prepared to eat humble
pie; it has given up plans to go into power and other sectors and will
toe the BAT line. The excise axe may cost ITC dear but BAT, for one,
has some reason to cheer.

TELECOM:  BALL NOW IN SUPREME COURT

The telecom licensing issue saw the proceedings at the winter session
of parliament come to a total standstill as opposition members demanded
an investigation into the "biggest scam of the times". Apart from
passing some vital bills (such as the approval of President's rule in
Uttar Pradesh), no work could be done during the entire session.

The ball is now with the Supreme Court which has ordered a temporary
stay on basic telecom licences. This means that the tenders for the
five circles already finalised have also been put on hold. However, the
court allowed the government to go ahead with the retendering process
for the 13 other circles. The granting of contracts will only take
place after the final hearing which is scheduled for January 9.

The main argument of the petitioners in the case before the Supreme
Court is that public sector units have been discriminated against by
not allowing them to participate in the bidding, that the rules have
been loaded in favour of the multinationals and the private sector, and
that some private parties -- principally Himachal Futuristic
Communications -- have been given undue advantages.

TELECOM:  REBIDDING FOR THE BASIC CIRCLES IS LUKEWARM

The re-bidding for the 13 basic circles has received an extremely low-
key response. Only five circles were bid for with six companies
participating in the process. In the first round, a total of 16
companies participated with 81 bids being received for the 20 basic
circles on offer. The reason for the poor response is the uncertainty
over the entire issue. Companies are unwilling to commit themselves
before the Supreme Court judgement is delivered. Secondly, several
opposition parties have declared that they will cancel the entire
tendering process if they come to power after the next elections and
companies are not prepared to risk another Enron-type situation.
Besides, many contend that the reserve prices set by the telecom
department are too high to leave room for profits.

Of the circles thrown open for re-tendering, only Punjab attracted two
bids. Essar-Bell Atlantic was the highest with a quote of Rs14,251m
(levy quoted in terms of net present value). Bharti-STET bid Rs13,680m.
The reserve price was Rs12,700m. The bidders in the other four circles
were Tata-Bell Canada Rs13,127m (Andhra Pradesh; reserve price
Rs12,500m); RPG-NTT Rs36,051m (Tamil Nadu; Rs25,500m); Reliance-Nynex
Rs10,537m (Gujarat; Rs10,500m); and Usha-Moscow Telecom Rs1,400.6m
(Bihar; Rs1,400m).

Several majors such as AT&T-Birla, which had bid for four circles last
time, and US West-BPL, which had bid for five circles, stayed out of
the bidding in this round. Also significant is the fact that the bids
are much lower than what Himachal Futuristic Communication Ltd had
quoted before it had to give up the circles because of the cap imposed.
With several circles yet to be taken up, there is likely to be another
round of bidding soon.

TELCOM:  TWENTY LICENCES AWARDED FOR MOBILE SERVICES

Despite the ongoing controversy and the opposition demand that the
entire telecom privatisation process be put on hold until the Supreme
Court ruling, the government has awarded 20 licences to seven companies
for operating cellular mobile telephone services. The licences, awarded
on December 12, are for JT Mobile-Telia, Sweden (Andhra Pradesh and
Punjab); Birla Communications-AT&T, US (Gujarat and Maharashtra);
Escotel-First Pacific, Hong Kong (Uttar Pradesh west, Haryana and
Kerala), Koshika Telecom-Philipino Telecom, the Philippines (Uttar
Pradesh west, Uttar Pradesh east, Orissa and Bihar); Cellular
Communications-Airtouch, US (Tamil Nadu); Reliance Telecom-Nynex, US
(Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, North-east, Assam and
Himachal Pradesh); and Bharti Telenet-STET, Italy (Himachal Pradesh).
The other licences will be awarded shortly.

TELECOM:  JOINT VENTURES MAY CHANGE THE MIXTURE

In another major change of norms, the department of telecommunications
(DoT) is likely to allow consortia which have won licences to operate
cellular mobile services in the country to change their composition.
This has become necessary because of both the continuing confusion over
the award of licences and the fact that, despite all this, the
prospects for business seem better. While those disenchanted with the
chaos want to pull out others want to raise their stakes in the joint
ventures. This is being opposed by their Indian partners. Take the case
of Koshika Telecom which has been granted licences to operate cellular
services in four circles -- Uttar Pradesh (east), Uttar Pradesh (west),
Orissa and Bihar. Koshika is a joint venture between Usha (India) and
Philipino Telephone Corporation, the largest cellular operator in the
Philippines. Usha (India) has dragged Philipino Telephone to Delhi high
court alleging that the company is threatening to pull out unless it is
allowed to hike its stake to 34 per cent. According to DoT
stipulations, the foreign partner cannot dilute its holding to below 10
per cent in the first three years. Thus, if Philipino does pull out,
the Koshika licences will become invalid. While the Delhi high court
has restrained Philipino Telecom from reneging on the deal, it is
recognised that Indian courts may not be able to do much if the foreign
partner is indeed bent on pulling out. DoT may thus have to agree to
the substitution of some other foreign partner.

According to Usha (India), Philipino Telephone has realised late in the
day that the prospects in the Indian telecom sector are indeed very
bright. Usha's counsel told the court that the foreign company is now
arm-twisting its Indian partner to get both a higher stake and a
greater say in the management. Another successful bidder Modicom
Network Private Ltd, which has won the circles of Punjab and Karnataka,
has approached the government with an application that the 26 per cent
stake of its original partner -- Vanguard of the US -- be transferred to
Australian giant Telstra International. Telstra is already operating
cellular services in Calcutta (which was awarded much earlier) with
B.K. Modi of Modicom, so it sees obvious synergies in a tie-up for
Punjab and Karnataka. Incidentally, Telstra had tied up with Spic to
bid for the current round of celular circles but its estimates were way
out of line. In Karnataka, Telstra-Spic bid Rs2,090m while winner
Modicom quoted a figure of Rs13,930m.

A change in partner is also on the cards in the Hinduja-HCL-Singapore
Telecom combine with Singapore Telecom expressing its desire to pull
out. Both the Hindujas and Modicom desperately need another foreign
partner because of the experience requirements DoT has insisted on.

AVIATION:  FOREIGN EQUITY OKAY, BUT NOT NOW

The government has decided in principle to allow up to 40 per cent
foreign equity holding in domestic airlines. But, in a curious rider,
it will not be giving any such blanket permission until the
modernisation programme for the aviation sector is completed. The
programme includes extension of runways, building of terminals and
modernisation of airports. As this is a subjective issue it means, in
effect, that the decision on foreign equity participation has been
postponed indefinitely. However, according to the civil aviation and
tourism ministry, approvals could still be given on a case-to-case
basis as has been done for Jet Airways. Among the applications which
have queued up at the civil aviation ministry's door are those from
Indotik (of the Ravi Tikkoo group) and the Tata-Singapore Airlines
proposal. The government would also have had to decide on the proposal
by ModiLuft to allow Lufthansa to take a 40 per cent stake, but the
foreign carrier is apparently not interested at the moment.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  POWER SECTOR ATTRACTS THE MOST MONEY

The infrastructure sector has been attracting the maximum foreign
direct investment (FDI) in the reform era. According to available data,
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved a total FDI of
Rs397bn in the period August 1991 to October 1995. Of this the power
sector accounted for the lion's share with Rs60bn (15.11 per cent). Oil
refineries attracted Rs40bn. The total fuel sector (which includes
power and oil refineries) added up to 27.01 per cent. The other big
chunk of FDI went for the telecommunications sector with a total
investment of Rs32.39bn (8.14 per cent). Of this, cellular mobile
telephone services accounted for Rs23.45bn (5.90 per cent). The
consumer goods sector, though the public face of foreign investment,
accounted for only 6.6 per cent (Rs26.27bn) of total FDI. Of this, food
processing provided the biggest chunk with Rs21.94bn (5.51 per cent).
The figures, however, tell only half the story as they relate to the
approvals and not the actual investment. In sectors such as power, the
FDI approval is very high. But most of the projects have been held up
because of various snags and the actual fund inflow has been small. On
the other hand, most of the investments in the food processing sector
have already been made.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  MULTINATIONALS LAW PLANNED

Existing multinational subsidiaries in the country are to be put on a
par with those seeking entry. Currently, even 100 per cent foreign-
owned companies can get into unallied lines of business by taking the
takeover/merger route. The government intends to introduce legislation
to debar such companies from getting into new lines of business unless
this is specifically mentioned in the articles and memoranda of
association. Under the current regulations, MNCs can enter new fields
by amending their articles and their memoranda of association in a
general body meeting. In the new scheme of things, central permission
will also be required for such diversification. This has become
necessary because some sectors are still barred for multinationals and
some areas are reserved for the small-scale sector. A few MNCs have,
however, succeeded in getting a toehold through takeovers.

POWER:  ABB SEEKS STAKE IN POWER COMPANIES

The $30bn power major Asea brown Boveri (ABB) is negotiating with
several new power projects in the country to pick up an equity stake in
them. ABB's main intention is to sell its equipment to these projects
and it would have been happy doing just that. Having a stake, however,
gives it the clear edge in equipment supply and is also an indication
of its long-term commitment. Negotiations are thus on with Videocon for
its 1,000 MW Madras project, with Basicorp and GVK for the
Krishnapattam project in Andhra Pradesh, with the Birla Powergen
combine for the Bena project in Madhya Pradesh and with Eisenberg of
Israel for the Yamunanagar project in Haryana. ABB is looking at a 5-20
per cent stake in all these projects. Incidentally ABB already has a 20
per cent stake in the 500 MW Pench project in Madhya Pradesh (Soros
Funds holds the other 80 per cent) and 5 per cent in the 235 MW
Jegurupada project. It will also be picking up a stake in the 250 MW
neyveli project.

HOTELS:  MS SHOES LOSES HOTEL SITE

Following his arrest after charges of price rigging prior to the public
issue of MS Shoes, the woes of promoter Pavan Sachdeva have been
multiplying. In his latest setback, he has been unable to retain the
four-star hotel and shopping complex site in New Delhi. The public
issue was raising money for its development. MS Shoes failed to pay
Rs130m of the Rs481m second instalment (including interest) by the
deadline of December 31. Hudco, which had sold him the land in the
first place, will now put it up for retendering as there is no
provision for offering the site to the second highest bidder in case of
default by the highest bidder.

This is not the first time that the beleaguered Sachdeva has failed to
meet his payment schedules. The second instalment was actually due on
April 30, 1995. But Sachdeva had moved the Delhi high court and
obtained a stay. The court had ordered MS Shoes to make the payment of
Rs415m (plus interest at 24 per cent) by December 31. Now that MS Shoes
has defaulted a second time, the stay stands automatically vacated.

HOTELS:  HOTEL LEELAVENTURE PULLS OUT OF HOTEL PROJECT

Hotel Leelaventure has backed out of the project to develop the Bombay
Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (BMRDA) hotel-cum-
convention centre in the Bandra-Kurla complex. Leela, which had won the
project with a bid of Rs11,330m, failed to make its initial payment
because of a technical hitch. Though the finance for the project had
been tied up, a consortium of financial institutions led by the
Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) refused to release funds
as BMRDA was unwilling to lease the land. While the institutions wanted
an immediate lease, BMRDA maintained that the land would be licensed to
Leela for the first three years and leased thereafter. This had been
specified in the tender offer and BMRDA was unwilling to change any of
the terms at the last moment. The tender had been a hotly contested one
with several multinationals tying up with Indian companies to submit
their bids. BMRDA will now float the tender again as some of the
combines which had submitted bids have since been wound up. However,
with land prices having dropped 15-20 per cent, it is likely to end up
the loser.

the daily newspaper. This is not Mallya's first foray in this sector.
But his earlier venture with a business magazine styled Business Update
proved abortive. The UB group is also entering the electronic media. A

This apart, UB has also acquired the Madras-based TV channel Golden

PRESIDENT'S RULE IMPOSED IN UTTAR PRADESH

In the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, no political party has secured a 
majority, which has resulted in president's rule in the state.  The National 
Conference has been elected to power in Jammu & Kashmir, while in Gujarat, the 
Mahagujarat Janata Party has assumed power.  Former Prime Minister Narsimha 
Rao continues to be involved in legal problems and has been accused in three 
different cases.

The assembly elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh have resulted in a hung
assembly with no political party securing a majority.  The governor has
imposed president's rule in the state.  Even though the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) has secured the highest number of seats, it falls short of a majority.
Both the Congress-Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party-United Front
alliances, in an attempt to keep the BJP from assuming power, have been unable
to arrive at a political understanding.

The National Conference (NC) has been elected to power in the assembly 
elections in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.  The NC, which had an electoral 
alliance with the Janata Dal, secured a decisive two-thirds majority.  The new 
Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah has been sworn in and will head the first 
popular government in the state after seven years of political turmoil.

The Mahagujarat Janata Party (MJP) has assumed power in the state of Gujarat
ending 35 days of President's rule.  Shankersinh Vaghela has been elected the
new Chief Minister of the state.  Earlier, Vaghela had broken away from the
state unit of the BJP which resulted in a split in the party and the dismissal
of the BJP government in Gujarat.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has charged former Prime Minister
Narsimha Rao, for his involvement in a bribery case.  A Delhi court has issued
a non-bailable warrant against Rao for his role in a forgery case.  In a third
case involving cheating, Rao will have to appear before court on November 6.

OUTLOOK

The conflict of interest between the Congress Party and the United Front
government, dissent amongst the constituents of the UF government over the
issue of supporting a Congress-BSP government in the state of Uttar Pradesh
and the likelihood of former Congress Party members rejoining the party,
suggests the possibility of the Congress Party withdrawing support from the UF
government.

of fiscal 1997.  The policy measures are expected to increase the money supply
in the economy.  The growth rate of industrial production in April-June 1996
was lower than during the same period in the previous year.

The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), C.  Rangarajan has announced
the monetary policy for the second half of 1996-97.  The measures are expected
to increase the money supply in the Indian economy by approximately $4.3
billion.  The RBI will reduce the cash reserve ratio by 2 percentage points.
It will increase the target for export credit as a percentage of a bank's net
credit from 10% to 12% and reduce the maximum permissible interest rates for
deposits with a maturity of 30 days and upto 1 year from 11% to 10%.  In
addition, banks have been allowed to lend their foreign currency non-resident
(bank) deposits in foreign currency-denominated loans to corporations.  The
foreign exchange risk is to be borne by the borrowers.  The RBI has also
imposed a cap of 15% interest on all post-shipment rupee export credits for a
period of 90 days to 180 days.

Industrial production of 172 industries, which account for a weight of 88% in
the overall index of industrial production, registered a growth of 9.9% during
April-June 1996, compared to the same period in 1995.  This is lower than the
15.5% growth recorded in April-June 1995.  The manufacturing, mining and
electric sectors recorded a deceleration in growth in April-June 1996,
compared to the same period in 1995.  Basic goods grew by only 2% compared to
13% during the previous year.  Growth in capital goods remained at 21.1%
during April-June 1996, intermediate goods grew to 13.2% from 3.9%, consumer
durables grew by 21.1% and consumer non-durables grew by 12.2% from the same
period in 1995.

The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) is likely to revise the overall
growth rate of the Indian economy from 7%, stated in the Economic Survey
update, to about 6.3% for 1995-96.  This is primarily because of a negative
growth of 3.19% in agricultural production during fiscal 1996.

OUTLOOK

According to sources in UNESCO, infrastructure investment in India is likely
to rise from the current level of $17 billion a year to about $30 billion by
fiscal 2001.  It is estimated that the total infrastructure investment
requirement over the next 5 years will be between $115 billion and $130
billion.

NEW GUIDELINES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT ANNOUNCED


The government has announced new guidelines for foreign investment into India. 
Foreign companies will be allowed to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the 
consumer goods sector but will have to dilute their equity within a stipulated 
period. Policies on mutual funds and the privatization of coal-bed methane have
been further liberalized.

The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has stated that it will allow
foreign companies to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the consumer goods
sector.  However, these companies will have to dilute their equity and
increase the domestic equity base within a stipulated period of time.  This
divestment policy does not extend to wholly-owned subsidiaries which have
already received government approval or to those firms which have invested in
areas where technology is not locally available.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has announced a new policy for the
privatization of coal-bed methane (CBM).  The CBM projects will be taken out
of the purview of the FIPB and will be subject to international bidding with
production-sharing contracts, similar to the policy on oil and gas
exploration.  This will affect the Reliance-Texaco proposal currently pending
approval from the FIPB.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has announced that mutual
funds will get automatic clearance to launch new funds if the regulatory body
does not raise any query within 21 days of filing of offer documents.
However, fund managers will have to abide by the prevalent SEBI guidelines,
including portfolio disclosures, monthly trading reports and transactions.

The FIPB will not clear wholly-owned marketing subsidiaries in the drugs and
pharmaceuticals sector.  The only exception will be if the subsidiary
manufactures bulk drugs from the basic drug stage.

OUTLOOK

The government will announce detailed guidelines and further amendments to the
National Highway Act of 1956 during the first week of November.  Regulatory
powers are expected to be vested with the National Highways Authority of
India.

BASIC SERVICE PROVIDERS ACCEPT LETTER OF INTENT


Basic services providers, except Basic Teleservices, a joint venture between
RPG and NTT, have accepted the Letter of Intent (LOI) for operating basic
services.  As a result, Communications Minister Beni Prasad Verma has
cancelled the licence earlier awarded to Basic Teleservices and the company
will have to forfeit $14.3 million that it submitted to the Department of
Telecommunication (DoT) in the form of bank guarantees.  The deadline for
accepting the LOI and paying the licence fee was October 18, 1996.
Consortiums that did not pay the licence fees by the deadline will now be
required to pay the licence fees plus a penalty of an additional 5% above the
prime lending rate of the State Bank of India, until licence fees are paid.


Two million government employees, including approximately one million telecom,
postal and telegraph workers had gone on a nationwide strike, demanding the
government remove the eligibility ceiling for payment of bonus.  The strike,
which had paralyzed the functioning of the telecom department for a week, was
called off after the government conceded to their demands.

GOVT APPROVES COGENTRIX COUNTER-GUARANTEES 


The United Front government has approved counter-guarantees for the
Cogentrix-led Mangalore Power Company (MPC).  Cogentrix expects to obtain
financial closure within 5 months.  The government has stated that Cogentrix,
which owns a 60% stake in the 1000MW thermal project, will not be allowed to
dilute its stake below 33%.  China Light & Power owns the remaining 40%
equity.  MPC has offered Karnataka State Electricity Board 40% of the total
equity in the company.  The counter-guarantees will cover capacity and energy
charge payments for the project in the event that State Electricity Boards
(SEB) default or are unable to make payments on time.

The United Front government will grant autonomy to state governments for
approval of power projects.  The government will abolish the mandatory
clearance required from the Central Electricity Authority; state governments
will be required to set up independent regulatory authorities to address
tariff-related issues.  State governments will also be empowered to give
environmental and forest clearances.

GE'S INDIA BUSINESS STRATEGY


Scott Bayman of GE India, outlines the firm's India business strategy.

Prior to the start of liberalization GE chairman and CEO Jack Welch visited
India and liked what he experienced.  After some intensive study, GE declared
India a priority country and began a period of investing.

At a time when many companies maintained the conventional view of India -- a
country overpopulated, poor and bureaucratic; GE took a more optimistic
position.  We saw India as a country of almost 1 billion new consumers for our
products and services.  A country of very talented entrepreneurs and capable
industrialists with a highly educated, technical work force.  And a country
where English is the most common language.

We set out on a strategy of forming alliances with a common purpose.  We saw
India as the heart of a fourth pole offering profitable sales growth.  We
wanted synergistic partners for flow businesses like lighting, plastics and
appliances.  By establishing our flow businesses and broadening our role, we
hoped to leverage this expanded presence to help our project businesses such
as power generation and aircraft engines.  We wanted number one or number two
positions, or a clear plan to get there ...  taking advantage of synergies
with our businesses outside India.

We moved quickly and formed four new operating joint ventures; two green
fields; and two using existing facilities.  These alliances combined GE
Plastics with IPCL; GE Medical Systems with Wipro; GE Appliances with Godrej &
Boyce and GE Lighting with Apar.

In late 1993, GE Capital received permission for a 100% wholly owned holding
company.  Using this as a platform, we formed a joint venture with HDFC called
Countrywide Consumer Financial Services which provided personal financing to
the hundreds of thousands of Indian consumers purchasing TV's, stereos,
appliances and other consumer durables.  Countrywide in turn, is forming joint
ventures with companies like Maruti to offer private label financing.  GE
Capital India also offers a range of services including equipment leasing and
financing, working capital loans, export finance, project finance and
strategic investment.  It is also involved with GE Power systems in the
development of independent power plants and other infrastructure projects.

From this beginning, we have added joint ventures in motors, medical systems
and information services.  Earlier this year, we began a 100 per cent owned
silicones business.  In addition, we are forming joint ventures to provide
services, overhaul and repair for the industrial and power generation
aftermarket.

Our big ticket items such as locomotives, aircraft engines, gas and steam
turbines and aero derivative engines are supported through licenses such as
BHEL and liaison offices.

As you can see, GE does not follow a standard, one dimensional approach.  We
like partners and have a large number of joint ventures around the world.
Whether or not a specific business is a joint venture of wholly owned
subsidiary, is driven by the local market, the availability of strong,
potential partners and local regulations.

Our country priorities for India are clear.  The top priority for each
business is to strengthen its growth strategies to widen leads over
competitors or to gain the number one share position.  Part of our plan is to
look back to what GE did to build its global positions, and bring these
lessons to India.

Our strategy in India is and has been to choose strong partners each of whom
bring value to the venture.  This value add may be in the form of strong brand
and distribution; or management talent and people resources; or existing
manufacturing capabilities in more mature industries; or the know how to build
factories and develop markets for newer industries.  Most important, our
partners share our values; our passion for growth and each has the highest
integrity.  These added values we look for from our partners are far more
important to us than investment dollars.

Ownership structures may change over time for a variety of reasons including
one or the other partner not wishing to continue to invest in the business, or
wishing to divest in order to invest in other more strategic opportunities.

Our strategy is to continue to staff our businesses with Indians.  Currently,
all but one of our businesses is led by either a local national or a
Nonresident Indian.  GE expatriates are here for their expertise and unique
knowledge of GE's products, services or management practices.  We anticipate
the number of expats will decrease over time.

Some of our businesses are fortunate to have joined hands with strong local
brands.  It is our strong desire to grow these brands while introducing the GE
brand for incremental sales, often in different market segments or with
different product positioning.

We are bringing the latest technologies and products to India such as ribbon
processing to lighting, compounding process for our world leading Lexan
plastic and the latest GE Profile refrigerators and washing machines designed
for international standards and climates.  Wipro-GE Medical Systems in
Bangalore had the exclusive design responsibility and is the supplier for all
global requirements for our latest ultra sound diagnostic product.

Our strategy is to bring GE's management know-how to India.  We hold two best 
practices sharing sessions each year with all the businesses where we exchange 
ideas and lessons and importantly, talk about how to adapt these to the Indian 
Market.  Our partners frequently send teams from their other businesses to 
participate.

A big focus of our cross business synergy is people development.  In 1995, we
trained over 900 managers, and this year, we will exceed 1000.  The courses
are the same as those developed and taught at Crotonville, our management
development center in the U.S.  Again, our partners' other businesses
frequently participate.

We have implemented GE's early leadership development programs for technical,
finance, information management and human resource specialists.  These
programs are available to all the businesses in India, and we currently have
124 participants.

CAMEROON-ENVIRONMENT:  FACING UP TO THE EUCALYPTUS MENACE

By Tansa Musa
   NKAMBE, Cameroon, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- The view from the third floor
of the Central Hotel in this small town tucked away in Cameroon's
North West Province is dominated by dense forests occasionally
broken by rooftops.
   It looks good, especially in a country which has been losing its
tree cover at an annual rate of about 0.6 per cent.
   But province officials are worried. The trees around Nkambe and
other areas in the northwest are eucalyptus, noted for the large
amounts of water they absorb.
   "We are dealing with an unnoticed crisis," says Raphael Kongor,
an environmental officer in Nkambe. "People have been growing
eucalyptus without regard for their water and food needs. Today we
are having unusually harsh dry seasons because the eucalyptus trees
are draining our waterways."
   Area residents confirm that water is becoming increasingly
scarce here. "Our streams are now dry most of the year and our
women and children have to travel long distances in search of
water," says Chona Patrick, a farmer in Nkambe. "And they also have
to go far, sometimes 15 to 20 kilometers away, to find fertile
farmland."
   Eucalyptus was first introduced in the hilly grasslands of the
North West Province by colonial administrators to meet their wood
and fuel needs and protect their homes from windstorms during the
rainy season. Local villagers followed suit.
   Since independence, Cameroon's government has encouraged the
regulated growth of eucalyptus, according to Nelson Chomba, a
forestry technician with the National Office for the Development
of Forests.
   "We encourage the planting of eucalyptus on barren, marginal
land, usually hilltops, far away from water catchment areas and the
sources of streams," Chomba told IPS. "We recommend that farmers
plant the trees at least 50 to 100 meters away from such areas."
   But it has proved hard to limit the planting of eucalyptus.
   Unlike coffee, the main cash crop in the area, growing
eucalyptus requires little labor and few supplies. "Plant it even
on rocky soil and it grows," says Kongor. "All you need to do is
clear a tract around the plantation to protect it from dry-season
brush fires."
   Moreover, it has a variety of uses. The branches make good
fuelwood. Mix the dried leaves with lime juice and you have a cheap
cough mixture, while the trees themselves act as windbreaks and can
also be used to mark the boundaries of farms.
   More importantly, however, there is money in eucalyptus. Its
wood can be sold and, with the prices of traditional cash crops
like coffee and cocoa fluctuating on the world market, there is
hardly a family in the districts of Donga-Mantung division, which
includes Nkambe and neighboring Bui, that does not have a
eucalyptus plantation or at least a few trees.
   It has also spread southwards to the Western province and is
gaining ground in the drier northern provinces of Adamawa and the
north, especially since there is quick cash to be made by selling
eucalyptus poles to the national electricity corporation, SONEL,
and the local telephone utility.
   "Every year I make about 100,000 CFA francs (about $220) from
selling poles to SONEL alone,"says Chona. "I've been producing
coffee for a long time but I don't get so much money from that."
   Patrick Bui, a farmer in Bui district, vows that nothing will
stop him from growing eucalyptus. "Look," he says, pointing to
bundles of firewood stacked along the main highway. "Do you know
how much I make every day from these?"
   "This gives me about 1,500 to 2,000 CFA francs (between $3.30
and $4.40) every day, which I use to pay the fees for my three
children in secondary school, buy (cooking) oil, soap and other
things for my family and to contribute to my 'njangui' (informal
savings and loan cooperative)."
   But the cost to the environment is high, says Kongor, who
explains that the eucalyptus has roots that go deep into the soil
to find water, which is why it should be grown on dry marginal
land.
   "Though the plant can help raise the water level, its
destructive nature cannot be overlooked," he adds. "It drains the
soil of valuable nutrients and water that other plants and crops
need to grow."
   However, "It would be useless to call on farmers not to plant
eucalyptus trees, considering the importance of such a plant
species in non-forest areas," says Kongor.
   "Our only weapon is to educate the farmers about proper forestry
techniques and the need to diversify economic activity to other
productive areas, like bee-farming."

LATIN AMERICA-HUMAN RIGHTS:  STILL PENDING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

By Daniel Gatti
   MONTEVIDEO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- "Your children are here, what pride
you must feel," exclaimed Hebe de Bonafini, leader of the
Argentinean Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, speaking in the name of
the thousands who disappeared during the military dictatorship of
1976-83.
   For the first time in years, the annual Resistance March
organized by the group on Dec. 7 filled the central Plaza de Mayo
to capacity.
   "Three generations marched together," read the headline in
Argentinean daily Pagina 12 the following day, as grandmothers,
mothers and the children of the disappeared marched together.
   "We children are here," declared a young member of Children for
Identity and Justice against Oblivion and Silence (HIJOS).
   "For years they wanted us to be nobody's children. Today we are
fighters. Our parents march with us," he added.
   "Two decades later, the wound opened by the military
dictatorship and its atrocities is still open, and the question has
not been resolved," said one protester.
   Official and unofficial estimates state that between nine and
thirty thousand people disappeared under the military dictatorship
that began with Lt. Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla.
   Human rights issues were front and center in Argentina in 1995,
with one leading army officer, Martin Balza, admitting his guilt
and distancing himself from the abuses of the military regime.
Balza's gesture was preceded by confessions from several members
of army personnel involved in the violations, and was followed by
more gentle "mea culpas" from the navy and air force leaders.
   The human rights issue also resurfaced in Chile, Brazil,
Uruguay, Central America and Colombia.
   In Chile, the ghost of the dictatorship reared its ugly head
once more as the issue of army power returned to the fore.
   The public also followed the progress of the case of Gen. Manuel
Contreras and a parliamentary proposal to suspend the prosecution
of 600 military officers accused of assassinations, abductions and
torture during the 1973 to 1990 period.
   In May, General Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinosa were
found guilty of masterminding the murder of former Chilean foreign
minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, in 1976.
   This verdict led Chilean human rights organizations to believe
the end of military impunity might be in sight, but when it took
three months to get Contreras into prison it became clear that the
armed forces still held great sway.
   Former dictator Augusto Pinochet is currently Chilean military
Chief of Staff.
   Suspicions were further confirmed when a parliamentary proposal
suggested putting a "full stop" to the prosecution of army
personnel accused of human rights offenses, and the Senate voted
earlier this month not to release information on the disappearances
and killings.
   Brazil also saw a resurfacing of human rights cases from the
sixties and seventies, and the current sitaton there earned the
nation the title "the nation of impunity."
   Around mid-year, Fernando Cardoso's government approved
compensation payments to the families of the dozens of people who
disappeared under the dictatorship of 1964-85. Most of these cases
were never investigated and no one was ever punished.
   Meanwhile, the group Human Rights Watch criticized the nation,
saying that the climate of impunity was encouraging the Military
Police and other security forces to commit "systematic breaches of
human rights."
   The group condemned the possible executions of dozens of common
criminals, militant rural workers and street children, especially
in cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and areas with land
use and ownership disputes.
   "This country has a culture of impunity which it has dragged
along for decades, which feeds on the worsening social inequalities
which lead the most powerful to use soldiers and the police against
the 'dangerous classes'," said one member of the Landless Movement.
   This same "culture" is alive and well in Central America, where
the dictatorships are disappearing within a generalized situation
of civil violence. A report from the Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights in Central America (CODEHUCA) condemned the resurgence
of death squads who target either their political opponents or
"common criminals."
   The situation which permits the incalculable number of
extra-judicial executions and the impunity of the murderers wears
away at the official legal system and corrupts the political
structure the report said.
   It said that the increasing regional crime rate feeds on
poverty, unemployment, and the fact that thousands of civilians
still possess their weapons, often from when they fought in the
civil wars.
   CODEHUCA calculated that there were around two million firearms
loose in Honduras, 300,000 in El Salvador and 250,000 in Guatemala,
concluding that the isthmus nations "are sitting on a social time
bomb without knowing when or how it's going to explode."

MOZAMBIQUE-ECONOMY:  POLITICIANS FIRE AWAY AT BRETTON WOODS

By Gustavo Mavie
   MAPUTO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- Mozambique's politicians, divided for
decades by ideological differences and war, have now united against
economic policies they blame for increasing poverty in one of the
world's poorest nations.
   "The (International Monetary Fund) IMF and the World Bank are
not interested in the economic development of Mozambique," charges
Antonio Palange of the opposition Democratic Union (UD), one of
three parties that won parliamentary seats in the country's first
ever multiparty elections, held in October 1994.
   Palange recently joined other parliamentarians from the UD, the
Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO, the largest opposition
group), and the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
(FRELIMO) in lashing out at the government's "marriage" to the
Bretton Wood institutions "at the expense of the Mozambican
people."
   This development is astonishing since Renamo has traditionally
been considered an ally of the West and FRELIMO was once avowedly
Marxist.
   Hoping to keep afloat an economy battered by prolonged civil war
and a socialist experiment that kicked off with the end of
Portuguese rule in 1975, FRELIMO opted for a market economy in 1987
at the behest of the international finance houses.
   But instead of recovery and prosperity, the structural
adjustment program (SAP) has brought most Mozambicans only more
misery, critics note. Even the government is uneasy about some
recommendations of the Bretton Woods pair, such as selling state
companies to curb government spending.
   Most of the 500 parastatals sold so far have passed into foreign
hands as few locals have the capital to purchase them, a fact which
has convinced many here that privatization threatens national
sovereignty.
   The IMF and World Bank are urging a reluctant government to sell
off the national carrier, LAM, the water and electricity companies,
the national railways and ports, customs and the post and
telecommunications' utility.
   But the government considers these enterprises of strategic
importance and prefers to turn them into financially autonomous
public companies with private management.
   In the meantime, the tariffs these utilities charge have soared,
especially for energy. In state housing projects, for example,
monthly electricity bills are more than 100 times as high as
rentals.
   Many here wonder exactly whom the policies touted by the Bretton
Woods institutions are aimed at helping, and not just because of
their social cost.
   When Trade and Industry Minister Oldeniro Baloi announced that
the World Bank had threatened to cut off funding unless Mozambique
exported its cashew nuts unprocessed, this was perceived here as
a bid to smash the many well-equipped factories that process the
nuts, Mozambique's second largest export after prawns.
   "There's no doubt that it's the wrong strategy to
de-industrialize Mozambique in exchange for a fistful of dollars,"
says Teodata Hunguana, a FRELIMO deputy who has held various
ministerial posts. He believes selling its few products cheaply is
a luxury Mozambique can ill afford.
   The IMF is "the new ministry of colonies," quipped fellow
FRELIMO deputy Sergio Vieira, also a former cabinet minister. "Let
the IMF keep its money. We should develop and modernize our
agriculture and protect our industry."
   Fruits of the program remain so elusive that it has been
extended five years beyond its original duration of three years,
leaving most people here with their "belts tightened right to the
bone," notes Carlos Cardoso, the outspoken editor of Mediafax, an
independent daily.
   Perhaps the bitterest pill for the 16 million inhabitants of
this southern African state is the dramatic fall in their money's
buying power, while prices and inflation gallop out of control.
   In the last eight years, the value of the national currency, the
metical, has plunged dramatically. In 1987, one U.S. dollar was
equivalent to 40 meticais at the official exchange rate and forty
times more on the black market. Today it is worth 10,826 meticais
officially and 11,500 on the black market.
   Unemployment is rife but those with jobs are scarcely better off
than the jobless. Many earn little more than the $20 monthly
minimum wage, which is barely more than half the $34 needed to buy
a 50 kilogram bag of rice, a staple here.
   At least 70 per cent of Mozambicans live below the poverty line,
yet for years the government kept the minimum wage at 78,000
meticais (seven U.S. dollars) in keeping with a wage freeze
recommended by the Bretton Woods institutions. It only raised it
three months ago after trade unions threatened a general strike.
   The pay hike infuriated IMF representative Sergio Leite who
slammed it as "completely unrealistic" and "inopportune." Leite
attacked waste by the government and warned at a press conference
that "we are going to order more cuts in government expenditure."
   Stung by what they deemed Leite's arrogance and disrespect for
their country's sovereignty, local newspapers said he had insulted
Mozambique's workers and wondered how much he earned at the IMF.
   Palange slammed "constant interference in Mozambique's economic
development by the World Bank" and urged the government to end its
"dependence on the IMF" as other African states have done after
realizing that its programs "do more harm than good to their
economies and social fabric."
   Later, another IMF official said it was up to individual
governments to fix minimum wages, but few here were placated.
   While critics call for a more independent stance by the
government, Planning and Finance Minister Tomas Salomao said
recently in parliament that it would be suicidal for Mozambique to
cut ties with its backers. The Paris Club injected $1 billion into
the country in 1995 and foreign aid accounts or around half of the
1996 budget, which totals slightly more than $605 million.
   Of the 1996 budget, $316 million will go towards rehabilitating
infrastructure destroyed during the civil war (1975-1992).
Recurrent costs should swallow up $287 million.
   The government's dependence on aid could be reduced if it
tightened up on illegal exports, which rob the treasury of millions
of dollars and in which many state officials are allegedly
involved.
   Official statistics show that between January and September,
$600 million was spent on imports and only $126 million worth of
goods were exported. But according to investigations by Mediafax,
illegal exports topped $800 million, most of which was banked
abroad.
   Salomao maintains that IMF's programs appear to be fruitless
only because "they are difficult to put into practice," but critics
insist that government members have been adhering to these programs
rather than slash their own salaries and other benefits derived
from co-operation with the finance houses.
   Neither the IMF's threats nor public disgruntlement have stemmed
the largely unchecked corruption and opulent lifestyles of those
in power and their associates. Almost all present and former
members of government hold shares in privatized companies and new
ones that are being set up. Many have built luxury houses in posh
city neighborhoods in addition to country houses to which they
retreat on weekends and holidays.
   Pajeros, Mercedes Benz, BMWs and other luxury vehicles litter
the streets, and yet "machibombas," minibuses on which the public
relies for transport, are scarce.
   Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi says an independent authority is
to be set up to combat corruption, but most people here feel this
is empty talk.

PALESTINE-HUMAN RIGHTS:  EDITOR JAILED FOR DEFYING ARAFAT'S WISH

By Deborah Horan
   JERUSALEM, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- The release of a Palestinian
newspaper editor detained for six days after failing to prominently
display a flattering article about Yasser Arafat has not eased
fears of a further clampdown on freedom of speech in liberated
Palestine.
   Maher al-Alameh, night editor of the Jerusalem-based Arabic
daily al-Quds, was freed yesterday after a week under interrogation
in the Palestinian self-rule enclave of Jericho. He had been
detained Dec. 25 by the Palestinian Preventive Security (PPS).
   His crime was failing to give enough prominence to flattering
comments about Arafat made by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of
Jerusalem. The Patriarch, greeting Arafat in Bethlehem on Christmas
Eve, had compared him to the revered second Caliph of Islam, Omar
bin el-Khatab, who captured Jerusalem in AD 638.
   All Palestinian newspapers received orders from Arafat's advisor
Nabil Abu Rudeineh to emphasize the Patriarch's comments on their
front page. When al-Alameh put it on page 8 instead he was summoned
to Jericho and detained.
   After a week in detention, during which time al-Alameh, 50, says
he was treated well, he was taken to Ramallah to meet Arafat
yesterday morning. "He (Arafat) asked me why I did not put the news
(on page one) concerning the Patriarch and the description of
Arafat as Caliph Omar," al-Alameh told IPS.
   Al-Alameh said he told Arafat that the reason was purely
practical. Eight per cent of the front page was election
advertising and the rest -- "four columns and a color picture" --
was all about Arafat and the full text of his speech in Bethlehem.
   "I didn't mean to hurt his feelings. It was only because I
didn't have space," he said. "We can't publish all the news of
Arafat on the front page. He (Arafat) was very polite. He said 'I'm
sorry' and kissed my head. He said, 'I don't like to arrest any of
my brothers.'"
   But the detention was seen as another serious blow to press
freedom under Arafat. Members of the Paris-based media rights NGO
Reporters Without Borders tried to visit al-Alameh in Jericho but
were refused entry on the orders of PPS head Jibril Rajoub.
   "I don't think it is a crime. It is a very, very silly pretext
to arrest a person and the timing is very, very bad," said al-
Alameh. "It comes on the eve of elections and of our claim we are
building a democratic entity."
   "They must respect human rights," said Bassem Eid, the
Palestinian representative of Reporters Without Borders. "The PPS
cannot go around kidnapping people."
   "If you don't respect the freedom of the press," added
al-Alameh, "how can you build a democracy?" Arafat officials
declined to comment; Rajoub would merely confirm to IPS that
al-Alameh had been released.
   Arafat has been making an effort to improve his troubled
relations with the Palestinian Christian community and to reassure
wary Christians that they are welcome to stay under the newly
emerging Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza.
   To further his initiative, Arafat asked all Arabic newspapers
in Palestine to prominently display the comments of the Patriarch
as evidence of the sympathy and support he was getting from
Christian leaders.
   Al-Quds, published in east Jerusalem, is the largest Arabic
daily and has a circulation of 25,000. Its circulation in the West
Bank has been stopped several times in the past after it published
articles critical of the Palestinian Authority's activities.
   In August 1994, Arafat ordered the daily an-Nahar closed after
it ran a story entitled "I Am A Jordanian From Hebron" at a time
when the Authority was experiencing strained relations with the
Hashemite Kingdom over the role each will play in Jerusalem.
   Last May, Arafat closed down the opposition Hamas newspaper
al-Watan for three months and jailed its editor for two years for
printing material that "harmed national unity." A recent press law
enacted by Arafat makes it a crime to print anything determined to
be damaging to "the national cause."
   "The Palestinian Authority maintains that if you are criticizing
them, you are harming 'national unity,'" said Eid, who is opposed
to the press law. "All we can hope for is that public opinion will
force them to change the policies."
   "He (Arafat) doesn't have the right (to arrest members of the
press)," said al-Alameh, "but...we are a non-democratic system so
he has the ability to order the newspapers to print whatever he
wants them to because they are afraid of action from Arafat. All
of them are in a cycle of fear."
   On several occasions, newspapers have been prevented from
distributing in Gaza after printing articles perceived as
unfavorable to Arafat or the Palestinian Authority. Security men
have also visited an-Nahar and allegedly threatened staff.
   The Palestinian Authority has also been criticized by human
rights organizations for arresting prominent figures in Gaza for
speaking out against government measures that have curbed speech.
   Nine months ago, prominent Palestinian human rights activist
Raji Sourani was arrested for producing a document that criticized
the government's handling of human rights issues.
   Earlier this month, Gaza psychiatrist and leading local activist
Eyad Sarraj was arrested in connection with criticisms of the
Authority's human rights policies made in an address to an
international seminar on journalists and the peace process
organized by Inter Press Service under the European Union's
PeaceMedia program. The seminar had also been addressed by senior
Palestinian Authority officials and the editor of al-Watan.
   Like al-Alameh, Sarraj was not formally arrested but was
"invited" to go for "discussions" with security officials. The
discussions turned into de facto detention.
   "I was treated very well. It was not under the conditions of a
prison," said al-Alameh, who was worried enough about the summons
from Rajoub to take a foreign journalist with him when he went.
   "I was treated respectfully, kindly -- maybe because they knew
I am famous and the international media covered my story. I think
this had pressure on them." But he was sure that had he refused the
summons he would have been forcibly taken. "I was threatened that
if I didn't go on my own they would kidnap me and put me in a car
or they would tear me to pieces."
   The article was politically sensitive for Arafat as it came on
the heels of a Catholic conference that focused on the state of
Christians in the Holy Land and amid accusations from several
Christian groups that their communities are afraid to stay in the
West Bank once it comes completely under Palestinian self-rule.
   To counter these claims, which the Palestinian Authority
dismisses as propaganda propagated by pro-Israeli or pro-Zionist
Christian groups, Arafat has been sprinkling his speeches with
comments aimed at making the Christian community feel more at ease.
   He attended the Christian mass at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born, and has
set a quota for Christian candidates running for seats in the
Palestinian Council (parliament), to ensure they are represented.
   Arafat's wife, Suha, a Greek Orthodox Palestinian Christian who
converted to Islam to marry her husband in 1990, has also been
making an effort to quell Christians' perceived fears.
   She visited the Church of the Nativity two days before Christmas
and had their five-month-old baby girl blessed. Christians, who
make up about three per cent of the population of the West Bank,
steadily left during the seven-year uprising against Israeli rule
in search of better living conditions -- as did many Muslims.
   But since the Oslo accord establishing Palestinian self-rule was
signed two years ago, some 40 prominent Bethlehem Christian
families have chosen to leave, increasing the feeling that they do
not feel welcome under the Palestinian Authority.
   Many Christians who left earlier, however, have said they plan
to return once the Palestinian enclaves attain full independence
from Israel.
   For Palestinians the most acute problem is the forthcoming
elections on Jan. 20. The view here is that even if serious
campaigns are mounted against Arafat's candidacy, Arafat's control
of the media will deny them equal space.
   In the longer term the media controls are undermining the
democratic system here, says al-Alameh.
   "We haven't freedom of the press. We do not have the press which
forced (President Richard) Nixon to resign. We do not have the
press which forced (then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak) Rabin to
resign." Rabin resigned after journalists uncovered the fact that
his wife had a then illegal foreign bank account.
   "We haven't the press to make the Authority afraid of it. We
have an Authority that makes the press afraid. It's a disaster.
It's a catastrophe."

CHILE:  GDP GROWTH BEATS INFLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME

By Gustavo Gonzalez
   SANTIAGO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- Among Chile's economic achievements
in 1995, a rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth that
exceeded the rate of inflation is a particular source of pride for
Treasury Minister Eduardo Aninat.
   The Chilean GDP grew 8.2 per cent -- 8.3 per cent over the 1994
level to $62 billion, while the consumer price index (CPI) grew by
an estimated 8.1 per cent or a maximum of 8.2 per cent.
   This is the first time since Chilean statistical records have
been kept that GDP grew as much or more than the CPI under
conditions of economic expansion and low inflation.
   The 1995 growth in production "means that production has almost
doubled over the past 10 years," a satisfied Aninat told
journalists as he presented economic data for the year on Dec. 28.
   "Chile is included among the ten emerging economies with the
best records in the world this year," the minister added, and
pointed out that investment amounted to 26 per cent of GDP.
   Aninat's briefing ratified the findings of an Economic
Commission for Latin America (ECLA) report released last week that
listed Chile as the region's best growth performer in 1995.
   ECLA and other international organizations attribute the Chilean
success to a combination of fiscal discipline, incentives for
domestic saving and foreign investment, and protection against
short-term capital flows.
   The Chilean stock market experienced only "a slight dizziness"
in the first trimester of 1995 as a result of the so-called
"tequila effect" that originated in Mexico's financial crisis and
hit other countries hard, especially Argentina.
   Chilean foreign investment is concentrated in production
activities, mostly in the mining sector, and the country is host
to relatively little of the short-term or "volatile" capital whose
flight precipitated the Mexican and Argentinean crises.
   It is true that Chile's strong economic performance this year
was aided by good international market prices for the country's
principal exports, including copper, fish meal, and cellulose.
   But this doesn't take credit away from Chile because prices rose
this year for almost all major Latin American exports, with the
exception of soybeans and beef.
   Although it confronts the same problems of inequality and
inequity as does the rest of the region, Chile can also claim a
real increase in GDP per capita, which Aninat says is between five
and six per cent.
   ECLA reports that Chilean GDP per capita grew 2.4 per cent in
1994 and rose to 6.4 per cent this year, while the rest of Latin
America and the Caribbean suffered a decline in per capita GDP of
1.1 per cent.
   While the regional unemployment rate rose from 6.4 per cent last
year to 7.4 per cent in 1995, Chile succeeded in reducing its rate
from 6.3 per cent to 5.6 per cent, which still remains high
compared to the 4.1 per cent rate in 1993.
   Real wages -- after factoring in inflation -- either fell or
stagnated in almost all of the countries in the region in 1995 but
they rose by 4 per cent in Chile.
   While offering this successful 1995 accounting, Aninat promised
the poorest Chileans that "the economic model will continue
incorporating a high level of equality and equity."
   At the other extreme, the minister displayed the caution typical
of a government reluctant to engage in confrontations with business
by inviting the high-income sectors "to continue contributing to
the country's economic efforts."
   Is Chile's economic success the product of a continuation of
neo-liberal policies inherited from General August Pinochet's
dictatorship (1973-90) or is it the fruit of combining a market
model with social redistribution policies?
   This question continues to be debated, especially by the
Pinochet supporters on the right wing, who insist that the present
government is merely profiting from the military regime's "sowing"
and that business enterprise is to be credited for the economic
growth.
   To measure the reestablished democracy's economic performance,
Aninat presented comparative statistics for the 1991-95 period
derived from ECLA and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
   Chile's average annual GDP growth rate over the period is 7.4
per cent, the highest in Latin America and far above the comparable
figure for the region (2.8 per cent), all developing countries (5.8
per cent) and the rest of the world (2.6 per cent).
   Chile's average annual inflation rate over the period was 12.1
per cent compared to 284.4 per cent for Latin America and 35.4 per
cent for all of the developing world.
   Finally, real wages grew 4.3 per cent in Chile during the five-
year period, while they increased by an average of only 1.9 per
cent in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

MALAYSIA-LABOR:  MIGRANT WORKERS EXPLOITED

By Kalinga Seneviratne
   KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 1 (IPS) -- Malaysia's rapid economic growth
has made it a magnet for migrant workers but exploitation by
employers has dashed many of their hopes of earning a decent
living.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad plans to make Malaysia a fully
developed nation by 2020, and economic expansion has led to a
serious labor shortage which as prompted the country to open its
doors to workers fleeing poverty and unemployment in other parts
of Asia.
   There are now an estimated two million guest workers in this
nation of 19.6 million people. Half of these migrants hold legal
work permits while the rest entered illegally, mainly through
Thailand and Indonesia.
   Indonesians initially dominated the market with cheap labor but
Bangladeshis are now a force to be reckoned with. There are now at
least 200,000 Bangladeshi workers in the country -- more than half
of them working in plantations and factories.
   Malaysia has reached an agreement with Bangladesh to recruit
50,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers -- including nurses and
doctors -- every year.
   Increasing numbers of middle-class Malaysians are employing
domestic helpers mainly from the Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh. Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting has admitted the
immigration department has a backlog of at least 10,000
applications for work permits for foreign maids.
   Unscrupulous employers, however, are exploiting the desperation
of many of the Asian workers fleeing from poverty at home.
Bangladeshis, who come from one of the world's poorest countries
with a per capita income of $180 a year, are the most vulnerable.
   "Recruiting agencies promise them $300 a month if they come to
Malaysia," says welfare worker S. Sinnappan. He says that many
young university graduates, lured by promotional photos and videos,
end up getting only half this amount.
   Most of the Bangladeshi plantation workers with whom Sinnappan
works had been promised jobs as technicians or engineers. They had
never worked in plantations and were not used to the heavy work in
the palm-oil plantations.
   "They paid the agencies as much as 6,000 ringgit (about $2,400)
to come here. Many raised the money by mortgaging their land or
house," he adds.
   G. Rajasekaran, secretary-general of the Malaysian Trade Union
Congress, says they do not object to migrant labor, provided the
government makes sure there are still jobs left for Malaysians.
   The government has drawn up regulations, but enforcement is very
weak, he says. "It has become so chaotic," he observed, "because
recruitment is done through recruiting agents."
   Rajasekaran says such agencies have mushroomed in recent years
because it is an easy way to make big money without any capital
outlay. "You just bring a person here, collect money from the
person who wants to work, and collect money from the company that
wants to employ him."
   He says exploitation happens at both ends and has led to
corruption involving, for example, the forging of work permits and
other documents. He favors government-to-government deals but is
worried that an unregulated labor influx will undermine working
conditions.
   "Despite impressive economic growth rates in the last five
years, wage levels and living standards of Malaysian workers --
especially industrial workers -- have not gone up as much as they
should have," he says, and the flood of foreign workers has
affected the bargaining power of trade unions.
   "If the government didn't allow foreign workers to come in, even
without collective bargaining, wage rates would have gone up
because of supply and demand ," argues Rajasekaran.
   He says that because of the comparatively low wage rates in
Malaysia, as many as 60,000 Malaysians cross the border each day
to work in Singapore, where a factory worker gets about $380 per
month compared with $160 a month for the same job at home.
   A task force on foreign labor has recommended a monthly wage of
$140 but some firms pay only $110. Locals refuse to work for such
wages, and companies use this as an excuse to turn to foreign
workers. The government this month warned it would no longer
tolerate such exploitation.
   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who heads the cabinet's
Committee on Foreign Workers, is concerned about the impact of
foreign workers on employment opportunities for Malaysians.
   "We will not accept foreign workers at the expense of
Malaysians, especially the younger generation, who are entering the
employment market. We want to ensure that priority is given to
Malaysians for all employment opportunities," he said.
   In his 1996 budget Anwar, who is also Minister of Finance,
increased the levy on foreign workers by 100 per cent. He also
announced in August that foreign job seekers can now be recruited
only as domestic helpers or shop assistants.
   P. Arunasalam, secretary-general of the Electrical Industry
Workers Union, urged the government to gradually phase out its
labor-intensive industries and instead train Malaysians to overcome
the shortage of skilled labor suited for high-technology
industries.
   He warns an increase in foreign labor will put more demands on
the government schooling system to take care of the workers'
children. He says many foreign workers have already forced small
traders in Malaysia to give up their trade at night markets.
   "Huge sums of money remitted by the foreign workers to their
respective countries of origin are a big drain on our country's
economy," says Arunasalam. "In 1994 alone, $960 million was sent
out of the country by one million workers."
   Rajasekaram argues that because of the low wage rates cushioned
by foreign labor, many Malaysian women are not encouraged to join
the workforce. He cites an official report last year saying
Malaysia would have 729,000 more workers if more women were
encouraged to work.
   Many Malaysians are now questioning the pace of development in
their country, while others think the problems of illegal migration
and exploitation of foreign labor should be addressed first.

POPULATION:  MEXICAN EMIGRATION UNAFFECTED BY NAFTA

   MEXICO CITY, Jan. 1 (IPS) -- The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), now two-years-old, has not had the expected
spectacular effect on the flow of migrants between Mexico and the
United States, according to demographic experts.
   Manuel Alva Hernandez, a researcher with the Colegio de Mexico,
told IPS that "population movements generally follow very complex
and slowly evolving trends, so that -- except in wartime -- they
don't happen suddenly."
   He noted that NAFTA -- the trading block linking Canada, the
United States and Mexico inaugurated on Jan. 1, 1994 -- has 374
million inhabitants and an annual product of $7 trillion but "only
ratified an existing process of integration."
   Alva Hernandez explained that there already had been a
privatizing trend in Mexico, along with significant productive and
speculative capital investment from the United States and other
countries, and that neither phenomenon had increased dramatically
in the two years the treaty has been in effect.
   Nor is there evidence, despite the economic crisis that has
battered Mexico since December 1994, of a major increase in Mexican
migration to the United States as it is often stimulated by family
or friendship ties along with work incentives, Alva Hernandez
added.
   International migration into Mexico did not play a major role
in the country's demographics during the first half of this
century, nor did large numbers of Mexicans emigrate, although there
was a constant outflow, mostly to the U.S.
   But a large increase in Mexican migration to the U.S. has been
evident in recent decades, especially the last 20 years, although
there has been no significant rise in migration into Mexico.
   Hence, Mexico shows a negative migratory balance sheet with the
outside world and has lost 290,000 inhabitants annually in recent
years. This has reduced its internal population growth rate by an
estimated 0.32 per cent.
   Significant migration to the U.S. began in the middle of the
nineteenth century after the U.S. occupied more than half of what
was then Mexico and rose during the revolutionary period (1910-
1919).
   During these years, about 200,000 Mexicans moved to the border
states of Texas, Arizona and California to work in agriculture, on
railroad lines and, to a lesser extent, in industry.
   The first world war (1914-1918) and the international economic
crisis that broke out in 1929 and lasted through the following
decade diminished the migratory flow, which rose again during the
second world war (1939-1945), when labor was needed to replace
workers enlisted in military service.
   The documented and undocumented migration of Mexicans living in
the United States in 1950, 1960, and 1970 was 630,000, 834,000 and
1,399,000, respectively.
   Beginning in the 1970's, this number rose rapidly. In 1980, it
was over 2,500,00 and it reached 4,500,000 in 1990, a number
equivalent to slightly more than 5.4 per cent of Mexico's census
population that year.
   During this entire period, the relative proportion of urban
migrants, non-agricultural workers and women within the total
population of migrants increased.
   This has changed the old U.S. stereotype of the Mexican migrant
as a poorly educated rural laborer seeking seasonal or temporary
work.
   A major contributor to this demographic change was the Mexican
economic crisis that began in 1980 and has become chronic since
then, with only a partial interruption during the first half of the
present decade.
   A change in the U.S. economy that affected the magnitude and
composition of demand for migratory labor also had an effect.
   Yet another influence was the 1986 reform of U.S. immigration
law, which encouraged some migrants to seek U.S. residence and
provided for the employment of migrants in some production
activities.
   According to some Mexican analysts, including noted
anthropologist Soledad Gonzalez Montes, "the development of
functional social networks that link places of origin with
destinations" played a special role in the new migration.
   This analysis suggests that once the Mexican population in the
United States reached a certain threshold, growing social networks
lowered the costs and risks associated with international migration
and increased the probability that potential migrants would make
the move.
   All of these factors gave the migratory movement a powerful push
even as regional economic development created new departure points
throughout Mexico's territory and increased the number of migrating
women and children.
   The number of entire families and those seeking family
reunification also rose among migrants.
   Gonzalez Montes pointed out "a growing concentration (of
migrants) in the states of California and Texas and in the
metropolitan areas of these and other (U.S.) states."
   Statistics show that the length of stay of Mexican migrants in
the United States has grown and that almost two thirds of those
covered by the 1986 legal residency program had been living in that
country for more than a decade.

U.S.-TRADE:  NAFTA ASSAILED ON SECOND ANNIVERSARY

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- U.S. fans of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are not celebrating.
   Two years after the highly-touted accord between the United
States, Canada, and Mexico, NAFTA has become a political liability
and given ammunition to critics of similar free trade agreements.
   Symptomatic was a cartoon appearing in today's New York Times
which depicted two men in a seedy-looking room in an urban
neighborhood. Across the street a decrepit apartment house is being
consumed by flames. One of the men is seated on a sofa reading a
newspaper's help-wanted classified advertisements. The page is
lined with the logos of fast-food joints like McDonalds and
Wendy's.
   His friend, who has just walked in the door with a bottle of
tequila, shouts, "Good news! Tequila is a dollar cheaper." The
caption below reads "NAFTA finally pays off."
   "Our predictions have proved correct; if anything, the situation
has worsened," declared William Bywater, president of the main U.S.
Electronics Workers' Union (IUE) and one of NAFTA's staunchest foes
on the pact's first anniversary.
   "The collapse of the Mexican economy, the increase in drug
traffic, the flood of illegal immigrants, the loss of jobs in the
U.S., and now the most recent specter of unsafe Mexican trucks on
our highways have proved that we were right (in opposing NAFTA),"
he said.
   He was referring to the latest, and biggest, roadblock in the
implementation of NAFTA, the mid-December decision by the
administration of President Bill Clinton to indefinitely delay the
liberalization of trucking rules that would have permitted U.S. and
Mexican truckers to operate more than 30 kilometers beyond each
others' borders.
   The new rules were to have taken effect this month but pressure
from the powerful Teamsters Union apparently persuaded the
administration to place "greater emphasis on safety and security"
for U.S. roadways. The administration has not yet indicated when
those concerns might be cleared up.
   Citing trade experts, the Washington Post said the decision, the
first major failure of NAFTA's implementation, showed "how eager
the administration is to reduce NAFTA's unpleasant political
fallout, even by circumventing rules of an accord President Clinton
championed."
   But it's not only Clinton's political base that is unhappy.
Pulled by television pundit and presidential hopeful Patrick
Buchanan, Republicans, too, have moved against NAFTA.
   Historically one of the most devoted free trade advocates in a
free trade party, Republican presidential front-runner Sen. Robert
Dole came out three months ago against the consideration of any new
trade pacts this year. With that remark, he effectively buried 45
years of staunch Republican support for any measure that would open
up foreign markets to U.S. goods and investment.
   He also buried the hopes of Caribbean Basin nations of achieving
parity with NAFTA benefits and of Chile for becoming the first
non-North American nation to be admitted to NAFTA this year. Given
the sensitivity of the issue in next year's presidential election,
those hopes are probably dead for next year as well.
   NAFTA supporters say all this is unfair. During its first year,
NAFTA had produced unprecedented gains in two-way trade for both
the United States and Mexico which, after all, was the reason for
its approval.
   The problem, they insist, was something completely unrelated to
the trade pact: the melt-down of the peso which began last December
when the incoming administration of Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo botched a devaluation.
   "Nonsense," say the foes, many of whom had warned that the peso
was kept deliberately overvalued during the NAFTA debate in the
U.S. Congress in late 1993 so as not to give ammunition to critics
who warned that inevitable devaluations would spur the flight of
capital and factories southwards.
   Whatever the relationship between the peso's collapse and NAFTA,
critics are now having a field day pointing to all of the broken
promises made by NAFTA's boosters two years ago.
   Clinton, for example, predicted that NAFTA would create 200,000
U.S. jobs in its first two years. In fact, Gary Hufbauer of the
Institute for International Economics, the economist on whom the
White House relied for Clinton's estimate, now admits that the
United States has probably lost about 225,000 jobs net.
   Indeed, Mexico is expected to end up with a trade surplus with
the United States this year of around $20 billion. U.S. exports to
Mexico have fallen to about their pre-NAFTA levels and, as yet,
show few signs of levelling off.
   Similarly, a new report to be released by the consumer group
Public Citizen and the Mexico City-based Red Mexicana de Accion
Frente al Libre Comercio (RMALC) finds that another major promise
of the NAFTA campaign, that public health and environmental
problems along the U.S.-Mexico border would be improved as a result
of NAFta, have been dashed.
   The 85-page report finds that "NAFTA has intensified severe
problems of water and air polution, hazardous waste dumping and
increased the incidence of certain diseases and birth defects in
the border region," according to Joan Claybrook, Public Citizen's
president.
   In spite of administration predictions that NAFTA-related
investments would disperse industry in Mexico away from the border
to other regions, the maquiladoras which dominate border
enterprises have been one of the few sectors to experience a major
boom over the past two years.
   The maquiladora workforce has grown 20 per cent since NAFTA took
effect, according to the new report, at the same time that an
estimated 1.6 million Mexicans have lost their jobs as a result of
the economic crisis. More than 85 per cent of the maquiladora
workers were employed near the border.
   Worse, the economic crisis in Mexico has greatly reduced the
ability of the country's state and federal health and environmental
authorities to deal with the increased industrial concentration
ccording to the report.

HONG KONG:  COUNTDOWN TO HANDOVER ENTERS CRUCIAL PHASE

Analysis by Yojana Sharma
   HONG KONG, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The countdown to the handover of Hong
Kong to China has entered what is arguably its most crucial phase
with Beijing having handpicked its team to steer the colony through
the final 18 months of British rule.
   A preparatory committee of Hong Kong businessmen, academics,
politicians and other public figures was officially approved by
China's Parliament, the National People's Congress, last week.
   Together with high-ranking Chinese officials, led by foreign
minister Qian Qichen, they are expected to move quickly to set in
place an embryo administration that will take charge on July 1,
1997, when this vibrant economy becomes a Special Administrative
Region of China.
   The formation of the Preparatory Committee, which has the
blessing of Britain under the terms of the handover treaty signed
by Britain and China in 1984, "signifies the formal start of giving
up power by the British administration here," says Terry Cheng,
editor of the daily Hong Kong Standard.
   From now on, says Cheng, "things will move very fast and the
political environment will be quite changed by the end of the year
(1996)."
   The Committee is expected to begin its work almost immediately.
Its most important task is seen as the election by mid-year by a
committee executive of Hong Kong's first post-1997 governor, to
replace Chris Patten, the 28th and last British governor of Hong
Kong.
   A short-list of names is already thought to have been drawn up
by the Chinese authorities. The naming of the Governor-designate
will be an important milestone, analysts say.
   The governor-in-waiting will then pick his Executive Council,
bringing out into the open the nature of the first post-1997
government. "The candidates will have an important bearing on the
future running of the territory," noted Cheng.
   However, some analysts say there will be few surprises with such
a small number of Hong Kong people appointed to the Committee. Hong
Kong figures wanting to be appointed to the Committee are already
jockeying for position.
   In particular, several delegations of business tycoons, many of
them with business interests in China, visited Beijing in recent
weeks to meet top Chinese officials and lobby for a place on the
Committee. Many of them succeeded, sparking strong criticism that
the Committee is heavily skewed towards the business sector with
entire sectors of the Hong Kong population completely
unrepresented.
   No members of Hong Kong's pro-democracy Democratic Party, which
swept the Legislative Council polls in September, have been
appointed, leading to criticism that the Committee is packed with
"yes-men" who will do Beijing's bidding rather than stand up for
Hong Kong's interests.
   Hong Kong legislator Dr. Leong Che-Hung wonders how many Hong
Kong representatives on the committee "can claim to represent Hong
Kong people? How many have actually spoken the mind of Hong Kong
people in the past? Paradoxically, records have shown that many of
them have spoken or even acted against the wishes of Hong Kong
people."
   Defending China's decision to exclude the Democrats, Hong Kong
legislator and Committee member David Chu said the Committee needed
to work smoothly.
   "The Chinese government will appoint people who can work with
China. There is just over a year to prepare the transition (to
Chinese rule) and the volume of work is quite big and some of the
work quite controversial," he said.
   The vast majority of appointees have already sat on a
consultative body set up by China known as the Preliminary Working
Committee (PWC), which wound up in early December to make way for
the Preparatory Committee. The PWC was seen as having little
credibility with the Hong Kong public.
   Meanwhile public opinion polls by three universities conducted
by sociologist Lau Siu Kai, himself appointed to the Committee,
found that Hong Kong people were quickly losing faith in the
political establishment pre- and post-1997.
   Lau said the survey showed people had declining trust in
political institutions and leaders during the transition. "The
power of the British authorities is waning and the legitimacy of
the incoming Chinese authorities has yet to be established," he
said.
   Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, who angered the Chinese with
his democratic reforms for the Colony also criticised the
Committee. "I think that...the lack of representativeness (of the
Committee) expresses China's attitude towards the territory.
   "I think there will inevitably be quite a lot of feeling in Hong
Kong that it's a great pity that China didn't show more trust for
opinion in Hong Kong and wasn't prepared to tap as wide a section
of opinion as possible," Patten told the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC).
   Analysts say that China still has its work cut out for it
shoring up Hong Kong's confidence in the post-1997 government, with
some predicting a mass exodus in 1996 if the future governor and
his team appear to be a self-serving group who will not stand up
to Beijing hardliners.
   "As for the ordinary people...their perception of future travel,
freedom, autonomy and rule of law will determine what course they
will take to cope with the changeover," said Cheng. "Some who have
already secured a right of abode elsewhere will leave next year if
they do not perceive the developments positively."
   Patten also warned: "If Chinese officials of the Preparatory
Committee go on delivering the same sort of shocks that Hong Kong
suffered in the last few months...if people start to doubt whether
Hong Kong really will have a high degree of independence after 1997
then they may decide to go abroad."
   Patten said there was little Britain could now do to reassure
people about the future. "The closer we get to 1997 the more people
will focus on the reality which is that more and more reassurance
is needed from China."
   Indirectly, Patten was also referring to Britain's declining
influence in the last days of its rule, with the Preparatory
Committee expected to be an important power center competing with
the Colonial administration in the final months.
   "The Chinese will have far greater influence on government
decision-making," noted Cheng.
   In particular once the name of the first post-1997 governor is
announced at mid-year, Patten will increasingly be seen as a lame
duck. As Cheng explained, while the post-1997 Governor-designate
and his team "will have no executive power...their views will be
much sought after...for any policy directions for post-1997 Hong
Kong."
   Hong Kong Liberal Party legislator Allen Lee, who was among
those appointed, admitted "at times the authority of the Hong Kong
government would be affected (by the Committee) whether the Hong
Kong government likes it or not."

PHILIPPINES:  NEW YEAR'S REVELRY FATAL FOR SCORES OF FILIPINOS

By Johanna Son
   MANILA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Not only do Filipinos observe the
world's longest Christmas season, they may well have the bloodiest
brand of New Year revelry too.
   For days after Filipinos welcome the New Year with
super-strength firecrackers like "Judas' Belt" and "Hiroshima",
newspapers and television stations keep a tally of people killed
or maimed by pyrotechnics at the height of holiday revelry.
   "Tradition dies hard, as does the stupidity of some people,"
commented Isyu, a popular tabloid that ran a picture of a doctor
working on the mangled hand of a firecracker victim grimacing in
pain.
   By this morning, newspapers reported that at least 23 persons
died and more than 800 persons were injured by firecrackers.
   Holiday fever in the Philippines begins as early as in October
and ends the first Sunday of January, on the Roman Catholic Feast
of the Three Kings. But yuletide celebrations reach their deafening
height on the midnight of Dec. 31.
   On New Year's Eve, emergency rooms of hospitals fill up with
blast and burn victims. Parts of Manila turn into mini-war zones,
where venturing out for a walk or drive is risky. Visibility dips
as smoke from exploded firecrackers engulfs the city.
   At least six people were killed by stray bullets fired by New
Years revellers into the sky, and scores more across the country
hurt by bullets.
   Thirteen fires broke out in the Philippine capital of Manila
during the early hours of Jan. 1, at least three of them started
by firecrackers falling on roofs or into storehouses.
   "Our insistence on exploding big firecrackers and firing guns
to welcome the new year must make other people wonder if we are
really a suicidal and homicidal race," said the Philippine Daily
Inquirer in its editorial today.
   "Or perhaps it is our desire to be the winner in the pyrotechnic
and noise Olympics: the bigger, the noisier, the deadlier, the
better. We do everything to excess, in the process injuring and
sometimes killing ourselves or other people," it added.
   But though the casualty count remained sizable, government
officials took some comfort in that it was considerably lower than
last year's toll.
   Some 4,500 persons were injured last year, many of whom lost
fingers or hands that were blasted away in accidents, by defective
firecrackers or by those powerful enough to sound and hurt like
small bombs. Health department officials attributed the lower
casualty toll to a national campaign to get Filipinos to use other
noisemakers instead of firecrackers.
   "The casualty toll has gone down by up to 50 per cent. Our
program for people to use horns has paid off somewhat," said Health
Secretary Hilarion Ramiro, who went on television to appeal to
people to avoid lighting firecrackers.
   Newspapers and radio stations reminded people to "be merry, not
sorry" during the New Year celebrations. TV stations tried to drive
the message home by running graphic footage of bloodied victims
maimed by firecracker blasts or burns.
   The government in fact made arrangements with more than 50
hospitals to treat up to 5,000 victims, with one hospital
designated as the National Registry for Firecracker-Related
Injuries.
   Largely unable to keep watch over firecracker factories, the
government has in recent years tried to dampen demand for
pyrotechnics by promoting the use of horns and other noisemakers
instead. But one of the most commonly-cited, and perhaps effective,
reasons for the lower casualty count this year has been the rising
cost of pyrotechnics, some of which are smuggled into the country.
Fancy firecrackers can cost well over $35 apiece.
   Members of the Martinez family say its supply of firecrackers
during this New Year's eve was good for only 30 minutes of revelry.
"We cut down because they're really getting expensive," said Danny
Martinez, a businessman.
   "While Filipinos rich and poor have been known to burn their
money, this becomes harder to do and easier to avoid when the
choice gets down to having a good dinner or a few noises," remarked
the Manila Times newspaper.

VENEZUELA-DRUGS:  CRIME BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN INCREASES

By Wilmer Poleo Zarpa
   CARACAS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Carmen Victoria lives in a marginal
neighborhood west of Caracas. She had her first child when she was
16 and her second child two years later. The fathers disappeared.
   Now in her early thirties, Carmen Victoria is an inmate of the
Los Teques women's prison 30 kilometers southwest of the capital.
Her oldest son, Juan Carlos, 16, is also imprisoned in a youth
reformatory. Both are charged with drug-related crimes.
   There are many cases in Venezuela like those of Carmen Victoria
and Juan Carlos, especially in the largest cities such as Caracas,
Maracay, Valencia, Barguisimeto and Maracaibo.
   The phenomenon has begun to cause concern but reliable
statistics about its incidence are not yet available.
   Nerio Rengifo, chief of the Judicial Technical Police's
Anti-Drug Division, acknowledges that the participation of women
and adolescents in criminal activity has grown significantly,
especially in the lower rungs of the illegal drug industry.
   Maribel Rodriguez, a sociologist with the Venezuelan Ministry
of Education, explained that "the country's economic crisis has hit
the population with the fewest resources especially hard."
   "In many families, children and youth find themselves compelled
for one reason or another, to leave school," she added.
   Lack of opportunity for poor children, youths and adults lead
to idleness which may encourage drug consumption or trafficking,
she said. Rodriguez noted the absence of education, sports and
cultural programs to help combat the problem.
   Rengifo agreed with the sociologist and added that much depended
on a child's upbringing and the ties created between parents and
child.
   "The situation is usually worse in poor neighborhoods where the
majority of children grow up parentless or where mothers have
children with different fathers," Rengifo said.
   The police chief said, "The mother must leave the children alone
for the better part of the day while she looks for sustenance."
   To this he added "the dearth of paternal role models to follow"
and a repressed desire for betterment which he says makes the poor
adolescent easy prey for any kind of criminal activity, with role
models found on every street and corner.
   Guillermo Romero, president of the National Commission Against
Illegal Drug Use (Conacuid) and the government's leading authority
on the issue agrees that the nuclear family is the basis for
education in every sense, including learning to reject drugs.
   For that reason, the National Plan for Prevention and Control
of Drug Production, Trafficking and Consumption emphasizes
prevention and the paramount need to actively include the
community, Romero explained.
   Community participation is given priority when developing
information, training and education programs directed toward
preventing drug trafficking and consumption, Romero said.
   The government, police and sociologists all agree that
prevention is the best tool. Commissioner Rengifo insisted that the
problem "will never be solved with repressive policies."
   Police believed that the solution lies in "confronting the lack
of family planning and fighting idleness by increasing activities
in poor neighborhoods," he said
   Conacuid has proposed reformulating all educational programs to
include specific objectives referring to the prevention of drug
trafficking and consumption.
   Romero announced plans for an epidemiological study that will
serve as the basis for the National Plan because it will provide
a better understanding of the general problem and specific
conditions in each neighborhood.
   "Nevertheless, we have to be clear that this is an ethical and
moral problem, a problem for everyone, and that consequently the
solution should be supported by everyone," Romero opined.
   Sociologist Ruth Taborda, who is also with the Ministry of
Education, added that the involvement of minors with drugs requires
stronger action for "preventive intervention in the family, school,
and community."
   Taborda said that she had developed concrete initiatives and
strategies that are broadly divided into a teacher training program
and a program to develop youth activists.
   "Using specific projects, we're seeking to train teachers in
preventive activity and also to develop youth leaders in the
schools," Taborda explained.

PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN:  PROXY WAR TESTS DOMESTIC POLITICS

By Nasim Zehra
   ISLAMABAD, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Determined to be seen as a big player
in Afghanistan, Pakistan has urged President Burhanuddin Rabbani
to smooth the way for talks on resolving the protracted war,
ignoring Rabbani's own unconditional offer for peace parleys.
   Foreign Minister Sardar Assef said in a televised interview over
the weekend that the "prime responsibility" for restoring peace in
Afghanistan rests with Rabbani, and had nothing to say about the
sudden raising of hopes for peace in Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan's beleaguered president last month surprised Afghan
watchers by offering to travel out of his fortified capital to the
strongholds of his rivals for talks to end the fierce battle for
power that has devastated the country.
   The Taliban student militia, who are Rabbani's biggest
challengers, are reported to be considering the offer. After an
expected initial rebuff, they now say they will make a decision
after receiving details.
   Commentators in Islamabad think Assef's silence on Rabbani's
offer may be the result of disquiet in Pakistan over the softening
of rigid stands by Rabbani and the Taliban. In Afghanistan's ethnic
power struggle, Pakistan is on the side of the Taliban who swept
out of seminaries in Pakistan in 1994 to threaten Rabbani's control
of Afghanistan.
   Islamabad's support for the student militants has strained its
previously cozy relations with Iran, which has thrown its
considerable weight behind Rabbani. Afghanistan is at the center
of a regional proxy war between neighbors bent on increasing their
presence in the strategic area.
   The Taliban control 11 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, and since
October have laid siege to Kabul. Afghanistan's historic capital
has been nearly completely destroyed in the war that erupted a few
months after mujahiddin forces ousted the pro-communist government
of Najibullah in April 1992.
   Rival factions trained on each other the stockpiles of
sophisticated arms and ammunition supplied by the United States via
Pakistan during the mujahiddin's 12-year war with the Afghan
government.
   Now fighting for control are the Persian-speaking
Tajik-controlled government of Rabbani ranged against the Uzbek
warlord General Rashid Dostam, the ethnic Pushtoon Hizbul Islami
chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the Taliban student warriors.
   On Dec. 30, eight Afghan civilians were killed and 41 injured
when a deadly new wave of shells and rockets smashed into Kabul
from Taliban positions on Kabul's fringes. The International
Committee of the Red Cross estimates factional fighting in and
around Kabul has killed more than a quarter million people.
   Tens of thousands of civilians have fled Kabul and many are
living in refugee camps in Pakistan's north and northwest.
Tolerated earlier, they are increasingly being viewed as a threat
to internal security in Pakistan.
   A wave of bomb attacks in Pakistan -- the worst being the blast
in Peshawar on Dec. 21 and the bombing of the Egyptian Embassy in
Islamabad on Nov. 19 -- are believed to be the fallout of
Afghanistan's lingering civil war.
   Political observers warn of worsening law and order because of
Pakistan's proxy military intervention in Afghanistan. While there
is no conclusive evidence, the involvement of the Rabbani regime
in master-minding some attacks is also suspected. In September,
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul was razed to the ground.
   Hardliners are campaigning for a military retaliatory attack on
the Afghan government. "Pakistan should attack Rabbani's military
target to teach a lesson," said Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, chairman
of the Kashmir Committee, at a press conference.
   In his opinion, this would be acceptable to the world community
which has not demurred when Israel's military attacked Hezbollah
targets in south Lebanon. They are not attacks of aggression but
for the protection of its citizens, he explained.
   However, as its response, Pakistan has only expelled the
Peshawar-based member of the Afghan Council, Moosa Khan, and
ordered that all foreign non-governmental groups working with
refugees must be staffed either by their own nationals or by
Pakistanis.
   Pakistan is awash with weapons and explosives, and it is
virtually impossible for the security forces to control the flow
of arms and men across its borders. Many militant Islamic groups
abroad have originated in Pakistan.
   Like the Taliban who have learned their lessons in warfare in
southwestern Baluchistan province, Islamic groups from Algeria to
Sudan and Egypt have roots in Pakistan's religious seminaries.
During the war conducted by Afghan mujahiddin against the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime, they received training in warfare and
the handling of explosives.
   Meanwhile, the Benazir Bhutto government in Islamabad has been
cracking down on the religious right to change Pakistan's image
abroad as a breeding ground for Islamic militants. Islamic radicals
last week expressed their outrage by calling a nationwide strike
against the government, accusing it of being un-Islamic.
   Liberal Pakistanis worry about an Islamic takeover. The fears
were heightened by disclosures about an abortive coup planned in
September last year by a group of fundamentalist officers in the
Pakistan army.

CAMEROON-AGRICULTURE:  FARMERS AND CATTLE-OWNERS CLASH OVER LAND

by Tansa Musa
   BAMENDA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The administrator of Wum, in
north-western Cameroon, had barely settled down to a day's work
when 150 women from a neighboring village began chanting protest
songs outside his office demanding the release from detention of
one of their kith and kin.
   Ekom David Achuo, the husband of one of the demonstrating women,
had earlier caught four cows that had devoured three-quarters of
his crop and marched them to the local police station, demanding
an investigation and compensation from the animals' owner. Instead
the police beat him up and detained him the whole day.
   Rather than freeing Achuo, the administrator ordered the women
away. Angrily they tore off their clothes, a common form of
ultimate protest among African women, at which the official fled.
   "We've had enough of this," fumed the leader of the group of
women. "They (the administration) have taken all our land and given
it to the Bororos (mainly cattle grazers in the region)."
   "Now we have no more land to farm on. Even when we grow crops
on what is left, they send their cows to destroy everything. And
each time we complain, the administration does nothing about it,"
she added.
   Wum, like most of the province, has been the scene of
increasingly violent conflicts over the past two decades between
farmers and immigrant cattle grazers.
   The competition has been inflamed by unregulated farming and
grazing, rapid population growth, and alleged bias on the part of
the local administration.
   Cattle rearing was first introduced to this primarily farming
area by Nigerian Fulani nomads (also known as Bororos) in the
1930's. In time, cattle became a sign of wealth even among locals.
   Northwestern Cameroon is mainly rough, hilly terrain and only
five per cent of the land is arable. The problem has been
compounded by shifting cultivation, a common practice among local
farmers whereby they exploit an area of land for three years, then
move onto another, leaving the first one fallow.
   In an area with no industries where 95 per cent of the
population of 1.8 million depend on subsistence agriculture, the
pressure on the land has reached the point of violence between
cultivators and cattle owners.
   According to Ali Tal, an agricultural expert here, farmer-grazer
disputes are a headache for both agricultural and veterinary
(livestock) services.
   Amos Chanji of the provincial livestock service in Bamenda
believes the solution lies in better land use by farmers and better
ranching by cattle breeders. But Ali says efforts to teach
sustainable farming and land use for high altitudes have failed.
   "We are quite aware that there is a shortage of land here," says
Dr. Idrissou Bapetel, veterinary officer for Wum. "We have tried
to demarcate grazing land from farm land. But nobody, neither the
farmer nor the grazer, respects the demarcation line. So we're
caught in between the two. We just don't know what to do."
   The clashes here have occasionally led to loss of property or
even life.
   Three months ago, a man stabbed during a fight with a
cattle-owner near his farm died in the hospital; in Ndu, part of
the neighboring Donga-Mantung Division, a herder burned down a hut
holding a farmer's harvest for the whole year when the farmer's
children stoned his cows for eating their crops.
   The violence has been attributed to the way in which
administrators have resolved the clashes. Often the Bororos, who
are usually richer than the farmers, bribe administrators in cash
or cattle to rule in their favor.
   Residents of Wat in Donga-Mantung say one major cattle-owner
comes before the courts at least six times a year, but always
emerges victorious.
   "All he needs to do is give the divisional officer one of his
many cows and the case is settled," a resident told IPS. But
administrators vehemently deny this.
   "You know, in this situation it is difficult to satisfy the two
sides. We try to let them understand that the two communities must
live together. The society needs the crops of the farmers as well
as the cattle the grazers raise. So the two must cohabit," says
James Yega, deputy divisional officer for Wum.
   Yega blames most of the problems on farmers who consider
themselves the original owners of the land: "They say the Bororos
are strangers encroaching on their land...But these people
(Bororos) are also Cameroonians and have equal access to land."

EAST ASIA-POLITICS:  IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, PUBLIC LOSING FAITH

Analysis by Suvendrini Kakuchi
   TOKYO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Corruption at the highest levels in
politics and business in Japan and South Korea is nothing new, say
analysts. It was ignored or tolerated by East Asian populations
riding a wave of more than a decade of rapid economic growth.
   Not so anymore. In a less economically vibrant Japan and a more
politically open South Korea, corruption is no longer viewed as a
necessary evil. Indeed, it is seen as an obstacle to future
development -- hence the emphasis on change by the government
leaders of both countries in their New Year messages yesterday.
   "Setting straight the historical record in order to rectify past
wrongs will be a starting point in which we should take pride and
it will also signal the birth of a new society," said South Korea
President Kim Young Sam.
   He has vowed to leave no stone unturned to bring the guilty to
justice with regard to corruption and coup-related incidents for
which two former presidents and several leading businessmen have
been arrested and indicted over the past few months.
   In Tokyo, where the government has been rocked by a series of
financial scandals, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama spent
much time on his government's plans to deregulate the economy in
such a way that bureaucrats would no longer have carte blanche over
the disbursement of public funds.
   "By promoting structural reform, deregulation and
liberalization, the outlook for the economy will be bright this
year," Murayama said in his New Year message yesterday.
   Both leaders urged public understanding as they try to make up
for past mistakes. They have to, say analysts, who feel the
scandals have threatened to undermine years of economic
development.
   The Japanese population is just about fed up with the political
establishment, commented Japan's Yomuiri Shimbun newspaper in an
editorial after last month's arrest of former labor minister Toshio
Yamaguchi.
   He faces charges of using his former position to secure 1.9
billion yen ($19 million) in illegal loans from the now defunct
Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank to help
relatives set up businesses that until recently raked in huge
profits.
   Not surprisingly, the Japanese public reacted with outrage when
the 60-year-old Yamaguchi refused to answer questions from
prosecutors and even evoked his special parliamentary immunity,
forcing the government to endorse his arrest at the last moment.
   Yamaguchi, deputy secretary of the reformist New Frontier Party,
continues to deny any wrongdoing, but in the eyes of a public tired
by reports of impropriety regarding present and former government
officials he is already deemed guilty, noted the newspaper Asahi
Shimbun.
   Asahi Shimbun also expects that an even bigger scandal,
involving the New York branch of the Daiwa Bank, will also see
those accused found guilty of mismanagement.
   Last week, that bank's former manager Masahiro Tsuda was
indicted by a New York court on charges of defrauding the U.S.
Federal Reserve by concealing $1.12 billion of trading losses.
   In November, Federal and New York State banking regulators
ordered Daiwa to close its operations in the United States after
a grand jury accused banking officials of illegally covering up
huge trading losses.
   The scandals have dealt a severe blow to Japan's image and much
of the heat has in turn been focused on the finance ministry for
failing to put adequate controls in place to preempt the illegal
activity.
   The resignation of the ministry's top-ranking bureaucrat,
administrative vice-finance minister Kyosuke Shin, is a reflection
of the turmoil caused by the bad-loan scandals, including the
mammoth bad debt problem faced by housing loan companies.
   "I have decided to step down to let some fresh air into the
ministry as 1996 starts, at a time when the morale of ministry
officials has been shaken by a series of incidents," he said in his
resignation letter, which was accepted Dec. 29 by Finance Minister
Masayoshi Takemura.
   Shinozawa, whose resignation becomes effective on Dec. 29, said
his resignation should not be seen in the light of a failing on his
part with regard to any particular "incident."
   Last month, the ministry unveiled a plan to spend billions of
dollars in public funds to shore up bankrupt housing loan
companies. Economic analysts applaud the initiative, but the
taxpayers are not enthusiastic about having to foot the bill for
the ministry's mistakes.
   Observers expect the government will try to put a lid on the
scandal by announcing reshuffles within the ministry. This,
however, may not be acceptable in today's Japan where unemployment
hit a post-war high of 3.4 per cent in November.
   According to Tokyo Business Today, a leading magazine on Japan's
economy, politics and business have deep-rooted bonds in Japanese
society -- ties forged for mutual gain.
   "Money is not the only reward enjoyed by politicians who do
favors for companies," said the magazine. "Electoral support also
plays a major part in the relationship. At election time companies
mobilize people, materials and money in support of the right sort
of politician."
   The business magazine says corruption goes deeper, with
politicians campaigning for large budget allocations for certain
ministries "expecting in turn to be accommodated (by bureaucrats)
when they put in a word for a favored company at contract time."
   Analysts in Seoul say that in South Korea corruption is
similarly rampant, adding that the political upheavals now rocking
the country should not be viewed only in the context of the coup
trials now taking place.
   The coup trials involve former South Korean president Roh Tae
Woo and his predecessor, who led the nation in the 1980's. They
have been arrested and charged for crimes ranging from bribery to
insurrection.
   Roh, South Korea's first elected president and often considered
the main instigator of democratic reform after decades of military
rule, is under arrest for accumulating a $6.5 million slush fund
from top business leaders.
   But just as in Japan, those arrested remain defiant in the face
of public disenchantment. Such is the case with Chun, one of the
nation's most formidable military dictators, who went on a hunger
strike to protest his arrest. He is now in hospital.
   Japanese and South Korean leaders find it difficult to accept
fault for their actions because they have become so accustomed to
a system which has earlier been considered part and parcel of East
Asian economic development.
   South Korea's now dynamic conglomerates enjoy state protection
through subsidies and regulations. In return it has been the
practice to handsomely reward politicians, who use the money to
finance their political campaigns.
   Meanwhile the economy has prospered, creating jobs -- one reason
why no fuss was made. Another reason is that the political
establishment used to be less open to criticism.
   "The power of a democratically awakened people has a lot to do
with the impending fate of the two former presidents awaiting
justice," South Korean analyst Mary B. Kim wrote in The Korea
Herald.
   Both Roh and Chun have been indicted on charges of corruption
and instigating a 1979 military coup that eventually carried them
to power.
   "To see these politicians in prison garb is a tremendous blow
to the nation's confidence," said Mary B. Kim. "The only way South
Koreans can redeem their loss is by hoping the current crisis will
clean the bad, old system."

DEVELOPMENT:  THIRD WORLD GROWTH SLOW OVER LAST DECADE

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 (IPS) -- Despite a decade of reform, most
Third World economies grew at a per capita rate of only one per
cent or less from 1985 through 1994, according to the latest
edition of the World Bank's annual Atlas.
   Considered as a region, African economies performed the worst
over the decade, with Cameroon claiming last place with a per
capita growth rate of minus 6.6 per cent. But Nicaragua's economy
also declined dramatically, at a rate of minus 6.4 per cent.
   Declines in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were in
many cases even more dramatic, with growth rates ranging from minus
0.9 per cent for Hungary and Poland to minus 18.6 per cent for
Georgia.
   Western industrialized economies, on the other hand, grew at a
fairly consistent rate of between one and two per cent, although
Sweden turned in zero per capita growth over the decade and
Finland's economy dipped at a 0.3 per cent per capita rate during
the ten years.
   As expected, the decade's star performers were Asian, with
Thailand turning in the strongest per capita growth rate of 8.2
per cent, followed by South Korea at 7.8 per cent, and China and
Singapore both at 6.9 per cent.
   Botswana, the African leader, was next with a rate of 6.6 per
cent. Highest in Latin America was Chile, with a 6.2 per cent per
capita growth rate.
   The Atlas, a yearly publication which contains a wealth of
statistical data on education, health, environmental quality,
energy use, and economic performance, notes wide disparities
between rich and poor nations.
   For example, the average citizen of Luxembourg, rated as the
world's richest country and with a per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) of $39,845, is almost 500 times richer than his
Mozambican counterpart, whose per capita GDP share of $80 is the
world's lowest.
   Using a different criterion called purchasing power parity (PPP)
which measures the purchasing power in each country in equivalent
U.S. dollars, the gap comes out somewhat smaller. Luxembourg's per
capita PPP is $31,090, while Mozambique's is about $550.
   In 1993, Luxembourg's energy consumption was 9,879 kilograms of
oil equivalent per person. That was about 1,400 times more than the
energy usage in the country at the other extreme, Somalia, whose
citizens consumed the equivalent of only seven kilograms of oil
that year.
   Indeed, Africa remains by far the poorest continent in the world
in almost every respect. Sierra Leone has the highest infant
mortality rate, with 164 children of every thousand succumbing
during their first year of life. In Japan and Sweden, which have
the lowest rates, only four and five children of every thousand,
respectively, die before their first birthday.
   Sierra Leone also had the lowest average life expectancy at
birth -- only 39 years. A cluster of other African nations and
Afghanistan averaged in the mid-40s. In contrast, the average life
expectancy for people in developed countries rose from 71 in 1970
to 77 in 1993.
   The Atlas argues that education and high economic growth are
linked. Botswana, China, Indonesia, Korea and Singapore -- all with
growth rates of over six per cent over the past decade -- have 96
per cent or more of their primary-age children enrolled in school.
   Despite Africa's relative poverty, child malnutrition is
generally worse in South Asia. As measured by the percentage which
is found to be underweight, 68 per cent of the children in
Bangladesh are malnourished, as are 63 per cent of Indian children;
50 per cent of Nepalis and 40 per cent of Pakistanis fall into the
malnourished category.
   Forty-six per cent of the children of Indonesia, one of the
Bank's star performers, were also found to be malnourished, as were
42 per cent of Vietnamese children.
   But the Bank does not have similar statistics on most of the
world's countries, including much of Africa, the Middle East, and
the former Soviet republics.
   The Atlas also discloses that in most parts of the world women
make up more than 30 per cent of the formal work force, but that
in 20 predominantly Muslim countries, they amount to less than 20
per cent. In Bangladesh, women make up only eight per cent of the
work force.

ENVIRONMENT:  GREEN CONVENTIONS YET TO PROVE EFFECTIVE

By Pratap Chatterjee
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The good environmental news for 1996
is that industrialized countries yesterday halted the production
of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals that destroy the
mantle of ozone which surrounds the planet, protecting it from the
sun's harmful ultra-violent radiation.
   The bad environmental news for 1996 is that the production of
carbon dioxide, another major contributor to the warming of the
planet, is much higher than predicted.
   Does this mean that the ozone layer is improving even as global
warming is getting worse? Not so far. Preliminary data for 1995
show that both the ozone layer and the global climate have fared
worse than expected.
   This is despite the fact that two international environmental
laws, the 1987 Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer and the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change,
have been in place for some time to prevent these very
environmental disasters .
   "In an ideal world, the good news would be just so. But climate
change and ozone depletion are not isolated phenomona. More carbon
dioxide warms the lower atmosphere and causes higher ozone
depletion," says Kalee Kreider from Ozone Action, a
Washington-based environmental group.
   Many companies have substituted ozone-depleting CFCs with
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). But both chemicals contribute to global
warming.
   "Conventions work to eliminate specific chemicals.
Unfortunately, the real world is complex and interactive so
progress on one chemical can be canceled out by increased
production of another chemical," adds Kreider.
   Scientists from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency
(NASA) say that the data from 2,000 land-based weather-monitoring
stations around the world show that 1995 was the hottest year of
the 130 years for which information is available.
   Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported
in September that the seasonal "hole" that opens up in the ozone
layer over Antarctic at the winter's end was roughly the area of
Europe, twice the previous year's size.
   This is about the same size as the hole that was opened up the
year that Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines. Scientists
blamed a rapid increase in the size of the ozone hole that year on
the ash and gases released by the volcano and predicted that the
hole would soon return to a more normal size.
   Scientists say that the problem with any prediction is that
there are numerous assumptions involved, many of which often turn
out to be wrong.
   Activists say that the latest data also show that global
conventions are useless without effective regulation and
enforcement.
   Take global warming. In 1992, governments signed an agreement
in Rio de Janiero to voluntarily cut back on the burning of fossil
fuels, which produces carbon dioxide, to bring national emission
levels down to those of 1990.
   That relatively modest goal fell far short of the 60 per cent
cut in greenhouse emissions that scientists have warned is the
minimum necessary to stabilize the global climate.
   But even this target has proven elusive. Preliminary data for
1995 shows that the United States produced 1,418 million metric
tons of carbon emissions, 5.5 per cent more than it produced in
1990.
   Skip Laitner, of the Virginia-based American Council for an
Energy Efficient Economy, wrote recently that much of the target
could have been met easily if U.S. consumers had invested more in
energy-efficient appliances and vehicles.
   "The lagging efficiency gains are all the more ironic since
earlier studies have shown that meeting the international goals
will increase both employment and economic productivity," he says.
   But energy efficiency alone is not enough to check carbon
emissions. Although fuel efficiency for U.S. cars rose from 5.7
kilometers to 8.9 kilometers to the liter between 1969 and 1990,
auto carbon emissions failed to come down.
   Partly because of the associated cost-saving, U.S. drivers drove
2.4 trillion kilometers in 1990, 50 per cent more than the
1.6.trillion kilometers they logged in 1969. That pushed total fuel
consumption from 242 billion to 273 billion liters.
   The United States is not the only country to miss the targets.
Analysts say that Japan's carbon emissions will exceed their 1990
levels by 5.75 per cent in the year 2000.
   The Canadians have already announced that they will miss the
target by 10 per cent, while unpublished memos from the European
Union show that it expects to be off by six to eight per cent.
   The problems with fulfilling the climate change convention are
two-fold. First, the convention is voluntary; second, governments
continue to pay out large subsidies to industries that rely on
fossil fuels. The United States estimates that its subsidies for
fossil fuels amount to between $10 billion and $15 billion
annually. Estimates for global subsidies range as high as $230
billion a year.
   Or take the depletion of the ozone layer. Yesterday, companies
in industrialized countries officially stopped all production of
CFCs to comply with the Montreal protocol.
   The problems with fulfilling this convention are also two-fold.
First, the ban does not cover consumption. The result is a thriving
smuggling racket.
   CFC smuggling is already making headlines. Last month, the
United States asked Costa Rica to extradite former Miami resident
Bruce Burrell, who was arrested in San Jose for allegedly trying
to smuggle 19,000 cylinders of CFCs into the U.S.
   U.S. government spies working on a covert operation called
"Operation Cool Breeze" discovered that an estimated five to ten
thousand tons of CFCs are being smuggled in to this country each
year.
   Second, CFC substitutes, like HFCs, which are favored by
industry, also have an ozone-depleting effect.
   This means that companies like Maytag and Sanyo continue to
market refrigerators that deplete the ozone. It also means that
companies like Dupont can buy and stockpile CFCs from
non-industrialized countries, which have another ten years to
phase-out CFCs under the Montreal accord.
   "What this shows is that nothing short of a global ban and
strong regulation will work," says Kreider.

U.S.-MEXICO:  CITIZENS' GROUP DEPLORES NAFTA FAILURES ON BORDER

   WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Citizens' groups in both the United
States and Mexico are criticizing the failure of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to improve public health and the
environment along the two countries' border.
   In a new report released here today, the Washington-based Public
Citizen organization and the Red Mexicana de Accion Frente al Libre
Comercio (RMALC) of Mexico City claim that promises by backers of
the two-year-old free trade deal that the border would be cleaned
up under the agreement have been betrayed.
   "Not only is NAFTA not meeting these promises," said Public
Citizen president Joan Claybrook, a top consumer official in the
administration of former president Jimmy Carter. "It has actually
made conditions worse than before it took effect two years ago."
   The 100-page report, entitled "NAFTA's Broken Promises: The
Border Betrayed", provides data on trends in the concentration of
maquiladora industries in the border area, air and water pollution,
hazardous waste, and birth defects attributable to environmental
causes over the past two years.
   Based on published records and interviews with more than one
hundred experts and government officials, the report says that the
promise of improved border conditions relied on three developments.
   It was expected that the maquiladoras would move away from the
border area into Mexico's interior, and that citizens and state
and local governments in the area would become wealthier given the
expected increase in two-way trade enabling them to devote more
money to environmental clean-up and better health enforcement.
   The optimistic predictions were also based on the belief that
strong agencies created under NAFTA would also improve enforcement
of environmental laws.
   But none of these assumptions has been realized, according to
the report.
   The dispersion of maquiladora industries was, according to the
administration of President Bill Clinton, one of the principal aims
of the accord. These industries, mostly assembly plants, not only
bring workers into already-crowded areas, but they also put strains
on natural resources, like water, and use chemicals which
contribute to water and air pollution.
   "If NAFTA is not implemented incentives will continue under the
maquiladoras to locate facilities in the border areas, thus
exacerbating environmental pressures on the border, such as loss
of habitat, adverse impacts to endangered and threatened species,
and reductions in groundwater levels," according to one
administration briefing paper.
   But contrary to that prediction, the new report says that the
maquiladora work force has actually grown by 20 per cent over the
last two years, from 546,000 to almost 700,000.
   The increase in maquiladora employment, according to the report,
is especially remarkable, given the fact that over the past year
some 1.6 million Mexicans have lost their jobs as a result of the
peso's collapse and the tight, anti-inflationary policy followed
by the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
   "As NAFTA opponents had predicted, the increased industrial
concentration has only intensified air and water pollution, dumping
of hazardous waste, and, most tragically, the rate of disease
associated with environmental degradation, including Hepatitis-A,
cholera and birth defects," said Lori Wallach who directs Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
   As to the improvement of resources to deal with the pollution
and better regulate industries in the border area, the collapse of
the Mexican peso has meant huge cutbacks in spending by both
Mexico's federal and local governments. Mexican Foreign Secretary
Jose Angel Gurria has said that Mexico has put on hold
participation in border environmental projects because of the
economic crisis, according to the report.
   At the same time, the Republican-led U.S. Congress has also cut
funding for border programs, while the World Bank has rearranged
its loan portfolio to Mexico to the detriment of environmental
programs.
   The result is that while private investment in the border area
has risen sharply since NAFTA took effect, both public investment
and the resources needed to ensure that the public's interest in
the environmental quality of the area and the health of its
citizens have fallen, according to the report.
   Nor have the new NAFTA-related institutions, mainly the
Commission on Environmental Cooperation, the Border Environmental
Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development
Bank (NADBank) even begun to fill the vacuum.
   The Commission, for example, has not yet heard a single case
involving the failure of the Mexican government to enforce its
environmental laws, while the NADBank, established to provide
low-interest loans for water and waste-treatment in border
communities, has yet to make its first loan.
   Nor is its director, Alfredo Phillips Olmedo, very optimistic
that the situation will change soon. "We have come to the
conclusion that it will be a more difficult process than originally
expected for the bank to engage in substantial lending operations
in the short term," he recently told a public meeting.
   Public Citizen is calling for passage of the NAFTA
Accountability Act, a bill recently introduced by two prominent
Democratic foes of the trade pact. It calls for renegotiating key
parts of NAFTA.

CUBA-ECONOMY:  NO READJUSTMENT WITHOUT BANKING REFORM

By Dalia Acosta
   HAVANA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The tidal wave of radical change in Cuba
will go full steam ahead in the new year with government plans for
deep banking reform to consolidate the economic readjustment.
   The renewal, cooked up by the National Bank of Cuba (BNC), would
do away with the state monopoly on banking, resurrecting structures
which were seen as "un-socialist" for more than 30 years.
   BNC president Francisco Soberon said a banking system is needed
to offer rapid, secure and effective payment, channeling savings
to where they can be most efficiently used and guarantee the
functioning of the economy.
   Specialist sources said that the market economy, adopted
gradually, will force the nation to play a competitive financial
game which will be impossible to win if all the power is in one
pair of hands.
   The decentralization process began to gain ground two years ago
when the currency reserves reached rock bottom, forcing the
government to search around for loans and financing for the
investments.
   The first sign of the process really getting underway was the
creation of the International Bank of Commerce Ltd. (BICSA), in
January 1994, which took over the commercial arm of the BNC and is
today at the core of a budding corporation called New Bank Ltd.
   BNC vice president Jose Rodriquez declared in November that the
new banking group was affiliated to the chain of currency
exchanges, CADECA S.A., the financial novelty with the most impact
for the average Cuban.
   The National Financier Ltd. (FINSA) was also created to provide
more flexible financing for businesses in Cuba, above all in
short-term loans.
   However, the fact that all the new bodies will ultimately be
under the control of the New Bank has raised suspicions among
observers.
   Soberon and other authorities defend the need to separate the
functions of the Central Bank and the Commercial Bank. They want
to see the creation of a Central Bank to control national financial
activity, alongside organisms like the Ministry of Finance and
Prices.
   Specialist sources state that the national banking system has
been forced to diversify its structures in order to respond to
similar changes taking place in the economy.
   The few large state-owned companies which dominated agricultural
production have given way to a mass of more than 3,000 cooperative
basic production units, 1,161 agricultural cooperatives and 86,000
private agricultural producers.
   Any way you look at it, the banking reform will have to plan its
action in order to support the tendency towards self-employed
workers, small, medium-sized and private businesses.
   For the time being, most of the pressure in Cuba is coming from
the changes in foreign trade: the desperate need for credit opened
the nation up to foreign investment and commercial autonomy was
granted to more than 240 national businesses.
   The presence of representatives from 11 foreign banks on the
island has introduced the important ingredient of competition and
revealed the increasing interest awakened by the Cuban economic
changes.
   However, the government is trying to keep control of a chunk of
the internal market of banking business, just as they did with
foreign investment.
   Rodriguez said that "the foreign banks are not authorized to
carry out any banking activity in the country."
   Their role is limited to "promoting the business of the island's
banks," he said, and for the present, "there is no possibility of
giving licenses to any foreign bank to offer other types of
services in Cuba."
   The Spanish Bilbao Vizcaya Bank (BBV) recently opened a branch
in Cuba, offering financing for the Las Tunas area sugar
production, in association with the PEMBA.
   The Netherland Caribbean Bank is also there, along with the
Spanish Exterior Bank, the Sabadel Bank and the Royal Bank of
Canada.
   A party to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Central Bank
recently was attended by representatives of 120 banks from 45
countries, showing that despite the operative limitations, the
foreign banks are very interested in the Cuban economy.
   BNC workers said that this meeting opened new perspectives for
a solution to the problem of the national foreign debt.
   In the opinion of local economists, foreign debt is one of the
main obstacles to the country entering fully into the capital
market and achieving economic growth. Not counting the money owed
to the former Soviet Union, the foreign debt runs to $8.6 billion.

PANAMA:  THE UNSETTLED ISSUE OF RETRIBUTION

By Silvio Hernandez
   PANAMA CITY, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Six years after the bloody U.S.
invasion in December 1989, the Panamanian people are still pressing
Washington for financial settlement for the death of some 2,500
civilians.
   "We will never forget," reads a notice erected in central Panama
City by the relatives of the dead.
   On Dec. 20, 1989, the United States launched a surprise attack
on Panama City and Colon, with more than 30,000 soldiers, planes,
helicopters and warships, in order to overthrow General Manuel
Noriega.
   The United States has invaded Panama fourteen times since 1856
on the pretext of protecting "vital interests" or U.S. citizens in
the nation.
   President of the Omar Torrijos Foundation, Alma Montenegro,
described this attack as "the most bloody of all (U.S.) invasions
of Panama," and the Secretary General of the National Workers
Center, Elberto Cobos, said that it left "deep wounds in the
national consciousness."
   Demands for justice against the United States, proclamations,
vigils and demonstrations each Dec. 20 "show that those deep wounds
are not healing and will not heal until the US military presence
is ended."
   The 1977 canal treaties dictate that all U.S. troops must be
withdrawn by Dec. 31, 1999, when all the military bases will be
handed over to Panamanian jurisdiction along with the canal itself.
   A controversial petition drawn up by President Bill Clinton last
September, and sent to Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares proposed "exploring" the possibility of the bases
remaining active.
   Cobos said that "the lesson" the Panamanians received on Dec.
20, 1989 "is that they must strengthen their independence and
consolidate their sovereignty on the basis of the strict fulfilment
of the (1977) treaties."
   Representative of the Committee for the Rescue of Sovereignty,
Paola Herrera, told IPS that "the United States has a
responsibility for the events of Dec. 20 (1989) that cannot be
by-passed."
   Around 200 tradespeople, whose businesses were destroyed by the
invading army, and families of the victims, presented the U.S. with
a demand for $300 million two years ago. Herrera said the demand
had not even been recognized by Washington, and that the amount
claimed was only a fraction of the cost of damage to the Panamanian
State and infrastructure.
   She stressed that the government of former president Guillermo
Endara, who took over the post in a U.S. base in the canal zone
only hours before the invasion, along with the present leader, "are
also responsible for not demanding war reparations."
   She said the U.S. army stole "millions of dollars of equipment
from the old National Defense Forces (once they were defeated),
destroying buildings, offices, and other state structures, and the
government passivity means they have never paid anything back."
   The local justice system, "never called to trial the U.S.
soldiers who committed crimes against unarmed Panamanian civilians,
even though many of them were duly identified."
   Meanwhile, "several members of the old National Defense Forces
are being tried for the death of two gringos (U.S. civilians)," who
died in the invasion.
   The father of Carlos Puga, who died in the invasion, said, "I
have not seen justice for my son...(he) died unarmed at the hands
of the invading forces in an open violation of human rights."
   He described the invasion as "genocide, for which the United
States must be made to pay reparations."
   The 135,000 member National Federation of Public Servants
(FENASEP) has called for the trial of Endara and his vice
presidents, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford, for being
"accomplices of the 1989 invasion."
   FENESEP spokesman, Maximo Gomez accused the trio of being "the
creators and accomplices of this invasion, proved by the fact that
they took over power in a U.S. base."

MEXICO:  SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS ANNOUNCES ZAPATISTA POLITICAL FRONT

By Eduardo Molina y Vedia
   MEXICO CITY, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Yesterday's announcement that the
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) will become a national
political front will not necessarily mean an end to guerrilla
tactics, said local experts in Mexico today.
   Zapatista leader "Subcommander Marcos," addressed "the civil,
indigenous, worker, rural worker, religious and non-party
organizations and civil society," in "an act for the transition to
democracy."
   The video was released to coincide with the second anniversary
of the Zapatista uprising two years ago yesterday.
   Political analyst Maria Luz Casal, from the Independent National
University, told IPS that the rebel declaration would mean the
renovation of the Zapatista's political arm the Zapatista National
Liberation Front (FZLN).
   "What has, until today, been the institutional role of the
National Democratic Convention (CND), which was made up of two
assemblies with 6,000 representatives in the insurgent zone, will
now go over to the FZLN," she said.
   The CND had been criticized by the insurgents for its internal
divisions and squabbles, along with its inability to manage mass
mobilizations.
   The CND brought together the smallest left-wing groups along
with the "Church of the poor" and the radical wing of the
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) - a group which won 17 per
cent of the national vote in 1994.
   It also included representatives of indigenous, human
rights,feminist and environmental non-government groups, along with
independent sympathizers.
   Casal said, "the social base will not change when the FZLN
substitutes the CND but they will try and minimize the role of the
preexisting political organizations and strengthen the
organizational function of the rebel leadership."
   Christian Ahuerma of the Workers Movement Studies Center said
the guerrilla declaration "is a new political gesture to indicate
that they are prepared to maintain the situation of detente and
look for new institutional solutions."
   "In fact," he said, "the Zapatistas have been more a political
than military force since they began, though they were
spectacularly catapulted onto the scene in a guerrilla outburst.
   Ever since they came into the public eye on Jan. 1, 1994, in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, the Zapatistas had been calling
for a democratic national front.
   After two months of military confrontations in the conflict
zone, the guerrilla and the government agreed to a ceasefire and
an armed truce which led to an arduously slow peace process, still
underway.
   Yesterday's declaration, dubbed the "Fourth Declaration from the
Lacandona Jungle," called for a "peaceful, civil, independent and
democratic, national Mexican organization."
   The FZLN will be part of the year-old National Liberation
Movement (MLN), defined as "a broad opposition force," which
recently established its first principles and plans of action.
   The FZLN "will not be a political party, because it will not
fight to take power, but a civil political force in opposition the
State party system."
   The Zapatistas particularly object to the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been in power since 1929 and
has suffered a series of scandals in the last year.
   The rebels see the government attitude as "prepotent, racist and
humiliating," and have called for former president Carlos Salinas
to be tried for "treason to the nation."
   They criticized the "defrauding of popular will, the imposition
of the neoliberal model which has plunged the population into
poverty and desperation, the sale of the nation to foreigners and
the close links with narcotraffic."
   The proposal for a political front was established by popular
vote in September when some 300,000 people voted in the "National
poll for peace and democracy" organized by non-governmental groups.
   One of its first actions will be to arrange an "intercontinental
summit against neoliberalism," among the Zapatistas' international
supporters and sympathizers.

JAMAICA-TOURISM:  WINTER SEASON GETS OFF TO BAD START

By Corinne Barnes
   KINGSTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- It has been only three weeks since the
winter tourist season began but already hoteliers here are wringing
their hands in despair.
   Smaller hotels are on the verge of closing their doors unable
to compete with the might and efficiency of the larger
all-inclusive resorts.
   But the landscape is not bright for all-inclusives either. They
had to offer discounted rates in order to attract the tourist
dollar as competition among the islands in the region becomes more
intense.
   For Jamaica, the winter tourist season means valuable foreign
exchange needed to service external debts and pay the country's
high import bill. Tourism earns this northern Caribbean island some
one billion U.S. dollars each year.
   "Business is bad," says Gale Elmore, owner of a 17-room hotel
in the country's northcoast resort town of Montego Bay.
   Elmore's 40 year old Richmond Hill Hotel is struggling this
season.
   So far this season while all-inclusives are registering
occupancy levels over 70 per cent, the smaller, more intimate
facilities have bookings of 25 per cent.
   One hotel has reported that only four of its 24 rooms are
currently occupied.
   "I have no projections to March, nothing confirmed," says
Anthony Thompson, general manager of the Carib Isle hotel in
Runaway Bay on the north coast.
   "(Business) has not got any better in 15 years," says Thompson.
"Maybe we should really close our doors."
   The non-all inclusive hoteliers complain that they have not been
able to carry out the necessary renovations and advertise their
product effectively to meet this year's winter season as they were
unable to borrow money as interest on loans are becoming
unbearable.
   Interest on loans now stand in the region of 47 per cent.
   President of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association (JHTA)
Lionel Reid who was optimistic at the start of the season says he
is also concerned that unless the situation changes these smaller
hotels may be forced out of business.
   "They (small hoteliers) are operating on bank borrowings and are
now at the wall," he says.
   Reid says it is impossible for these hotels to remain viable
when room rates being charged are what obtained 20 years ago.
   As for Elmore, in order to keep her business open she has had
to strike a deal with the all-inclusive hotels in the area to allow
their guests to eat at her hotel.
   Reid says the situation now existing in the tourism industry is
of concern to the wider population as the ripple effect will be
felt throughout the entire economy.
   If the small hotels are forced to fold, laid off workers are
likely to add to the unemployment level which is hovering at 15
per cent.
   The list of those affected is a long one and includes small
farmers who supply fresh fruits and vegetables to these hotels, and
restaurants and vendors who depend on the non all-inclusive hotel
trade.
   But the fight is not only between the small hotels and the
all-inclusive. Intra-regionally, each island is struggling to fend
off the determined challenge mounted by its neighbors.
   Jamaica, with its high crime rate (779 persons were murdered
last year), is being bypassed by tourists for other islands
perceived as unspoiled and safer.
   The public relations department at the Jamaica Tourist Board
says countries such as the Cayman Islands and Aruba which did not
have a presence in the market three years ago have increased their
profiles through lavish advertising.
   And Cuba which was not considered a serious competitor up to two
years ago has been pumping millions of dollars into its tourism
industry and is expected to lure many visitors to its shores this
year.
   Between January and September 1995, some 68,000 tourists visited
Jamaica. In 1994 the figure stood at 1.5 million, earning some $915
million although projections for that year had been for 1.7 million
with net earnings of $1.1 billion.

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA:  SERB SEIZURES TEST NATO'S PEACEKEEPING ROLE

By Jim Clark
   SARAJEVO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- NATO appeared to be in danger of
failing its first major test of effectiveness in holding the
fragile peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as concern grew for the safety
of a group of Bosnian Muslim civilians seized in a Serb-held suburb
of Sarajevo.
   The incident also showed up a potential gap between the
responsibilities of NATO's heavily armed forces and a putative
U.N.-led independent police force in the country. Both forces are
being deployed in the country under the terms of the Dayton Accord
supposed to herald a permanent settlement to the conflict.
   The Bosnian Serbs still control the western districts of
Sarajevo, from where they bombarded the city during the 44 month
war, but which must be handed over to the control of the Muslim-led
Bosnian government. The ten all disappeared yesterday in the suburb
of Ilidza, where opposition to the Dayton pact is strongest.
   Bosnian civilians started to use the main roads out of the city
through the suburbs after members of the 60,000-strong NATO
implementation force (IFOR) removed Serb checkpoints on the
roadways. The seizures stopped the movements.
   "We can confirm that 10 people are missing and we are pressing
the Bosnian Serb authorities to confirm their present location,"
said Colonel Vladimir Ribnikov, chief of the U.N. civilian police
force soon to deploy in Sarajevo.
   Bosnian government minister Hasan Muratovic said the U.N.
figures did not include four others seized yesterday by "Serb
terrorists" on the road from Kiseljak through Ilidza to Sarajevo.
   IFOR officers said they were concerned about the report but said
the responsibility for their safety was a matter for the civilian
authorities.
   NATO is limiting itself to implementing military aspects of the
agreement and plans to leave routine policing to an international
police force intended to tackle civilian problems. The force is yet
to be deployed, and will be under the direction of the High
Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, former Swedish prime
minister and European Union peace envoy Carl Bildt.
   But who should be responsible when paramilitary forces commit
criminal acts, such as the weekend seizures, has not been defined
as international efforts to grapple with the political aspects of
the accord fall behind schedule.
   NATO officers conceded that they are supposed to ensure freedom
of movement, but still did not consider the activities of
paramilitary groups seizing travellers moving about the city as
their responsibility.
   "We are not a police force, we are not mandated to take police
action," British IFOR spokesman Brigadier Andrew Cumming told a
news briefing in the rebel Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale.
   He attempted to play down the significance of the incidents,
describing today as "another extraordinarily quiet day" in the
(IFOR) theatre of operations. "The parties are continuing to
demonstrate great cooperation and willingness to achieve the goals
of the Dayton agreement," he added.
   The Bosnian Serbs, along with the Muslim-led government promised
to allow full freedom of movement to all citizens throughout Bosnia
when they signed the Dayton peace accord in Paris last month.
   Muratovic told Bosnian TV that an appeal for the unconditional
release of the detained had been issued at a meeting attended by
Serb, government and IFOR officials.
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said the former combatants
had not yet learnt how to deal with each other face to face. "They
have not yet been confronted with dealing with each other. That's
still ahead of them," Perry said at an Italian airbase as he
prepared for a tour of new U.S. encampments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
   Yet this kind of face to face confrontation is expected to
increase in frequency, especially as members of different
communities try to return to their homes in areas controlled by
former enemies, as specifically guaranteed by the Dayton accord.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today kicked
off their program of refugee return by announcing a top-level
meeting of 40 countries designed to marshal support and assistance
for a massive two-year scheme to see the first of 1.3 million
displaced persons back home in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nearly two
million more have sought refuge in neighboring Croatia, Serbia and
other European countries.
   In theory, IFOR is supposed to ensure that the returns can be
organized in peace, and the U.N. police force is supposed to ensure
general order while they are carried out. IFOR will not step in
unless there is a military threat to civilians.
   An IFOR media briefing in Sarajevo was told yesterday that "the
essence of the IFOR commitment to this theatre, is to wrest
authority away from military, and into the hands of the civilian
authorities."
   However NATO briefing papers say the IFOR mission will "help to
create a secure environment" which includes "assisting in the
observation and prevention of interference with the movement of
civilian populations, refugees and displaced persons."
   The U.N. Security Council approved a U.N. civilian police force
for Bosnia-Herzegovina last month. The 1,700 strong unit of
civilian police officers from around the U.N. member nations will
be responsible for the control and recruitment of local police and
providing them with operational assistance.
   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said the force will
cost about $90 million in the first six months, will to him but
will "subject to the coordination and guidance" of Bildt.
   Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed Sacirbey told a press
conference in Brussels last month that his government was working
out a detailed plan with IFOR for the policing of the Serb suburbs
of Sarajevo.
   "The Bosnian government wants to do all it can to reassure the
people in these areas," he said. "There will be joint police
patrols with the United Nations. There have always been Serbs,
Croats and others, as well as Muslims, in our police force.
   "But," he added, "we have agreed to increase the proportion of
Serbs to 30 per cent or more of the entire police force." It is
expected to be months before this combined force is effectively
operating.
   Until then the informal arrangements must continue, even though
they are already failing in Sarajevo.
   "IFOR was too quick to decide that security was satisfactory,"
said Amir Hafdziomergaic, Muratovic's deputy. "Acts of Serb
terrorism are not going to stop implementation of the Dayton peace
accords, but they risk undermining the conditions in which it takes
place."
   Muratovic said he may order Bosnian police to stop civilians
using the roads unless escorted by IFOR troops. There are no plans
for IFOR convoys to see Sarajevans safely about their own city, as
were sometimes run by the U.N. during the war.

SRI LANKA:  CONSERVATIONISTS BATTLE ECO-TOURISM

By Rita Sebastian
   COLOMBO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- An unsuspecting deer nibbles at a
plastic bag caught on a prickly bush in Horton Plains, a
picturesque reserve in Sri Lanka's central hills.
   The animal does not know that it is flirting with death. The
non-biodegradable plastic could choke its intestine, leading to a
painful death.
   Jagath Gunewardene of the non-governmental Environmental
Foundation blames the government policy of promotion of eco-tourism
in Sri Lanka for the new problems that park officials are being
forced to contend with. At all times of the year, Horton Plains is
swarming with tourists both local and foreign.
   Dismissing them as nothing but "pleasure seekers," he says that
90 per cent of visitors to the park and similar sanctuaries in Sri
Lanka are insensitive and out to destroy what they have travelled
from far and near to see.
   The authorities have laid down strict rules to prevent visitors
from disturbing the plant and animal life in the park. Photography
at close range is prohibited, but that has not stopped tourists
from hounding the deer for a good shot.
   And by the time the last day tripper goes home, the nature
reserve is littered with the remains of lunch and empty packets of
potato crisps and soft drink bottles.
   Conservationists say Horton Plains was created to preserve a
part of Sri Lanka's tropical beauty for future generations, but the
authorities did not fully take into account man's carelessness and
ability to destroy.
   "There has to be proper policing of tourists and their numbers
must be limited," says Deepthinka Kankanige of the Colombo-based
Society for Environmental Education. On an average some 60 people
visit the park, but even that has been found too many for the staff
whose main job is to safeguard the park.
   About 100 kilometers east of Colombo is Adam's Peak, a mountain
top that is venerated by Sri Lanka's Buddhist people, drawing
millions of devotees on a yearly pilgrimage. Many foreign tourists
to Sri Lanka also scale the peak to catch spectacular views of the
sunrise and the distant blue of the Indian Ocean.
   But the beauty of Adam's Peak may be its ruin. Unregulated camp
sites have sprung up in the wilderness and trees are being stripped
for firewood for bonfires, which are a constant threat specially
during the dry season.
   Kankanige says policing by Forest Department officials would
help, but it is imperative tourist officials educate visitors.
   Buses and private cars reaching Horton's Plain are beset by
souvenir sellers. While a lot of what is sold is bric-a-brac, rare
and endemic fauna and flora from the park are also being peddled
by enterprising locals.
   Knowledgeable buyers to eco-tourism destinations in Sri Lanka
can pick up rare species of plants, fish, butterflies and beetles,
Gunewardene confirms. The poaching by locals if unchecked could
seriously endanger wildlife species, he adds.
   Tourism officials in Colombo can only see the money eco-tourism
is bringing in. "Wildlife sanctuaries, nature reserves and
waterfalls are a great tourist attraction," an official of the
Tourist Board says.
   Asked if officials were taking adequate safeguards to protect
the areas from mass tourism, he admits that not enough has been
done but the authorities are aware of the importance of maintaining
the ecological balance.
   A firm critic of the government's promotion of eco-tourism is
Dr. Ranjan Fernando, president of the Wildlife and Nature
Protection Society. He feels the authorities are unwisely
exploiting the natural resource.
   "The way the idea is being promoted in this country seems to be
merely exploiting the natural resources of the island," he
underlines.
   Fernando cites the promotion of tourism in the catchment areas
of reservoirs as evidence of official shortsightedness. The
catchment areas are protected under Sri Lanka's Fauna and Flora
Protection Act, but officials have thrown them open to tourists.
   The government is motivated by short term interests in its
promotion of tourism, he thinks. Foreigners may bring in precious
foreign exchange now, but tourism in the long term will destroy the
environmental balance, he believes.
   "Tourism will disturb the ecological balance, which will take
thousands of years to heal," he states.
   In his opinion, eco-tourism is a contradictory concept and time
and again it has been shown that tourism is geared to changing the
natural way of life.
   But officials in Colombo think otherwise. They think eco-tourism
will attract discerning visitors who are sensitive to nature and
its importance in the cycle of life.
   Eco-tourists are not looking for just the sun, sea and the sand,
a Tourist Board official here said. Sri Lanka has earned notoriety
as a destination for pedophiles. An influx of foreign tourists to
Sri Lanka's famed beaches, mostly from the west, has been seen as
the main reason for the spread of the Aids virus among the local
population.

CHINA-ENERGY:  WIND HELPS POWER BOOMING ECONOMY

By Gao Fengfeng
   BEIJING, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- China, whose coal-fired power plants
have sent pollution levels soaring, has turned to a cleaner
alternative to help fuel its flourishing economy: wind energy.
   The use of this environment-friendly and renewable energy in
China has already passed from the experimental stage to far-ranging
application, especially in the grasslands for nomadic herdsmen and
some remote areas beyond the reach of the national power grid.
   The country now has 130,000 small and medium-size wind-driven
generators with a capacity of 17,000 kilowatts. More than 30
factories produce 100-200 watt generators nationwide. Three
quarters of these small generators are installed in the Inner
Mongolia grasslands.
   Wind-driven generators enable people in remote areas to use
electric lamps, television sets, radios and other modern
facilities. Since wind power became available, more students from
backward regions are said to have gone to university to receive
higher education.
   For larger application of wind power, there are 14 wind power
stations in China. They are equipped with 99 generators with a
total capacity of 14,600 kilowatts.
   The country's wind power application is concentrated mainly in
the provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Liaoning and
Fujian.
   As China has not yet mastered the modern technology of
manufacturing large wind-driven generators it has to import them,
mainly from Denmark, Germany, the United States, Belgium and
Sweden.
   Officials say wind power will play an important role in China's
effort to redistribute power across the country.
   There are about 120 million Chinese who still have no access to
electricity. Most of them live in the remote mountainous or
pastoral regions where the installation of wind-driven generators
will be less expensive than the extension of long-distance power
transmission lines from major power plants.
   The Chinese power industry is currently dominated by coal-fired
power plants, which are blamed for much of the smog that hovers
over the country's industrial regions.
   "China's coal reserve is largely distributed in the west, while
most of giant power plants are located in the more prosperous
east," says Yin Lian, a senior energy ministry official.
   About one-fifth of railway freight volume is devoted to coal
consumed by thermal power generators. This puts a heavy burden on
the already clogged national rail transport system.
   In this context, it makes both economic and ecological sense to
develop wind power in China. "As wind power demands less investment
and has far more flexibility in operation, it suits China
particularly well," says Yin.
   And China claims a rich wind power reserve of about 253 million
kilowatts which can be harnessed, according to long-range
investigations conducted by meteorological experts.
   Although the annual output of wind power still makes up only a
tiny portion of the country's total electricity output, the energy
ministry has worked out an ambitious plan that will enhance the
total capacity of wind-driven generators in China to one million
kilowatts by the end of the century.
   To meet this goal, the state has approved a provisional
regulation to give a more favorable price on wind power to the
consumers. And energy officials say the government is considering
a reduction of value-added tax, income tax, and import tariff in
the case of buying facilities from abroad.
   "The rapid development of wind power cannot succeed without
support from government, and it is particularly the case as wind
power traditionally drew far less attention than conventional power
sources," says Yin.
   China hopes to raise public awareness of the importance of this
form of energy by hosting an international conference in Beijing
in May. Local and foreign experts will discuss ways to give China's
fledgling wind power industry a further push.
   China mainly imports giant and middle-size wind-driven
generators ranging from 200 to 500 kilowatts. The conference is
expected to help China cut production cost and introduce technology
to produce its own generators.
   Denmark tops the list of donors in this field, supplying 13 sets
of 150 kilowatt wind-driven generators and one 100 kilowatt
generator for the Dabancheng wind power station in Xinjiang.
   In 1994 it provided loans worth $16 million for building four
wind power projects in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Dalian in
Liaoning, and Guangdong. Up to now, China has made use of a total
of $26 million worth of loans from the Danish government.
   "We welcome and encourage foreign funds to flow into China in
this regard, as China claims a great potential in developing wind
power," says Yin, adding that the country's target for overall use
of wind power is set for eight million kilowatts by 2020.

ANGOLA-POLITICS:  BRINKMANSHIP CONTINUES

By Chris Simpson
   LUANDA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- U.N. Special Representative Alioune
Blondin Beye says this should be Angola's year of "definitive
peace" following steady consolidation seen in 1995.
   But Beye is almost alone in his optimism. Even the Christmas
period in Angola was dominated by fresh allegations of offensives
and stiff warnings from both sides, while mediators struggled to
keep things in perspective.
   The U.N., with some 6,200 blue helmets in Angola to monitor
military demobilization under a year-old peace agreement, had been
hoping for a rapid post-Christmas breakthrough.
   Visits by government officials and Beye to the Bailundo
headquarters of the opposition Union for the Total Liberation of
Angola on Dec. 21 and Dec. 23 respectively, were meant to pave the
way for a resumption of military talks between the government and
UNITA and a summit with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
opposition leader Jonas Savimbi early in the New Year.
   Beye took to the airwaves on Dec. 27 to give a generally upbeat
resume on the peace process to date. He warned, however, that any
ceasefire violations at this stage were unacceptable. He reserved
particular criticism for the media, warning that "hostile
propaganda" was continuing to sour the atmosphere.
   Ironically, Beye's criticisms coincided with a fresh outburst
of allegations from UNITA's radio station, Vorgan, whose "northern
correspondent," Felix Miranda, alleged that a major government
offensive in the province of Uige had killed 40 people. Quoting
local UNITA commanders, Miranda claimed heavy artillery and tanks
had been deployed by the government.
   As envoys from Russia, Portugal and the United States arrived
in Bailundo the same day for what was meant to have been a routine
meeting with UNITA, they were immediately confronted with news of
renewed fighting.
   Vorgan's accusations were later strongly backed by UNITA's
secretary-general, Paulo Lukamba Gato, in interviews with the BBC
and Voice of America. Gato stressed that the government's actions
ruled out any prompt resumption of military talks given the lack
of a "climate of confidence."
   Vorgan repeated the allegations, claiming that government troops
had massacred civilians in areas it had occupied. But UNITA's
claims were firmly denied by government spokesman Gen. Higino
Carneiro. Interviewed on local radio on Dec. 28, Carneiro accused
UNITA of indulging in cheap propaganda, adding that all UNITA's
current concerns were meant to have been addressed at the meeting
with the government in Bailundo a week earlier.
   Subsequent visits by Beye and U.S. ambassador Donald Steinberg
to the central highlands town of Bailundo on Dec. 28 and 29 were
aimed at winning UNITA over. They both met with Savimbi who had
been absent from the previous round of meetings.
   Meanwhile, a Joint Commission delegation, including military
representatives from the government and UNITA, travelled to Uige
on Dec. 29 to investigate the movement's allegations.
   The delegation has yet to publicize its findings, but U.N. and
diplomatic sources have hinted that UNITA's version of events is
greatly exaggerated and that UNITA is simply looking for another
pretext to stay away from military talks with the government and
keep its troops out of the quartering areas.
   UNITA's latest allegations have focused on the region of
Quitexe, 50 kilometers southwest of UNITA's northern stronghold of
Negage in the province of Uige. While the government holds the
provincial capital of Uige, UNITA controls most of the rest of the
province, including the frontier with Zaire.
   Uige has been tense throughout the peace process, despite U.N.
efforts to improve free movement between government and UNITA
areas. Sporadic clashes have been reported in the north, while the
civilian population has complained of harassment by the armies of
both sides.
   The United Nations is hoping to convene a new Joint Commission
meeting as soon as possible. But as of Jan. 2, UNITA's
representative in Luanda was still in Bailundo, with no word yet
from the movement on the resumption of the military talks, which
have experienced a series of interruptions over the past few
months.
   According to diplomatic sources in contact with UNITA, the
current problems should not be overstated. "UNITA is still in
problem-resolving mode," IPS was told. "But UNITA is worried about
the current crisis of confidence."
   The government however is likely to react very critically to
further delays. In an explicit warning to UNITA, a senior military
source in Luanda warned recently that the current rate of progress
was unacceptable.
   "It has gone extremely slowly. The only positive development so
far has been the deployment of U.N. forces and the construction of
the quartering areas."
   The same source accused UNITA of carrying out military actions
countrywide, of continuing recruitment campaigns and rearming. "We
have more information than anyone else and we are always asking
ourselves 'What is the reason for this behavior'?" he said.
   The government military is still denying having used mercenaries
at any stage, stressing that the South African security firm
Executive Outcomes fulfilled the kind of training role also
performed by Portuguese instructors under the terms of the Bicesse
peace accords of 1991, a peace agreement overturned when UNITA
returned to war a year later.
   Military sources have also emphasized that "absolutely nothing"
has happened in Uige, beyond a routine confrontation between two
rival patrol groups. The government maintains that its actions in
Zaire province in November and December were a legitimate response
to persistent provocation by UNITA.
   Looking forwards, senior generals remain publicly committed to
the Lusaka Protocol, the peace agreement signed in November 1994,
but accept major disagreements persist, particularly on the issue
of a new national army.
   The Bicesse accords provided for 20,000 UNITA troops in a
unified army. Some 2,500 came in and stayed in, leaving places for
only 17,500 more, many less than UNITA now wants. Government
proposals for a "social reconstruction" wing focussing on
rehabilitation and public works has met with little support from
UNITA, although it could provide employment for thousands more
soldiers.
   In his New Year's address to the nation, dos Santos called for
greater diplomatic pressure on UNITA to force compliance with the
Lusaka protocol. There has been no explicit warning yet of what
military action might be taken if UNITA does not show more
cooperation.

IRAQ-SANCTIONS:  MIXED SIGNALS CONFUSE SANCTIONS RENEWAL ISSUE

Analysis by Dilip Hiro
   LONDON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The United Nations Security Council's
routine 60-day renewal of sanctions against Iraq grows steadily
more problematic. The next reimposition, due on Jan. 8, must now
take account of mixed signals on the subject coming from the
region.
   A communique issued on Dec. 6 at the end of the six member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Muscat, Oman, backed
continuation of the embargo until Iraq complied with all Security
Council resolutions on the Gulf War. But some of the Gulf states
are in flexible mood.
   Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad ibn Khalif al-Thani, who pointedly did
not attend the summit closing ceremony, had brought to the GCC a
message of reconciliation from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   And in October, United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Zaid ibn
al-Nahayan publicly called for a relaxation of the embargo against
Iraq. The ruler of Oman, Sultan Qaboos ibn-Said, was also reported
to be favoring mending fences with Baghdad.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Jaber ibn Ahmad al-Sabah
of Kuwait, the countries most affected by Saddam's disastrous
invasion and rapid defeat in 1990/1991, predictably remained
staunchly opposed to any relaxation of the sanctions against Iraq.
Firmly behind them was the United States. The three prevailed.
   However there are some signs of a split within the Saudi ruling
establishment. Following his meeting with Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak in Cairo on Dec. 14, Prince Khalid ibn Sultan al-Saud, the
joint coalition commander during the 1991 Gulf War, declared that
the U.N. sanctions had strengthened rather than weakened the Iraqi
regime, and needed to be eased.
   Signals coming from Amman are equally mixed. In this instance
Jordan is uniquely placed. It is the only one of Iraq's neighbors
allowed by the U.N. Security Council to have limited economic
relations with Baghdad. It is permitted to import 67,000 barrels
of oil per day from Iraq, which the latter sells at a discount
price and supplies by truck. The Iraqi government uses the income
to buy food and medicine for its citizens.
   In mid-December a Jordanian delegation visited Baghdad to
negotiate an increase in supplies of oil for 1996. Though the Saudi
monarch has by now forgiven King Hussein of Jordan for not joining
the Gulf War against Iraq and has mended fences with Amman, he has
yet to offer oil supplies to Jordan.
   But while the Jordanian king is unable to end his country's
dependence on Iraqi petroleum, he has recently taken to shoring up
the exiled opposition leaders of Iraq. In December he addressed
them at a meeting in Amman.
   He proposed a federal set-up in Iraq which, in his view, would
satisfy the three main groups in the country: Kurds, Shias and
Sunnis. Since there are no clear geographical lines that divide
Sunni Muslims from Shia Muslims, the idea has been a non-starter.
   What lies behind this move by King Hussein? Pressure by the
United States. Having repeatedly failed to see Saddam overthrown
by his own people, Washington has now seemingly opted for a fairly
long-term strategy of toppling his regime through a combination of
economic and political measures.
   Since Jordan is the only overland gateway into and from Iraq,
a country cut off from foreign air links, it has a key role to play
if the U.S. plan is to succeed. And given Jordan's economic and
diplomatic dependence on Washington, it is imperative that its
monarch must be seen to be doing something on this front.
   Nonetheless, Saddam is taking King Hussein's move seriously.
Just after Christmas Baghdad announced that Iraq's direct
international telephone links are being cut on the ground that it
does not have enough foreign exchange to pay the bills.
   Baghdad has also reduced the duration of its exit visa from 12
months to one month, thus restricting further foreign travel for
Iraqi citizens.
   And Saddam launched a new austerity campaign on Dec. 31 to halt
the decline of the Iraqi currency. He called for tax increases and
a cut in the amount of bank notes in circulation. The dinar has
plunged to 2,500 against the dollar on the black market, against
an official rate of one dinar to $3.20.
   As for the U.N. sanctions, Iraq's state-run newspapers yesterday
exuded confidence. Al-Thawra, the daily paper of the ruling Baath
party, as quoted by the state-run Iraqi News Agency, said sanctions
would be lifted in 1996 thanks to "friends and brothers" who were
aware of what it called Iraq's "real commitment" to U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
   In this decision the final report of the U.N.'s chief inspector
in Iraq, Rolf Ekeus, will carry great weight. Just before
Christmas, Ekeus revealed that, tipped off by the Iraqi government,
his inspectors had salvaged some crates from the Tigris river in
Baghdad.
   These contained gyroscopes for long range ballistic missiles,
which are banned by the Security Council Resolution 687 of April
1991. A preliminary study showed that the crates had been under
water for about three months.
   The Iraqi government's explanation was it had caught an
individual who had brought these machines into the country and when
he could not ship them out of Iraq he decided to dump the crates
into the Tigris. Ekeus is investigating the matter, and it will be
some weeks before he reaches a conclusion.
   The U.N. has offered to allow Iraq to sell a limited quantity
of oil to pay for medicine and humanitarian supplies, but Baghdad
refuses, saying U.N. conditions infringe on its sovereignty. Oil
exports used to account for 90 per cent of Iraq's foreign revenues.
   Ekeus's final report on Iraq's demolition of its weapons of mass
destruction and long range missiles is unlikely to materialize
before the Security Council review of the sanctions by Jan. 8. The
chances are they will be renewed for another 60 days.
   Thus the major losers in this 65 months old saga remain the
Iraqi population, who are suffering untold economic hardships,
widely expected to culminate in a famine in the spring.
   The average monthly wage is just 5,000 dinars, equivalent to two
dollars and inadequate to cope with prices. Currently Iraqis pay
up to 60 dinars for bread, 1,200 dinars for a kilo of flour, and
5,000 dinars for a kilo of meat. Most now survive on state rations.

ENVIRONMENT/LITHUANIA:  NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY RECORD WORRIES MANY

By Edvinas Butkus
   VILNIUS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Even its senior management regards
Lithuania's troubled Ignalina nuclear plant as being at risk of
suffering a serious technical breakdown with potentially lethal
consequences.
   "Despite the complexity of reactor technology, in the Ignalina
atomic power plant certain tasks are carried out with very
primitive means," admits Dr. Povilas Vaisnys, director of the
Lithuanian state atomic energy security inspectorate (VATESI).
   The reactors at Ignalina, 130 kilometers northeast of the
capital Vilnius, are of the same RBMK design as those used at the
Chernobyl plant in Ukraine, site of the world's worst nuclear
accident in 1986. It produces 80 per cent of Lithuania's
electricity.
   The plant is scheduled for closure by 2010 when alternative
power sources must be in place. Yet despite extensive safety
improvements at the plant, funded in part by the European Union and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a
series of accidents at the plant in late 1995 raised new concerns.
   In the last incident, staff were routinely calibrating devices
to measure electron flow on Nov. 30, when engineer Vladimir Rusinov
from the plant's atomic security center was forced against
regulations to enter an irradiated area when the measuring device
failed to fit through its regular aperture.
   Rusinov was said to have suffered no serious aftereffects. "Such
a level of radiation does not cause any reaction in the human
organism and has no practical effects which can be measured by the
modern medical devices at our disposal," Vaisnys said.
   On Nov. 22, 12 tons of water from the pressurized tanks of the
emergency core cooling system were accidentally released. Although
emergency steps were taken at the time, the reactor was shut down
the next day after an automatic safety system failed.
   Eleven days prior to that leak, there was a small fire in the
machine room of Unit 1 after a pipe in the hydraulic system
cracked, also leading to a 24-hour reactor shut-down.
   In August, two cranes became entangled during refueling at Unit
2, and several days later a spent 150 kilogram fuel rod broke while
being lowered into the cooling pond and sank to the bottom. Earlier
in August staff had to leave the reactor hall while a damaged fuel
element was removed from the core. No radiation was leaked into the
atmosphere in any of the incidents.
   But this series of minor accidents has impelled Vilius
Kazanavicius, former deputy prime minister of Soviet Lithuania, to
voice his concern that minor accidents now may lead to major ones
later.
   In an article for a national daily at the beginning of December,
Kaanavicius said the plant was still dependent on Russian-speaking
and trained Russian migrant staff.
   He said that in five years since independence from the Soviet
Union, Lithuania had not trained new staff for the plant, which is
run now as it was when it opened by Russian engineers. Most of the
3,300 staff at the plant are Russian.
   "The Ignalina plant is ours, but it is run by others," said
Kazanavicius. He saw another danger if the Russian staff had to
leave the plant. He proposed that the plant be closed down as soon
as possible.
   There is also the danger that emergency procedures might not be
able to counter deliberate sabotage bids. In November 1994,
Lithuanian Kestutis Mazuika threatened to bomb the plant in the
name of a fictitious terrorist group, NUC-41 W, unless the Swedish
government paid him $8 million. He was arrested and jailed when he
turned up to collect the money.
   A range of projects to improve safety at Ignalina have been
completed or are still under way, including a 33 million ECU
program funded by the EBRD. The plant is 200 kilometers from Minsk,
500 from Warsaw, and 660 from Moscow or Stockholm.
   Ignalina itself contributed the equivalent of a further $5
million a year to the program, and aid has also been promised by
Sweden, Canada, Japan and the United States. The total being spent
on safety improvements at the site is now around $100 million.
   The managers of the plant are short of funds. They have even
tried to file a law suit against the national Lietuvos Energija
electricity company a few months ago to force the latter to pay
debts for energy already generated and sold. Last year's forced
suspension of two of the country's commercial banks has also held
up salary payments to plant staff.
   According to a U.S. Department of Energy's report on "Most
Dangerous Reactors", published this summer, Ignalina could be even
more dangerous than Chernobyl. Lithuania, however, denies this.
VATESI safety expert Alexander Aleyev told IPS last month that they
regarded the U.S. report technically inaccurate and out of date.
   Nevertheless Lithuania has set up a fund for the phased closure
and decommissioning of Ignalina by 2010 which it is estimated will
cost $600 million. Closure will not be easy and Deputy Power
Minister Saulius Kutas has said that Lithuania may consider
constructing a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina, which has
allowed Lithuania to export power to Belarus and Russia.
   Under an agreement signed with the Russian state power company
Energiya, the Lithuanian State Power System is also exporting
electricity to Russia in return for supplies of nuclear fuel. The
total value of the contract, which ends on May 1, 1996, is
estimated at $60 million.

BURUNDI-HUMAN RIGHTS:  END TO CYCLE OF POLITICAL KILLINGS SOUGHT

By IPS Correspondents
   PARIS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- More than 1,000 people are killed by
government forces or paramilitary groups each month in Burundi, but
the world continues to turn a blind eye to such atrocities, say
NGOs working in the strife-torn country.
   Most of those killed by the Tutsi-dominated security forces are
members of the Hutu ethnic group from which the majority political
party, Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), of President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, draws its support.
   "FRODEBU demands that the international community intervene, in
whatever form it can, including military or economic," said a
spokesman for the party in Paris.
   Ntibantunganya appealed for an end to the unrest in a New Year's
Day radio broadcast yesterday. He said Burundi faced "total
collapse" unless the violence is stemmed and blamed "fanatics" from
the Hutu majority, Tutsi minority and the Army.
   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are
swept away and defeated," said Ntibantunganya, speaking on state
radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
   Over 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the
current civil conflict broke out in October 1993. More than 1,300
have been killed since the start of November 1995, but the
international community has persistently failed its victims by its
silence and inaction, Amnesty says.
   Amnesty believes that many more massacres have gone unreported
in the inaccessible provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke where
fighting between government forces and rebels has intensified
during 1995. Most victims are unarmed women, children and the aged.
   "The government has shown itself incapable of preventing its
security forces from unlawfully killing unarmed civilians and
carrying out other human rights violations," said a spokesman for
the human rights NGO before the New Year holiday.
   "The first thing to do is to send the Army back to the
barracks," said the FRODEBU spokesman, "because it is the source
of instability in the country and made to respect the results of
the 1993 elections (which produced a Hutu president). Otherwise,
we are off to an interminable cycle of massacres and carnage."
   "It is a tragedy that the international community -- including
foreign diplomats and representatives of the U.N. and the
Organization of African Unity -- has become a powerless spectator,"
added Amnesty.
   In Paris Christian Raggioli, chief of operations in Burundi for
the French NGO Medecins du Monde said that they and other
humanitarian organizations have also been the target of attacks.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross and several other
aid agencies suspended their activities in Burundi last month. The
U.N. World Food Program said food distribution to the north and
northeast had been suspended again today.
   "Whether the armed people are bandits or para-military groups
of which side, we don't know," said Raggioli. "But we are worried
about the security of our volunteers." Some 150,000 Rwandan
refugees and 80,000 Burundians in Burundi depend on food aid.
   "Our objective is come to the aid of victims, whoever is the
aggressor," he said, but if their staff were prevented from
reaching victims, it would have to consider quitting the country.
"We won't endorse the massacres," he said. "Today, the situation
is almost untenable and it is possible that we will leave."
   But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said today that the
violence appeared to be easing slightly. There were no reports of
violence over the weekend, spokesman Ron Redmond told reporters in
Geneva.
   Amnesty has been collecting data on recent attacks. They cited
an attack by government forces surrounding Gasarara in Kanyosha
district, Rural Bujumbura province, on Nov. 14 and killed at least
430 unarmed civilians, virtually all of them Hutu.
   The soldiers also looted property and set houses on fire. There
are reports that some civilians were lured to assemble in a school,
ostensibly for their own protection, and then shot or bayonetted
to death.
   In a letter to the provincial governor dated Nov. 20, the
Kanyosha district administrator said he had counted 421 dead: 40
men, 73 women, 165 boys and 143 girls. An inquiry carried out by
security officials reportedly established that at least 430 people
were killed, while other sources claim that at least 500 people
were extrajudicially executed and many others "disappeared." The
results of the inquiry have not been made public.
   "One must put an end to the impunity of killers." said the
FRODEBU spokesman. "As soon as those responsible are identified,
they must be tried.
   "The silence of the international community?" added Raggioli.
"Maybe they are waiting for more massacres. For them to react, they
are probably waiting for the killings to surpass those in Rwanda.
In Rwanda, the killings already had to come to such proportions
before the international community stirred."
   Nearly 300 unarmed civilians, most of them Hutu, were reportedly
killed by government forces Dec. 6-7 in the suburbs of the capital
Bujumbura. At least 270 of the victims were killed in the suburban
area of Sororezo Hill by soldiers using automatic weapons, rockets
and helicopter gunships.
   The killings took place in the wake of what the Burundi
authorities said were clashes between government forces and rebels
belonging to the Hutu-dominated, National Council for the Defense
of Democracy (CNDD).
   The CNDD has denied involvement in the attacks. Some of the
attacks by government forces appear to be a continuation of
attempts by the Tutsi-dominated security forces to rid Bujumbura
of its Hutu population.
   Hutu armed groups have also killed scores of Tutsi. For example,
an armed gang attacked Campazi camp for displaced members of the
Tutsi ethnic group in Muruta district, Kirundo province and killed
about 40. Some of the killings by Tutsi militia have also been
carried out with the support or connivance of the security forces.
   Further killings were reported in Kanyosha district on Nov. 26
when soldiers attacked a group of youths playing football at
Nyamaboko primary school.
   Some soldiers reportedly accused one youth from Rumonge of being
a member of a gang which sabotaged a power station in Rumonge. They
beat and then shot the youth dead. Other youths fled in panic and
were pursued by the soldiers. Soldiers then went on the rampage in
the area and killed as many as 500 people.
   Although most of the killings are carried out by government
troops, Burundi authorities complain that the Tutsi-led army is
being demonized, a Bujumbura-based observer told Amnesty
International.
   Hutu-dominated and Tutsi armed groups appear to be almost in
competition to see who can kill the most members of rival groups,
say Amnesty. On the nights of Nov. 1 and 2 at least four people
were shot dead and about 20 wounded by an armed gang in Buyenzi,
a suburb of Bujumbura, said Amnesty researchers.
   Prominent citizens continue to be targeted by members of the
security forces and armed groups. On Dec. 2 at least five Hutu were
taken away by soldiers in Mutanga-Nord suburb of Bujumbura.
   They included Elie Ndikumana, an official of the Ministry of
Public Works and Equipment, Dr. Gaspard Nzikobanyanka, Nestor
Katihabwa, a Burundi University student, Sylvestre Niyonzima and
a nightwatchman named Donatien. Their bodies and the body of
another person were found near Bujumbura airport several days
later.
   And during a counter-insurgency operation on Dec. 6-7 government
forces also attacked the homes of several Hutu officials, including
that of Augustin Nzojibwami, the Secretary General of FRODEBU,
Fabien Sagatwa, Secretary of State for Security, and Antoinette
Bazikwankana, a former presidency official.

CONGO-LABOR:  SALARY PAYMENTS A BIG SURPRISE FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS

By Nana Rosine Ngangoue
   BRAZZAVILLE, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- If you had gone a year without pay
and then got a windfall lump sum, how would you feel? Exuberant
say Congo's long-suffering but for now happy civil servants.
   Bar owners and shop keepers are also smiling as traffic jams in
downtown Brazzaville attest to the booming following the
government's payment in December of four months back pay owed to
public workers.
   "They treated us like beggars. We'd become beggars. Now I'm
happy that we got four months salary in the space of a month,"
rejoices Augustin Elenga, a journalist at the state-owned Congolese
Information Agency.
   Paid irregularly for nearly five years and not paid at all for
more than twelve months, civil servants were on the cutting-edge
of Congo's economic and political malaise.
   After multiparty polls in 1993 swept away an oppressive single
party system, this central African state's new government, led by
technocrat president Pascal Lissouba, claimed their predecessors
had drained the state's coffers and run up a foreign debt of $5
billion.
   Economic recovery was further hampered by ethnic-based political
conflict that pitted government supporters against the opposition,
killing 2,000 and displacing 20,000 other people at its height.
Congo, with a population of just 2.5 million, seemed irretrievably
lost to chaos.
   "We endured the toughest of Calvaries. We were no longer living,
we were surviving. When I think that my landlord evicted me and
that my children lost a year of schooling as we were unable to meet
the fees, I tell myself that I passed through a terrible time in
my life," recalls Kengue Cyr, a public servant.
   For many, however, hope has returned with the big pay envelope
and a commitment to the regularization of salaries by the
government, one of the aims of a new three-year structural
adjustment program (SAP) agreed to in December by the government
and the International Monetary Fund.
   There has also been a series of talks between the government and
opposition to ease the political crisis.
   Congo's adjustment program comprises several measures to
stimulate growth in a country where gross domestic product (GDP)
registered minus 4.6 per cent in 1994, and to increase employment.
From January, salaries and pensions of civil service are to be paid
on time.
   Economic recovery has also been shored up by new contracts
between the state and oil production firms, increasing the state's
stake in the sector. Official statistics reveal that in 1996 oil
is expected to bring in $315 million.
   The effect of the public servants windfall is evident throughout
the capital, with bars and other places of entertainment chock
full.
   "There's a mad crowd here today because of the money circulating
in the capital. Before, we couldn't expect so many people," says
one barman here.
   In people's homes there is also a tangible psychological relief.
   "You can't tell how much we've relaxed now. We've paid all our
debts, that's a great relief to me," says Honorine Samba, a
teacher's wife.
   But the sudden circulation of a great deal of money has also
triggered inflation. In the city's markets, vendors are marking up
prices and the cost of clothes in particular have soared.
   "If this goes on, we won't be able to manage. Vendors don't
realize that the money we've just been paid is to pay our debts,"
says Elenga, whose joy is tainted with apprehension about the
future.
   "It's true that I'm smiling, but this happiness is limited as
we're afraid they'll stop the payments and we'll be back at square
one," the journalist confides. "I hope that this good fortune
lasts, but above all that we're paid all the outstanding salaries."
   Prime Minister Jacques Joachim Yombi Opangault recently promised
that regular salaries were back to stay. How far the promise will
hold remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Brazzaville has once again
become a sociable and happy town.

NIGERIA-MEDIA:  ABIOLA'S NEWSPAPER BACK ON THE STREETS

By Toye Olori
   LAGOS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- "You missed me because I was severely
Abachalized," explains a cartoon man in plaster on the back page
of the Concord, an independent newspaper which hit the streets
today after an 18-month ban.
   Owned by jailed Nigerian opposition politician Moshood Abiola,
who is widely believed to have won Nigeria's 1993 presidential
elections, the paper was shut down in August 1994 by Gen. Sani
Abacha.
   The Guardian and Punch, also privately-owned, were also closed
at the height of protests intended to force the military out of
power and bring about installation of Abiola, jailed on treason
charges after declaring himself president on the anniversary of the
annulled election.
   An unreserved apology to the head of state for any transgression
against either the government or the person of Abacha from the
paper's management brought the Guardian a reprieve in July 1995.
   "I hope unlike the Concord and Punch that the Guardian will show
genuine remorse and reciprocate the government's gesture of
goodwill," Abacha told the paper's management and members of the
Newspaper Proprietor's Association of Nigeria.
   But the Concord and Punch, among the largest circulation papers
before the ban, refused to give in and remained proscribed until
October 1995.
   Physical damage to its printing machines hampered the Concord's
resumption of operations, sources close to the newspaper say. But
its first issue back on the streets was as fearless and provocative
as ever.
   Today's lead story focused on democracy and the war between the
military government and the international community, while the back
page carried a six-column headline "Ogonis to Mourn Saro-Wiwa,
others" a reference to the recent execution of the minority rights
campaigner that triggered international outrage.
   The front page editorial announced: "We do not regard the
unbanning as a special favor to be reciprocated with a show of
remorse and contrition, but as a belated undoing of what should not
have been done in the first place."
   "If the Concord and other newspapers that were peremptorily
banned had breached the laws of the country, the authorities should
have prosecuted them in the law courts, unless they have no faith
in the judiciary," the editorial reads.
   The editorial thanked "all men and women of goodwill, at home
and abroad, whose appeals, according to General Sani Abacha, moved
him to lift the ban." But it notes that the appeals, however
well-intentioned, are ultimately subversive of the rule of law and
democracy.
   "They invest in persons to whom they are directed powers that
they do not posses and ought not to possess, powers that, in
effect, set them above the constitution," the editorial insists.
   The paper's tone has rekindled fears that it may be heading for
a fresh collision with Abacha's regime.
   "The Concord has to be tactical in its criticisms of this
government or it might incur the wrath of the military and its
security operatives as is happening to some opposition newspapers
now," says Biola Alagoa, a journalist.
   "If they (military government) cannot close the papers down
because of the negative impact it will have on their image, they
can at least burn their buildings and equipment down to prevent
them from publishing," Alagoa continues.
   This seems an oblique reference to the fires that gutted the
premises of the newly-opened Guardian two weeks ago and the News
Magazine on New Year's Eve.
   The finger has been pointed at security agents as both
publications were ardent critics of government. "This is the
beginning of new tactics to force opposition papers out of
circulation. It is government of thuggery," Alagoa alleged.
   Revealing that the fire at the News Magazine caused extensive
damage to vital documents, computers and other electronic
equipment, editor-in-chief Dapo Olorunyomi shares Alagoa's
suspicions.
   "Though nothing was stolen, put in the context of the Guardian
fire about two weeks ago, we suspect arson. Only our own floor was
burnt in the four-story building," Olorunyomi said.
   Tell, another combative privately-owned news magazine has also
repeatedly run afoul of the government. On Dec. 17, 55,000 copies
of the magazine were seized at the printers by security agents. Six
days later, another 50,000 copies were seized six days later
editor-in-chief Nosa Igiebor was arrested and detained.
   The Dec. 25 edition of the magazine was titled "Abiola's
Freedom: The World Waits for Abacha" while the New Year's Day
edition seized on Dec. 23 bore the title: "Abacha is Adamant;
Terrorizes the Opposition".
