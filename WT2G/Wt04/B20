Don't we ever think about the time
Different ways that you can help me hide
Is it so wrong that we feel the way we do
Gotta figure out to cut the line, yeah!

Could you ever feel this way again
Will it be the same as it began
I can only lick up so much for so long
Something in the way to feel again

Always in my place, see that it's not well
The sickness on my face will change 
But you would not believe it

Everything I'm watching from the sky
I can't remember nothing passing by
There is no risk here if I can't tell it now
Waiting for the day to end besides

Always in my place, see that it's not well
The sickness on my face will change but you can't tell

And I don't even know what I should be
All I know is how I could feel
I just wish I could tell what I should say
And I don't know, I don't know

It's out into the tunnel and can't stop
The senile have to count up all they got
Sometime, someone is gonna have to choose
And figure out what counts from day to day

Is that hard for us to understand?
It's sitting on our chest and here's the end
How's that for karma in the western state?
Now we have to feel how much we hate

Always in my place, see that it's not well
The sickness on my face will change but you can't tell

Always in my place, see that it's not well
The sickness on my face will change but you can't tell

Paperboy doesn't bring me the news
He only brings one side to choose
So how can we see both sides clearly?
My idols all have gone away
They left and never bothered to say
So maybe they're not all I thought that they should be 
Yeah

Everything's okay in the summer
At least it seems to be in my mind
If I come across just like the others
Nothing ever be the same

Heroin frosted flakes are warm
My neighborhood's been ripped and torn
But I will always buy what you sell me
As long as I can blame the cross
I'm not responsible for my loss
I've cheapened something that is so taboo, oh yeah

Everything's okay in the summer                       Time
At least it seems to be in my mind                    Mind
If I come across just like the others
                          Come across just like the others
Nothing ever be the same in time

You're a freak and I'm going to be okay
I just gotta figure out what I should say
What's good for you isn't good for me
I'll just have to stay on the cool side of the street

Your pointed finger doesn't bother me
I hope my fist doesn't bother you
But I've gotta stop that way of thinking
I wish I could complain some more
But my head and voice are sore
And I don't feel like talking to you right now

Said everything's okay in the summer                  Time
At least it seems to be in my mind                    Mind
If I come across just like the others
                          Come across just like the others
Nothing ever be the same in time

Everything's okay in the summertime 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah                                Time
At least it seems to be in my mind                    Mind
If I come across just like the others
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah    Come across just like the others
Nothing'd ever be the same in time

Picture perfect on a Sunday, it's only perfect in his head
All this time her mind's not with him
He's better off the worse she gets
This reality was once just a terrible dream

The gorgeous morning takes a bad turn
Forgive forget with naive grace
Melodramatic acting with exaggerated face

One day a big wind's gonna come and blow away
All of those things inside that we are so scared to say
And if the change is wrong and nothing good is left
I'll let my head hang, I just might be better off dead

The family still sees the beauty
What's grey and dull and left alone
It's not quite paradise but this is better than home
In the hallways of the city 
The blame is saved and it's not mine
It's so godawful and wonderful at the same time

One day a big wind's gonna come and blow away
All of those things inside that we are so scared to say
And if the change is wrong and nothing good is left
I'll let my head hang, I just might be better off dead

Think about what's really happening
Watch and see the house as it sinks
The starving and the sickness and the hurt
It's never getting better, only worse

When will it wash away, yeah, yeah 
Someday will wash away
When will it wash away, yeah, yeah 
Someday will wash away

Maybe I don't know much about the way we're going
Maybe I can't see both sides again
Through the garbage time and the other ideas inside
When it springs up, do they ever bend, oh yeah

From what I know, what I know
There will always be another
From what I know, what I know 
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again

Could you help me laugh?  Can I help you wake up and stand?
There's only a few who can walk like that
And if the words are vague 
It doesn't equate them with genius
Some are not quite ready for that yet

From what I know, what I know
There will always be another
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again

Never mind the wrinkles 
We can always hide them if we need to
We'll cover up the cracks and freaks 
And devils if we have to

To all my weirdo friends 
They never seem to know the difference
From their hollow minds come hollow words
And I get hypnotized 
And I can't hold my tongue back sometimes
It's never really fun until it burns, oh yeah

From what I know, what I know
There will always be another
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again
It's what I want, it's what I want, it's what I want again

With how you're always telling me what to do
Hey, Mr. Sun King, don't you ever wanna sit and listen
I've got an idea 
That I might just figure this out someday
I've got an idea 
That I might just get through to you someday

It never changes 
'Cause I sit right back with my hands crossed
Coming unglued, think you're coming unglued

Hey, keep that banner up 
'Cause I need someone to fly it for me
Hey, Mr. TV, thank you for the years of mindless answers
We don't know much about the gutter 
But I'm sure you'll help us
We don't wear snakeskin 
But that green shade fits you so well
Because

Anything could happen when my last words finally get said
They might be everything I know
The only thing that's left from years of habit
And the self-abuse just turned around and ran to go
What's the point in helping you 
When I can't even help myself
Said what's it all really for
And I know I told you that I'd quit today, I'd quit today
But come tomorrow, I'll want more

And I'm waiting                       I never take my time
For something                      Wakes up in my mind (?)
And I'm waiting                       I never take my time
Around

I pulled the hammer on the last day of my child's mind
So I could clear it up again
When he looks in the mirror 
Does he see the same things you do
He'll try to change it when he can
'Cause it's like the dog who loves to taste that hand
The hand that feeds, you know he loves to watch it bleed
And I know it's coming 
So I throw down all those things inside
I'm never taking what I need

And I'm waiting                       I never take my time
For something                      Wakes up in my mind (?)

And hope to still clean the house
And hope to shake the temple

Oh, what's the difference?  What's the difference?
What's the difference, I say?

I cannot stand your angle, I cannot smell your disease
But instead of kicking back 
I will say, yeah, yeah, yeah, what I know

<h1>The Shining Road </h1>
An overview of persons, places, and things of interest to myself, including
certain personages of whom I have the honour of calling my friends.
<br clear=all>

<hr>

<em>See also adjoining <a href="appendix.html">appendix of friends and interests</a>.</em>

<hr>

It was brought to my attention some years ago that the shoes a person
wears are intimately connected to that person's character.  Thus, I
will begin this short monologue by describing my own.  On the floor,
not too far away from my door (a very plain door, it could be said,
when taken from the inside, but the outside is a rather different
story.  It has a strange mask made of fun-tack on it, several signs
including one with the words ``Radioactive When Wet'' and another one
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/kcf/censor/">protesting</a>
the ban of some usenet newsgroups at CMU.  In any case, that lies
beyond the scope of this page, so I won't bore you with details about
how the administration was utterly clueless and mishandled nearly
everything.) <p>

Leaving the door, we pass several coats hanging from conveniently
placed hooks on the walls of this short entry corridor and find the
object of our investigation--my shoes, in case you have forgotten in
the course of my unfortunate wandering above--sitting in a row on the
floor. <p>

On the left is a pair of black suede shoes, in a style known as
modified Oxfords, or by the name I prefer, Byrons.  These shoes are
somewhat worn, but care has been put into their keeping, since they
are one of but a few pairs of shoes I have the honor to own.
Immediately to their right are two pair of canvas converse all-stars,
bearing the name of Charles Taylor and known affectionately as
``Chucks''.  One pair is black, and the other plaid and actually
constructed of a material far less durable than canvas, which may
explain their sad condition. These chucks are not generally worn in
matched sets, and one can discern this by noticing that there is only
one pair of laces to distribute between the four shoes and that
currently only one black and one plaid shoe are laced. <p>

The final pair of shoes (accounting for a grand total of four pair, in
case our honored reader has not been keeping track) is a pair of
hiking boots which appear to have taken much wear, although this
writer assures the reader to avoid any false pretenses that this
appearance is solely due to use over a long period of time, and not
the constant stresses of climbing the mountain of arguably
less-than-worthwhile material that separates the door of this room
from the bed. <p>

Now that the finer points of my shoes have been brought to your
attention, I will reveal to you a short list of my acquaintances and
interests. <p>

In this room I reside with <a href="http://omega.mac.cc.cmu.edu/">Jeremiah Blatz</a> and Dan Root.  One might consider
three other entities as living in the room with us--these being olivier,
omega and ghost, the computers used by each of us.  (We are all, at the
time of this writing, engaged in the study of computer science, although
my dear friend Jer may soon switch to another related field in order to
satisfy his desire to create objects of great aesthetic value to people
other than computer scientists.) <p>

On my desk is olivier, surrounded by the sort of clutter of items that
seems to accumulate around me during day-to-day living.  Also on the
main level of my desk is a container of tapes, sixty in number, all
with the black-on-white labels that show they were given to me by
another dear friend, <a href="gopher://comtch.iea.com:79/Xshietala">S. Ellen Hietala</a>.
Atop that container is a copy of Romanov's Russian-English
English-Russian Dictionary which has not been, I am sorry to say,
opened in some time.  And above that is a light which, pleasantly,
gets little use. <p>

The top part of my desk--more properly a hutch, is rather more
imposing.  It rises to a great height of some eight feet and contains
much of value to me.  First, my CD collection, which continues to
grow, much more quickly than my tape collection.  The fault for this
lies in the stereo above, which is more adept at playing CDs than
tapes.  This stereo sometimes frightens people on first sight, as it
has rather more knobs and frobnitzim than most.  On the same shelf as
the CDs reside a photograph of my <a href="visigoth.html">family</a>,
a screwdriver, a candle, and a music box of non-Russian manufacture,
but of distinctly Russian design, showing five scenes from
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. <p>

Next to the stereo, which in truth is on top of the hutch, is a milk
crate which contains another candle, a strange contraption constructed
from LEGOs which was given to me by yet another Dear Friend, this one
named <a href="http://128.180.104.9/jillstuff/welcome.html">Jill</a>.
The item of my greatest affection in this box is a cherub, given to me
by my dearest Ellen. <p>

Finally, atop everything else, are four flags.  Three of these have
some commonality, while the fourth is added for purely aesthetic
value.  (You may discover the wrong commonality by looking at them.
Or perhaps not.)  The flags are of Great Britain, Australia, New
Zealand, and Papua/New Guinea.  Feel free to speculate on the meaning
of this. <p>

Olivier, by the way, is named after the great British actor Sir
Laurence Olivier, whom I revere greatly.  Olivier runs Linux, and is
in fact most likely the computer which has served this page to you.
It has a 1GB SCSI disk, but only 8 megabytes of memory--so I may have
in fact noticed the sound of the disk activity change when you
accessed this. <p>

Down the hall from me live the ever-enigmatic
<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/rw3u/">Roger</a>,
<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/gh2e/">Sumner</a>, and
<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/ak4q/">Anu</a>.  They
deserve more than passing interest, since they've been my friends
since last year, at least, but I'll allow them to present themselves
more completely on their own home pages. <p>

In any case, I am sure this information can be, if not illuminating,
printed out and used as toilet tissue of the highest grade. <p>

Blessed be in your walks on the shining road of life, and when you
meet someone, look at their shoes.  Hell.  It might be me.

<h1> A Russo-Gaelic Rennaisance Man </h1>

<p> Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is John McClary Prevost.
Throughout the years, I have been known by many other names. My
immediately family persists in calling me Jack, as they have done for
many many years, though I started going by John some while ago. When I
was on electronic bulletin boards, I called myself the Bishop, in
honor both of the chess piece and Harry Harrison's criminal
mastermind. Now I go by Visigoth... This name comes from my
fascination with things gothic (which I define in a slightly different
way than other people might), and my origins in the west.  Spokane to
be exact.  Spokane, Washington. </p>

<p> Spokane is the second largest city in Washington state. Second is,
of course, only a relative term. Relative to Seattle, one of the
larger cities in my part of the world. Especially if you consider the
other cities in the area that are inseperable from it to be part of
the whole. That is, however, immaterial. Spokane lies in the middle of
wheat country--the Palouse Hills. Several generations ago, my family
on my mother's side migrated to the area by way of the Oregon trail.
They were in a group of seven great families that settled the area
(Hamilton, Blish, Hodgen, Young, Pankey, and I can't remember the other two.)
Intermarriage occured, of course, since there weren't many other
groups in the area, and the families became a group.  This is why the
large family reunions that happened every two years come to mind when
I think about family.  </p>

<p> My mom's family is pretty much standard standard rural
american--straight-laced, football watching, country music listening
hicks. Not a bad bunch, but not my style. My mom avoided coming to be
just like them when she met my father.  (I am told they married after
knowing each other for less than a month, on the set of "The Taming of
the Shrew". They were somewhat hippieish, coming in on the end of that
era. The men at the wedding all wore formal dress with their hair tied
back with ribbons. I've seen pictures, and it was indeed a sight.) Anyway.  Dad was
raised as a city kid. His family comes from Detroit, but moved to
Spokane when he was young. His dad was a maniac (balding, as all the
Prevost men seem to be, and jolly, even though he hated to be called
Grandpa...  He wanted all us kids to call him "Doug" (his name), so we
called him Grandpa Doug.  He grew to accept this, though he never
really liked kids much.)  On the fourth of July, Grandpa Doug would
take old pipes and such and launch bottle rockets at the neighbors. He
was a socialist, and never worked to hide his views, nor did he keep
the <i>Russia Today</i> magazines that came to his door wrapped in
brown paper hidden. Doug was always fascinated by Russia. This is, I
suppose, where my fascination with Russia comes from.  </p>

<p> My father's mother, Grandma Shirley, was always quiet and
reserved, trying to hold a family of <em>very</em> opinionated people
together. Her parents were both Irish. The McClarys. They traveled to
Spokane via Canada, crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific in three
generations. (My mom's family's history in the U.S.  goes back much
further.) All of her children except for one had red hair. I don't
have red hair--but my beard is red. This is, without a doubt, where my
fascination with Eire and things Celtic comes from.  </p>

<p> My father was raised Catholic (including Catholic school and the
like), and my mother was raised Lutheran. They raised my sister
Natalie and I to be agnostic.  It's anybody's guess what her religion
will end up as. I sincerely hope she remains agnostic. It's a good way
to be accepting, if you don't try to force it on others. Myself, I
have ended up with a rather Pagan viewpoint. My philosophy rules my
life much more than any religious belief, but if any gods do exist, I
believe that they are multiple. I also believe in force of will.
Whether that is magic or not, I cannot say. In essence--I do not
believe that my beliefs in this area effect whether I do good or not,
so I try to avoid worrying about it. I am, as in all things,
irreverant.  </p>

<p> I'm working right now as a Systems Programmer for facilities in
the CS department here at Carnegie Mellon. In the past, I've worked as
a consultant in the computer clusters, and I've done extensive work in
desktop publishing. Since I don't use Macs too much any more, I don't
know the quirks of the latest programs, but I like to think my grasp
on the ideals of page layout is still good. In my current job, I've
created a database for keeping track of CS department alumni, and a
software availability database listing what software is available for
what platforms in the department. I'm currenty the Linux support
person in the department, as well as the Linux SIG knight for the CMU
Student Computer Club, and generally one of the Linux gurus on campus.
I also like Perl.  In a recent development, I'm trying to attain
sufficient AIX clue to become the full-time AIX support person in the
department. As my friend Anu says: ``Staff-job having bastard? Stay
tuned!'' </p>

<p> I'm working on an archive of lyrics for my favorite bands... (The
music link off of these pages, with the dotted eighth note...) Check
back, occasionally. Feel free to mail me any ideas you have for links
to add to my poem, and I'll change the poem again one of these days.
</p>

<p> Oh--I've got some friends in the area, too...  Jer's my roommate.
Sidney's gone now, and Dan has moved in. Anu's kind of depressing
sometimes, but seems much happier lately. He likes owls. Jill's a
dear. Roger's something different. Ben's got good taste in music.
Sumner's a math major with too much time on his hands, and Mike's a
god. </p>

<p> There's a visigoth at Caltech on the west coast who's also into
Linux, but he's not me. I actually have no idea who he is. Because of
this, I go by Ostragoth on the very rare occasions that I use IRC.
</p>

<p> Peace, and Blessed Be.  </p>

  <h1> ``Alone'' <br>
        <cite> <font size=4> Edgar Allan Poe </font> </cite> </h1>

  <blockquote>
	From <a href="http://128.180.104.9/jillstuff/welcome.html"> 
		childhood</a>'s hour I have not been <br>
	As <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/">

	As <a href="http://www.dementia.org/"> others </a> saw;

	My heart to joy at the same tone; <br>
	And all I loved, I <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/dr4b/home.html">loved</a> alone. <br>
	Then- in my childhood, in the dawn <br>
	Of a most stormy life- was drawn <br>
	From every <a href="http://omega.mac.cc.cmu.edu/">

	The mystery which binds me still: <br>
	From the torrent, or the fountain, <br>
	From the red cliff of the mountain, <br>
	From the sun that round me rolled <br>
	In its autumn tint of gold, <br>
	From the lightning in the sky <br>
	As it passed me flying by, <br>
	From the thunder and the storm, <br>
	And the <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/ak4q/">

	(When the rest of <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs/usr/mah/www/">

	Of a demon in my view.

<h1>The Shining Road </h1>
An overview of persons, places, and things of interest to myself, including
certain personages of whom I have the honour of calling my friends.
<br clear=all>

<hr>

<em>See also adjoining <a href="appendix.html">appendix of friends and interests</a>.</em>

<hr>

It was brought to my attention some years ago that the shoes a person
wears are intimately connected to that person's character.  Thus, I
will begin this short monologue by describing my own.  On the floor,
not too far away from my door (a very plain door, it could be said,
when taken from the inside, but the outside is a rather different
story.  It has a strange mask made of fun-tack on it, several signs
including one with the words ``Radioactive When Wet'' and another one
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/kcf/censor/">protesting</a>
the ban of some usenet newsgroups at CMU.  In any case, that lies
beyond the scope of this page, so I won't bore you with details about
how the administration was utterly clueless and mishandled nearly
everything.) <p>

Leaving the door, we pass several coats hanging from conveniently
placed hooks on the walls of this short entry corridor and find the
object of our investigation--my shoes, in case you have forgotten in
the course of my unfortunate wandering above--sitting in a row on the
floor. <p>

On the left is a pair of black suede shoes, in a style known as
modified Oxfords, or by the name I prefer, Byrons.  These shoes are
somewhat worn, but care has been put into their keeping, since they
are one of but a few pairs of shoes I have the honor to own.
Immediately to their right are two pair of canvas converse all-stars,
bearing the name of Charles Taylor and known affectionately as
``Chucks''.  One pair is black, and the other plaid and actually
constructed of a material far less durable than canvas, which may
explain their sad condition. These chucks are not generally worn in
matched sets, and one can discern this by noticing that there is only
one pair of laces to distribute between the four shoes and that
currently only one black and one plaid shoe are laced. <p>

The final pair of shoes (accounting for a grand total of four pair, in
case our honored reader has not been keeping track) is a pair of
hiking boots which appear to have taken much wear, although this
writer assures the reader to avoid any false pretenses that this
appearance is solely due to use over a long period of time, and not
the constant stresses of climbing the mountain of arguably
less-than-worthwhile material that separates the door of this room
from the bed. <p>

Now that the finer points of my shoes have been brought to your
attention, I will reveal to you a short list of my acquaintances and
interests. <p>

In this room I reside with <a href="http://omega.mac.cc.cmu.edu/">Jeremiah Blatz</a> and Dan Root.  One might consider
three other entities as living in the room with us--these being olivier,
omega and ghost, the computers used by each of us.  (We are all, at the
time of this writing, engaged in the study of computer science, although
my dear friend Jer may soon switch to another related field in order to
satisfy his desire to create objects of great aesthetic value to people
other than computer scientists.) <p>

On my desk is olivier, surrounded by the sort of clutter of items that
seems to accumulate around me during day-to-day living.  Also on the
main level of my desk is a container of tapes, sixty in number, all
with the black-on-white labels that show they were given to me by
another dear friend, <a href="gopher://comtch.iea.com:79/Xshietala">S. Ellen Hietala</a>.
Atop that container is a copy of Romanov's Russian-English
English-Russian Dictionary which has not been, I am sorry to say,
opened in some time.  And above that is a light which, pleasantly,
gets little use. <p>

The top part of my desk--more properly a hutch, is rather more
imposing.  It rises to a great height of some eight feet and contains
much of value to me.  First, my CD collection, which continues to
grow, much more quickly than my tape collection.  The fault for this
lies in the stereo above, which is more adept at playing CDs than
tapes.  This stereo sometimes frightens people on first sight, as it
has rather more knobs and frobnitzim than most.  On the same shelf as
the CDs reside a photograph of my <a href="visigoth.html">family</a>,
a screwdriver, a candle, and a music box of non-Russian manufacture,
but of distinctly Russian design, showing five scenes from
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. <p>

Next to the stereo, which in truth is on top of the hutch, is a milk
crate which contains another candle, a strange contraption constructed
from LEGOs which was given to me by yet another Dear Friend, this one
named <a href="http://128.180.104.9/jillstuff/welcome.html">Jill</a>.
The item of my greatest affection in this box is a cherub, given to me
by my dearest Ellen. <p>

Finally, atop everything else, are four flags.  Three of these have
some commonality, while the fourth is added for purely aesthetic
value.  (You may discover the wrong commonality by looking at them.
Or perhaps not.)  The flags are of Great Britain, Australia, New
Zealand, and Papua/New Guinea.  Feel free to speculate on the meaning
of this. <p>

Olivier, by the way, is named after the great British actor Sir
Laurence Olivier, whom I revere greatly.  Olivier runs Linux, and is
in fact most likely the computer which has served this page to you.
It has a 1GB SCSI disk, but only 8 megabytes of memory--so I may have
in fact noticed the sound of the disk activity change when you
accessed this. <p>

Down the hall from me live the ever-enigmatic
<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/rw3u/">Roger</a>,
<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/gh2e/">Sumner</a>, and
<a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/u/ak4q/">Anu</a>.  They
deserve more than passing interest, since they've been my friends
since last year, at least, but I'll allow them to present themselves
more completely on their own home pages. <p>

In any case, I am sure this information can be, if not illuminating,
printed out and used as toilet tissue of the highest grade. <p>

Blessed be in your walks on the shining road of life, and when you
meet someone, look at their shoes.  Hell.  It might be me.

<h1>bauhaus <br> ``The Sanity Assassin''</h1>

<blockquote>
sinister echos clutching at straws<br>
letter boxes screaming<br>
you try to pin him to the wall<br>
you end up on the ceiling<br>
locked in a dome<br>
the shadows flicker by<br>
he's the madcap pusher<br>
delerium the drug he's dealing<br>
<br>
he drops a capsule in your drink<br>
and spikes your dreams with madness<br>
<br>
he's the sniper in the hills<br>
hiding in the holes in your head<br>
he's the poison in your poison<br>
the razor in your bead<br>
hanging on a picture<br>
eye lid needle and thread<br>
you empty yourself once again<br>
he's always one step ahead<br>
was it whispers in your ear<br>
nothing that you said ?<br>
he's walking your sleep now<br>
he keeps your fat paranoia well fed<br>
<br>
he drops a capsule...<br>
<br>
the sanity assassin stays up all night stalking<br>
the sanity assassin picks off victims like flys<br>
the sanity assassin lets his fingers do the walking<br>
the sanity assassin the crack shot between your eyes<br>
he's got you in his sights<br>
<br>
he drops a capsule...

<h1>bauhaus <br> ``Dark Entries''</h1>

<blockquote>
Caressing bent up to the jug again<br>
With sheaths and pills<br>
Invading all those stills<br>
In a hovel of a bed<br>
I will scream in pain<br>
Oh please, miss lane<br>
Leave me with some pain<br>
Went walking through this city's neon lights<br>
In fear of disguising my warping seething<br>
Pressure lines and graceless heirs<br>
Intangible of price<br>
Trying so hard to fine what? what was right<br>
I came upon your room it stuck into my head<br>
We leapt into the bed degrading even lice<br>
You took delight in taking down<br>
All my shielded pride<br>
Until exposed became my darker side<br>
Puckering up and down some avenue of sin<br>
Too cheap to ride they're woth a try<br>
If only for the old times, cold times<br>
Don't go waving your pretentious love<br>
He's soliciting on his tan brown brogues<br>
Gyrating through some lonesome devil's row<br>
Pinpointing well meaning upper class prey<br>
Of walking money check possessing holes<br>
He often sleekly offers his services<br>
Exploitation of his finer years<br>
Work with loosely woven fabrics<br>
Of lonely office clerks<br>
Any lay suffices his dollar green eye

I dare you, to be real<br>
To touch a flickering flame<br>

Don't cower in night fright<br>
<br>
Don't back away just yet<br>
From destinations set<br>
I dare you to be proud<br>

Like sound from bells to peal<br>
I dare you to speak of your despise<br>
For bureaucracy, hypocrisy--all liars<br>

<blockquote>
A gut pull drag on me<br>
Into the chasm gaping we<br>
Mirrors multi-reflecting this<br>
Between spunk stained sheet<br>
And odourous whim<br>
Calm eye-flick-shudder within<br>
Assist me to walk away in sin<br>
Where is the string that Theseus laid<br>
Fine me out this labyrinth place.<br>
<br>
I do get bored, I get bored<br>
In the flat field.<br>
I get bored, I do get bored<br>
In the flat field.<br>
<br>
Let me catch the slit of light<br>
For a maidens sake<br>
On a maiden flight<br>
In the flat fireld I do get bored<br>
Replace with Piccadilly whores<br>
In my yearning for some cerebral fix<br>
Transfer me to that solid plain<br>
Hammer me into the blazen pain<br>
Moulding shapes no shame to waste<br>
Moulding shapes no shame to waste<br>
And drage me there with deafening haste.

<h1>bauhaus <br> ``A God in an Alcove''</h1>

<blockquote>
Go and look for the dejected once proud<br>
Idol remembered in stone aloud<br>
Then on coins his face was mirrored<br>
Take a look it soon hath slithered<br>
To a fractured marble slab, renunciation clad<br>
His nourishment extract from his subjects<br>
That mass production profile<br>
<br>
He's a God--in--in an alcove.<br>
<br>
Once he spread the rain<br>
So they dreamt in vain<br>
Once he spread the wheat<br>
Had made garlands for his feet<br>
Until the lily poet of our times<br>
Horizoned on the line<br>
Love became the in theme then<br>
Opposing fakirs thrice by ten<br>
Don't perceive his empty plea<br>
That's redundant effigy.<br>
<br>
He's a God--in--in an alcove.<br>
<br>
Take in view his empty stool<br>
What's left is satin cool<br>
Clawing adornment for his crimes<br>
They saw they had to draw the line<br>
So they sent him far away<br>
So they sent him far away<br>
To a little alcove<br>
To a little alcove<br>
All alone.<br>
<br>
He's a God, a God.<br>
<br>
Now I am silly<br>
Now I am silly<br>
Silly, silly, silly, silly,
Silly.

perlxs - XS language reference manual
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlxs_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_introduction_0">
Introduction</A>
</H2>
XS is a language used to create an extension interface
between Perl and some C library which one wishes to use with
Perl.  The XS interface is combined with the library to
create a new library which can be linked to Perl.  An <STRONG>XSUB</STRONG>
is a function in the XS language and is the core component
of the Perl application interface.
<p>The XS compiler is called <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG>.  This compiler will embed
the constructs necessary to let an XSUB, which is really a C
function in disguise, manipulate Perl values and creates the
glue necessary to let Perl access the XSUB.  The compiler
uses <STRONG>typemaps</STRONG> to determine how to map C function parameters
and variables to Perl values.  The default typemap handles
many common C types.  A supplement typemap must be created
to handle special structures and types for the library being
linked.
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlxstut.html">
the <EM>perlxstut</EM> manpage</A>
 for a tutorial on the whole extension creation process.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_on_0">
On The Road</A>
</H2>
Many of the examples which follow will concentrate on creating an interface
between Perl and the ONC+ RPC bind library functions.  The <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM>
function is used to demonstrate many features of the XS language.  This
function has two parameters; the first is an input parameter and the second
is an output parameter.  The function also returns a status value.
<p>
<XMP>
        bool_t rpcb_gettime(const char *host, time_t *timep);

</XMP>
<p>From C this function will be called with the following
statements.
<p>
<XMP>
     #include <rpc/rpc.h>
     bool_t status;
     time_t timep;
     status = rpcb_gettime( "localhost", &timep );

</XMP>
<p>If an XSUB is created to offer a direct translation between this function
and Perl, then this XSUB will be used from Perl with the following code.
The <STRONG>$status</STRONG> and <STRONG>$timep</STRONG> variables will contain the output of the function.
<p>
<XMP>
     use RPC;
     $status = rpcb_gettime( "localhost", $timep );

</XMP>
<p>The following XS file shows an XS subroutine, or XSUB, which
demonstrates one possible interface to the <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM>
function.  This XSUB represents a direct translation between
C and Perl and so preserves the interface even from Perl.
This XSUB will be invoked from Perl with the usage shown
above.  Note that the first three #include statements, for
<CODE>EXTERN.h</CODE>, <CODE>perl.h</CODE>, and <CODE>XSUB.h</CODE>, will always be present at the
beginning of an XS file.  This approach and others will be
expanded later in this document.
<p>
<XMP>
     #include "EXTERN.h"
     #include "perl.h"
     #include "XSUB.h"
     #include <rpc/rpc.h>
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC
     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &timep
          OUTPUT:
          timep

</XMP>
<p>Any extension to Perl, including those containing XSUBs,
should have a Perl module to serve as the bootstrap which
pulls the extension into Perl.  This module will export the
extension's functions and variables to the Perl program and
will cause the extension's XSUBs to be linked into Perl.
The following module will be used for most of the examples
in this document and should be used from Perl with the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>

command as shown earlier.  Perl modules are explained in
more detail later in this document.
<p>
<XMP>
     package RPC;
     require Exporter;
     require DynaLoader;
     @ISA = qw(Exporter DynaLoader);
     @EXPORT = qw( rpcb_gettime );
     bootstrap RPC;
     1;

</XMP>
<p>Throughout this document a variety of interfaces to the <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM>
XSUB will be explored.  The XSUBs will take their parameters in different
orders or will take different numbers of parameters.  In each case the
XSUB is an abstraction between Perl and the real C <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM>
function, and the XSUB must always ensure that the real <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM>
function is called with the correct parameters.  This abstraction will
allow the programmer to create a more Perl-like interface to the C
function.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_0">
The Anatomy of an XSUB</A>
</H2>
The following XSUB allows a Perl program to access a C library function
called 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sin_0">sin()</A>
.  The XSUB will imitate the C function which takes a single
argument and returns a single value.
<p>
<XMP>
     double
     sin(x)
       double x

</XMP>
<p>When using C pointers the indirection operator <CODE>*</CODE> should be considered
part of the type and the address operator <CODE>&amp;</CODE> should be considered part of
the variable, as is demonstrated in the <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function above.  See
the section on typemaps for more about handling qualifiers and unary
operators in C types.
<p>The function name and the return type must be placed on
separate lines.
<p>
<XMP>
  INCORRECT                        CORRECT
  double sin(x)                    double
    double x                       sin(x)
                                     double x

</XMP>
<p>The function body may be indented or left-adjusted.  The following example
shows a function with its body left-adjusted.  Most examples in this
document will indent the body.

<A NAME="perlxs_the_1">
The Argument Stack</A>
</H2>
The argument stack is used to store the values which are
sent as parameters to the XSUB and to store the XSUB's
return value.  In reality all Perl functions keep their
values on this stack at the same time, each limited to its
own range of positions on the stack.  In this document the
first position on that stack which belongs to the active
function will be referred to as position 0 for that function.
<p>XSUBs refer to their stack arguments with the macro <STRONG>ST(x)</STRONG>, where <EM>x</EM>
refers to a position in this XSUB's part of the stack.  Position 0 for that
function would be known to the XSUB as ST(0).  The XSUB's incoming
parameters and outgoing return values always begin at ST(0).  For many
simple cases the <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler will generate the code necessary to
handle the argument stack by embedding code fragments found in the
typemaps.  In more complex cases the programmer must supply the code.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_2">
The RETVAL Variable</A>
</H2>
The RETVAL variable is a magic variable which always matches
the return type of the C library function.  The <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler will
supply this variable in each XSUB and by default will use it to hold the
return value of the C library function being called.  In simple cases the
value of RETVAL will be placed in ST(0) of the argument stack where it can
be received by Perl as the return value of the XSUB.
<p>If the XSUB has a return type of <CODE>void</CODE> then the compiler will
not supply a RETVAL variable for that function.  When using
the PPCODE: directive the RETVAL variable may not be needed.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_3">
The MODULE Keyword</A>
</H2>
The MODULE keyword is used to start the XS code and to
specify the package of the functions which are being
defined.  All text preceding the first MODULE keyword is
considered C code and is passed through to the output
untouched.  Every XS module will have a bootstrap function
which is used to hook the XSUBs into Perl.  The package name
of this bootstrap function will match the value of the last
MODULE statement in the XS source files.  The value of
MODULE should always remain constant within the same XS
file, though this is not required.
<p>The following example will start the XS code and will place
all functions in a package named RPC.
<p>
<XMP>
     MODULE = RPC

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_4">
The PACKAGE Keyword</A>
</H2>
When functions within an XS source file must be separated into packages
the PACKAGE keyword should be used.  This keyword is used with the MODULE
keyword and must follow immediately after it when used.
<p>
<XMP>
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC
     [ XS code in package RPC ]
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPCB
     [ XS code in package RPCB ]
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC
     [ XS code in package RPC ]

</XMP>
<p>Although this keyword is optional and in some cases provides redundant
information it should always be used.  This keyword will ensure that the
XSUBs appear in the desired package.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_5">
The PREFIX Keyword</A>
</H2>
The PREFIX keyword designates prefixes which should be
removed from the Perl function names.  If the C function is
<CODE><EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM></CODE> and the PREFIX value is <CODE>rpcb_</CODE> then Perl will
see this function as <CODE><EM>gettime()</EM></CODE>.
<p>This keyword should follow the PACKAGE keyword when used.
If PACKAGE is not used then PREFIX should follow the MODULE
keyword.
<p>
<XMP>
     MODULE = RPC  PREFIX = rpc_
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPCB  PREFIX = rpcb_

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_6">
The OUTPUT: Keyword</A>
</H2>
The OUTPUT: keyword indicates that certain function parameters should be
updated (new values made visible to Perl) when the XSUB terminates or that
certain values should be returned to the calling Perl function.  For
simple functions, such as the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sin_0">sin()</A>
 function above, the RETVAL variable is
automatically designated as an output value.  In more complex functions
the <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler will need help to determine which variables are output
variables.
<p>This keyword will normally be used to complement the CODE:  keyword.
The RETVAL variable is not recognized as an output variable when the
CODE: keyword is present.  The OUTPUT:  keyword is used in this
situation to tell the compiler that RETVAL really is an output
variable.
<p>The OUTPUT: keyword can also be used to indicate that function parameters
are output variables.  This may be necessary when a parameter has been
modified within the function and the programmer would like the update to
be seen by Perl.
<p>
<XMP>
     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &timep
          OUTPUT:
          timep

</XMP>
<p>The OUTPUT: keyword will also allow an output parameter to
be mapped to a matching piece of code rather than to a
typemap.
<p>
<XMP>

<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_7">
The CODE: Keyword</A>
</H2>
This keyword is used in more complicated XSUBs which require
special handling for the C function.  The RETVAL variable is
available but will not be returned unless it is specified
under the OUTPUT: keyword.
<p>The following XSUB is for a C function which requires special handling of
its parameters.  The Perl usage is given first.
<p>
<XMP>

<A NAME="perlxs_the_8">
The INIT: Keyword</A>
</H2>
The INIT: keyword allows initialization to be inserted into the XSUB before
the compiler generates the call to the C function.  Unlike the CODE: keyword
above, this keyword does not affect the way the compiler handles RETVAL.
<p>
<XMP>
    bool_t

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_9">
The NO_INIT Keyword</A>
</H2>
The NO_INIT keyword is used to indicate that a function
parameter is being used as only an output value.  The <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG>
compiler will normally generate code to read the values of
all function parameters from the argument stack and assign
them to C variables upon entry to the function.  NO_INIT
will tell the compiler that some parameters will be used for
output rather than for input and that they will be handled
before the function terminates.
<p>The following example shows a variation of the <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function.
This function uses the timep variable as only an output variable and does
not care about its initial contents.
<p>
<XMP>
     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &timep = NO_INIT

          timep

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_initializing_0">
Initializing Function Parameters</A>
</H2>
Function parameters are normally initialized with their
values from the argument stack.  The typemaps contain the
code segments which are used to transfer the Perl values to
the C parameters.  The programmer, however, is allowed to
override the typemaps and supply alternate initialization
code.
<p>The following code demonstrates how to supply initialization code for
function parameters.  The initialization code is eval'd by the compiler
before it is added to the output so anything which should be interpreted
literally, such as double quotes, must be protected with backslashes.
<p>
<XMP>
     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host = (char *)SvPV(ST(0),na);
          time_t &timep = 0;
          OUTPUT:
          timep

</XMP>
<p>This should not be used to supply default values for parameters.  One
would normally use this when a function parameter must be processed by
another library function before it can be used.  Default parameters are
covered in the next section.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_default_0">
Default Parameter Values</A>
</H2>
Default values can be specified for function parameters by
placing an assignment statement in the parameter list.  The
default value may be a number or a string.  Defaults should
always be used on the right-most parameters only.
<p>To allow the XSUB for <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> to have a default host
value the parameters to the XSUB could be rearranged.  The
XSUB will then call the real <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function with
the parameters in the correct order.  Perl will call this
XSUB with either of the following statements.
<p>
<XMP>
     $status = rpcb_gettime( $timep, $host );
     $status = rpcb_gettime( $timep );

</XMP>
<p>The XSUB will look like the code  which  follows.   A  CODE:
block  is used to call the real <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function with
the parameters in the correct order for that function.
<p>
<XMP>
     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(timep,host="localhost")
          char *host
          time_t timep = NO_INIT
          CODE:
               RETVAL = rpcb_gettime( host, &timep );

          timep
          RETVAL

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_10">
The PREINIT: Keyword</A>
</H2>
The PREINIT: keyword allows extra variables to be declared before the
typemaps are expanded.  If a variable is declared in a CODE: block then that
variable will follow any typemap code.  This may result in a C syntax
error.  To force the variable to be declared before the typemap code, place
it into a PREINIT: block.  The PREINIT: keyword may be used one or more
times within an XSUB.
<p>The following examples are equivalent, but if the code is using complex
typemaps then the first example is safer.

The INPUT: Keyword</A>
</H2>
The XSUB's parameters are usually evaluated immediately after entering the

evaluated a little later.  The INPUT: keyword can be used multiple times
within an XSUB and can be used to list one or more input variables.  This

<A NAME="perlxs_variable_length_0">
Variable-length Parameter Lists</A>
</H2>
XSUBs can have variable-length parameter lists by specifying an ellipsis
<CODE>(...)</CODE> in the parameter list.  This use of the ellipsis is similar to that
found in ANSI C.  The programmer is able to determine the number of
arguments passed to the XSUB by examining the <CODE>items</CODE> variable which the
<STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler supplies for all XSUBs.  By using this mechanism one can
create an XSUB which accepts a list of parameters of unknown length.
<p>The <EM>host</EM> parameter for the <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> XSUB can be
optional so the ellipsis can be used to indicate that the
XSUB will take a variable number of parameters.  Perl should
be able to call this XSUB with either of the following statements.
<p>
<XMP>
     $status = rpcb_gettime( $timep, $host );
     $status = rpcb_gettime( $timep );

<A NAME="perlxs_the_12">
The PPCODE: Keyword</A>
</H2>
The PPCODE: keyword is an alternate form of the CODE: keyword and is used
to tell the <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler that the programmer is supplying the code to
control the argument stack for the XSUBs return values.  Occasionally one
will want an XSUB to return a list of values rather than a single value.
In these cases one must use PPCODE: and then explicitly push the list of
values on the stack.  The PPCODE: and CODE:  keywords are not used
together within the same XSUB.
<p>The following XSUB will call the C <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function
and will return its two output values, timep and status, to
Perl as a single list.
<p>
<XMP>
     void
     rpcb_gettime(host)
          char *host
          PREINIT:

          bool_t  status;
          PPCODE:
          status = rpcb_gettime( host, &timep );
          EXTEND(sp, 2);
          PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(status)));
          PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(timep)));

</XMP>
<p>Notice that the programmer must supply the C code necessary
to have the real <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function called and to have
the return values properly placed on the argument stack.
<p>The <CODE>void</CODE> return type for this function tells the <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler that
the RETVAL variable is not needed or used and that it should not be created.
In most scenarios the void return type should be used with the PPCODE:
directive.
<p>The <EM>EXTEND()</EM> macro is used to make room on the argument
stack for 2 return values.  The PPCODE: directive causes the
<STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler to create a stack pointer called <CODE>sp</CODE>, and it
is this pointer which is being used in the <EM>EXTEND()</EM> macro.
The values are then pushed onto the stack with the <EM>PUSHs()</EM>
macro.
<p>Now the <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function can be used from Perl with
the following statement.
<p>
<XMP>
     ($status, $timep) = rpcb_gettime("localhost");

Occasionally the programmer will want to simply return

separate status value.  The <EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM> function offers
just this situation.  If the function succeeds we would like

The ALIAS: Keyword</A>

The ALIAS: keyword allows an XSUB to have two more more unique Perl names
and to know which of those names was used when it was invoked.  The Perl
names may be fully-qualified with package names.  Each alias is given an
index.  The compiler will setup a variable called <CODE>ix</CODE> which contain the
index of the alias which was used.  When the XSUB is called with its
declared name <CODE>ix</CODE> will be 0.
<p>The following example will create aliases <CODE>FOO::<EM>gettime()</EM></CODE> and
<CODE>BAR::<EM>getit()</EM></CODE> for this function.

This keyword can be used to pull other files into the XS module.  The other

The CASE: Keyword</A>
</H2>
The CASE: keyword allows an XSUB to have multiple distinct parts with each
part acting as a virtual XSUB.  CASE: is greedy and if it is used then all
other XS keywords must be contained within a CASE:.  This means nothing may
precede the first CASE: in the XSUB and anything following the last CASE: is
included in that case.
<p>A CASE: might switch via a parameter of the XSUB, via the <CODE>ix</CODE> ALIAS:
variable (see <EM>``The ALIAS: Keyword''</EM>), or maybe via the <CODE>items</CODE> variable
(see <EM>``Variable-length Parameter Lists''</EM>).  The last CASE: becomes the
<STRONG>default</STRONG> case if it is not associated with a conditional.  The following
example shows CASE switched via <CODE>ix</CODE> with a function <CODE><EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM></CODE>
having an alias <CODE><EM>x_gettime()</EM></CODE>.  When the function is called as
<CODE><EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM></CODE> it's parameters are the usual <CODE>(char *host, time_t *timep)</CODE>, 
but when the function is called as <CODE><EM>x_gettime()</EM></CODE> is parameters are
reversed, <CODE>(time_t *timep, char *host)</CODE>.

<H2> <EM>The &amp; Unary Operator</EM></H2>
The &amp; unary operator is used to tell the compiler that it should dereference
the object when it calls the C function.  This is used when a CODE: block is
not used and the object is a not a pointer type (the object is an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_int_0">int</A>
 or
<CODE>long</CODE> but not a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_int_0">int*</A>
 or <CODE>long*</CODE>).
<p>The following XSUB will generate incorrect C code.  The xsubpp compiler will
turn this into code which calls <CODE><EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM></CODE> with parameters C<(char
*host, time_t timep)&gt;, but the real <CODE><EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM></CODE> wants the <CODE>timep</CODE>
parameter to be of type <CODE>time_t*</CODE> rather than <CODE>time_t</CODE>.
<p>
<XMP>
    bool_t
    rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t timep
          OUTPUT:
          timep

</XMP>
<p>That problem is corrected by using the <CODE>&amp;</CODE> operator.  The xsubpp compiler
will now turn this into code which calls <CODE><EM>rpcb_gettime()</EM></CODE> correctly with
parameters <CODE>(char *host, time_t *timep)</CODE>.  It does this by carrying the
<CODE>&amp;</CODE> through, so the function call looks like <CODE>rpcb_gettime(host, &amp;timep)</CODE>.

Inserting Comments and C Preprocessor Directives</A>
</H2>
C preprocessor directives are allowed within BOOT:, PREINIT: INIT:,
CODE:, PPCODE: and CLEANUP: blocks, as well as outside the functions.
Comments are allowed anywhere after the MODULE keyword.  The compiler
will pass the preprocessor directives through untouched and will remove
the commented lines.
Comments can be added to XSUBs by placing a <CODE>#</CODE> as the first
non-whitespace of a line.  Care should be taken to avoid making the
comment look like a C preprocessor directive, lest it be interpreted as
such.  The simplest way to prevent this is to put whitespace in front of
the <CODE>#</CODE>.
<p>If you use preprocessor directives to choose one of two
versions of a function, use
<p>
<XMP>
    #if ... version1

<p>and not
<p>

<A NAME="perlxs_using_0">
Using XS With C++</A>
</H2>
If a function is defined as a C++ method then it will assume
its first argument is an object pointer.  The object pointer
will be stored in a variable called THIS.  The object should
have been created by C++ with the <EM>new()</EM> function and should
be blessed by Perl with the <EM>sv_setref_pv()</EM> macro.  The
blessing of the object by Perl can be handled by a typemap.  An example
typemap is shown at the end of this section.
<p>If the method is defined as static it will call the C++
function using the class::<EM>method()</EM> syntax.  If the method is not static
the function will be called using the THIS-&gt;<EM>method()</EM> syntax.
<p>The next examples will use the following C++ class.
<p>
<XMP>
     class color {
          public:
          color();
          ~color();
          int blue();
          void set_blue( int );
          private:
          int c_blue;
     };

</XMP>
<p>The XSUBs for the <EM>blue()</EM> and <EM>set_blue()</EM> methods are defined with the class
name but the parameter for the object (THIS, or ``self'') is implicit and is
not listed.
<p>
<XMP>
     int
     color::blue()
     void
     color::set_blue( val )
          int val

</XMP>
<p>Both functions will expect an object as the first parameter.  The xsubpp
compiler will call that object <CODE>THIS</CODE> and will use it to call the specified
method.  So in the C++ code the <EM>blue()</EM> and <EM>set_blue()</EM> methods will be called
in the following manner.
<p>
<XMP>
     RETVAL = THIS->blue();
     THIS->set_blue( val );

</XMP>
<p>If the function's name is <STRONG>DESTROY</STRONG> then the C++ 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_delete_0">delete</A>
 function will be
called and <CODE>THIS</CODE> will be given as its parameter.
<p>
<XMP>
     void
     color::DESTROY()

</XMP>
<p>The C++ code will call 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_delete_0">delete</A>
.
<p>
<XMP>
     delete THIS;

</XMP>
<p>If the function's name is <STRONG>new</STRONG> then the C++ <CODE>new</CODE> function will be called
to create a dynamic C++ object.  The XSUB will expect the class name, which
will be kept in a variable called <CODE>CLASS</CODE>, to be given as the first
argument.
<p>
<XMP>
     color *
     color::new()

</XMP>
<p>The C++ code will call <CODE>new</CODE>.

<A NAME="perlxs_interface_0">
Interface Strategy</A>
</H2>
When designing an interface between Perl and a C library a straight
translation from C to XS is often sufficient.  The interface will often be
very C-like and occasionally nonintuitive, especially when the C function
modifies one of its parameters.  In cases where the programmer wishes to
create a more Perl-like interface the following strategy may help to
identify the more critical parts of the interface.
<p>Identify the C functions which modify their parameters.  The XSUBs for
these functions may be able to return lists to Perl, or may be
candidates to return undef or an empty list in case of failure.
<p>Identify which values are used by only the C and XSUB functions
themselves.  If Perl does not need to access the contents of the value
then it may not be necessary to provide a translation for that value
from C to Perl.
<p>Identify the pointers in the C function parameter lists and return
values.  Some pointers can be handled in XS with the &amp; unary operator on
the variable name while others will require the use of the * operator on
the type name.  In general it is easier to work with the &amp; operator.
<p>Identify the structures used by the C functions.  In many
cases it may be helpful to use the T_PTROBJ typemap for
these structures so they can be manipulated by Perl as
blessed objects.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_perl_0">
Perl Objects And C Structures</A>
</H2>
When dealing with C structures one should select either
<STRONG>T_PTROBJ</STRONG> or <STRONG>T_PTRREF</STRONG> for the XS type.  Both types are
designed to handle pointers to complex objects.  The
T_PTRREF type will allow the Perl object to be unblessed
while the T_PTROBJ type requires that the object be blessed.
By using T_PTROBJ one can achieve a form of type-checking
because the XSUB will attempt to verify that the Perl object
is of the expected type.
<p>The following XS code shows the <EM>getnetconfigent()</EM> function which is used
with ONC+ TIRPC.  The <EM>getnetconfigent()</EM> function will return a pointer to a
C structure and has the C prototype shown below.  The example will
demonstrate how the C pointer will become a Perl reference.  Perl will
consider this reference to be a pointer to a blessed object and will
attempt to call a destructor for the object.  A destructor will be
provided in the XS source to free the memory used by <EM>getnetconfigent()</EM>.
Destructors in XS can be created by specifying an XSUB function whose name
ends with the word <STRONG>DESTROY</STRONG>.  XS destructors can be used to free memory
which may have been malloc'd by another XSUB.
<p>
<XMP>
     struct netconfig *getnetconfigent(const char *netid);

</XMP>
<p>A <CODE>typedef</CODE> will be created for <CODE>struct netconfig</CODE>.  The Perl
object will be blessed in a class matching the name of the C
type, with the tag <CODE>Ptr</CODE> appended, and the name should not
have embedded spaces if it will be a Perl package name.  The
destructor will be placed in a class corresponding to the
class of the object and the PREFIX keyword will be used to
trim the name to the word DESTROY as Perl will expect.
<p>
<XMP>
     typedef struct netconfig Netconfig;
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC
     Netconfig *
     getnetconfigent(netid)
          char *netid
     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = NetconfigPtr  PREFIX = rpcb_
     void
     rpcb_DESTROY(netconf)
          Netconfig *netconf
          CODE:
          printf("Now in NetconfigPtr::DESTROY\n");
          free( netconf );

</XMP>
<p>This example requires the following typemap entry.  Consult the typemap
section for more information about adding new typemaps for an extension.
<p>
<XMP>
     TYPEMAP
     Netconfig *  T_PTROBJ

</XMP>
<p>This example will be used with the following Perl statements.
<p>
<XMP>
     use RPC;
     $netconf = getnetconfigent("udp");

</XMP>
<p>When Perl destroys the object referenced by <STRONG>$netconf</STRONG> it will send the
object to the supplied XSUB DESTROY function.  Perl cannot determine, and
does not care, that this object is a C struct and not a Perl object.  In
this sense, there is no difference between the object created by the
<EM>getnetconfigent()</EM> XSUB and an object created by a normal Perl subroutine.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxs_the_23">
The Typemap</A>
</H2>
The typemap is a collection of code fragments which are used by the <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG>
compiler to map C function parameters and values to Perl values.  The
typemap file may consist of three sections labeled <CODE>TYPEMAP</CODE>, <CODE>INPUT</CODE>, and
<CODE>OUTPUT</CODE>.  The INPUT section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values
into variables of certain C types.  The OUTPUT section tells the compiler
how to translate the values from certain C types into values Perl can
understand.  The TYPEMAP section tells the compiler which of the INPUT and
OUTPUT code fragments should be used to map a given C type to a Perl value.
Each of the sections of the typemap must be preceded by one of the TYPEMAP,
INPUT, or OUTPUT keywords.
<p>The default typemap in the <CODE>ext</CODE> directory of the Perl source contains many
useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.  Some extensions define
additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.  These
additional typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main
typemap.  The <STRONG>xsubpp</STRONG> compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
override any mappings which are in the default typemap.
<p>Most extensions which require a custom typemap will need only the TYPEMAP
section of the typemap file.  The custom typemap used in the
<EM>getnetconfigent()</EM> example shown earlier demonstrates what may be the typical
use of extension typemaps.  That typemap is used to equate a C structure
with the T_PTROBJ typemap.  The typemap used by <EM>getnetconfigent()</EM> is shown
here.  Note that the C type is separated from the XS type with a tab and
that the C unary operator <CODE>*</CODE> is considered to be a part of the C type name.

<A NAME="perlxstut_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
This tutorial will educate the reader on the steps involved in creating
a Perl extension.  The reader is assumed to have access to 
<A HREF="perlguts.html">
the <EM>perlguts</EM> manpage</A>
 and

<A HREF="perlxs.html">
the <EM>perlxs</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>This tutorial starts with very simple examples and becomes more complex,
with each new example adding new features.  Certain concepts may not be
completely explained until later in the tutorial in order to slowly ease
the reader into building extensions.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_version_0">
VERSION CAVEAT</A>
</H2>
This tutorial tries hard to keep up with the latest development versions
of Perl.  This often means that it is sometimes in advance of the latest
released version of Perl, and that certain features described here might
not work on earlier versions.  This section will keep track of when various
features were added to Perl 5.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>In versions of 5.002 prior to version beta 3, then the line in the .xs file
about ``PROTOTYPES: DISABLE'' will cause a compiler error.  Simply remove that
line from the file.
<p>
<LI>In versions of 5.002 prior to version 5.002b1h, the test.pl file was not
automatically created by h2xs.  This means that you cannot say ``make test''
to run the test script.  You will need to add the following line before the
``use extension'' statement:
<p>
<XMP>
        use lib './blib';

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>In versions 5.000 and 5.001, instead of using the above line, you will need
to use the following line:
<p>
<XMP>
        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib") }

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>This document assumes that the executable named ``perl'' is Perl version 5.  
Some systems may have installed Perl version 5 as ``perl5''.
<p>
</UL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_dynamic_0">
DYNAMIC VERSUS STATIC</A>
</H2>
It is commonly thought that if a system does not have the capability to
dynamically load a library, you cannot build XSUB's.  This is incorrect.
You <EM>can</EM> build them, but you must link the XSUB's subroutines with the
rest of Perl, creating a new executable.  This situation is similar to
Perl 4.
<p>This tutorial can still be used on such a system.  The XSUB build mechanism
will check the system and build a dynamically-loadable library if possible,
or else a static library and then, optionally, a new statically-linked
executable with that static library linked in.
<p>Should you wish to build a statically-linked executable on a system which
can dynamically load libraries, you may, in all the following examples,
where the command ``make'' with no arguments is executed, run the command
``make perl'' instead.
<p>If you have generated such a statically-linked executable by choice, then
instead of saying ``make test'', you should say ``make test_static''.  On systems
that cannot build dynamically-loadable libraries at all, simply saying "make
test" is sufficient.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_example_0">
EXAMPLE 1</A>
</H2>
Our first extension will be very simple.  When we call the routine in the
extension, it will print out a well-known message and return.
<p>Run ``h2xs -A -n Mytest''.  This creates a directory named Mytest, possibly under
ext/ if that directory exists in the current working directory.  Several files
will be created in the Mytest dir, including MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, Mytest.pm,
Mytest.xs, test.pl, and Changes.
<p>The MANIFEST file contains the names of all the files created.
<p>The file Makefile.PL should look something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
        # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
        # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
        WriteMakefile(
            'NAME'      => 'Mytest',
            'VERSION_FROM' => 'Mytest.pm', # finds $VERSION
            'LIBS'      => [''],   # e.g., '-lm'
            'DEFINE'    => '',     # e.g., '-DHAVE_SOMETHING'
            'INC'       => '',     # e.g., '-I/usr/include/other'
        );

</XMP>
<p>The file Mytest.pm should start with something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        package Mytest;
        require Exporter;
        require DynaLoader;
        @ISA = qw(Exporter DynaLoader);
        # Items to export into callers namespace by default. Note: do not export
        # names by default without a very good reason. Use EXPORT_OK instead.
        # Do not simply export all your public functions/methods/constants.
        @EXPORT = qw(
        );
        $VERSION = '0.01';
        bootstrap Mytest $VERSION;
        # Preloaded methods go here.
        # Autoload methods go after __END__, and are processed by the autosplit program.
        1;
        __END__
        # Below is the stub of documentation for your module. You better edit it!

</XMP>
<p>And the Mytest.xs file should look something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        #ifdef __cplusplus
        extern "C" {
        #endif
        #include "EXTERN.h"
        #include "perl.h"
        #include "XSUB.h"
        #ifdef __cplusplus
        }
        #endif
        
        PROTOTYPES: DISABLE
        MODULE = Mytest         PACKAGE = Mytest

</XMP>
<p>Let's edit the .xs file by adding this to the end of the file:
<p>
<XMP>
        void
        hello()
                CODE:
                printf("Hello, world!\n");

</XMP>
<p>Now we'll run ``perl Makefile.PL''.  This will create a real Makefile,
which make needs.  It's output looks something like:
<p>
<XMP>
        % perl Makefile.PL
        Checking if your kit is complete...
        Looks good
        Writing Makefile for Mytest
        %

</XMP>
<p>Now, running make will produce output that looks something like this
(some long lines shortened for clarity):
<p>
<XMP>
        % make
        umask 0 && cp Mytest.pm ./blib/Mytest.pm
        perl xsubpp -typemap typemap Mytest.xs >Mytest.tc && mv Mytest.tc Mytest.c
        cc -c Mytest.c
        Running Mkbootstrap for Mytest ()
        chmod 644 Mytest.bs
        LD_RUN_PATH="" ld -o ./blib/PA-RISC1.1/auto/Mytest/Mytest.sl -b Mytest.o
        chmod 755 ./blib/PA-RISC1.1/auto/Mytest/Mytest.sl
        cp Mytest.bs ./blib/PA-RISC1.1/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs
        chmod 644 ./blib/PA-RISC1.1/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs

</XMP>
<p>Now, although there is already a test.pl template ready for us, for this
example only, we'll create a special test script.  Create a file called hello
that looks like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        #! /opt/perl5/bin/perl
        
        use lib './blib';
        
        use Mytest;
        
        Mytest::hello();

</XMP>
<p>Now we run the script and we should see the following output:
<p>
<XMP>
        % perl hello
        Hello, world!
        %

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_example_1">
EXAMPLE 2</A>
</H2>
Now let's add to our extension a subroutine that will take a single argument
and return 0 if the argument is even, 1 if the argument is odd.
<p>Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:
<p>
<XMP>
        int
        is_even(input)
                int     input
                CODE:
                RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);
                OUTPUT:
                RETVAL

</XMP>
<p>There does not need to be white space at the start of the ``int input'' line,
but it is useful for improving readability.  The semi-colon at the end of
that line is also optional.
<p>Any white space may be between the ``int'' and ``input''.  It is also okay for
the four lines starting at the ``CODE:'' line to not be indented.  However,
for readability purposes, it is suggested that you indent them 8 spaces
(or one normal tab stop).
<p>Now re-run make to rebuild our new shared library.
<p>Now perform the same steps as before, generating a Makefile from the
Makefile.PL file, and running make.
<p>In order to test that our extension works, we now need to look at the
file test.pl.  This file is set up to imitate the same kind of testing
structure that Perl itself has.  Within the test script, you perform a
number of tests to confirm the behavior of the extension, printing ``ok''
when the test is correct, ``not ok'' when it is not.
<p>Remove the line that starts with ``use lib'', change the print statement in
the BEGIN block to print ``1..4'', and add the following code to the end of
the file:
<p>
<XMP>
        print &Mytest::is_even(0) == 1 ? "ok 2" : "not ok 2", "\n";
        print &Mytest::is_even(1) == 0 ? "ok 3" : "not ok 3", "\n";
        print &Mytest::is_even(2) == 1 ? "ok 4" : "not ok 4", "\n";

</XMP>
<p>We will be calling the test script through the command ``make test''.  You
should see output that looks something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        % make test
        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /opt/perl5.002b2/bin/perl (lots of -I arguments) test.pl
        1..4
        ok 1
        ok 2
        ok 3
        ok 4
        %

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_what_0">
WHAT HAS GONE ON?</A>
</H2>
The program h2xs is the starting point for creating extensions.  In later
examples we'll see how we can use h2xs to read header files and generate
templates to connect to C routines.
<p>h2xs creates a number of files in the extension directory.  The file
Makefile.PL is a perl script which will generate a true Makefile to build
the extension.  We'll take a closer look at it later.
<p>The files &lt;extension&gt;.pm and &lt;extension&gt;.xs contain the meat of the extension.
The .xs file holds the C routines that make up the extension.  The .pm file
contains routines that tell Perl how to load your extension.
<p>Generating and invoking the Makefile created a directory blib (which stands
for ``build library'') in the current working directory.  This directory will
contain the shared library that we will build.  Once we have tested it, we
can install it into its final location.
<p>Invoking the test script via ``make test'' did something very important.  It
invoked perl with all those -I arguments so that it could find the various
files that are part of the extension.
<p>It is <EM>very</EM> important that while you are still testing extensions that
you use ``make test''.  If you try to run the test script all by itself, you
will get a fatal error.
<p>Another reason it is important to use ``make test'' to run your test script
is that if you are testing an upgrade to an already-existing version, using
``make test'' insures that you use your new extension, not the already-existing
version.
<p>When Perl sees a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use extension;</A>
, it searches for a file with the same name
as the use'd extension that has a .pm suffix.  If that file cannot be found,
Perl dies with a fatal error.  The default search path is contained in the

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_inc_0">@INC</A>
 array.
<p>In our case, Mytest.pm tells perl that it will need the Exporter and Dynamic
Loader extensions.  It then sets the <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> and <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> arrays and the <STRONG>$VERSION</STRONG>
scalar; finally it tells perl to bootstrap the module.  Perl will call its
dynamic loader routine (if there is one) and load the shared library.
<p>The two arrays that are set in the .pm file are very important.  The <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG>
array contains a list of other packages in which to search for methods (or
subroutines) that do not exist in the current package.  The <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array
tells Perl which of the extension's routines should be placed into the
calling package's namespace.
<p>It's important to select what to export carefully.  Do NOT export method names
and do NOT export anything else <EM>by default</EM> without a good reason.
<p>As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object-oriented then don't
export anything.  If it's just a collection of functions then you can export
any of the functions via another array, called <STRONG>@EXPORT_OK</STRONG>.
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the <EM>perlmod</EM> manpage</A>
 for more information.
<p>The <STRONG>$VERSION</STRONG> variable is used to ensure that the .pm file and the shared
library are ``in sync'' with each other.  Any time you make changes to
the .pm or .xs files, you should increment the value of this variable.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_writing_0">
WRITING GOOD TEST SCRIPTS</A>
</H2>
The importance of writing good test scripts cannot be overemphasized.  You
should closely follow the ``ok/not ok'' style that Perl itself uses, so that
it is very easy and unambiguous to determine the outcome of each test case.
When you find and fix a bug, make sure you add a test case for it.
<p>By running ``make test'', you ensure that your test.pl script runs and uses
the correct version of your extension.  If you have many test cases, you
might want to copy Perl's test style.  Create a directory named ``t'', and
ensure all your test files end with the suffix ``.t''.  The Makefile will
properly run all these test files.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_example_2">
EXAMPLE 3</A>
</H2>
Our third extension will take one argument as its input, round off that
value, and set the <EM>argument</EM> to the rounded value.
<p>Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:
<p>
<XMP>
        void
        round(arg)
                double  arg
                CODE:
                if (arg > 0.0) {
                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
                        arg = ceil(arg - 0.5);
                } else {
                        arg = 0.0;
                }
                OUTPUT:
                arg

</XMP>
<p>Edit the Makefile.PL file so that the corresponding line looks like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        'LIBS'      => ['-lm'],   # e.g., '-lm'

</XMP>
<p>Generate the Makefile and run make.  Change the BEGIN block to print out
``1..9'' and add the following to test.pl:
<p>
<XMP>
        $i = -1.5; &Mytest::round($i); print $i == -2.0 ? "ok 5" : "not ok 5", "\n";
        $i = -1.1; &Mytest::round($i); print $i == -1.0 ? "ok 6" : "not ok 6", "\n";
        $i = 0.0; &Mytest::round($i); print $i == 0.0 ? "ok 7" : "not ok 7", "\n";
        $i = 0.5; &Mytest::round($i); print $i == 1.0 ? "ok 8" : "not ok 8", "\n";
        $i = 1.2; &Mytest::round($i); print $i == 1.0 ? "ok 9" : "not ok 9", "\n";

</XMP>
<p>Running ``make test'' should now print out that all nine tests are okay.
<p>You might be wondering if you can round a constant.  To see what happens, add
the following line to test.pl temporarily:
<p>
<XMP>
        &Mytest::round(3);

</XMP>
<p>Run ``make test'' and notice that Perl dies with a fatal error.  Perl won't let
you change the value of constants!
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_what_s_0">
WHAT'S NEW HERE?</A>
</H2>
Two things are new here.  First, we've made some changes to Makefile.PL.
In this case, we've specified an extra library to link in, in this case the
math library, libm.  We'll talk later about how to write XSUBs that can call
every routine in a library.
<p>Second, the value of the function is being passed back not as the function's
return value, but through the same variable that was passed into the function.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_input_0">
INPUT AND OUTPUT PARAMETERS</A>
</H2>
You specify the parameters that will be passed into the XSUB just after you
declare the function return value and name.  Each parameter line starts with
optional white space, and may have an optional terminating semicolon.
<p>The list of output parameters occurs after the OUTPUT: directive.  The use
of RETVAL tells Perl that you wish to send this value back as the return
value of the XSUB function.  In Example 3, the value we wanted returned was
contained in the same variable we passed in, so we listed it (and not RETVAL)
in the OUTPUT: section.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_the_0">
THE XSUBPP COMPILER</A>
</H2>
The compiler xsubpp takes the XS code in the .xs file and converts it into
C code, placing it in a file whose suffix is .c.  The C code created makes
heavy use of the C functions within Perl.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_the_1">
THE TYPEMAP FILE</A>
</H2>
The xsubpp compiler uses rules to convert from Perl's data types (scalar,
array, etc.) to C's data types (int, char *, etc.).  These rules are stored
in the typemap file (<STRONG>$PERLLIB</STRONG>/ExtUtils/typemap).  This file is split into
three parts.
<p>The first part attempts to map various C data types to a coded flag, which
has some correspondence with the various Perl types.  The second part contains
C code which xsubpp uses for input parameters.  The third part contains C
code which xsubpp uses for output parameters.  We'll talk more about the
C code later.
<p>Let's now take a look at a portion of the .c file created for our extension.
<p>
<XMP>
        XS(XS_Mytest_round)
        {
            dXSARGS;
            if (items != 1)
                croak("Usage: Mytest::round(arg)");
            {
                double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));      /* XXXXX */
                if (arg > 0.0) {
                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
                        arg = ceil(arg - 0.5);
                } else {
                        arg = 0.0;
                }
                sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);   /* XXXXX */
            }
            XSRETURN(1);
        }

</XMP>
<p>Notice the two lines marked with ``XXXXX''.  If you check the first section of
the typemap file, you'll see that doubles are of type T_DOUBLE.  In the
INPUT section, an argument that is T_DOUBLE is assigned to the variable
arg by calling the routine SvNV on something, then casting it to double,
then assigned to the variable arg.  Similarly, in the OUTPUT section,
once arg has its final value, it is passed to the sv_setnv function to
be passed back to the calling subroutine.  These two functions are explained
in 
<A HREF="perlguts.html">
the <EM>perlguts</EM> manpage</A>
; we'll talk more later about what that ``ST(0)'' means in the
section on the argument stack.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_warning_0">
WARNING</A>
</H2>
In general, it's not a good idea to write extensions that modify their input
parameters, as in Example 3.  However, in order to better accomodate calling
pre-existing C routines, which often do modify their input parameters,
this behavior is tolerated.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_example_3">
EXAMPLE 4</A>
</H2>
In this example, we'll now begin to write XSUB's that will interact with
pre-defined C libraries.  To begin with, we will build a small library of
our own, then let h2xs write our .pm and .xs files for us.
<p>Create a new directory called Mytest2 at the same level as the directory
Mytest.  In the Mytest2 directory, create another directory called mylib,
and cd into that directory.
<p>Here we'll create some files that will generate a test library.  These will
include a C source file and a header file.  We'll also create a Makefile.PL
in this directory.  Then we'll make sure that running make at the Mytest2
level will automatically run this Makefile.PL file and the resulting Makefile.
<p>In the testlib directory, create a file mylib.h that looks like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        #define TESTVAL 4
        extern double   foo(int, long, const char*);

</XMP>
<p>Also create a file mylib.c that looks like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include "./mylib.h"
        
        double
        foo(a, b, c)
        int             a;
        long            b;
        const char *    c;
        {
                return (a + b + atof(c) + TESTVAL);
        }

</XMP>
<p>And finally create a file Makefile.PL that looks like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
        $Verbose = 1;
        WriteMakefile(
            'NAME' => 'Mytest2::mylib',
            'clean'     => {'FILES' => 'libmylib.a'},
        );
        sub MY::postamble {
                '
        all :: static
        static ::       libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
        libmylib$(LIB_EXT): $(O_FILES)
                $(AR) cr libmylib$(LIB_EXT) $(O_FILES)
                $(RANLIB) libmylib$(LIB_EXT)
        ';
        }

</XMP>
<p>We will now create the main top-level Mytest2 files.  Change to the directory
above Mytest2 and run the following command:
<p>
<XMP>
        % h2xs -O -n Mytest2 < ./Mytest2/mylib/mylib.h

</XMP>
<p>This will print out a warning about overwriting Mytest2, but that's okay.
Our files are stored in Mytest2/mylib, and will be untouched.
<p>The normal Makefile.PL that h2xs generates doesn't know about the mylib
directory.  We need to tell it that there is a subdirectory and that we
will be generating a library in it.  Let's add the following key-value
pair to the WriteMakefile call:
<p>
<XMP>
        'MYEXTLIB' => 'mylib/libmylib$(LIB_EXT)',

</XMP>
<p>and a new replacement subroutine too:
<p>
<XMP>
        sub MY::postamble {
        '
        $(MYEXTLIB): mylib/Makefile
                cd mylib && $(MAKE)
        ';
        }

</XMP>
<p>(Note: Most makes will require that there be a tab character that indents
the line ``cd mylib &amp;&amp; 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__26">$(</A>
MAKE)''.)
<p>Let's also fix the MANIFEST file so that it accurately reflects the contents
of our extension.  The single line that says ``mylib'' should be replaced by
the following three lines:
<p>
<XMP>
        mylib/Makefile.PL
        mylib/mylib.c
        mylib/mylib.h

</XMP>
<p>To keep our namespace nice and unpolluted, edit the .pm file and change
the line setting <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> to <STRONG>@EXPORT_OK</STRONG>.  And finally, in the .xs file,
edit the #include line to read:
<p>
<XMP>
        #include "mylib/mylib.h"

</XMP>
<p>And also add the following function definition to the end of the .xs file:
<p>
<XMP>
        double
        foo(a,b,c)
                int             a
                long            b
                const char *    c
                OUTPUT:
                RETVAL

</XMP>
<p>Now we also need to create a typemap file because the default Perl doesn't
currently support the const char * type.  Create a file called typemap and
place the following in it:
<p>
<XMP>
        const char *    T_PV

</XMP>
<p>Now run perl on the top-level Makefile.PL.  Notice that it also created a
Makefile in the mylib directory.  Run make and see that it does cd into
the mylib directory and run make in there as well.
<p>Now edit the test.pl script and change the BEGIN block to print ``1..4'',
and add the following lines to the end of the script:
<p>
<XMP>
        print &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "Hello, world!") == 7 ? "ok 2\n" : "not ok 2\n";
        print &Mytest2::foo(1, 2, "0.0") == 7 ? "ok 3\n" : "not ok 3\n";
        print abs(&Mytest2::foo(0, 0, "-3.4") - 0.6) <= 0.01 ? "ok 4\n" : "not ok 4\n";

</XMP>
<p>(When dealing with floating-point comparisons, it is often useful to not check
for equality, but rather the difference being below a certain epsilon factor,
0.01 in this case)
<p>Run ``make test'' and all should be well.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>In the .xs file, there's now a #include declaration with the full path to
the mylib.h header file.
<p>
<LI>There's now some new C code that's been added to the .xs file.  The purpose
of the <CODE>constant</CODE> routine is to make the values that are #define'd in the
header file available to the Perl script (in this case, by calling
<CODE>&amp;main::TESTVAL</CODE>).  There's also some XS code to allow calls to the
<CODE>constant</CODE> routine.
<p>
<LI>The .pm file has exported the name TESTVAL in the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array.  This
could lead to name clashes.  A good rule of thumb is that if the #define
is only going to be used by the C routines themselves, and not by the user,
they should be removed from the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array.  Alternately, if you don't
mind using the ``fully qualified name'' of a variable, you could remove most
or all of the items in the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array.
<p>
</UL>
We've also told Perl about the library that we built in the mylib.subdirectory.  That required only the addition of the MYEXTLIB variable
to the WriteMakefile call and the replacement of the postamble subroutine
to cd into the subdirectory and run make.  The Makefile.PL for the
library is a bit more complicated, but not excessively so.  Again we
replaced the postamble subroutine to insert our own code.  This code
simply specified that the library to be created here was a static
archive (as opposed to a dynamically loadable library) and provided the
commands to build it.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_specifying_0">
SPECIFYING ARGUMENTS TO XSUBPP</A>
</H2>
With the completion of Example 4, we now have an easy way to simulate some
real-life libraries whose interfaces may not be the cleanest in the world.
We shall now continue with a discussion of the arguments passed to the
xsubpp compiler.
<p>When you specify arguments in the .xs file, you are really passing three
pieces of information for each one listed.  The first piece is the order
of that argument relative to the others (first, second, etc).  The second
is the type of argument, and consists of the type declaration of the
argument (e.g., int, char*, etc).  The third piece is the exact way in
which the argument should be used in the call to the library function
from this XSUB.  This would mean whether or not to place a ``&amp;'' before
the argument or not, meaning the argument expects to be passed the address
of the specified data type.
<p>There is a difference between the two arguments in this hypothetical function:
<p>
<XMP>
        int
        foo(a,b)
                char    &a
                char *  b

</XMP>
<p>The first argument to this function would be treated as a char and assigned
to the variable a, and its address would be passed into the function foo.
The second argument would be treated as a string pointer and assigned to the
variable b.  The <EM>value</EM> of b would be passed into the function foo.  The
actual call to the function foo that xsubpp generates would look like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        foo(&a, b);

</XMP>
<p>Xsubpp will identically parse the following function argument lists:
<p><UL><LI>	char	&a</LI>
<LI>	char&a</LI>
<LI>	char	& a</LI>
</UL>
<p>However, to help ease understanding, it is suggested that you place a ``&amp;''
next to the variable name and away from the variable type), and place a
``*'' near the variable type, but away from the variable name (as in the
complete example above).  By doing so, it is easy to understand exactly
what will be passed to the C function -- it will be whatever is in the
``last column''.
<p>You should take great pains to try to pass the function the type of variable
it wants, when possible.  It will save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_the_2">
THE ARGUMENT STACK</A>
</H2>
If we look at any of the C code generated by any of the examples except
example 1, you will notice a number of references to ST(n), where n is
usually 0.  The ``ST'' is actually a macro that points to the n'th argument
on the argument stack.  ST(0) is thus the first argument passed to the
XSUB, ST(1) is the second argument, and so on.
<p>When you list the arguments to the XSUB in the .xs file, that tell xsubpp
which argument corresponds to which of the argument stack (i.e., the first
one listed is the first argument, and so on).  You invite disaster if you
do not list them in the same order as the function expects them.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_extending_0">
EXTENDING YOUR EXTENSION</A>
</H2>
Sometimes you might want to provide some extra methods or subroutines
to assist in making the interface between Perl and your extension simpler
or easier to understand.  These routines should live in the .pm file.
Whether they are automatically loaded when the extension itself is loaded
or only loaded when called depends on where in the .pm file the subroutine
definition is placed.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_documenting_0">
DOCUMENTING YOUR EXTENSION</A>
</H2>
There is absolutely no excuse for not documenting your extension.
Documentation belongs in the .pm file.  This file will be fed to pod2man,
and the embedded documentation will be converted to the man page format,
then placed in the blib directory.  It will be copied to Perl's man
page directory when the extension is installed.
<p>You may intersperse documentation and Perl code within the .pm file.
In fact, if you want to use method autoloading, you must do this,
as the comment inside the .pm file explains.
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlpod.html">

 for more information about the pod format.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlxstut_installing_0">
INSTALLING YOUR EXTENSION</A>
</H2>
Once your extension is complete and passes all its tests, installing it
is quite simple: you simply run ``make install''.  You will either need 
to have write permission into the directories where Perl is installed,
or ask your system administrator to run the make for you.

<A NAME="perlfunc_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The functions in this section can serve as terms in an expression.
They fall into two major categories: list operators and named unary
operators.  These differ in their precedence relationship with a
following comma.  (See the precedence table in 
<A HREF="perlop.html">
the <EM>perlop</EM> manpage</A>
.)  List
operators take more than one argument, while unary operators can never
take more than one argument.  Thus, a comma terminates the argument of
a unary operator, but merely separates the arguments of a list
operator.  A unary operator generally provides a scalar context to its
argument, while a list operator may provide either scalar and list
contexts for its arguments.  If it does both, the scalar arguments will
be first, and the list argument will follow.  (Note that there can only
ever be one list argument.)  For instance, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_splice_2">splice()</A>
 has three scalar
arguments followed by a list.
<p>In the syntax descriptions that follow, list operators that expect a
list (and provide list context for the elements of the list) are shown
with LIST as an argument.  Such a list may consist of any combination
of scalar arguments or list values; the list values will be included
in the list as if each individual element were interpolated at that
point in the list, forming a longer single-dimensional list value.
Elements of the LIST should be separated by commas.
<p>Any function in the list below may be used either with or without
parentheses around its arguments.  (The syntax descriptions omit the
parens.)  If you use the parens, the simple (but occasionally
surprising) rule is this: It <EM>LOOKS</EM> like a function, therefore it <EM>IS</EM> a
function, and precedence doesn't matter.  Otherwise it's a list
operator or unary operator, and precedence does matter.  And whitespace
between the function and left parenthesis doesn't count--so you need to
be careful sometimes:
<p>
<XMP>
    print 1+2+3;        # Prints 6.
    print(1+2) + 3;     # Prints 3.
    print (1+2)+3;      # Also prints 3!
    print +(1+2)+3;     # Prints 6.
    print ((1+2)+3);    # Prints 6.

</XMP>
<p>If you run Perl with the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch it can warn you about this.  For
example, the third line above produces:
<p>
<XMP>
    print (...) interpreted as function at - line 1.
    Useless use of integer addition in void context at - line 1.

</XMP>
<p>For functions that can be used in either a scalar or list context,
non-abortive failure is generally indicated in a scalar context by
returning the undefined value, and in a list context by returning the
null list.
<p>Remember the following rule:

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
</DL>
Each operator and function decides which sort of value it would be most.appropriate to return in a scalar context.  Some operators return the
length of the list that would have been returned in a list context.  Some
operators return the first value in the list.  Some operators return the
last value in the list.  Some operators return a count of successful
operations.  In general, they do what you want, unless you want
consistency.

</STRONG>
<DD>
A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.  This unary
operator takes one argument, either a filename or a filehandle, and
tests the associated file to see if something is true about it.  If the
argument is omitted, tests 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
, except for <CODE>-t</CODE>, which tests STDIN.
Unless otherwise documented, it returns <CODE>1</CODE> for TRUE and <CODE>''</CODE> for FALSE, or
the undefined value if the file doesn't exist.  Despite the funny
names, precedence is the same as any other named unary operator, and
the argument may be parenthesized like any other unary operator.  The
operator may be any of:
<p>
<XMP>
    -r  File is readable by effective uid/gid.
    -w  File is writable by effective uid/gid.
    -x  File is executable by effective uid/gid.
    -o  File is owned by effective uid.
    -R  File is readable by real uid/gid.
    -W  File is writable by real uid/gid.
    -X  File is executable by real uid/gid.
    -O  File is owned by real uid.
    -e  File exists.
    -z  File has zero size.
    -s  File has non-zero size (returns size).
    -f  File is a plain file.
    -d  File is a directory.
    -l  File is a symbolic link.
    -p  File is a named pipe (FIFO).
    -S  File is a socket.
    -b  File is a block special file.
    -c  File is a character special file.
    -t  Filehandle is opened to a tty.
    -u  File has setuid bit set.
    -g  File has setgid bit set.
    -k  File has sticky bit set.
    -T  File is a text file.
    -B  File is a binary file (opposite of -T).
    -M  Age of file in days when script started.
    -A  Same for access time.
    -C  Same for inode change time.

</XMP>
<p>The interpretation of the file permission operators <CODE>-r</CODE>, <CODE>-R</CODE>, 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
,
<CODE>-W</CODE>, 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_x_0">-x</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_x_0">-X</A>
 is based solely on the mode of the file and the
uids and gids of the user.  There may be other reasons you can't actually
read, write or execute the file.  Also note that, for the superuser,
<CODE>-r</CODE>, <CODE>-R</CODE>, 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 and <CODE>-W</CODE> always return 1, and 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_x_0">-x</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_x_0">-X</A>
 return
1 if any execute bit is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the superuser may
thus need to do a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_stat_1">stat()</A>
 in order to determine the actual mode of the
file, or temporarily set the uid to something else.
<p>Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        chop;
        next unless -f $_;      # ignore specials
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>Note that 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_s_0">-s/a/b/</A>
 does not do a negated substitution.  Saying
<CODE>-exp(<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>)</CODE> still works as expected, however--only single letters
following a minus are interpreted as file tests.
<p>The 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>
 and <CODE>-B</CODE> switches work as follows.  The first block or so of the
file is examined for odd characters such as strange control codes or
characters with the high bit set.  If too many odd characters (&gt;30%)
are found, it's a <CODE>-B</CODE> file, otherwise it's a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>
 file.  Also, any file
containing null in the first block is considered a binary file.  If 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>

or <CODE>-B</CODE> is used on a filehandle, the current stdio buffer is examined
rather than the first block.  Both 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>
 and <CODE>-B</CODE> return TRUE on a null
file, or a file at EOF when testing a filehandle.  Because you have to 
read a file to do the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>
 test, on most occasions you want to use a <CODE>-f</CODE>
against the file first, as in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next unless -f <STRONG>$file</STRONG> &amp;&amp; -T <STRONG>$file</STRONG></A>
.
<p>If any of the file tests (or either the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_stat_1">stat()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_lstat_1">lstat()</A>
 operators) are given the
special filehandle consisting of a solitary underline, then the stat
structure of the previous file test (or stat operator) is used, saving
a system call.  (This doesn't work with <CODE>-t</CODE>, and you need to remember
that 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_lstat_1">lstat()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_l_0">-l</A>
 will leave values in the stat structure for the
symbolic link, not the real file.)  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "Can do.\n" if -r $a || -w _ || -x _;
    stat($filename);
    print "Readable\n" if -r _;
    print "Writable\n" if -w _;
    print "Executable\n" if -x _;
    print "Setuid\n" if -u _;
    print "Setgid\n" if -g _;
    print "Sticky\n" if -k _;
    print "Text\n" if -T _;
    print "Binary\n" if -B _;

<A NAME="perlfunc_accept_0">
accept NEWSOCKET,GENERICSOCKET</A>

</STRONG>

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_alarm_0">
alarm SECONDS</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Arranges to have a SIGALRM delivered to this process after the
specified number of seconds have elapsed.  (On some machines,
unfortunately, the elapsed time may be up to one second less than you
specified because of how seconds are counted.)  Only one timer may be
counting at once.  Each call disables the previous timer, and an
argument of 0 may be supplied to cancel the previous timer without
starting a new one.  The returned value is the amount of time remaining
on the previous timer.
<p>For delays of finer granularity than one second, you may use Perl's

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_syscall_0">syscall()</A>

<A NAME="perlfunc_bind_0">
bind SOCKET,NAME</A>

<DD>
Binds a network address to a socket, just as the bind system call

<EM>``Sockets: Client/Server Communication''</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_binmode_0">
binmode FILEHANDLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Arranges for the file to be read or written in ``binary'' mode in operating
systems that distinguish between binary and text files.  Files that are
not in binary mode have CR LF sequences translated to LF on input and LF
translated to CR LF on output.  Binmode has no effect under Unix; in DOS
and similarly archaic systems, it may be imperative--otherwise your
DOS-damaged C library may mangle your file.  The key distinction between
systems that need binmode and those that don't is their text file
formats.  Systems like Unix and Plan9 that delimit lines with a single
character, and that encode that character in C as '\n', do not need

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_binmode_0">binmode</A>
.  The rest need it.  If FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value
is taken as the name of the filehandle.

This function tells the referenced object (passed as REF) that it is now
an object in the CLASSNAME package--or the current package if no CLASSNAME
is specified, which is often the case.  It returns the reference for
convenience, since a

This is a slightly safer version of chop (see below).  It removes any

 (also known as

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_input_record_separator_1">$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR</A>
 in the <CODE>English</CODE> module).  It returns the number
of characters removed.  It's often used to remove the newline from the
end of an input record when you're worried that the final record may be
missing its newline.  When in paragraph mode (<CODE>$/ = ``''</CODE>), it removes all
trailing newlines from the string.  If VARIABLE is omitted, it chomps

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>

<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {

Chops off the last character of a string and returns the character

<p>On most systems, you are not allowed to change the ownership of the

begin with a ``/'' by your process and all of its children.  (It doesn't

<A NAME="perlfunc_close_0">

Closes the file or pipe associated with the file handle, returning TRUE

descriptor.  You don't have to close FILEHANDLE if you are immediately
going to do another 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 will close it for you.  (See

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
.)  However, an explicit close on an input file resets the line
counter ($.), while the implicit close done by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 does not.  Also,
closing a pipe will wait for the process executing on the pipe to
complete, in case you want to look at the output of the pipe
afterwards.  Closing a pipe explicitly also puts the status value of
the command into

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 BLOCK attached to a BLOCK (typically in a <CODE>while</CODE> or
<CODE>foreach</CODE>), it is always executed just before the conditional is about to
be evaluated again, just like the third part of a <CODE>for</CODE> loop in C.  Thus
it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been
continued via the

<A NAME="perlfunc_crypt_0">

<DD>
Encrypts a string exactly like the crypt(3) function in the C library

extirpated as a potential munition).  This can prove useful for checking
the password file for lousy passwords, amongst other things.  Only the
guys wearing white hats should do this.
<p>Here's an example that makes sure that whoever runs this program knows
their own password:
<p>
<XMP>
    $pwd = (getpwuid($<))[1];

dbmopen ASSOC,DBNAME,MODE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
[This function has been superseded by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 function.]
<p>This binds a dbm(3), ndbm(3), sdbm(3), <EM>gdbm()</EM>, or Berkeley DB file to an
associative array.  ASSOC is the name of the associative array.  (Unlike
normal open, the first argument is <EM>NOT</EM> a filehandle, even though it
looks like one).  DBNAME is the name of the database (without the <EM>.dir</EM>
or <EM>.pag</EM> extension if any).  If the database does not exist, it is
created with protection specified by MODE (as modified by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_umask_0">umask()</A>
).
If your system only supports the older DBM functions, you may perform only
one 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
 in your program.  In older versions of Perl, if your system
had neither DBM nor ndbm, calling 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
 produced a fatal error; it now
falls back to sdbm(3).
<p>If you don't have write access to the DBM file, you can only read
associative array variables, not set them.  If you want to test whether
you can write, either use file tests or try setting a dummy array entry
inside an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, which will trap the error.
<p>Note that functions such as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_values_0">values()</A>
 may return huge array
values when used on large DBM files.  You may prefer to use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>

function to iterate over large DBM files.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    # print out history file offsets
    dbmopen(%HIST,'/usr/lib/news/history',0666);
    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
        print $key, ' = ', unpack('L',$val), "\n";
    }
    dbmclose(%HIST);

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_defined_0">
defined EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a boolean value saying whether EXPR has a real value
or not.  Many operations return the undefined value under exceptional
conditions, such as end of file, uninitialized variable, system error
and such.  This function allows you to distinguish between an undefined
null scalar and a defined null scalar with operations that might return
a real null string, such as referencing elements of an array.  You may
also check to see if arrays or subroutines exist.  Use of defined on
predefined variables is not guaranteed to produce intuitive results.
<p>When used on a hash array element, it tells you whether the value
is defined, not whether the key exists in the hash.  Use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exists_0">exists()</A>
 for that.
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    print if defined $switch{'D'};
    print "$val\n" while defined($val = pop(@ary));
    die "Can't readlink $sym: $!"
        unless defined($value = readlink $sym);
    eval '@foo = ()' if defined(@foo);
    die "No XYZ package defined" unless defined %_XYZ;
    sub foo { defined &$bar ? &$bar(@_) : die "No bar"; }

</XMP>
<p>See also 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>
.
<p>Note: many folks tend to overuse 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
, and then are surprised to
discover that the number 0 and the null string are, in fact, defined
concepts.  For example, if you say
<p>
<XMP>
    "ab" =~ /a(.*)b/;

</XMP>
<p>the pattern match succeeds, and <STRONG>$1</STRONG> is defined, despite the fact that it
matched ``nothing''.  But it didn't really match nothing--rather, it
matched something that happened to be 0 characters long.  This is all
very above-board and honest.  When a function returns an undefined value,
it's an admission that it couldn't give you an honest answer.  So
you should only use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
 when you're questioning the integrity
of what you're trying to do.  At other times, a simple comparison to
0 or ``'' is what you want.

<A NAME="perlfunc_delete_0">

Deletes the specified value from its hash array.  Returns the deleted

<CODE><STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{}</CODE> modifies the environment.  Deleting from an array tied to a DBM
file deletes the entry from the DBM file.  (But deleting from a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
d
hash doesn't necessarily return anything.)
<p>The following deletes all the values of an associative array:
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $key (keys %ARRAY) {
        delete $ARRAY{$key};
    }

</XMP>
<p>(But it would be faster to use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>

exits with 255.  Inside an

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>

<XMP>
    die "Can't cd to spool: $!\n" unless chdir '/usr/spool/news';

</XMP>
<p>If the value of EXPR does not end in a newline, the current script line
number and input line number (if any) are also printed, and a newline
is supplied.  Hint: sometimes appending ``, stopped'' to your message
will cause it to make better sense when the string ``at foo line 123'' is
appended.  Suppose you are running script ``canasta''.
<p>
<XMP>
    die "/etc/games is no good";
    die "/etc/games is no good, stopped";

<A NAME="perlfunc_eof_1">
eof</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns 1 if the next read on FILEHANDLE will return end of file, or if
FILEHANDLE is not open.  FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value
gives the real filehandle name.  (Note that this function actually
reads a character and then <EM>ungetc()</EM>s it, so it is not very useful in an
interactive context.)  Do not read from a terminal file (or call

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof(FILEHANDLE)</A>
 on it) after end-of-file is reached.  Filetypes such
as terminals may lose the end-of-file condition if you do.
<p>An 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof</A>
 without an argument uses the last file read as argument.
Empty parentheses () may be used to indicate
the pseudofile formed of the files listed on the command line, i.e.

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof()</A>
</A>
 is reasonable to use inside a while (&lt;&gt;) loop to detect the end
of only the last file.  Use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof(ARGV)</A>
 or eof without the parentheses to
test <EM>EACH</EM> file in a while (&lt;&gt;) loop.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    # reset line numbering on each input file
    while (<>) {
        print "$.\t$_";
        close(ARGV) if (eof);   # Not eof().
    }
    # insert dashes just before last line of last file
    while (<>) {
        if (eof()) {
            print "--------------\n";
            close(ARGV);        # close or break; is needed if we
                                # are reading from the terminal
        }
        print;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Practical hint: you almost never need to use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof</A>
 in Perl, because the
input operators return undef when they run out of data.

<A NAME="perlfunc_eval_0">
eval EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_eval_1">
eval BLOCK</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
EXPR is parsed and executed as if it were a little Perl program.  It
is executed in the context of the current Perl program, so that any
variable settings, subroutine or format definitions remain afterwards.
The value returned is the value of the last expression evaluated, or a
return statement may be used, just as with subroutines.
<p>If there is a syntax error or runtime error, or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 statement is
executed, an undefined value is returned by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, and 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 is set to the
error message.  If there was no error, 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 is guaranteed to be a null
string.  If EXPR is omitted, evaluates 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
.  The final semicolon, if
any, may be omitted from the expression.
<p>Note that, since 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
 traps otherwise-fatal errors, it is useful for
determining whether a particular feature (such as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_socket_0">socket()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_symlink_0">symlink()</A>
)
is implemented.  It is also Perl's exception trapping mechanism, where
the die operator is used to raise exceptions.
<p>If the code to be executed doesn't vary, you may use the eval-BLOCK
form to trap run-time errors without incurring the penalty of
recompiling each time.  The error, if any, is still returned in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
.
Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    # make divide-by-zero non-fatal
    eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;
    # same thing, but less efficient
    eval '$answer = $a / $b'; warn $@ if $@;
    # a compile-time error
    eval { $answer = };
    # a run-time error
    eval '$answer =';   # sets $@

</XMP>
<p>With an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, you should be especially careful to remember what's 
being looked at when:
<p>
<XMP>
    eval $x;            # CASE 1
    eval "$x";          # CASE 2
    eval '$x';          # CASE 3
    eval { $x };        # CASE 4
    eval "\$$x++"       # CASE 5
    $$x++;              # CASE 6

</XMP>
<p>Cases 1 and 2 above behave identically: they run the code contained in the
variable <STRONG>$x</STRONG>.  (Although case 2 has misleading double quotes making the
reader wonder what else might be happening (nothing is).) Cases 3 and 4
likewise behave in the same way: they run the code &lt;<STRONG>$x</STRONG>&gt;, which does
nothing at all.  (Case 4 is preferred for purely visual reasons.) Case 5
is a place where normally you <EM>WOULD</EM> like to use double quotes, except
that in that particular situation, you can just use symbolic references
instead, as in case 6.

<A NAME="perlfunc_exec_0">
exec LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
 function executes a system command <EM>AND NEVER RETURNS</EM>.  Use
the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_system_1">system()</A>
 function if you want it to return.
<p>If there is more than one argument in LIST, or if LIST is an array with
more than one value, calls execvp(3) with the arguments in LIST.  If
there is only one scalar argument, the argument is checked for shell
metacharacters.  If there are any, the entire argument is passed to
<CODE>/bin/sh -c</CODE> for parsing.  If there are none, the argument is split
into words and passed directly to <EM>execvp()</EM>, which is more efficient.
Note: 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_system_1">system()</A>
 do not flush your output buffer, so you may
need to set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__8">$|</A>
 to avoid lost output.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    exec '/bin/echo', 'Your arguments are: ', @ARGV;
    exec "sort $outfile | uniq";

</XMP>
<p>If you don't really want to execute the first argument, but want to lie
to the program you are executing about its own name, you can specify
the program you actually want to run as an ``indirect object'' (without a
comma) in front of the LIST.  (This always forces interpretation of the
LIST as a multi-valued list, even if there is only a single scalar in
the list.)  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    $shell = '/bin/csh';
    exec $shell '-sh';          # pretend it's a login shell

</XMP>
<p>or, more directly,
<p>

<A NAME="perlfunc_exists_0">

</XMP>
<p>A hash element can only be TRUE if it's defined, and defined if
it exists, but the reverse doesn't necessarily hold true.
<p>Note that the EXPR can be arbitrarily complicated as long as the final
operation is a hash key lookup:

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_exit_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Evaluates EXPR and exits immediately with that value.  (Actually, it
calls any defined <CODE>END</CODE> routines first, but the <CODE>END</CODE> routines may not
abort the exit.  Likewise any object destructors that need to be called
are called before exit.)  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    $ans = <STDIN>;
    exit 0 if $ans =~ /^[Xx]/;

</XMP>
<p>See also

fatal error if used on a machine that doesn't implement either flock(2) or
fcntl(2). The fcntl(2) system call will be automatically used if flock(2)
is missing from your system.  This makes 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_flock_0">flock()</A>
 the portable file locking
strategy, although it will only lock entire files, not records.  Note also
that some versions of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_flock_0">flock()</A>
 cannot lock things over the network; you
would need to use the more system-specific

Note: unflushed buffers remain unflushed in both processes, which means

<A NAME="perlfunc_formline_0">
formline PICTURE, LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is an internal function used by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_format_0">format</A>
s, though you may call it
too.  It formats (see 
<A HREF="perlform.html">
the <EM>perlform</EM> manpage</A>
) a list of values according to the
contents of PICTURE, placing the output into the format output
accumulator, 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_a_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
A</A>
 (or 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_accumulator_0">$ACCUMULATOR</A>
 in English).
Eventually, when a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
 is done, the contents of

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_a_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
A</A>
 are written to some filehandle, but you could also read 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_a_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
A</A>

yourself and then set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_a_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
A</A>
 back to ``''.  Note that a format typically
does one 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_formline_0">formline()</A>
 per line of form, but the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_formline_0">formline()</A>
 function itself
doesn't care how many newlines are embedded in the PICTURE.  This means
that the <CODE>~</CODE> and <CODE>~~</CODE> tokens will treat the entire PICTURE as a single line.
You may therefore need to use multiple formlines to implement a single
record format, just like the format compiler.
<p>Be careful if you put double quotes around the picture, since an ``<CODE>@</CODE>''
character may be taken to mean the beginning of an array name.

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_formline_0">formline()</A>

<EM>goto &amp;NAME</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
The goto-LABEL form finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes
execution there.  It may not be used to go into any construct that
requires initialization, such as a subroutine or a foreach loop.  It
also can't be used to go into a construct that is optimized away.  It
can be used to go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope,
including out of subroutines, but it's usually better to use some other
construct such as last or die.  The author of Perl has never felt the
need to use this form of goto (in Perl, that is--C is another matter).
<p>The goto-EXPR form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically.  This allows for computed gotos per FORTRAN, but isn't
necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:
<p>
<XMP>
    goto ("FOO", "BAR", "GLARCH")[$i];

</XMP>
<p>The goto-&amp;NAME form is highly magical, and substitutes a call to the
named subroutine for the currently running subroutine.  This is used by
AUTOLOAD subroutines that wish to load another subroutine and then
pretend that the other subroutine had been called in the first place
(except that any modifications to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> in the current subroutine are
propagated to the other subroutine.)  After the goto, not even 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_caller_0">caller()</A>

will be able to tell that this routine was called first.

<A NAME="perlfunc_grep_1">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for each element of LIST (locally setting

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 to each element) and returns the list value consisting of those
elements for which the expression evaluated to TRUE.  In a scalar
context, returns the number of times the expression was TRUE.
<p>
<XMP>
    @foo = grep(!/^#/, @bar);    # weed out comments

</XMP>
<p>or equivalently,
<p>
<XMP>
    @foo = grep {!/^#/} @bar;    # weed out comments

</XMP>
<p>Note that, since 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 is a reference into the list value, it can be used
to modify the elements of the array.  While this is useful and
supported, it can cause bizarre results if the LIST is not a named

<A NAME="perlfunc_hex_0">

Interprets EXPR as a hex string and returns the corresponding decimal

<A NAME="perlfunc_import_0">

There is no built-in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_import_0">import()</A>
 function.  It is merely an ordinary
method (subroutine) defined (or inherited) by modules that wish to export
names to another module.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use()</A>

<A NAME="perlfunc_index_1">
index STR,SUBSTR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the position of the first occurrence of SUBSTR in STR at or after
POSITION.  If POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of
the string.  The return value is based at 0 (or whatever you've set the $[
variable to--but don't do that).  If the substring is not found, returns
one less than the base, ordinarily -1.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_int_0">

Returns the integer portion of EXPR.  If EXPR is omitted, uses

.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_ioctl_0">
ioctl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Implements the ioctl(2) function.  You'll probably have to say
<p>
<XMP>
    require "ioctl.ph"; # probably in /usr/local/lib/perl/ioctl.ph

</XMP>
<p>first to get the correct function definitions.  If 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_ioctl_0">ioctl.ph</A>
 doesn't
exist or doesn't have the correct definitions you'll have to roll your
own, based on your C header files such as <EM>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</EM>.
(There is a Perl script called <STRONG>h2ph</STRONG> that comes with the Perl kit which
may help you in this, but it's non-trivial.)  SCALAR will be read and/or
written depending on the FUNCTION--a pointer to the string value of SCALAR
will be passed as the third argument of the actual ioctl call.  (If SCALAR
has no string value but does have a numeric value, that value will be
passed rather than a pointer to the string value.  To guarantee this to be
TRUE, add a 0 to the scalar before using it.)  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pack_0">pack()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unpack_0">unpack()</A>

functions are useful for manipulating the values of structures used by

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_ioctl_0">ioctl()</A>
.  The following example sets the erase character to DEL.
<p>
<XMP>
    require 'ioctl.ph';
    $getp = &TIOCGETP;
    die "NO TIOCGETP" if $@ || !$getp;
    $sgttyb_t = "ccccs";                # 4 chars and a short
    if (ioctl(STDIN,$getp,$sgttyb)) {
        @ary = unpack($sgttyb_t,$sgttyb);
        $ary[2] = 127;
        $sgttyb = pack($sgttyb_t,@ary);
        ioctl(STDIN,&TIOCSETP,$sgttyb)
            || die "Can't ioctl: $!";
    }

</XMP>
<p>The return value of ioctl (and fcntl) is as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
        if OS returns:          then Perl returns:
            -1                    undefined value
             0                  string "0 but true"
        anything else               that number

</XMP>
<p>Thus Perl returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure, yet you can
still easily determine the actual value returned by the operating
system:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($retval = ioctl(...)) || ($retval = -1);
    printf "System returned %d\n", $retval;

<A NAME="perlfunc_join_0">

Joins the separate strings of LIST or ARRAY into a single string with

Example:

    $_ = join(':', $login,$passwd,$uid,$gid,$gcos,$home,$shell);

<A NAME="perlfunc_keys_0">
keys ASSOC_ARRAY</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a normal array consisting of all the keys of the named

The keys are returned in an apparently random order, but it is the same
order as either the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_values_0">values()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>
 function produces (given that
the associative array has not been modified).  Here is yet another way
to print your environment:
<p>
<XMP>
    @keys = keys %ENV;
    @values = values %ENV;
    while ($#keys >= 0) {
        print pop(@keys), '=', pop(@values), "\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>or how about sorted by key:
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
        print $key, '=', $ENV{$key}, "\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>To sort an array by value, you'll need to use a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sort_2">sort{}</A>

function.  Here's a descending numeric sort of a hash by its values:
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $key (sort { $hash{$b} <=> $hash{$a} } keys %hash)) {
        printf "%4d %s\n", $hash{$key}, $key;

<A NAME="perlfunc_kill_0">

processes successfully signaled.
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt = kill 1, $child1, $child2;
    kill 9, @goners;

</XMP>
<p>Unlike in the shell, in Perl if the <EM>SIGNAL</EM> is negative, it kills
process groups instead of processes.  (On System V, a negative <EM>PROCESS</EM>
number will also kill process groups, but that's not portable.)  That

use a signal name in quotes.  See the <EM>``Signals''</EM> man page for details.

<A NAME="perlfunc_open_1">

<DD>
Opens the file whose filename is given by EXPR, and associates it with
FILEHANDLE.  If FILEHANDLE is an expression, its value is used as the name
of the real filehandle wanted.  If EXPR is omitted, the scalar variable of
the same name as the FILEHANDLE contains the filename.  If the filename
begins with ``&lt;'' or nothing, the file is opened for input.  If the filename
begins with ``&gt;'', the file is opened for output.  If the filename begins
with ``&gt;&gt;'', the file is opened for appending.  You can put a '+' in front
of the '&gt;' or '&lt;' to indicate that you want both read and write access to
the file; thus '+&lt;' is usually preferred for read/write updates--the '+&gt;'
mode would clobber the file first.  These correspond to the fopen(3) modes
of 'r', 'r+', 'w', 'w+', 'a', and 'a+'.
<p>If the filename begins with ``|'', the filename is interpreted
as a command to which output is to be piped, and if the filename ends with
a ``|'', the filename is interpreted See <EM>``Using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 for IPC''</EM>
for more examples of this.  as command which pipes input to us.  (You may
not have a raw 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 to a command that pipes both in <EM>and</EM> out, but see See <EM>open2</EM>,
<EM>open3</EM>, and <EM>``Bidirectional Communication''</EM> for alternatives.)
<p>Opening '-' opens STDIN and opening '&gt;-' opens STDOUT.  Open returns
non-zero upon success, the undefined value otherwise.  If the open
involved a pipe, the return value happens to be the pid of the
subprocess.  
<p>If you're unfortunate enough to be running Perl on a system that
distinguishes between text files and binary files (modern operating
systems don't care), then you should check out 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_binmode_0"><EM>binmode</EM></A>
 for tips for
dealing with this.  The key distinction between systems that need binmode
and those that don't is their text file formats.  Systems like Unix and
Plan9 that delimit lines with a single character, and that encode that
character in C as '\n', do not need 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_binmode_0">binmode</A>
.  The rest need it.
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    $ARTICLE = 100;
    open ARTICLE or die "Can't find article $ARTICLE: $!\n";
    while (<ARTICLE>) {...

</XMP>
<PRE>
    open(LOG, '&gt;&gt;/usr/spool/news/twitlog'); # (log is reserved)

                next;

</PRE>
<p>You may also, in the Bourne shell tradition, specify an EXPR beginning
with ``&gt;&amp;'', in which case the rest of the string is interpreted as the
name of a filehandle (or file descriptor, if numeric) which is to be
duped and opened.  You may use &amp; after &gt;, &gt;&gt;, &lt;, +&gt;, +&gt;&gt; and +&lt;.  The
mode you specify should match the mode of the original filehandle.
(Duping a filehandle does not take into acount any existing contents of
stdio buffers.)
Here is a script that saves, redirects, and restores STDOUT and
STDERR:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    open(SAVEOUT, ">&STDOUT");
    open(SAVEERR, ">&STDERR");
    open(STDOUT, ">foo.out") || die "Can't redirect stdout";
    open(STDERR, ">&STDOUT") || die "Can't dup stdout";
    select(STDERR); $| = 1;     # make unbuffered
    select(STDOUT); $| = 1;     # make unbuffered
    print STDOUT "stdout 1\n";  # this works for
    print STDERR "stderr 1\n";  # subprocesses too
    close(STDOUT);
    close(STDERR);
    open(STDOUT, ">&SAVEOUT");
    open(STDERR, ">&SAVEERR");
    print STDOUT "stdout 2\n";
    print STDERR "stderr 2\n";

</XMP>
<p>If you specify ``&lt;&amp;=N'', where N is a number, then Perl will do an
equivalent of C's <EM>fdopen()</EM> of that file descriptor; this is more
parsimonious of file descriptors.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FILEHANDLE, "<&=$fd")

</XMP>
<p>If you open a pipe on the command ``-'', i.e. either ``|-'' or ``-|'', then
there is an implicit fork done, and the return value of open is the pid
of the child within the parent process, and 0 within the child
process.  (Use defined(<STRONG>$pid</STRONG>) to determine whether the open was successful.)
The filehandle behaves normally for the parent, but i/o to that
filehandle is piped from/to the STDOUT/STDIN of the child process.
In the child process the filehandle isn't opened--i/o happens from/to
the new STDOUT or STDIN.  Typically this is used like the normal
piped open when you want to exercise more control over just how the
pipe command gets executed, such as when you are running setuid, and
don't want to have to scan shell commands for metacharacters.  
The following pairs are more or less equivalent:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FOO, "|tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'");
    open(FOO, "|-") || exec 'tr', '[a-z]', '[A-Z]';
    open(FOO, "cat -n '$file'|");
    open(FOO, "-|") || exec 'cat', '-n', $file;

</XMP>
<p>See <EM>``Safe Pipe Opens''</EM> for more examples of this.
<p>Explicitly closing any piped filehandle causes the parent process to
wait for the child to finish, and returns the status value in $?.
Note: on any operation which may do a fork, unflushed buffers remain
unflushed in both processes, which means you may need to set $| to
avoid duplicate output.
<p>Using the FileHandle constructor from the FileHandle package,
you can generate anonymous filehandles which have the scope of whatever
variables hold references to them, and automatically close whenever
and however you leave that scope:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    ...
    sub read_myfile_munged {
        my $ALL = shift;
        my $handle = new FileHandle;
        open($handle, "myfile") or die "myfile: $!";
        $first = <$handle>
            or return ();     # Automatically closed here.
        mung $first or die "mung failed";       # Or here.
        return $first, <$handle> if $ALL;       # Or here.
        $first;                                 # Or here.
    }

</XMP>
<p>The filename that is passed to open will have leading and trailing
whitespace deleted.  In order to open a file with arbitrary weird
characters in it, it's necessary to protect any leading and trailing
whitespace thusly:
<p>
<XMP>
    $file =~ s#^(\s)#./$1#;
    open(FOO, "< $file\0");

</XMP>
<p>If you want a ``real'' C 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 (see <EM>open(2)</EM> on your system), then
you should use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sysopen_1">sysopen()</A>
 function.  This is another way to
protect your filenames from interpretation.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    sysopen(HANDLE, $path, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0700)
        or die "sysopen $path: $!";
    HANDLE->autoflush(1);
    HANDLE->print("stuff $$\n");
    seek(HANDLE, 0, 0);
    print "File contains: ", <HANDLE>;

<p>Each letter may optionally be followed by a number which gives a repeat
count.  With all types except ``a'', ``A'', ``b'', ``B'', ``h'' and ``H'', and ``P'' the
pack function will gobble up that many values from the LIST.  A * for the
repeat count means to use however many items are left.  The ``a'' and ``A''
types gobble just one value, but pack it as a string of length count,
padding with nulls or spaces as necessary.  (When unpacking, ``A'' strips
trailing spaces and nulls, but ``a'' does not.)  Likewise, the ``b'' and ``B''
fields pack a string that many bits long.  The ``h'' and ``H'' fields pack a
string that many nybbles long.  The ``P'' packs a pointer to a structure of
the size indicated by the length.  Real numbers (floats and doubles) are
in the native machine format only; due to the multiplicity of floating
formats around, and the lack of a standard ``network'' representation, no
facility for interchange has been made.  This means that packed floating
point data written on one machine may not be readable on another - even if
both use IEEE floating point arithmetic (as the endian-ness of the memory
representation is not part of the IEEE spec).  Note that Perl uses doubles
internally for all numeric calculation, and converting from double into
float and thence back to double again will lose precision (i.e.

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unpack_0">unpack(``f'', pack(``f'', <STRONG>$foo</STRONG>)</A>
) will not in general equal <STRONG>$foo</STRONG>).
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo = pack("cccc",65,66,67,68);
    # foo eq "ABCD"
    $foo = pack("c4",65,66,67,68);

    $foo = pack("ccxxcc",65,66,67,68);
    # foo eq "AB\0\0CD"
    $foo = pack("s2",1,2);
    # "\1\0\2\0" on little-endian
    # "\0\1\0\2" on big-endian
    $foo = pack("a4","abcd","x","y","z");
    # "abcd"
    $foo = pack("aaaa","abcd","x","y","z");

package NAMESPACE</A>

<DD>
Declares the compilation unit as being in the given namespace.  The scope
of the package declaration is from the declaration itself through the end of
the enclosing block (the same scope as the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 operator).  All further
unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this namespace.  A package
statement only affects dynamic variables--including those you've used

 on--but <EM>not</EM> lexical variables created with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>

or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>

it merely influences which symbol table is used by the compiler for the
rest of that block.  You can refer to variables and filehandles in other
packages by prefixing the identifier with the package name and a double
colon:  <CODE><STRONG>$Package::Variable</STRONG></CODE>.  If the package name is null, the <CODE>main</CODE>
package as assumed.  That is, <CODE><STRONG>$::sail</STRONG></CODE> is equivalent to <CODE><STRONG>$main::sail</STRONG></CODE>.

<DD>
Opens a pair of connected pipes like the corresponding system call.
Note that if you set up a loop of piped processes, deadlock can occur
unless you are very careful.  In addition, note that Perl's pipes use
stdio buffering, so you may need to set $| to flush your WRITEHANDLE

<p>If there are no elements in the array, returns the undefined value.

<DD>
Prints a string or a comma-separated list of strings.  Returns TRUE
if successful.  FILEHANDLE may be a scalar variable name, in which case
the variable contains the name of or a reference to the filehandle, thus introducing one
level of indirection.  (NOTE: If FILEHANDLE is a variable and the next
token is a term, it may be misinterpreted as an operator unless you
interpose a + or put parens around the arguments.)  If FILEHANDLE is
omitted, prints by default to standard output (or to the last selected
output channel--see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
).  If LIST is also omitted, prints 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 to
STDOUT.  To set the default output channel to something other than
STDOUT use the select operation.  Note that, because print takes a
LIST, anything in the LIST is evaluated in a list context, and any
subroutine that you call will have one or more of its expressions
evaluated in a list context.  Also be careful not to follow the print
keyword with a left parenthesis unless you want the corresponding right
parenthesis to terminate the arguments to the print--interpose a + or
put parens around all the arguments.
<p>Note that if you're storing FILEHANDLES in an array or other expression,
you will have to use a block returning its value instead

Returns a TRUE value if EXPR is a reference, FALSE otherwise.  The value
returned depends on the type of thing the reference is a reference to.
Builtin types include:

    REF
    SCALAR
    ARRAY
    HASH
    CODE
    GLOB

</XMP>
<p>If the referenced object has been blessed into a package, then that package

<A NAME="perlfunc_require_0">
require</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Demands some semantics specified by EXPR, or by 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 if EXPR is not
supplied.  If EXPR is numeric, demands that the current version of Perl
($] or 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_perl_version_0">$PERL_VERSION</A>
) be equal or greater than EXPR.
<p>Otherwise, demands that a library file be included if it hasn't already
been included.  The file is included via the do-FILE mechanism, which is
essentially just a variety of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
.  Has semantics similar to the following
subroutine:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub require {
        local($filename) = @_;
        return 1 if $INC{$filename};
        local($realfilename,$result);
        ITER: {
            foreach $prefix (@INC) {
                $realfilename = "$prefix/$filename";

        die "$filename did not return true value" unless $result;
        $INC{$filename} = $realfilename;
        $result;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Note that the file will not be included twice under the same specified
name.  The file must return TRUE as the last statement to indicate
successful execution of any initialization code, so it's customary to
end such a file with ``1;'' unless you're sure it'll return TRUE
otherwise.  But it's better just to put the ``<CODE>1;</CODE>'', in case you add more
statements.
<p>If EXPR is a bare word, the require assumes a ``<EM>.pm</EM>'' extension for you,
to make it easy to load standard modules.  This form of loading of 
modules does not risk altering your namespace.

<A NAME="perlfunc_reset_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Generally used in a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 block at the end of a loop to clear
variables and reset ?? searches so that they work again.  The
expression is interpreted as a list of single characters (hyphens
allowed for ranges).  All variables and arrays beginning with one of
those letters are reset to their pristine state.  If the expression is
omitted, one-match searches (?pattern?) are reset to match again.  Only
resets variables or searches in the current package.  Always returns
1.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    reset 'X';          # reset all X variables
    reset 'a-z';        # reset lower case variables
    reset;              # just reset ?? searches

</XMP>
<p>Resetting ``A-Z'' is not recommended since you'll wipe out your
ARGV and ENV arrays.  Only resets package variables--lexical variables
are unaffected, but they clean themselves up on scope exit anyway,
so anymore you probably want to use them instead.  See

Forces EXPR to be interpreted in a scalar context and returns the value

<XMP>
    @counts = ( scalar @a, scalar @b, scalar @c );

</XMP>
<p>There is no equivalent operator to force an expression to 
be interpolated in a list context because it's in practice never
needed.  If you really wanted to do so, however, you could use
the construction <CODE>@{[ (some expression) ]}</CODE>, but usually a simple

<A NAME="perlfunc_seek_0">
seek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Randomly positions the file pointer for FILEHANDLE, just like the <EM>fseek()</EM>
call of stdio.  FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name
of the filehandle.  The values for WHENCE are 0 to set the file pointer to
POSITION, 1 to set the it to current plus POSITION, and 2 to set it to EOF
plus offset.  You may use the values SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END for
this from POSIX module.  Returns 1 upon success, 0 otherwise.
<p>On some systems you have to do a seek whenever you switch between reading
and writing.  Amongst other things, this may have the effect of calling
stdio's clearerr(3).  A ``whence'' of 1 (SEEK_CUR) is useful for not moving
the file pointer:
<p>
<XMP>
    seek(TEST,0,1);

</XMP>
<p>This is also useful for applications emulating <CODE>tail -f</CODE>.  Once you hit
EOF on your read, and then sleep for a while, you might have to stick in a

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_seek_0">seek()</A>
 to reset things.  First the simple trick listed above to clear the
filepointer.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_seek_0">seek()</A>
 doesn't change the current position, but it
<EM>does</EM> clear the end-of-file condition on the handle, so that the next
<CODE>&lt;FILE&gt;</CODE> makes Perl try again to read something.  Hopefully.
<p>If that doesn't work (some stdios are particularly cantankerous), then
you may need something more like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for (;;) {
        for ($curpos = tell(FILE); $_ = <FILE>; $curpos = tell(FILE)) {
            # search for some stuff and put it into files
        }

<A NAME="perlfunc_seekdir_0">
seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS</A>

<DD>
Sets the current position for the

must be a value returned by

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_select_1">
select</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the currently selected filehandle.  Sets the current default
filehandle for output, if FILEHANDLE is supplied.  This has two
effects: first, a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write</A>
 or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print</A>
 without a filehandle will
default to this FILEHANDLE.  Second, references to variables related to
output will refer to this output channel.  For example, if you have to
set the top of form format for more than one output channel, you might
do the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    select(REPORT1);
    $^ = 'report1_top';
    select(REPORT2);
    $^ = 'report2_top';

</XMP>
<p>FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name of the
actual filehandle.  Thus:
<p>
<XMP>
    $oldfh = select(STDERR); $| = 1; select($oldfh);

</XMP>
<p>Some programmers may prefer to think of filehandles as objects with
methods, preferring to write the last example as:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    STDERR->autoflush(1);

</XMP>

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_select_1">
select RBITS,WBITS,EBITS,TIMEOUT</A>

This calls the select(2) system call with the bitmasks specified, which

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_fileno_0">fileno()</A>

, along these lines:

    vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1;
    vec($win,fileno(STDOUT),1) = 1;
    $ein = $rin | $win;

</XMP>
<p>If you want to select on many filehandles you might wish to write a
subroutine:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub fhbits {
        local(@fhlist) = split(' ',$_[0]);
        local($bits);
        for (@fhlist) {

        }
        $bits;
    }
    $rin = fhbits('STDIN TTY SOCK');

</XMP>
<p>The usual idiom is:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($nfound,$timeleft) =
      select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, $timeout);

</XMP>
<p>or to block until something becomes ready just do this 
<p>
<XMP>
    $nfound = select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, undef);

</XMP>
<p>Most systems do not both to return anything useful in <STRONG>$timeleft</STRONG>, so
calling 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 in a scalar context just returns <STRONG>$nfound</STRONG>.
<p>Any of the bitmasks can also be undef.  The timeout, if specified, is
in seconds, which may be fractional.  Note: not all implementations are
capable of returning the <STRONG>$timeleft</STRONG>.  If not, they always return
<STRONG>$timeleft</STRONG> equal to the supplied <STRONG>$timeout</STRONG>.
<p>You can effect a 250-microsecond sleep this way:
<p>
<XMP>
    select(undef, undef, undef, 0.25);

<DD>
Sorts the LIST and returns the sorted list value.  Nonexistent values
of arrays are stripped out.  If SUBNAME or BLOCK is omitted, sorts
in standard string comparison order.  If SUBNAME is specified, it
gives the name of a subroutine that returns an integer less than, equal
to, or greater than 0, depending on how the elements of the array are
to be ordered.  (The &lt;=&gt; and cmp operators are extremely useful in such
routines.)  SUBNAME may be a scalar variable name, in which case the
value provides the name of the subroutine to use.  In place of a
SUBNAME, you can provide a BLOCK as an anonymous, in-line sort
subroutine.
<p>In the interests of efficiency the normal calling code for subroutines is
bypassed, with the following effects: the subroutine may not be a
recursive subroutine, and the two elements to be compared are passed into
the subroutine not via <STRONG>@_</STRONG> but as the package global variables <STRONG>$a</STRONG> and

<A NAME="perlfunc_split_2">
split</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Splits a string into an array of strings, and returns it.
<p>If not in a list context, returns the number of fields found and splits into
the <STRONG>@_</STRONG> array.  (In a list context, you can force the split into <STRONG>@_</STRONG> by
using <CODE>??</CODE> as the pattern delimiters, but it still returns the array
value.)  The use of implicit split to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> is deprecated, however.
<p>If EXPR is omitted, splits the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 string.  If PATTERN is also omitted,
splits on whitespace (after skipping any leading whitespace).  Anything
matching PATTERN is taken to be a delimiter separating the fields.  (Note
that the delimiter may be longer than one character.)  If LIMIT is
specified and is not negative, splits into no more than that many fields
(though it may split into fewer).  If LIMIT is unspecified, trailing null
fields are stripped (which potential users of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pop_0">pop()</A>
 would do well to
remember).  If LIMIT is negative, it is treated as if an arbitrarily large
LIMIT had been specified.
<p>A pattern matching the null string (not to be confused with
a null pattern <CODE>//</CODE>, which is just one member of the set of patterns
matching a null string) will split the value of EXPR into separate
characters at each point it matches that way.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    print join(':', split(/ */, 'hi there'));

</XMP>
<p>produces the output 'h:i:t:h:e:r:e'.
<p>The LIMIT parameter can be used to partially split a line
<p>
<XMP>
    ($login, $passwd, $remainder) = split(/:/, $_, 3);

</XMP>
<p>When assigning to a list, if LIMIT is omitted, Perl supplies a LIMIT
one larger than the number of variables in the list, to avoid
unnecessary work.  For the list above LIMIT would have been 4 by
default.  In time critical applications it behooves you not to split
into more fields than you really need.
<p>If the PATTERN contains parentheses, additional array elements are
created from each matching substring in the delimiter.
<p>
<XMP>
    split(/([,-])/, "1-10,20");

</XMP>
<p>produces the list value
<p>
<XMP>
    (1, '-', 10, ',', 20)

</XMP>
<p>If you had the entire header of a normal Unix email message in <STRONG>$header</STRONG>, 
you could split it up into fields and their values this way:
<p>
<XMP>
    $header =~ s/\n\s+/ /g;  # fix continuation lines
    %hdrs   =  (UNIX_FROM => split /^(.*?):\s*/m, $header);

</XMP>
<p>The pattern <CODE>/PATTERN/</CODE> may be replaced with an expression to specify
patterns that vary at runtime.  (To do runtime compilation only once,
use <CODE>/<STRONG>$variable</STRONG>/o</CODE>.)
<p>As a special case, specifying a PATTERN of space (<CODE>' '</CODE>) will split on
white space just as split with no arguments does.  Thus, split(' ') can
be used to emulate <STRONG>awk</STRONG>'s default behavior, whereas 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split(/ /)</A>

will give you as many null initial fields as there are leading spaces.
A split on /\s+/ is like a split(' ') except that any leading
whitespace produces a null first field.  A split with no arguments
really does a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split(' ', 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
)</A>
 internally.
<p>Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(passwd, '/etc/passwd');
    while (<passwd>) {
        ($login, $passwd, $uid, $gid, $gcos, 
            $home, $shell) = split(/:/);
        ...
    }

</XMP>

Returns a 13-element array giving the status info for a file, either the
file opened via FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR.  Returns a null list if
the stat fails.  Typically used as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
       $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
           = stat($filename);

</XMP>
<p>Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types.  Here are the 
meaning of the fields:
<p><UL><LI>  dev	    device number of filesystem </LI>
<LI>  ino	    inode number </LI>
<LI>  mode	    file mode  (type and permissions)</LI>
<LI>  nlink	    number of (hard) links to the file </LI>
<LI>  uid	    numeric user ID of file's owner </LI>
<LI>  gid	    numer group ID of file's owner </LI>
<LI>  rdev	    the device identifier (special files only)</LI>
<LI>  size	    total size of file, in bytes </LI>
<LI>  atime	    last access time since the epoch</LI>
<LI>  mtime	    last modify time since the epoch</LI>
<LI>  ctime	    inode change time (NOT creation type!) since the epoch</LI>
<LI>  blksize   preferred blocksize for file system I/O</LI>
<LI>  blocks    actual number of blocks allocated</LI>
</UL>
<p>(The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)
<p>If stat is passed the special filehandle consisting of an underline, no
stat is done, but the current contents of the stat structure from the
last stat or filetest are returned.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    if (-x $file && (($d) = stat(_)) && $d < 0) {
        print "$file is executable NFS file\n";

study SCALAR</A>

<A NAME="perlfunc_study_0">
study</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Takes extra time to study SCALAR (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 if unspecified) in anticipation of
doing many pattern matches on the string before it is next modified.
This may or may not save time, depending on the nature and number of
patterns you are searching on, and on the distribution of character
frequencies in the string to be searched--you probably want to compare
runtimes with and without it to see which runs faster.  Those loops
which scan for many short constant strings (including the constant
parts of more complex patterns) will benefit most.  You may have only
one study active at a time--if you study a different scalar the first
is ``unstudied''.  (The way study works is this: a linked list of every
character in the string to be searched is made, so we know, for
example, where all the 'k' characters are.  From each search string,
the rarest character is selected, based on some static frequency tables
constructed from some C programs and English text.  Only those places
that contain this ``rarest'' character are examined.)
<p>For example, here is a loop which inserts index producing entries
before any line containing a certain pattern:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        study;
        print ".IX foo\n" if /\bfoo\b/;
        print ".IX bar\n" if /\bbar\b/;
        print ".IX blurfl\n" if /\bblurfl\b/;
        ...
        print;
    }

</XMP>
<p>In searching for /\bfoo\b/, only those locations in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 that contain ``f''
will be looked at, because ``f'' is rarer than ``o''.  In general, this is
a big win except in pathological cases.  The only question is whether
it saves you more time than it took to build the linked list in the
first place.
<p>Note that if you have to look for strings that you don't know till
runtime, you can build an entire loop as a string and eval that to
avoid recompiling all your patterns all the time.  Together with
undefining $/ to input entire files as one record, this can be very
fast, often faster than specialized programs like fgrep(1).  The following
scans a list of files (<STRONG>@files</STRONG>) for a list of words (<STRONG>@words</STRONG>), and prints
out the names of those files that contain a match:
<p>
<XMP>
    $search = 'while (<>) { study;';
    foreach $word (@words) {
        $search .= "++\$seen{\$ARGV} if /\\b$word\\b/;\n";
    }
    $search .= "}";
    @ARGV = @files;
    undef $/;
    eval $search;               # this screams
    $/ = "\n";          # put back to normal input delim

Extracts a substring out of EXPR and returns it.  First character is at
offset 0, or whatever you've set $[ to.  If OFFSET is negative, starts
that far from the end of the string.  If LEN is omitted, returns
everything to the end of the string.  If LEN is negative, leaves that

<p>You can use the

something shorter than LEN, the string will shrink, and if you assign

as follows: if a given argument is numeric, the argument is passed as
an int.  If not, the pointer to the string value is passed.  You are
responsible to make sure a string is pre-extended long enough to
receive any result that might be written into a string.  If your
integer arguments are not literals and have never been interpreted in a
numeric context, you may need to add 0 to them to force them to look
like numbers.

Opens the file whose filename is given by FILENAME, and associates it

FILENAME, MODE, PERMS.
<p>The possible values and flag bits of the MODE parameter are

However, for historical reasons, some values are universal: zero means
read-only, one means write-only, and two means read/write.
<p>If the file named by FILENAME does not exist and the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open</A>

creates it (typically because MODE includes the O_CREAT flag), then
the value of PERMS specifies the permissions of the newly created

<A NAME="perlfunc_tied_0">
tied VARIABLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a reference to the object underlying VARIABLE (the same value
that was originally returned by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 call which bound the variable
to a package.)  Returns the undefined value if VARIABLE isn't tied to a
package.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_time_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the number of non-leap seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1,
1970.  Suitable for feeding to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_gmtime_0">gmtime()</A>

    ($user,$system,$cuser,$csystem) = times;

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_tr_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
The translation operator.  See 
<A HREF="perlop.html">
the <EM>perlop</EM> manpage</A>

<A NAME="perlfunc_truncate_0">
truncate FILEHANDLE,LENGTH</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_truncate_1">
truncate EXPR,LENGTH</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Truncates the file opened on FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR, to the
specified length.  Produces a fatal error if truncate isn't implemented
on your system.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_uc_0">
uc EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns an uppercased version of EXPR.  This is the internal function
implementing the \U escape in double-quoted strings.
Should respect any POSIX <EM>setlocale()</EM> settings.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_ucfirst_0">
ucfirst EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the value of EXPR with the first character uppercased.  This is
the internal function implementing the \u escape in double-quoted strings.
Should respect any POSIX <EM>setlocale()</EM> settings.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_umask_0">
umask EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_umask_0">
umask</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Sets the umask for the process and returns the old one.  If EXPR is
omitted, merely returns current umask.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_undef_0">
undef EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_undef_0">
undef</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Undefines the value of EXPR, which must be an lvalue.  Use only on a
scalar value, an entire array, or a subroutine name (using ``&amp;'').  (Using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>

will probably not do what you expect on most predefined variables or
DBM list values, so don't do that.)  Always returns the undefined value.  You can omit
the EXPR, in which case nothing is undefined, but you still get an
undefined value that you could, for instance, return from a
subroutine.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    undef $foo;
    undef $bar{'blurfl'};
    undef @ary;
    undef %assoc;
    undef &mysub;
    return (wantarray ? () : undef) if $they_blew_it;

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_unlink_0">
unlink LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Deletes a list of files.  Returns the number of files successfully
deleted.
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt = unlink 'a', 'b', 'c';
    unlink @goners;
    unlink <*.bak>;

</XMP>
<p>Note: unlink will not delete directories unless you are superuser and
the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_u_1">-U</A>
 flag is supplied to Perl.  Even if these conditions are
met, be warned that unlinking a directory can inflict damage on your
filesystem.  Use rmdir instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_unpack_0">
unpack TEMPLATE,EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Unpack does the reverse of pack: it takes a string representing a
structure and expands it out into a list value, returning the array
value.  (In a scalar context, it merely returns the first value
produced.)  The TEMPLATE has the same format as in the pack function.
Here's a subroutine that does substring:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub substr {
        local($what,$where,$howmuch) = @_;
        unpack("x$where a$howmuch", $what);
    }

</XMP>
<p>and then there's
<p>
<XMP>
    sub ordinal { unpack("c",$_[0]); } # same as ord()

</XMP>
<p>In addition, you may prefix a field with a %&lt;number&gt; to indicate that
you want a &lt;number&gt;-bit checksum of the items instead of the items
themselves.  Default is a 16-bit checksum.  For example, the following
computes the same number as the System V sum program:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        $checksum += unpack("%16C*", $_);
    }
    $checksum %= 65536;

</XMP>
<p>The following efficiently counts the number of set bits in a bit vector:
<p>
<XMP>
    $setbits = unpack("%32b*", $selectmask);

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_untie_0">
untie VARIABLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Breaks the binding between a variable and a package.  (See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
.)
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_unshift_0">
unshift ARRAY,LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Does the opposite of a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_shift_0">shift</A>
.  Or the opposite of a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push</A>
,
depending on how you look at it.  Prepends list to the front of the
array, and returns the new number of elements in the array.
<p>
<XMP>
    unshift(ARGV, '-e') unless $ARGV[0] =~ /^-/;

</XMP>
<p>Note the LIST is prepended whole, not one element at a time, so the
prepended elements stay in the same order.  Use reverse to do the
reverse.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_use_0">
use Module LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_use_1">
use Module</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Imports some semantics into the current package from the named module,
generally by aliasing certain subroutine or variable names into your
package.  It is exactly equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require Module; import Module LIST; }

</XMP>
<p>The BEGIN forces the require and import to happen at compile time.  The
require makes sure the module is loaded into memory if it hasn't been
yet.  The import is not a builtin--it's just an ordinary static method
call into the ``Module'' package to tell the module to import the list of
features back into the current package.  The module can implement its
import method any way it likes, though most modules just choose to
derive their import method via inheritance from the Exporter class that
is defined in the Exporter module. See <EM>Exporter</EM>.
<p>If you don't want your namespace altered, explicitly supply an empty list:
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module ();

</XMP>
<p>That is exactly equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require Module; }

</XMP>
<p>Because this is a wide-open interface, pragmas (compiler directives)
are also implemented this way.  Currently implemented pragmas are:
<p>
<XMP>
    use integer;
    use diagnostics;
    use sigtrap qw(SEGV BUS);
    use strict  qw(subs vars refs);
    use subs    qw(afunc blurfl);

</XMP>
<p>These pseudomodules import semantics into the current block scope, unlike
ordinary modules, which import symbols into the current package (which are
effective through the end of the file).
<p>There's a corresponding ``no'' command that unimports meanings imported
by use.
<p>
<XMP>
    no integer;
    no strict 'refs';

</XMP>
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_utime_0">
utime LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Changes the access and modification times on each file of a list of
files.  The first two elements of the list must be the NUMERICAL access
and modification times, in that order.  Returns the number of files
successfully changed.  The inode modification time of each file is set
to the current time.  Example of a ``touch'' command:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    $now = time;
    utime $now, $now, @ARGV;

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_values_0">
values ASSOC_ARRAY</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a normal array consisting of all the values of the named
associative array.  (In a scalar context, returns the number of
values.)  The values are returned in an apparently random order, but it
is the same order as either the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>
 function would produce
on the same array.  See also 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>
, and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sort_2">sort()</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_vec_0">
vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Treats the string in EXPR as a vector of unsigned integers, and
returns the value of the bitfield specified by OFFSET.  BITS specifies
the number of bits that are reserved for each entry in the bit
vector. This must be a power of two from 1 to 32. 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_vec_0">vec()</A>
 may also be
assigned to, in which case parens are needed to give the expression
the correct precedence as in
<p>
<XMP>
    vec($image, $max_x * $x + $y, 8) = 3;

</XMP>
<p>Vectors created with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_vec_0">vec()</A>
 can also be manipulated with the logical
operators |, &amp; and ^, which will assume a bit vector operation is
desired when both operands are strings.
<p>To transform a bit vector into a string or array of 0's and 1's, use these:
<p>
<XMP>
    $bits = unpack("b*", $vector);
    @bits = split(//, unpack("b*", $vector));

</XMP>
<p>If you know the exact length in bits, it can be used in place of the *.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_wait_0">
wait</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Waits for a child process to terminate and returns the pid of the
deceased process, or -1 if there are no child processes.  The status is
returned in $?.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_waitpid_0">
waitpid PID,FLAGS</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Waits for a particular child process to terminate and returns the pid
of the deceased process, or -1 if there is no such child process.  The
status is returned in $?.  If you say
<p>
<XMP>
    use POSIX "wait_h";
    ...
    waitpid(-1,&WNOHANG);

</XMP>
<p>then you can do a non-blocking wait for any process.  Non-blocking wait
is only available on machines supporting either the waitpid(2) or
wait4(2) system calls.  However, waiting for a particular pid with
FLAGS of 0 is implemented everywhere.  (Perl emulates the system call
by remembering the status values of processes that have exited but have
not been harvested by the Perl script yet.)
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_wantarray_0">
wantarray</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns TRUE if the context of the currently executing subroutine is
looking for a list value.  Returns FALSE if the context is looking
for a scalar.
<p>
<XMP>
    return wantarray ? () : undef;

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_warn_0">
warn LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Produces a message on STDERR just like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
, but doesn't exit or

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_write_0">

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_write_1">

<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_write_1">
write</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the specified file,
using the format associated with that file.  By default the format for
a file is the one having the same name is the filehandle, but the
format for the current output channel (see the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 function) may be set
explicitly by assigning the name of the format to the $~ variable.
<p>Top of form processing is handled automatically:  if there is
insufficient room on the current page for the formatted record, the
page is advanced by writing a form feed, a special top-of-page format
is used to format the new page header, and then the record is written.
By default the top-of-page format is the name of the filehandle with
``_TOP'' appended, but it may be dynamically set to the format of your
choice by assigning the name to the $^ variable while the filehandle is
selected.  The number of lines remaining on the current page is in
variable $-, which can be set to 0 to force a new page.
<p>If FILEHANDLE is unspecified, output goes to the current default output
channel, which starts out as STDOUT but may be changed by the

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select</A>
 operator.  If the FILEHANDLE is an EXPR, then the expression
is evaluated and the resulting string is used to look up the name of
the FILEHANDLE at run time.  For more on formats, see 
<A HREF="perlform.html">
the <EM>perlform</EM> manpage</A>

<p>Note that write is <EM>NOT</EM> the opposite of read.  Unfortunately.

perlguts - Perl's Internal Functions
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlguts_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
This document attempts to describe some of the internal functions of the
Perl executable.  It is far from complete and probably contains many errors.
Please refer any questions or comments to the author below.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlguts_datatypes_0">
Datatypes</A>
</H1>
Perl has three typedefs that handle Perl's three main data types:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV  Scalar Value
    AV  Array Value
    HV  Hash Value

</XMP>
<p>Each typedef has specific routines that manipulate the various data types.
<p>
<H2> <EM>What is an ``IV''?</EM></H2>
Perl uses a special typedef IV which is large enough to hold either an
integer or a pointer.
<p>Perl also uses two special typedefs, I32 and I16, which will always be at
least 32-bits and 16-bits long, respectively.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlguts_working_0">
Working with SV's</A>
</H2>
An SV can be created and loaded with one command.  There are four types of
values that can be loaded: an integer value (IV), a double (NV), a string,
(PV), and another scalar (SV).
<p>The four routines are:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV*  newSViv(IV);
    SV*  newSVnv(double);
    SV*  newSVpv(char*, int);
    SV*  newSVsv(SV*);

</XMP>
<p>To change the value of an *already-existing* SV, there are five routines:
<p>
<XMP>
    void  sv_setiv(SV*, IV);
    void  sv_setnv(SV*, double);
    void  sv_setpvn(SV*, char*, int)
    void  sv_setpv(SV*, char*);
    void  sv_setsv(SV*, SV*);

</XMP>
<p>Notice that you can choose to specify the length of the string to be
assigned by using 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_setpvn_0">sv_setpvn</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_newsvpv_0">newSVpv</A>
, or you may allow Perl to
calculate the length by using 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_setpv_0">sv_setpv</A>
 or by specifying 0 as the second
argument to 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_newsvpv_0">newSVpv</A>
.  Be warned, though, that Perl will determine the
string's length by using <CODE>strlen</CODE>, which depends on the string terminating
with a NUL character.
<p>To access the actual value that an SV points to, you can use the macros:
<p>
<XMP>
    SvIV(SV*)
    SvNV(SV*)
    SvPV(SV*, STRLEN len)

</XMP>
<p>which will automatically coerce the actual scalar type into an IV, double,
or string.
<p>In the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svpv_0">SvPV</A>
 macro, the length of the string returned is placed into the
variable <CODE>len</CODE> (this is a macro, so you do <EM>not</EM> use <CODE>&amp;len</CODE>).  If you do not
care what the length of the data is, use the global variable 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_na_0">na</A>
.  Remember,
however, that Perl allows arbitrary strings of data that may both contain
NUL's and not be terminated by a NUL.
<p>If you simply want to know if the scalar value is TRUE, you can use:
<p>
<XMP>
    SvTRUE(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>Although Perl will automatically grow strings for you, if you need to force
Perl to allocate more memory for your SV, you can use the macro
<p>
<XMP>
    SvGROW(SV*, STRLEN newlen)

</XMP>
<p>which will determine if more memory needs to be allocated.  If so, it will
call the function <CODE>sv_grow</CODE>.  Note that 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svgrow_0">SvGROW</A>
 can only increase, not
decrease, the allocated memory of an SV.
<p>If you have an SV and want to know what kind of data Perl thinks is stored
in it, you can use the following macros to check the type of SV you have.
<p>
<XMP>
    SvIOK(SV*)
    SvNOK(SV*)
    SvPOK(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>You can get and set the current length of the string stored in an SV with
the following macros:
<p>
<XMP>
    SvCUR(SV*)
    SvCUR_set(SV*, I32 val)

</XMP>
<p>You can also get a pointer to the end of the string stored in the SV
with the macro:
<p>
<XMP>
    SvEND(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>But note that these last three macros are valid only if 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svpok_0">
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svpok_0">SvPOK()</A>
</A>
 is true.
<p>If you want to append something to the end of string stored in an <CODE>SV*</CODE>,
you can use the following functions:
<p>
<XMP>
    void  sv_catpv(SV*, char*);
    void  sv_catpvn(SV*, char*, int);
    void  sv_catsv(SV*, SV*);

</XMP>
<p>The first function calculates the length of the string to be appended by
using <CODE>strlen</CODE>.  In the second, you specify the length of the string
yourself.  The third function extends the string stored in the first SV
with the string stored in the second SV.  It also forces the second SV to
be interpreted as a string.
<p>If you know the name of a scalar variable, you can get a pointer to its SV
by using the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV*  perl_get_sv("varname", FALSE);

</XMP>
<p>This returns NULL if the variable does not exist.
<p>If you want to know if this variable (or any other SV) is actually 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined</A>
,
you can call:
<p>
<XMP>
    SvOK(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>The scalar 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>
 value is stored in an SV instance called 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_undef_0">sv_undef</A>
.  Its
address can be used whenever an <CODE>SV*</CODE> is needed.
<p>There are also the two values 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_yes_0">sv_yes</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_no_0">sv_no</A>
, which contain Boolean
TRUE and FALSE values, respectively.  Like 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_undef_0">sv_undef</A>
, their addresses can
be used whenever an <CODE>SV*</CODE> is needed.
<p>Do not be fooled into thinking that <CODE>(SV *) 0</CODE> is the same as <CODE>&amp;sv_undef</CODE>.
Take this code:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV* sv = (SV*) 0;
    if (I-am-to-return-a-real-value) {
            sv = sv_2mortal(newSViv(42));
    }
    sv_setsv(ST(0), sv);

</XMP>
<p>This code tries to return a new SV (which contains the value 42) if it should
return a real value, or undef otherwise.  Instead it has returned a null
pointer which, somewhere down the line, will cause a segmentation violation,
or just weird results.  Change the zero to <CODE>&amp;sv_undef</CODE> in the first line and
all will be well.
<p>To free an SV that you've created, call 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svrefcnt_dec_0">SvREFCNT_dec(SV*)</A>
.  Normally this
call is not necessary.  See the section on <STRONG>MORTALITY</STRONG>.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlguts_what_s_0">
What's Really Stored in an SV?</A>
</H2>
Recall that the usual method of determining the type of scalar you have is
to use <CODE>Sv*OK</CODE> macros.  Since a scalar can be both a number and a string,
usually these macros will always return TRUE and calling the <CODE>Sv*V</CODE>
macros will do the appropriate conversion of string to integer/double or
integer/double to string.
<p>If you <EM>really</EM> need to know if you have an integer, double, or string
pointer in an SV, you can use the following three macros instead:
<p>
<XMP>
    SvIOKp(SV*)
    SvNOKp(SV*)
    SvPOKp(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>These will tell you if you truly have an integer, double, or string pointer
stored in your SV.  The ``p'' stands for private.
<p>In general, though, it's best to just use the <CODE>Sv*V</CODE> macros.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlguts_working_1">
Working with AV's</A>
</H2>
There are two ways to create and load an AV.  The first method just creates
an empty AV:
<p>
<XMP>
    AV*  newAV();

</XMP>
<p>The second method both creates the AV and initially populates it with SV's:
<p>
<XMP>
    AV*  av_make(I32 num, SV **ptr);

</XMP>
<p>The second argument points to an array containing <CODE>num</CODE> <CODE>SV*</CODE>'s.  Once the
AV has been created, the SV's can be destroyed, if so desired.
<p>Once the AV has been created, the following operations are possible on AV's:
<p>

<p>These should be familiar operations, with the exception of 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_av_unshift_0">av_unshift</A>
.
This routine adds <CODE>num</CODE> elements at the front of the array with the

value.  You must then use 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_av_store_0">av_store</A>
 (described below) to assign values
to these new elements.
<p>Here are some other functions:
<p>
<XMP>
    I32   av_len(AV*); /* Returns highest index value in array */
    SV**  av_fetch(AV*, I32 key, I32 lval);
            /* Fetches value at key offset, but it stores an undef value
               at the offset if lval is non-zero */
    SV**  av_store(AV*, I32 key, SV* val);
            /* Stores val at offset key */

</XMP>
<p>Take note that 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_av_fetch_0">av_fetch</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_av_store_0">av_store</A>
 return <CODE>SV**</CODE>'s, not <CODE>SV*</CODE>'s.
<p>
<XMP>
    void  av_clear(AV*);
            /* Clear out all elements, but leave the array */
    void  av_undef(AV*);
            /* Undefines the array, removing all elements */
    void  av_extend(AV*, I32 key);
            /* Extend the array to a total of key elements */

</XMP>
<p>If you know the name of an array variable, you can get a pointer to its AV
by using the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    AV*  perl_get_av("varname", FALSE);

</XMP>
<p>This returns NULL if the variable does not exist.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlguts_working_2">
Working with HV's</A>
</H2>
To create an HV, you use the following routine:
<p>
<XMP>
    HV*  newHV();

</XMP>
<p>Once the HV has been created, the following operations are possible on HV's:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV**  hv_store(HV*, char* key, U32 klen, SV* val, U32 hash);
    SV**  hv_fetch(HV*, char* key, U32 klen, I32 lval);

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>klen</CODE> parameter is the length of the key being passed in.  The <CODE>val</CODE>
argument contains the SV pointer to the scalar being stored, and <CODE>hash</CODE> is
the pre-computed hash value (zero if you want 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_hv_store_0">hv_store</A>
 to calculate it
for you).  The <CODE>lval</CODE> parameter indicates whether this fetch is actually a
part of a store operation.
<p>Remember that 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_hv_store_0">hv_store</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_hv_fetch_0">hv_fetch</A>
 return <CODE>SV**</CODE>'s and not just
<CODE>SV*</CODE>.  In order to access the scalar value, you must first dereference
the return value.  However, you should check to make sure that the return
value is not NULL before dereferencing it.
<p>These two functions check if a hash table entry exists, and deletes it.
<p>
<XMP>
    bool  hv_exists(HV*, char* key, U32 klen);
    SV*   hv_delete(HV*, char* key, U32 klen, I32 flags);

</XMP>
<p>And more miscellaneous functions:
<p>
<XMP>
    void   hv_clear(HV*);
            /* Clears all entries in hash table */
    void   hv_undef(HV*);
            /* Undefines the hash table */

</XMP>
<p>Perl keeps the actual data in linked list of structures with a typedef of HE.
These contain the actual key and value pointers (plus extra administrative
overhead).  The key is a string pointer; the value is an <CODE>SV*</CODE>.  However,
once you have an <CODE>HE*</CODE>, to get the actual key and value, use the routines
specified below.
<p>
<XMP>
    I32    hv_iterinit(HV*);
            /* Prepares starting point to traverse hash table */
    HE*    hv_iternext(HV*);
            /* Get the next entry, and return a pointer to a
               structure that has both the key and value */
    char*  hv_iterkey(HE* entry, I32* retlen);
            /* Get the key from an HE structure and also return

               hv_iterkey, and hv_iterval.  The key and retlen
               arguments are return values for the key and its
               length.  The value is returned in the SV* argument */

</XMP>
<p>If you know the name of a hash variable, you can get a pointer to its HV
by using the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    HV*  perl_get_hv("varname", FALSE);

</XMP>
<p>This returns NULL if the variable does not exist.
<p>The hash algorithm, for those who are interested, is:
<p>
<XMP>
    i = klen;
    hash = 0;

<XMP>
    SV* newRV((SV*) thing);

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>thing</CODE> argument can be any of an <CODE>SV*</CODE>, <CODE>AV*</CODE>, or <CODE>HV*</CODE>.  Once
you have a reference, you can use the following macro to dereference the
reference:

    SvRV(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>then call the appropriate routines, casting the returned <CODE>SV*</CODE> to either an
<CODE>AV*</CODE> or <CODE>HV*</CODE>, if required.
<p>To determine if an SV is a reference, you can use the following macro:
<p>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlguts_xsub_s_0">
XSUB's and the Argument Stack</A>
</H1>
The XSUB mechanism is a simple way for Perl programs to access C subroutines.
An XSUB routine will have a stack that contains the arguments from the Perl
program, and a way to map from the Perl data structures to a C equivalent.
<p>The stack arguments are accessible through the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_st_0">ST(n)</A>
 macro, which returns
the <CODE>n</CODE>'th stack argument.  Argument 0 is the first argument passed in the
Perl subroutine call.  These arguments are <CODE>SV*</CODE>, and can be used anywhere
an <CODE>SV*</CODE> is used.
<p>Most of the time, output from the C routine can be handled through use of
the RETVAL and OUTPUT directives.  However, there are some cases where the
argument stack is not already long enough to handle all the return values.
An example is the POSIX <EM>tzname()</EM> call, which takes no arguments, but returns
two, the local timezone's standard and summer time abbreviations.
<p>To handle this situation, the PPCODE directive is used and the stack is
extended using the macro:
<p>
<XMP>
    EXTEND(sp, num);

</XMP>
<p>where <CODE>sp</CODE> is the stack pointer, and <CODE>num</CODE> is the number of elements the
stack should be extended by.
<p>Now that there is room on the stack, values can be pushed on it using the
macros to push IV's, doubles, strings, and SV pointers respectively:
<p>
<XMP>
    PUSHi(IV)
    PUSHn(double)
    PUSHp(char*, I32)
    PUSHs(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>And now the Perl program calling <CODE>tzname</CODE>, the two values will be assigned
as in:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($standard_abbrev, $summer_abbrev) = POSIX::tzname;

</XMP>
<p>An alternate (and possibly simpler) method to pushing values on the stack is
to use the macros:
<p>
<XMP>
    XPUSHi(IV)
    XPUSHn(double)
    XPUSHp(char*, I32)
    XPUSHs(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>These macros automatically adjust the stack for you, if needed.

<A NAME="perlguts_mortality_0">
Mortality</A>
</H1>
In Perl, values are normally ``immortal'' -- that is, they are not freed unless
explicitly done so (via the Perl 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>
 call or other routines in Perl
itself).
<p>Add cruft about reference counts.
	int SvREFCNT(SV* sv);
	void SvREFCNT_inc(SV* sv);
	void SvREFCNT_dec(SV* sv);
<p>In the above example with <CODE>tzname</CODE>, we needed to create two new SV's to push
onto the argument stack, that being the two strings.  However, we don't want
these new SV's to stick around forever because they will eventually be
copied into the SV's that hold the two scalar variables.
<p>An SV (or AV or HV) that is ``mortal'' acts in all ways as a normal ``immortal''
SV, AV, or HV, but is only valid in the ``current context''.  When the Perl
interpreter leaves the current context, the mortal SV, AV, or HV is
automatically freed.  Generally the ``current context'' means a single
Perl statement.
<p>To create a mortal variable, use the functions:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV*  sv_newmortal()
    SV*  sv_2mortal(SV*)
    SV*  sv_mortalcopy(SV*)

</XMP>
<p>The first call creates a mortal SV, the second converts an existing SV to
a mortal SV, the third creates a mortal copy of an existing SV.
<p>The mortal routines are not just for SV's -- AV's and HV's can be made mortal
by passing their address (and casting them to <CODE>SV*</CODE>) to the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_mortal_0">sv_2mortal</A>
 or

<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_mortalcopy_0">sv_mortalcopy</A>
 routines.
<p>>From Ilya:
Beware that the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_mortal_0">sv_2mortal()</A>
 call is eventually equivalent to
<EM>svREFCNT_dec()</EM>. A value can happily be mortal in two different contexts,
and it will be <EM>svREFCNT_dec()</EM>ed twice, once on exit from these
contexts. It can also be mortal twice in the same context. This means
that you should be very careful to make a value mortal exactly as many
times as it is needed. The value that go to the Perl stack <EM>should</EM>
be mortal.
<p>You should be careful about creating mortal variables.  It is possible for
strange things to happen should you make the same value mortal within
multiple contexts.

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlguts_stashes_0">
Stashes</A>
</H1>
A stash is a hash table (associative array) that contains all of the
different objects that are contained within a package.  Each key of the
stash is a symbol name (shared by all the different types of objects
that have the same name), and each value in the hash table is called a
GV (for Glob Value).  This GV in turn contains references to the various
objects of that name, including (but not limited to) the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    Scalar Value
    Array Value
    Hash Value
    File Handle
    Directory Handle
    Format
    Subroutine

</XMP>
<p>Perl stores various stashes in a separate GV structure (for global
variable) but represents them with an HV structure.  The keys in this
larger GV are the various package names; the values are the <CODE>GV*</CODE>'s
which are stashes.  It may help to think of a stash purely as an HV,
and that the term ``GV'' means the global variable hash.
<p>To get the stash pointer for a particular package, use the function:
<p>
<XMP>
    HV*  gv_stashpv(char* name, I32 create)
    HV*  gv_stashsv(SV*, I32 create)

</XMP>
<p>The first function takes a literal string, the second uses the string stored
in the SV.  Remember that a stash is just a hash table, so you get back an
<CODE>HV*</CODE>.  The <CODE>create</CODE> flag will create a new package if it is set.
<p>The name that <CODE>gv_stash*v</CODE> wants is the name of the package whose symbol table
you want.  The default package is called <CODE>main</CODE>.  If you have multiply nested
packages, pass their names to <CODE>gv_stash*v</CODE>, separated by <CODE>::</CODE> as in the Perl
language itself.
<p>Alternately, if you have an SV that is a blessed reference, you can find
out the stash pointer by using:
<p>
<XMP>
    HV*  SvSTASH(SvRV(SV*));

</XMP>
<p>then use the following to get the package name itself:
<p>
<XMP>
    char*  HvNAME(HV* stash);

</XMP>
<p>If you need to return a blessed value to your Perl script, you can use the
following function:
<p>
<XMP>
    SV*  sv_bless(SV*, HV* stash)

</XMP>
<p>where the first argument, an <CODE>SV*</CODE>, must be a reference, and the second
argument is a stash.  The returned <CODE>SV*</CODE> can now be used in the same way
as any other SV.

<A NAME="perlguts_assigning_0">
Assigning Magic</A>
</H2>
Perl adds magic to an SV using the sv_magic function:
<p>
<XMP>
    void sv_magic(SV* sv, SV* obj, int how, char* name, I32 namlen);

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>sv</CODE> argument is a pointer to the SV that is to acquire a new magical
feature.
<p>If <CODE>sv</CODE> is not already magical, Perl uses the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svupgrade_0">SvUPGRADE</A>
 macro to
set the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svt_pvmg_0">SVt_PVMG</A>
 flag for the <CODE>sv</CODE>.  Perl then continues by adding
it to the beginning of the linked list of magical features.  Any prior
entry of the same type of magic is deleted.  Note that this can be
overriden, and multiple instances of the same type of magic can be
associated with an SV.
<p>The <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>namlem</CODE> arguments are used to associate a string with
the magic, typically the name of a variable. <CODE>namlem</CODE> is stored in the

<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_mg_len_0">mg_len</A>
 field and if <CODE>name</CODE> is non-null and <CODE>namlem</CODE> &gt;= 0 a malloc'd
copy of the name is stored in <CODE>mg_ptr</CODE> field.
<p>The sv_magic function uses <CODE>how</CODE> to determine which, if any, predefined
``Magic Virtual Table'' should be assigned to the <CODE>mg_virtual</CODE> field.
See the ``Magic Virtual Table'' section below.  The <CODE>how</CODE> argument is also
stored in the <CODE>mg_type</CODE> field.
<p>The <CODE>obj</CODE> argument is stored in the <CODE>mg_obj</CODE> field of the <CODE>MAGIC</CODE>
structure.  If it is not the same as the <CODE>sv</CODE> argument, the reference
count of the <CODE>obj</CODE> object is incremented.  If it is the same, or if
the <CODE>how</CODE> argument is ``#'', or if it is a null pointer, then <CODE>obj</CODE> is
merely stored, without the reference count being incremented.
<p>There is also a function to add magic to an <CODE>HV</CODE>:
<p>
<XMP>
    void hv_magic(HV *hv, GV *gv, int how);

</XMP>
<p>This simply calls 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_magic_0">sv_magic</A>
 and coerces the <CODE>gv</CODE> argument into an <CODE>SV</CODE>.
<p>To remove the magic from an SV, call the function sv_unmagic:
<p>
<XMP>
    void sv_unmagic(SV *sv, int type);

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>type</CODE> argument should be equal to the <CODE>how</CODE> value when the <CODE>SV</CODE>
was initially made magical.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlguts_magic_1">
Magic Virtual Tables</A>
</H2>
The <CODE>mg_virtual</CODE> field in the <CODE>MAGIC</CODE> structure is a pointer to a
<CODE>MGVTBL</CODE>, which is a structure of function pointers and stands for
``Magic Virtual Table'' to handle the various operations that might be
applied to that variable.
<p>The <CODE>MGVTBL</CODE> has five pointers to the following routine types:
<p>
<XMP>
    int  (*svt_get)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_set)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    U32  (*svt_len)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_clear)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_free)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);

</XMP>
<p>This MGVTBL structure is set at compile-time in <CODE>perl.h</CODE> and there are
currently 19 types (or 21 with overloading turned on).  These different
structures contain pointers to various routines that perform additional
actions depending on which function is being called.
<p>
<XMP>
    Function pointer    Action taken
    ----------------    ------------
    svt_get             Do something after the value of the SV is retrieved.
    svt_set             Do something after the SV is assigned a value.
    svt_len             Report on the SV's length.
    svt_clear           Clear something the SV represents.
    svt_free            Free any extra storage associated with the SV.

</XMP>
<p>For instance, the MGVTBL structure called <CODE>vtbl_sv</CODE> (which corresponds
to an <CODE>mg_type</CODE> of '\0') contains:
<p>
<XMP>
    { magic_get, magic_set, magic_len, 0, 0 }

</XMP>
<p>Thus, when an SV is determined to be magical and of type '\0', if a get
operation is being performed, the routine <CODE>magic_get</CODE> is called.  All
the various routines for the various magical types begin with <CODE>magic_</CODE>.
<p>The current kinds of Magic Virtual Tables are:

<XMP>
    MAGIC* mg_find(SV*, int type); /* Finds the magic pointer of that type */

</XMP>
<p>This routine returns a pointer to the <CODE>MAGIC</CODE> structure stored in the SV.
If the SV does not have that magical feature, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is returned.  Also,
if the SV is not of type SVt_PVMG, Perl may core-dump.
<p>
<XMP>
    int mg_copy(SV* sv, SV* nsv, char* key, STRLEN klen);

</XMP>
<p>This routine checks to see what types of magic <CODE>sv</CODE> has.  If the mg_type
field is an upper-case letter, then the mg_obj is copied to <CODE>nsv</CODE>, but
the mg_type field is changed to be the lower-case letter.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlguts_double_typed_0">
Double-Typed SV's</A>
</H1>
Scalar variables normally contain only one type of value, an integer,
double, pointer, or reference.  Perl will automatically convert the
actual scalar data from the stored type into the requested type.
<p>Some scalar variables contain more than one type of scalar data.  For
example, the variable 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__21">$!</A>
 contains either the numeric value of <CODE>errno</CODE>
or its string equivalent from either <CODE>strerror</CODE> or <CODE>sys_errlist[]</CODE>.
<p>To force multiple data values into an SV, you must do two things: use the
<CODE>sv_set*v</CODE> routines to add the additional scalar type, then set a flag
so that Perl will believe it contains more than one type of data.  The
four macros to set the flags are:
<p>
<XMP>
        SvIOK_on
        SvNOK_on
        SvPOK_on
        SvROK_on

</XMP>
<p>The particular macro you must use depends on which <CODE>sv_set*v</CODE> routine
you called first.  This is because every <CODE>sv_set*v</CODE> routine turns on
only the bit for the particular type of data being set, and turns off
all the rest.
<p>For example, to create a new Perl variable called ``dberror'' that contains
both the numeric and descriptive string error values, you could use the
following code:
<p>
<XMP>
    extern int  dberror;
    extern char *dberror_list;
    SV* sv = perl_get_sv("dberror", TRUE);
    sv_setiv(sv, (IV) dberror);
    sv_setpv(sv, dberror_list[dberror]);
    SvIOK_on(sv);

</XMP>
<p>If the order of 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_setiv_0">sv_setiv</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sv_setpv_0">sv_setpv</A>
 had been reversed, then the
macro 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_svpok_on_0">SvPOK_on</A>
 would need to be called instead of 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_sviok_on_0">SvIOK_on</A>

<A NAME="perlguts_calling_0">
Calling Perl Routines from within C Programs</A>
</H1>
There are four routines that can be used to call a Perl subroutine from
within a C program.  These four are:
<p>
<XMP>
    I32  perl_call_sv(SV*, I32);
    I32  perl_call_pv(char*, I32);
    I32  perl_call_method(char*, I32);
    I32  perl_call_argv(char*, I32, register char**);

</XMP>
<p>The routine most often used is 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
.  The <CODE>SV*</CODE> argument
contains either the name of the Perl subroutine to be called, or a
reference to the subroutine.  The second argument consists of flags
that control the context in which the subroutine is called, whether
or not the subroutine is being passed arguments, how errors should be
trapped, and how to treat return values.
<p>All four routines return the number of arguments that the subroutine returned
on the Perl stack.
<p>When using any of these routines (except 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_perl_call_argv_0">perl_call_argv</A>
), the programmer
must manipulate the Perl stack.  These include the following macros and
functions:
<p>
<XMP>
    dSP
    PUSHMARK()
    PUTBACK
    SPAGAIN
    ENTER
    SAVETMPS
    FREETMPS
    LEAVE

<A NAME="perlguts_memory_0">
Memory Allocation</A>
</H1>
It is strongly suggested that you use the version of malloc that is distributed
with Perl.  It keeps pools of various sizes of unallocated memory in order to
more quickly satisfy allocation requests.
However, on some platforms, it may cause spurious malloc or free errors.
<p>
<XMP>
    New(x, pointer, number, type);
    Newc(x, pointer, number, type, cast);
    Newz(x, pointer, number, type);

</XMP>
<p>These three macros are used to initially allocate memory.  The first argument
<CODE>x</CODE> was a ``magic cookie'' that was used to keep track of who called the macro,
to help when debugging memory problems.  However, the current code makes no
use of this feature (Larry has switched to using a run-time memory checker),
so this argument can be any number.
<p>The second argument <CODE>pointer</CODE> will point to the newly allocated memory.
The third and fourth arguments <CODE>number</CODE> and <CODE>type</CODE> specify how many of
the specified type of data structure should be allocated.  The argument
<CODE>type</CODE> is passed to <CODE>sizeof</CODE>.  The final argument to 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_newc_0">Newc</A>
, <CODE>cast</CODE>,
should be used if the <CODE>pointer</CODE> argument is different from the <CODE>type</CODE>
argument.
<p>Unlike the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_new_0">New</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_newc_0">Newc</A>
 macros, the 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_newz_0">Newz</A>
 macro calls <CODE>memzero</CODE>
to zero out all the newly allocated memory.
<p>
<XMP>
    Renew(pointer, number, type);
    Renewc(pointer, number, type, cast);
    Safefree(pointer)

</XMP>
<p>These three macros are used to change a memory buffer size or to free a
piece of memory no longer needed.  The arguments to 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_renew_0">Renew</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_renewc_0">Renewc</A>

match those of 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_new_0">New</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html#perlguts_newc_0">Newc</A>
 with the exception of not needing the
``magic cookie'' argument.
<p>
<XMP>
    Move(source, dest, number, type);
    Copy(source, dest, number, type);
    Zero(dest, number, type);

</XMP>
<p>These three macros are used to move, copy, or zero out previously allocated
memory.  The <CODE>source</CODE> and <CODE>dest</CODE> arguments point to the source and
destination starting points.  Perl will move, copy, or zero out <CODE>number</CODE>
instances of the size of the <CODE>type</CODE> data structure (using the <CODE>sizeof</CODE>
function).

DESCRIPTION</A>

<A NAME="perlvar_predefined_0">
Predefined Names</A>
</H2>
The following names have special meaning to Perl.  Most of the
punctuational names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogues in one of
the shells.  Nevertheless, if you wish to use the long variable names,
you just need to say
<p>
<XMP>
    use English;

</XMP>
<p>at the top of your program.  This will alias all the short names to the
long names in the current package.  Some of them even have medium names,
generally borrowed from <STRONG>awk</STRONG>.
<p>To go a step further, those variables that depend on the currently
selected filehandle may instead be set by calling an object method on
the FileHandle object.  (Summary lines below for this contain the word
HANDLE.)  First you must say
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;

</XMP>
<p>after which you may use either
<p>
<XMP>
    method HANDLE EXPR

</XMP>
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    HANDLE->method(EXPR)

</XMP>
<p>Each of the methods returns the old value of the FileHandle attribute.
The methods each take an optional EXPR, which if supplied specifies the
new value for the FileHandle attribute in question.  If not supplied,
most of the methods do nothing to the current value, except for

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_autoflush_0">autoflush()</A>
, which will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.
<p>A few of these variables are considered ``read-only''.  This means that if
you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly through
a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.

<A NAME="perlvar__5">
$*</A>

Set to 1 to do multiline matching within a string, 0 to tell Perl
that it can assume that strings contain a single line, for the purpose
of optimizing pattern matches.  Pattern matches on strings containing
multiple newlines can produce confusing results when ``
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__5">$*</A>
'' is 0.  Default
is 0.  (Mnemonic: * matches multiple things.)  Note that this variable
only influences the interpretation of ``<CODE>^</CODE>'' and ``<CODE>$</CODE>''.  A literal newline can
be searched for even when <CODE>$* == 0</CODE>.
<p>Use of ``

<p>
<LI>
<A NAME="perlvar__6">
$.</A>

The current input line number of the last filehandle that was read.  An
explicit close on the filehandle resets the line number.  Since
``<CODE>&lt;&gt;</CODE>'' never does an explicit close, line numbers increase
across ARGV files (but see examples under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof()</A>
).  Localizing 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__6">$.</A>
 has
the effect of also localizing Perl's notion of "the last read
filehandle``.  (Mnemonic: many programs use ''." to mean the current line
number.)

<LI>
<A NAME="perlvar_rs_0">
$RS</A>

<p>
<LI>
<A NAME="perlvar__7">
$/</A>

The input record separator, newline by default.  Works like <STRONG>awk</STRONG>'s RS
variable, including treating blank lines as delimiters if set to the
null string.  You may set it to a multicharacter string to match a
multi-character delimiter.  Note that setting it to <CODE>``\n\n''</CODE> means
something slightly different than setting it to <CODE>``''</CODE>, if the file
contains consecutive blank lines.  Setting it to <CODE>``''</CODE> will treat two or
more consecutive blank lines as a single blank line.  Setting it to
<CODE>``\n\n''</CODE> will blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the
next paragraph, even if it's a newline.  (Mnemonic: / is used to
delimit line boundaries when quoting poetry.)
<p>
<XMP>
    undef $/;
    $_ = <FH>;          # whole file now here

$OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH</A>

<p>
<LI>
<A NAME="perlvar__8">
$|</A>

If set to nonzero, forces a flush after every write or print on the
currently selected output channel.  Default is 0.  Note that STDOUT
will typically be line buffered if output is to the terminal and block
buffered otherwise.  Setting this variable is useful primarily when you
are outputting to a pipe, such as when you are running a Perl script
under rsh and want to see the output as it's happening.  This has no
effect on input buffering.  
(Mnemonic: when you want your pipes to be piping hot.)

<A NAME="perlvar_ofs_0">
$OFS</A>

<p>
<LI>
<A NAME="perlvar__9">
$,</A>

The output field separator for the print operator.  Ordinarily the
print operator simply prints out the comma separated fields you
specify.  In order to get behavior more like <STRONG>awk</STRONG>, set this variable
as you would set <STRONG>awk</STRONG>'s OFS variable to specify what is printed
between fields.  (Mnemonic: what is printed when there is a , in your
print statement.)

<A NAME="perlvar__10">
$\</A>

The output record separator for the print operator.  Ordinarily the
print operator simply prints out the comma separated fields you
specify, with no trailing newline or record separator assumed.  In
order to get behavior more like <STRONG>awk</STRONG>, set this variable as you would
set <STRONG>awk</STRONG>'s ORS variable to specify what is printed at the end of the
print.  (Mnemonic: you set ``
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__10">$\</A>
'' instead of adding \n at the end of the
print.  Also, it's just like /, but it's what you get ``back'' from
Perl.)

This is like ``

is a space.  (Mnemonic: obvious, I think.)

The subscript separator for multi-dimensional array emulation.  If you
refer to a hash element as
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo{$a,$b,$c}

</XMP>
<p>it really means
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo{join($;, $a, $b, $c)}

</XMP>
<p>But don't put
<p>
<XMP>
    @foo{$a,$b,$c}      # a slice--note the @

<p>which means
<p>
<XMP>
    ($foo{$a},$foo{$b},$foo{$c})

</XMP>
<p>Default is ``\034'', the same as SUBSEP in <STRONG>awk</STRONG>.  Note that if your
keys contain binary data there might not be any safe value for ``
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__12">$;</A>
''.
(Mnemonic: comma (the syntactic subscript separator) is a
semi-semicolon.  Yeah, I know, it's pretty lame, but ``
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__9">$,</A>

taken for something more important.)

The output format for printed numbers.  This variable is a half-hearted
attempt to emulate <STRONG>awk</STRONG>'s OFMT variable.  There are times, however,
when <STRONG>awk</STRONG> and Perl have differing notions of what is in fact
numeric.  Also, the initial value is <STRONG>%.</STRONG>20g rather than <STRONG>%.</STRONG>6g, so you
need to set ``

The hash <STRONG>%ENV</STRONG> contains your current environment.  Setting a

The hash <STRONG>%SIG</STRONG> is used to set signal handlers for various

    sub handler {       # 1st argument is signal name
        local($sig) = @_;

    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT

</XMP>
<p>The <STRONG>%SIG</STRONG> array only contains values for the signals actually set within

<XMP>
    $SIG{PIPE} = Plumber;       # SCARY!!
    $SIG{"PIPE"} = "Plumber";   # just fine, assumes main::Plumber

    $SIG{"PIPE"} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber() return??

</XMP>
<p>The one marked scary is problematic because it's a bareword, which means
sometimes it's a string representing the function, and sometimes it's 
going to call the subroutine call right then and there!  Best to be sure
and quote it or take a reference to it.  *Plumber works too.  See the <EM>perlsubs</EM>  manpage
.
<p>Certain internal hooks can be also set using the <STRONG>%SIG</STRONG> hash.  The
routine indicated by <STRONG>$SIG</STRONG>{__WARN__} is called when a warning message is
about to be printed.  The warning message is passed as the first
argument.  The presence of a __WARN__ hook causes the ordinary printing
of warnings to STDERR to be suppressed.  You can use this to save warnings
in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
    eval $proggie;

</XMP>
<p>The routine indicated by <STRONG>$SIG</STRONG>{__DIE__} is called when a fatal exception
is about to be thrown.  The error message is passed as the first
argument.  When a __DIE__ hook routine returns, the exception
processing continues as it would have in the absence of the hook,
unless the hook routine itself exits via a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_goto_2">goto</A>
, a loop exit, or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
.
The __DIE__ handler is explicitly disabled during the call, so that you
can die from a __DIE__ handler.  Similarly for __WARN__.

<A NAME="perlmod_packages_0">
Packages</A>
</H2>
Perl provides a mechanism for alternative namespaces to protect packages
from stomping on each others variables.  In fact, apart from certain
magical variables, there's really no such thing as a global variable in
Perl.  The package statement declares the compilation unit as being in the
given namespace.  The scope of the package declaration is from the
declaration itself through the end of the enclosing block (the same scope
as the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 operator).  All further unqualified dynamic identifiers
will be in this namespace.  A package statement only affects dynamic
variables--including those you've used 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 on--but <EM>not</EM> lexical
variables created with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
.  Typically it would be the first declaration
in a file to be included by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 operator.  You can
switch into a package in more than one place; it merely influences which
symbol table is used by the compiler for the rest of that block.  You can
refer to variables and filehandles in other packages by prefixing the
identifier with the package name and a double colon:
<CODE><STRONG>$Package::Variable</STRONG></CODE>.  If the package name is null, the <CODE>main</CODE> package
as assumed.  That is, <CODE><STRONG>$::sail</STRONG></CODE> is equivalent to <CODE><STRONG>$main::sail</STRONG></CODE>.
<p>(The old package delimiter was a single quote, but double colon
is now the preferred delimiter, in part because it's more readable
to humans, and in part because it's more readable to <STRONG>emacs</STRONG> macros.
It also makes C++ programmers feel like they know what's going on.)
<p>Packages may be nested inside other packages: <CODE><STRONG>$OUTER::INNER::var</STRONG></CODE>.  This
implies nothing about the order of name lookups, however.  All symbols
are either local to the current package, or must be fully qualified
from the outer package name down.  For instance, there is nowhere
within package <CODE>OUTER</CODE> that <CODE><STRONG>$INNER::var</STRONG></CODE> refers to <CODE><STRONG>$OUTER::INNER::var</STRONG></CODE>.
It would treat package <CODE>INNER</CODE> as a totally separate global package.
<p>Only identifiers starting with letters (or underscore) are stored in a
package's symbol table.  All other symbols are kept in package <CODE>main</CODE>,
including all of the punctuation variables like 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
.  In addition, the
identifiers STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT, ENV, INC and SIG are
forced to be in package <CODE>main</CODE>, even when used for other purposes than
their built-in one.  Note also that, if you have a package called <CODE>m</CODE>,
<CODE>s</CODE> or <CODE>y</CODE>, then you can't use the qualified form of an identifier
because it will be interpreted instead as a pattern match, a substitution,
or a translation.
<p>(Variables beginning with underscore used to be forced into package
main, but we decided it was more useful for package writers to be able
to use leading underscore to indicate private variables and method names.

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 is still global though.)
<p><EM>Eval()</EM>ed strings are compiled in the package in which the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
 was
compiled.  (Assignments to <CODE><STRONG>$SIG</STRONG>{}</CODE>, however, assume the signal
handler specified is in the <CODE>main</CODE> package.  Qualify the signal handler
name if you wish to have a signal handler in a package.)  For an
example, examine <EM>perldb.pl</EM> in the Perl library.  It initially switches
to the <CODE>DB</CODE> package so that the debugger doesn't interfere with variables
in the script you are trying to debug.  At various points, however, it
temporarily switches back to the <CODE>main</CODE> package to evaluate various
expressions in the context of the <CODE>main</CODE> package (or wherever you came
from).  See 
<A HREF="perldebug.html">
the <EM>perldebug</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlsub.html">
the <EM>perlsub</EM> manpage</A>
 for other scoping issues related to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
, 
or 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
 regarding closures.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlmod_symbol_0">
Symbol Tables</A>
</H2>
The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the associative
array of that name appended with two colons.  The main symbol table's
name is thus <CODE><STRONG>%main::</STRONG></CODE>, or <CODE><STRONG>%::</STRONG></CODE> for short.  Likewise the nested package
mentioned earlier is named <CODE><STRONG>%OUTER::INNER::</STRONG></CODE>.
<p>The value in each entry of the associative array is what you are referring
to when you use the <CODE>*name</CODE> typeglob notation.  In fact, the following
have the same effect, though the first is more efficient because it does
the symbol table lookups at compile time:
<p>
<XMP>
    local(*main::foo) = *main::bar; local($main::{'foo'}) =
    $main::{'bar'};

</XMP>
<p>You can use this to print out all the variables in a package, for
instance.  Here is <EM>dumpvar.pl</EM> from the Perl library:
<p>
<XMP>
   package dumpvar;
   sub main::dumpvar {
       ($package) = @_;
       local(*stab) = eval("*${package}::");
       while (($key,$val) = each(%stab)) {
           local(*entry) = $val;
           if (defined $entry) {
               print "\$$key = '$entry'\n";
           }
           if (defined @entry) {
               print "\@$key = (\n";
               foreach $num ($[ .. $#entry) {
                   print "  $num\t'",$entry[$num],"'\n";
               }
               print ")\n";
           }
           if ($key ne "${package}::" && defined %entry) {
               print "\%$key = (\n";
               foreach $key (sort keys(%entry)) {
                   print "  $key\t'",$entry{$key},"'\n";
               }
               print ")\n";
           }
       }
   }

</XMP>
<p>Note that even though the subroutine is compiled in package <CODE>dumpvar</CODE>,
the name of the subroutine is qualified so that its name is inserted
into package <CODE>main</CODE>.
<p>Assignment to a typeglob performs an aliasing operation, i.e.,
<p>
<XMP>
    *dick = *richard;

</XMP>
<p>causes variables, subroutines and file handles accessible via the
identifier <CODE>richard</CODE> to also be accessible via the symbol <CODE>dick</CODE>.  If
you only want to alias a particular variable or subroutine, you can
assign a reference instead:
<p>
<XMP>
    *dick = \$richard;

</XMP>
<p>makes <STRONG>$richard</STRONG> and <STRONG>$dick</STRONG> the same variable, but leaves
<STRONG>@richard</STRONG> and <STRONG>@dick</STRONG> as separate arrays.  Tricky, eh?
<p>This mechanism may be used to pass and return cheap references
into or from subroutines if you won't want to copy the whole
thing.
<p>
<XMP>
    %some_hash = ();
    *some_hash = fn( \%another_hash );
    sub fn {
        local *hashsym = shift;
        # now use %hashsym normally, and you
        # will affect the caller's %another_hash
        my %nhash = (); # do what you want
        return \%nhash; 
    }

</XMP>
<p>On return, the reference wil overwrite the hash slot in the
symbol table specified by the *some_hash typeglob.  This
is a somewhat tricky way of passing around refernces cheaply
when you won't want to have to remember to dereference variables
explicitly.
<p>Another use of symbol tables is for making ``constant''  scalars.
<p>
<XMP>
    *PI = \3.14159265358979;

</XMP>
<p>Now you cannot alter <STRONG>$PI</STRONG>, which is probably a good thing all in all.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlmod_package_0">
Package Constructors and Destructors</A>
</H2>
There are two special subroutine definitions that function as package
constructors and destructors.  These are the <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> and <CODE>END</CODE>
routines.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sub_2">sub</A>
 is optional for these routines.
<p>A <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> subroutine is executed as soon as possible, that is, the
moment it is completely defined, even before the rest of the containing
file is parsed.  You may have multiple <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> blocks within a
file--they will execute in order of definition.  Because a <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>
block executes immediately, it can pull in definitions of subroutines
and such from other files in time to be visible to the rest of the
file.
<p>An <CODE>END</CODE> subroutine is executed as late as possible, that is, when the
interpreter is being exited, even if it is exiting as a result of a

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 function.  (But not if it's is being blown out of the water by a
signal--you have to trap that yourself (if you can).)  You may have
multiple <CODE>END</CODE> blocks within a file--they will execute in reverse
order of definition; that is: last in, first out (LIFO).
<p>Note that when you use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_n_0">-n</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_p_0">-p</A>
 switches to Perl, <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>
and <CODE>END</CODE> work just as they do in <STRONG>awk</STRONG>, as a degenerate case.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlmod_perl_0">
Perl Classes</A>
</H2>
There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package may function
as a class if it provides subroutines that function as methods.  Such a
package may also derive some of its methods from another class package
by listing the other package name in its <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> array.  
<p>For more on this, see 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlmod_perl_1">
Perl Modules</A>
</H2>
A module is just a package that is defined in a library file of
the same name, and is designed to be reusable.  It may do this by
providing a mechanism for exporting some of its symbols into the symbol
table of any package using it.  Or it may function as a class
definition and make its semantics available implicitly through method
calls on the class and its objects, without explicit exportation of any
symbols.  Or it can do a little of both.
<p>For example, to start a normal module called Fred, create
a file called Fred.pm and put this at the start of it:
<p>
<XMP>
    package      Fred;
    require      Exporter;
    @ISA       = qw(Exporter);
    @EXPORT    = qw(func1 func2);
    @EXPORT_OK = qw($sally @listabob %harry func3);

</XMP>
<p>Then go on to declare and use your variables in functions
without any qualifications.
See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html#perlmod_exporter_0"><EM>Exporter</EM></A>
 and the <EM>Perl Modules File</EM> for details on 
mechanics and style issues in module creation.
<p>Perl modules are included into your program by saying
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module;

</XMP>
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module LIST;

</XMP>
<p>This is exactly equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require "Module.pm"; import Module; }

</XMP>
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require "Module.pm"; import Module LIST; }

</XMP>
<p>As a special case
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module ();

</XMP>
<p>is exactly equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require "Module.pm"; }

</XMP>
<p>All Perl module files have the extension <EM>.pm</EM>.  
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 assumes this so
that you don't have to spell out ``<EM>Module.pm</EM>'' in quotes.  This also
helps to differentiate new modules from old <EM>.pl</EM> and <EM>.ph</EM> files.
Module names are also capitalized unless they're functioning as pragmas,
``Pragmas'' are in effect compiler directives, and are sometimes called
``pragmatic modules'' (or even ``pragmata'' if you're a classicist).
<p>Because the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 statement implies a <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> block, the importation
of semantics happens at the moment the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 statement is compiled,
before the rest of the file is compiled.  This is how it is able
to function as a pragma mechanism, and also how modules are able to
declare subroutines that are then visible as list operators for
the rest of the current file.  This will not work if you use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>

instead of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
.  With require you can get into this problem:
<p>
<XMP>
    require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible
    $here = Cwd::getcwd();      
    use Cwd;                    # import names from Cwd:: 
    $here = getcwd();
    require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible
    $here = getcwd();           # oops! no main::getcwd()

</XMP>
<p>In general 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use Module ();</A>
 is recommended over 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require Module;</A>
.
<p>Perl packages may be nested inside other package names, so we can have
package names containing <CODE>::</CODE>.  But if we used that package name
directly as a filename it would makes for unwieldy or impossible
filenames on some systems.  Therefore, if a module's name is, say,
<CODE>Text::Soundex</CODE>, then its definition is actually found in the library
file <EM>Text/Soundex.pm</EM>.
<p>Perl modules always have a <EM>.pm</EM> file, but there may also be dynamically
linked executables or autoloaded subroutine definitions associated with
the module.  If so, these will be entirely transparent to the user of
the module.  It is the responsibility of the <EM>.pm</EM> file to load (or
arrange to autoload) any additional functionality.  The POSIX module
happens to do both dynamic loading and autoloading, but the user can
just say 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use POSIX</A>
 to get it all.

<A HREF="perlxs.html">

<A NAME="perlmod_note_0">
NOTE</A>
</H1>
Perl does not enforce private and public parts of its modules as you may
have been used to in other languages like C++, Ada, or Modula-17.  Perl
doesn't have an infatuation with enforced privacy.  It would prefer
that you stayed out of its living room because you weren't invited, not
because it has a shotgun.
<p>The module and its user have a contract, part of which is common law,
and part of which is ``written''.  Part of the common law contract is
that a module doesn't pollute any namespace it wasn't asked to.  The
written contract for the module (AKA documentation) may make other
provisions.  But then you know when you 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use RedefineTheWorld</A>
 that
you're redefining the world and willing to take the consequences.

<A NAME="perlmod_the_0">
THE PERL MODULE LIBRARY</A>
</H1>
A number of modules are included the the Perl distribution.  These are
described below, and all end in <EM>.pm</EM>.  You may also discover files in 
the library directory that end in either <EM>.pl</EM> or <EM>.ph</EM>.  These are old
libraries supplied so that old programs that use them still run.  The
<EM>.pl</EM> files will all eventually be converted into standard modules, and
the <EM>.ph</EM> files made by <STRONG>h2ph</STRONG> will probably end up as extension modules
made by <STRONG>h2xs</STRONG>.  (Some <EM>.ph</EM> values may already be available through the
POSIX module.)  The <STRONG>pl2pm</STRONG> file in the distribution may help in your
conversion, but it's just a mechanical process, so is far from bullet proof.

Modules: Creation, Use and Abuse</A>
</H1>
(The following section is borrowed directly from Tim Bunce's modules
file, available at your nearest CPAN site.)
<p>Perl 5 implements a class using a package, but the presence of a
package doesn't imply the presence of a class.  A package is just a
namespace.  A class is a package that provides subroutines that can be
used as methods.  A method is just a subroutine that expects, as its
first argument, either the name of a package (for ``static'' methods),
or a reference to something (for ``virtual'' methods).
<p>A module is a file that (by convention) provides a class of the same
name (sans the .pm), plus an import method in that class that can be
called to fetch exported symbols.  This module may implement some of
its methods by loading dynamic C or C++ objects, but that should be
totally transparent to the user of the module.  Likewise, the module
might set up an AUTOLOAD function to slurp in subroutine definitions on
demand, but this is also transparent.  Only the .pm file is required to
exist.

<A NAME="perlmod_do_0">
Do similar modules already exist in some form?</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
If so, please try to reuse the existing modules either in whole or
by inheriting useful features into a new class.  If this is not
practical try to get together with the module authors to work on
extending or enhancing the functionality of the existing modules.
A perfect example is the plethora of packages in perl4 for dealing
with command line options.
<p>If you are writing a module to expand an already existing set of
modules, please coordinate with the author of the package.  It
helps if you follow the same naming scheme and module interaction
scheme as the original author.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlmod_try_0">
Try to design the new module to be easy to extend and reuse.</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Use blessed references.  Use the two argument form of bless to bless
into the class name given as the first parameter of the constructor,
e.g.:
<p>
<XMP>
 sub new { 
        my $class = shift;
        return bless {}, $class;
 }

</XMP>
<p>or even this if you'd like it to be used as either a static
or a virtual method.
<p>
<XMP>
 sub new { 
        my $self  = shift;
        my $class = ref($self) || $self;
        return bless {}, $class;
 }

</XMP>
<p>Pass arrays as references so more parameters can be added later
(it's also faster).  Convert functions into methods where
appropriate.  Split large methods into smaller more flexible ones.
Inherit methods from other modules if appropriate.
<p>Avoid class name tests like: die ``Invalid'' unless ref <STRONG>$ref</STRONG> eq 'FOO'.
Generally you can delete the ``eq 'FOO''' part with no harm at all.
Let the objects look after themselves! Generally, avoid hardwired
class names as far as possible.
<p>Avoid <STRONG>$r</STRONG>-&gt;Class::<EM>func()</EM> where using <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG>=qw(... Class ...) and
<STRONG>$r</STRONG>-&gt;<EM>func()</EM> would work (see perlbot man page for more details).
<p>Use autosplit so little used or newly added functions won't be a
burden to programs which don't use them. Add test functions to
the module after __END__ either using AutoSplit or by saying:
<p>
<XMP>
 eval join('',<main::DATA>) || die $@ unless caller();

</XMP>
<p>Does your module pass the 'empty sub-class' test? If you say
``<STRONG>@SUBCLASS::ISA</STRONG> = qw(YOURCLASS);'' your applications should be able
to use SUBCLASS in exactly the same way as YOURCLASS.  For example,
does your application still work if you change:  <STRONG>$obj</STRONG> = new YOURCLASS;
into: <STRONG>$obj</STRONG> = new SUBCLASS; ?
<p>Avoid keeping any state information in your packages. It makes it
difficult for multiple other packages to use yours. Keep state
information in objects.
<p>Always use 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
. Try to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict;</A>
 (or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict qw(...);</A>
).
Remember that you can add 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_no_0">no strict qw(...);</A>
 to individual blocks
of code which need less strictness. Always use 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>

Follow the guidelines in the perlstyle(1) manual.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlmod_some_0">
Some simple style guidelines</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The perlstyle manual supplied with perl has many helpful points.
<p>Coding style is a matter of personal taste. Many people evolve their
style over several years as they learn what helps them write and
maintain good code.  Here's one set of assorted suggestions that
seem to be widely used by experienced developers:
<p>Use underscores to separate words.  It is generally easier to read
<STRONG>$var_names_like_this</STRONG> than <STRONG>$VarNamesLikeThis</STRONG>, especially for
non-native speakers of English. It's also a simple rule that works
consistently with VAR_NAMES_LIKE_THIS.
<p>Package/Module names are an exception to this rule. Perl informally
reserves lowercase module names for 'pragma' modules like integer
and strict. Other modules normally begin with a capital letter and
use mixed case with no underscores (need to be short and portable).
<p>You may find it helpful to use letter case to indicate the scope
or nature of a variable. For example:
<p>
<XMP>
 $ALL_CAPS_HERE   constants only (beware clashes with perl vars)
 $Some_Caps_Here  package-wide global/static
 $no_caps_here    function scope my() or local() variables

</XMP>
<p>Function and method names seem to work best as all lowercase.
E.g., <STRONG>$obj</STRONG>-&gt;<EM>as_string()</EM>.
<p>You can use a leading underscore to indicate that a variable or
function should not be used outside the package that defined it.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlmod_select_0">
Select what to export.</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Do NOT export method names!
<p>Do NOT export anything else by default without a good reason!
<p>Exports pollute the namespace of the module user.  If you must
export try to use <STRONG>@EXPORT_OK</STRONG> in preference to <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> and avoid
short or common names to reduce the risk of name clashes.
<p>Generally anything not exported is still accessible from outside the
module using the ModuleName::item_name (or <STRONG>$blessed_ref</STRONG>-&gt;method)
syntax.  By convention you can use a leading underscore on names to
informally indicate that they are 'internal' and not for public use.
<p>(It is actually possible to get private functions by saying:
my <STRONG>$subref</STRONG> = sub { ... };  &amp;<STRONG>$subref</STRONG>; But there's no way to call that
directly as a method, since a method must have a name in the symbol
table.)
<p>As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object oriented
then export nothing. If it's just a collection of functions then
<STRONG>@EXPORT_OK</STRONG> anything but use <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> with caution.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlmod_select_1">
Select a name for the module.</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This name should be as descriptive, accurate and complete as
possible.  Avoid any risk of ambiguity. Always try to use two or
more whole words.  Generally the name should reflect what is special
about what the module does rather than how it does it.  Please use
nested module names to informally group or categorise a module.
A module should have a very good reason not to have a nested name.
Module names should begin with a capital letter.
<p>Having 57 modules all called Sort will not make life easy for anyone
(though having 23 called Sort::Quick is only marginally better :-).
Imagine someone trying to install your module alongside many others.
If in any doubt ask for suggestions in comp.lang.perl.misc.
<p>If you are developing a suite of related modules/classes it's good
practice to use nested classes with a common prefix as this will
avoid namespace clashes. For example:  Xyz::Control, Xyz::View,
Xyz::Model etc. Use the modules in this list as a naming guide.
<p>If adding a new module to a set, follow the original author's
standards for naming modules and the interface to methods in
those modules.
<p>To be portable each component of a module name should be limited to
11 characters. If it might be used on DOS then try to ensure each is
unique in the first 8 characters. Nested modules make this easier.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlmod_have_0">
Have you got it right?</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
How do you know that you've made the right decisions? Have you
picked an interface design that will cause problems later? Have
you picked the most appropriate name? Do you have any questions?
<p>The best way to know for sure, and pick up many helpful suggestions,
is to ask someone who knows. Comp.lang.perl.misc is read by just about
all the people who develop modules and it's the best place to ask.
<p>All you need to do is post a short summary of the module, its
purpose and interfaces. A few lines on each of the main methods is
probably enough. (If you post the whole module it might be ignored
by busy people - generally the very people you want to read it!)
<p>Don't worry about posting if you can't say when the module will be
ready - just say so in the message. It might be worth inviting
others to help you, they may be able to complete it for you!

<A NAME="perlmod_adding_0">
Adding a Copyright Notice.</A>

How you choose to licence your work is a personal decision.
The general mechanism is to assert your Copyright and then make
a declaration of how others may copy/use/modify your work.
<p>Perl, for example, is supplied with two types of licence: The GNU
GPL and The Artistic License (see the files README, Copying and
Artistic).  Larry has good reasons for NOT just using the GNU GPL.
<p>My personal recommendation, out of respect for Larry, Perl and the
perl community at large is to simply state something like:
<p>
<XMP>
 Copyright (c) 1995 Your Name. All rights reserved.
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

</XMP>
<p>This statement should at least appear in the README file. You may
also wish to include it in a Copying file and your source files.
Remember to include the other words in addition to the Copyright.
<p>
<LI>
<A NAME="perlmod_give_0">
Give the module a version/issue/release number.</A>

To be fully compatible with the Exporter and MakeMaker modules you
should store your module's version number in a non-my package
variable called <STRONG>$VERSION</STRONG>.  This should be a valid floating point 
number with at least two digits after the decimal (ie hundredths,
e.g, <STRONG>$VERSION</STRONG> = ``0.01'').  Don't use a ``1.3.2'' style version.
See Exporter.pm in Perl5.001m or later for details.
<p>It may be handy to add a function or method to retrieve the number.
Use the number in announcements and archive file names when
releasing the module (ModuleName-1.02.tar.Z).
See perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker.pm for details.
<p>
<LI>
<A NAME="perlmod_how_0">
How to release and distribute a module.</A>

It's good idea to post an announcement of the availability of your
module (or the module itself if small) to the comp.lang.perl.announce
Usenet newsgroup.  This will at least ensure very wide once-off
distribution.
<p>If possible you should place the module into a major ftp archive and
include details of it's location in your announcement.
<p>Some notes about ftp archives: Please use a long descriptive file
name which includes the version number. Most incoming directories
will not be readable/listable, i.e., you won't be able to see your
file after uploading it. Remember to send your email notification
message as soon as possible after uploading else your file may get
deleted automatically. Allow time for the file to be processed
and/or check the file has been processed before announcing its
location.

</H1>
A pod-to-whatever translator reads a pod file paragraph by paragraph,
and translates it to the appropriate output format.  There are
three kinds of paragraphs:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>A verbatim paragraph, distinguished by being indented (that is,
it starts with space or tab).  It should be reproduced exactly,
with tabs assumed to be on 8-column boundaries.  There are no
special formatting escapes, so you can't italicize or anything
like that.  A \ means \, and nothing else.
<p>
<LI>A command.  All command paragraphs start with ``='', followed by an
identifier, followed by arbitrary text that the command can
use however it pleases.  Currently recognized commands are
<p>
<XMP>
    =head1 heading
    =head2 heading
    =item text
    =over N
    =back
    =cut
    =pod

</XMP>
<p>The ``=pod'' directive does nothing beyond telling the compiler to lay
off of through the next ``=cut''.  It's useful for adding another 
paragraph to the doc if you're mixing up code and pod a lot.  
<p>Head1 and head2 produce first and second level headings, with the text on
the same paragraph as ``=headn'' forming the heading description.
<p>Item, over, and back require a little more explanation: Over starts a
section specifically for the generation of a list using =item commands. At
the end of your list, use =back to end it. You will probably want to give
``4'' as the number to =over, as some formatters will use this for indention.
This should probably be a default. Note also that there are some basic rules
to using =item: don't use them outside of an =over/=back block, use at least
one inside an =over/=back block, you don't _have_ to include the =back if
the list just runs off the document, and perhaps most importantly, keep the
items consistent: either use ``=item *'' for all of them, to produce bullets,
or use ``=item 1.'', ``=item 2.'', etc., to produce numbered lists, or use
``=item foo'', ``=item bar'', etc., i.e., things that looks nothing like bullets
or numbers. If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as many
formatters you the first =item type to decide how to format the list.  
<p>And don't forget, when using any command, that that command lasts up until
the end of the <STRONG>paragraph</STRONG>, not the line. Hence in the examples below, you
can see the blank lines after each command to end it's paragraph.
<p>Some examples of lists include:
<p>
<XMP>
 =over 4
 =item *
 First item
 =item *
 Second item
 =back
 =over 4
 =item Foo()
 Description of Foo function
 =item Bar()
 Description of Bar function
 =back

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>An ordinary block of text.  It will be filled, and maybe even
justified.  Certain interior sequences are recognized both
here and in commands:
<p>
<XMP>
    I<text>     italicize text, used for emphasis or variables
    B<text>     embolden text, used for switches and programs
    S<text>     text contains non-breaking spaces
    C<code>     literal code 
    L<name>     A link (cross reference) to name
                    L<name>             manpage
                    L<name/ident>       item in manpage
                    L<name/"sec">       section in other manpage
                    L<"sec">            section in this manpage
                                        (the quotes are optional)
                    L</"sec">           ditto
    F<file>     Used for filenames
    X<index>    An index entry
    Z<>         A zero-width character

</XMP>
<p>That's it.  The intent is simplicity, not power.  I wanted paragraphs
to look like paragraphs (block format), so that they stand out
visually, and so that I could run them through fmt easily to reformat
them (that's F7 in my version of <STRONG>vi</STRONG>).  I wanted the translator (and not
me) to worry about whether " or ' is a left quote or a right quote
within filled text, and I wanted it to leave the quotes alone dammit in
verbatim mode, so I could slurp in a working program, shift it over 4
spaces, and have it print out, er, verbatim.  And presumably in a
constant width font.
<p>In particular, you can leave things like this verbatim in your text:
<p>
<XMP>
    Perl
    FILEHANDLE
    $variable
    function()
    manpage(3r)

</XMP>
<p>Doubtless a few other commands or sequences will need to be added along
the way, but I've gotten along surprisingly well with just these.
<p>Note that I'm not at all claiming this to be sufficient for producing a
book.  I'm just trying to make an idiot-proof common source for nroff,
TeX, and other markup languages, as used for online documentation.
Translators exist for <STRONG>pod2man</STRONG>  (that's for nroff(1) and troff(1)),
<STRONG>pod2html</STRONG>, <STRONG>pod2latex</STRONG>, and <STRONG>pod2fm</STRONG>.

<A NAME="perlpod_embedding_0">
Embedding Pods in Perl Modules</A>
</H1>
You can embed pod documentation in your Perl scripts.  Start your
documentation with a =head1 command at the beg, and end it with 
an =cut command.  Perl will ignore the pod text.  See any of the
supplied library modules for examples.  If you're going to put
your pods at the end of the file, and you're using an __END__
or __DATA__ cut mark, make sure to put a blank line there before
the first pod directive.
<p>
<XMP>
    __END__
    =head1 NAME
    modern - I am a modern module

</XMP>
<p>If you had not had that blank line there, then the translators wouldn't
have seen it.

perlop - Perl operators and precedence

<A NAME="perlop_synopsis_0">
SYNOPSIS</A>
</H1>
Perl operators have the following associativity and precedence,
listed from highest precedence to lowest.  Note that all operators
borrowed from C keep the same precedence relationship with each other,
even where C's precedence is slightly screwy.  (This makes learning
Perl easier for C folks.)  With very few exceptions, these all 
operate on scalar values only, not array values.
<p><UL><LI>    left	terms and list operators (leftward)</LI>

<LI>    left	=~ !~ </LI>
<LI>    left	* / % x</LI>

<p>In the following sections, these operators are covered in precedence order.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlop_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_terms_0">
Terms and List Operators (Leftward)</A>
</H2>
Any TERM is of highest precedence of Perl.  These includes variables,
quote and quotelike operators, any expression in parentheses,
and any function whose arguments are parenthesized.  Actually, there
aren't really functions in this sense, just list operators and unary
operators behaving as functions because you put parentheses around
the arguments.  These are all documented in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html">
the <EM>perlfunc</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>If any list operator (
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
, etc.) or any unary operator (
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_chdir_0">chdir()</A>
, etc.)
is followed by a left parenthesis as the next token, the operator and
arguments within parentheses are taken to be of highest precedence,
just like a normal function call.
<p>In the absence of parentheses, the precedence of list operators such as

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sort_2">sort</A>
, or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_chmod_0">chmod</A>
 is either very high or very low depending on
whether you look at the left side of operator or the right side of it.
For example, in
<p>
<XMP>
    @ary = (1, 3, sort 4, 2);
    print @ary;         # prints 1324

</XMP>
<p>the commas on the right of the sort are evaluated before the sort, but
the commas on the left are evaluated after.  In other words, list
operators tend to gobble up all the arguments that follow them, and
then act like a simple TERM with regard to the preceding expression.
Note that you have to be careful with parens:
<p>
<XMP>
    # These evaluate exit before doing the print:
    print($foo, exit);  # Obviously not what you want.
    print $foo, exit;   # Nor is this.
    # These do the print before evaluating exit:
    (print $foo), exit; # This is what you want.
    print($foo), exit;  # Or this.
    print ($foo), exit; # Or even this.

</XMP>
<p>Also note that
<p>
<XMP>
    print ($foo & 255) + 1, "\n";

</XMP>
<p>probably doesn't do what you expect at first glance.  See 

<A HREF="perlop.html#perlop_named_0"><EM>Named Unary Operators</EM></A>
 for more discussion of this.
<p>Also parsed as terms are the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do {}</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval {}</A>
 constructs, as
well as subroutine and method calls, and the anonymous 
constructors <CODE>[]</CODE> and <CODE>{}</CODE>.
<p>See also 
<A HREF="perlop.html#perlop_quote_0"><EM>Quote and Quotelike Operators</EM></A>
 toward the end of this section,
as well as <EM>O Operators''</EM>.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_the_0">
The Arrow Operator</A>
</H2>
Just as in C and C++, ``<CODE>-&gt;</CODE>'' is an infix dereference operator.  If the
right side is either a <CODE>[...]</CODE> or <CODE>{...}</CODE> subscript, then the left side
must be either a hard or symbolic reference to an array or hash (or
a location capable of holding a hard reference, if it's an lvalue (assignable)).
See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>Otherwise, the right side is a method name or a simple scalar variable
containing the method name, and the left side must either be an object
(a blessed reference) or a class name (that is, a package name).
See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_autoincrement_0">
Autoincrement and Autodecrement</A>
</H2>
``++'' and ``--'' work as in C.  That is, if placed before a variable, they
increment or decrement the variable before returning the value, and if
placed after, increment or decrement the variable after returning the value.
<p>The autoincrement operator has a little extra built-in magic to it.  If
you increment a variable that is numeric, or that has ever been used in
a numeric context, you get a normal increment.  If, however, the
variable has only been used in string contexts since it was set, and
has a value that is not null and matches the pattern
<CODE>/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*$/</CODE>, the increment is done as a string, preserving each
character within its range, with carry:
<p>
<XMP>
    print ++($foo = '99');      # prints '100'
    print ++($foo = 'a0');      # prints 'a1'
    print ++($foo = 'Az');      # prints 'Ba'
    print ++($foo = 'zz');      # prints 'aaa'

</XMP>
<p>The autodecrement operator is not magical.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_exponentiation_0">
Exponentiation</A>
</H2>
Binary ``**'' is the exponentiation operator.  Note that it binds even more
tightly than unary minus, so -2**4 is -(2**4), not (-2)**4. (This is
implemented using C's pow(3) function, which actually works on doubles
internally.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_symbolic_0">
Symbolic Unary Operators</A>
</H2>
Unary ``!'' performs logical negation, i.e. ``not''.  See also <CODE>not</CODE> for a lower
precedence version of this.
<p>Unary ``-'' performs arithmetic negation if the operand is numeric.  If
the operand is an identifier, a string consisting of a minus sign
concatenated with the identifier is returned.  Otherwise, if the string
starts with a plus or minus, a string starting with the opposite sign
is returned.  One effect of these rules is that <CODE>-bareword</CODE> is equivalent
to <CODE>``-bareword''</CODE>.
<p>Unary ``~'' performs bitwise negation, i.e. 1's complement.
<p>Unary ``+'' has no effect whatsoever, even on strings.  It is useful
syntactically for separating a function name from a parenthesized expression
that would otherwise be interpreted as the complete list of function
arguments.  (See examples above under <EM>List Operators</EM>.)
<p>Unary ``\'' creates a reference to whatever follows it.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
.
Do not confuse this behavior with the behavior of backslash within a
string, although both forms do convey the notion of protecting the next
thing from interpretation.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_binding_0">
Binding Operators</A>
</H2>
Binary ``=~'' binds a scalar expression to a pattern match.  Certain operations
search or modify the string 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 by default.  This operator makes that kind
of operation work on some other string.  The right argument is a search
pattern, substitution, or translation.  The left argument is what is
supposed to be searched, substituted, or translated instead of the default

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
.  The return value indicates the success of the operation.  (If the
right argument is an expression rather than a search pattern,
substitution, or translation, it is interpreted as a search pattern at run
time.  This is less efficient than an explicit search, since the pattern
must be compiled every time the expression is evaluated--unless you've
used <CODE>/o</CODE>.)
<p>Binary ``!~'' is just like ``=~'' except the return value is negated in
the logical sense.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_multiplicative_0">
Multiplicative Operators</A>
</H2>
Binary ``*'' multiplies two numbers.
<p>Binary ``/'' divides two numbers.
<p>Binary ``%'' computes the modulus of the two numbers.
<p>Binary ``x'' is the repetition operator.  In a scalar context, it
returns a string consisting of the left operand repeated the number of
times specified by the right operand.  In a list context, if the left
operand is a list in parens, it repeats the list.
<p>
<XMP>
    print '-' x 80;             # print row of dashes
    print "\t" x ($tab/8), ' ' x ($tab%8);      # tab over
    @ones = (1) x 80;           # a list of 80 1's
    @ones = (5) x @ones;        # set all elements to 5

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_additive_0">
Additive Operators</A>
</H2>
Binary ``+'' returns the sum of two numbers.
<p>Binary ``-'' returns the difference of two numbers.
<p>Binary ``.'' concatenates two strings.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_shift_0">
Shift Operators</A>
</H2>
Binary ``&lt;&lt;'' returns the value of its left argument shifted left by the
number of bits specified by the right argument.  Arguments should be 
integers.
<p>Binary ``&gt;&gt;'' returns the value of its left argument shifted right by the
number of bits specified by the right argument.  Arguments should be 
integers.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_named_0">
Named Unary Operators</A>
</H2>
The various named unary operators are treated as functions with one
argument, with optional parentheses.  These include the filetest
operators, like <CODE>-f</CODE>, 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_m_1">-M</A>
, etc.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html">
the <EM>perlfunc</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>If any list operator (
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
, etc.) or any unary operator (
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_chdir_0">chdir()</A>
, etc.)
is followed by a left parenthesis as the next token, the operator and
arguments within parentheses are taken to be of highest precedence,
just like a normal function call.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    chdir $foo    || die;       # (chdir $foo) || die
    chdir($foo)   || die;       # (chdir $foo) || die
    chdir ($foo)  || die;       # (chdir $foo) || die
    chdir +($foo) || die;       # (chdir $foo) || die

</XMP>
<p>but, because * is higher precedence than ||:
<p>
<XMP>
    chdir $foo * 20;    # chdir ($foo * 20)
    chdir($foo) * 20;   # (chdir $foo) * 20
    chdir ($foo) * 20;  # (chdir $foo) * 20
    chdir +($foo) * 20; # chdir ($foo * 20)
    rand 10 * 20;       # rand (10 * 20)
    rand(10) * 20;      # (rand 10) * 20
    rand (10) * 20;     # (rand 10) * 20
    rand +(10) * 20;    # rand (10 * 20)

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_relational_0">
Relational Operators</A>
</H2>
Binary ``&lt;'' returns true if the left argument is numerically less than
the right argument.
<p>Binary ``&gt;'' returns true if the left argument is numerically greater
than the right argument.
<p>Binary ``&lt;='' returns true if the left argument is numerically less than
or equal to the right argument.
<p>Binary ``&gt;='' returns true if the left argument is numerically greater
than or equal to the right argument.
<p>Binary ``lt'' returns true if the left argument is stringwise less than
the right argument.
<p>Binary ``gt'' returns true if the left argument is stringwise greater
than the right argument.
<p>Binary ``le'' returns true if the left argument is stringwise less than
or equal to the right argument.
<p>Binary ``ge'' returns true if the left argument is stringwise greater
than or equal to the right argument.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_equality_0">
Equality Operators</A>
</H2>
Binary ``=='' returns true if the left argument is numerically equal to
the right argument.
<p>Binary ``!='' returns true if the left argument is numerically not equal
to the right argument.
<p>Binary ``&lt;=&gt;'' returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the left argument is numerically
less than, equal to, or greater than the right argument.
<p>Binary ``eq'' returns true if the left argument is stringwise equal to
the right argument.
<p>Binary ``ne'' returns true if the left argument is stringwise not equal
to the right argument.
<p>Binary ``cmp'' returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the left argument is stringwise
less than, equal to, or greater than the right argument.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_bitwise_0">
Bitwise And</A>
</H2>
Binary ``&amp;'' returns its operators ANDed together bit by bit.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_bitwise_1">
Bitwise Or and Exclusive Or</A>
</H2>
Binary ``|'' returns its operators ORed together bit by bit.
<p>Binary ``^'' returns its operators XORed together bit by bit.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_c_style_0">
C-style Logical And</A>
</H2>
Binary ``&amp;&amp;'' performs a short-circuit logical AND operation.  That is,
if the left operand is false, the right operand is not even evaluated.
Scalar or list context propagates down to the right operand if it
is evaluated.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_c_style_1">
C-style Logical Or</A>
</H2>
Binary ``||'' performs a short-circuit logical OR operation.  That is,
if the left operand is true, the right operand is not even evaluated.
Scalar or list context propagates down to the right operand if it
is evaluated.
<p>The <CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> operators differ from C's in that, rather than returning
0 or 1, they return the last value evaluated.  Thus, a reasonably portable
way to find out the home directory (assuming it's not ``0'') might be:
<p>
<XMP>
    $home = $ENV{'HOME'} || $ENV{'LOGDIR'} ||
        (getpwuid($<))[7] || die "You're homeless!\n";

</XMP>
<p>As more readable alternatives to <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> and <CODE>||</CODE>, Perl provides ``and'' and
``or'' operators (see below).  The short-circuit behavior is identical.  The
precedence of ``and'' and ``or'' is much lower, however, so that you can
safely use them after a list operator without the need for
parentheses:
<p>
<XMP>
    unlink "alpha", "beta", "gamma"
            or gripe(), next LINE;

</XMP>
<p>With the C-style operators that would have been written like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    unlink("alpha", "beta", "gamma")
            || (gripe(), next LINE);

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_range_0">
Range Operator</A>
</H2>
Binary ``..'' is the range operator, which is really two different
operators depending on the context.  In a list context, it returns an
array of values counting (by ones) from the left value to the right
value.  This is useful for writing <CODE>for (1..10)</CODE> loops and for doing
slice operations on arrays.  Be aware that under the current implementation,
a temporary array is created, so you'll burn a lot of memory if you 
write something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for (1 .. 1_000_000) {
        # code
    } 

</XMP>
<p>In a scalar context, ``..'' returns a boolean value.  The operator is
bistable, like a flip-flop, and emulates the line-range (comma) operator
of <STRONG>sed</STRONG>, <STRONG>awk</STRONG>, and various editors.  Each ``..'' operator maintains its
own boolean state.  It is false as long as its left operand is false.
Once the left operand is true, the range operator stays true until the
right operand is true, <EM>AFTER</EM> which the range operator becomes false
again.  (It doesn't become false till the next time the range operator is
evaluated.  It can test the right operand and become false on the same
evaluation it became true (as in <STRONG>awk</STRONG>), but it still returns true once.
If you don't want it to test the right operand till the next evaluation
(as in <STRONG>sed</STRONG>), use three dots (``...'') instead of two.)  The right
operand is not evaluated while the operator is in the ``false'' state, and
the left operand is not evaluated while the operator is in the ``true''
state.  The precedence is a little lower than || and &amp;&amp;.  The value
returned is either the null string for false, or a sequence number
(beginning with 1) for true.  The sequence number is reset for each range
encountered.  The final sequence number in a range has the string ``E0''
appended to it, which doesn't affect its numeric value, but gives you
something to search for if you want to exclude the endpoint.  You can
exclude the beginning point by waiting for the sequence number to be
greater than 1.  If either operand of scalar ``..'' is a numeric literal,
that operand is implicitly compared to the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__6">$.</A>
 variable, the current
line number.  Examples:
<p>As a scalar operator:
<p>
<XMP>
    if (101 .. 200) { print; }  # print 2nd hundred lines
    next line if (1 .. /^$/);   # skip header lines
    s/^/> / if (/^$/ .. eof()); # quote body

</XMP>
<p>As a list operator:
<p>
<XMP>
    for (101 .. 200) { print; } # print $_ 100 times
    @foo = @foo[$[ .. $#foo];   # an expensive no-op
    @foo = @foo[$#foo-4 .. $#foo];      # slice last 5 items

</XMP>
<p>The range operator (in a list context) makes use of the magical
autoincrement algorithm if the operands are strings.  You
can say
<p>
<XMP>
    @alphabet = ('A' .. 'Z');

</XMP>
<p>to get all the letters of the alphabet, or
<p>
<XMP>
    $hexdigit = (0 .. 9, 'a' .. 'f')[$num & 15];

</XMP>
<p>to get a hexadecimal digit, or
<p>
<XMP>
    @z2 = ('01' .. '31');  print $z2[$mday];

</XMP>
<p>to get dates with leading zeros.  If the final value specified is not
in the sequence that the magical increment would produce, the sequence
goes until the next value would be longer than the final value
specified.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_conditional_0">
Conditional Operator</A>
</H2>
Ternary ``?:'' is the conditional operator, just as in C.  It works much
like an if-then-else.  If the argument before the ? is true, the
argument before the : is returned, otherwise the argument after the :
is returned.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    printf "I have %d dog%s.\n", $n, 
            ($n == 1) ? '' : "s";

</XMP>
<p>Scalar or list context propagates downward into the 2nd
or 3rd argument, whichever is selected.  
<p>
<XMP>
    $a = $ok ? $b : $c;  # get a scalar
    @a = $ok ? @b : @c;  # get an array
    $a = $ok ? @b : @c;  # oops, that's just a count!

</XMP>
<p>The operator may be assigned to if both the 2nd and 3rd arguments are
legal lvalues (meaning that you can assign to them):
<p>
<XMP>
    ($a_or_b ? $a : $b) = $c;

</XMP>
<p>This is not necessarily guaranteed to contribute to the readability of your program.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_assignment_0">
Assignment Operators</A>
</H2>
``='' is the ordinary assignment operator.
<p>Assignment operators work as in C.  That is,
<p>
<XMP>
    $a += 2;

</XMP>
<p>is equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    $a = $a + 2;

</XMP>
<p>although without duplicating any side effects that dereferencing the lvalue
might trigger, such as from 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
.  Other assignment operators work similarly.  
The following are recognized: 
<p>
<PRE>
    **=    +=    *=    &amp;=    &lt;&lt;=    &amp;&amp;=
           -=    /=    |=    &gt;&gt;=    ||=
           .=    %=    ^=
                 x=

</PRE>
<p>Note that while these are grouped by family, they all have the precedence
of assignment.
<p>Unlike in C, the assignment operator produces a valid lvalue.  Modifying
an assignment is equivalent to doing the assignment and then modifying
the variable that was assigned to.  This is useful for modifying
a copy of something, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($tmp = $global) =~ tr [A-Z] [a-z];

</XMP>
<p>Likewise,
<p>
<XMP>
    ($a += 2) *= 3;

</XMP>
<p>is equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    $a += 2;
    $a *= 3;

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_comma_0">
Comma Operator</A>
</H2>
Binary ``,'' is the comma operator.  In a scalar context it evaluates
its left argument, throws that value away, then evaluates its right
argument and returns that value.  This is just like C's comma operator.
<p>In a list context, it's just the list argument separator, and inserts
both its arguments into the list.
<p>The =&gt; digraph is mostly just a synonym for the comma operator.  It's useful for
documenting arguments that come in pairs.  As of release 5.001, it also forces
any word to the left of it to be interpreted as a string.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_list_0">
List Operators (Rightward)</A>
</H2>
On the right side of a list operator, it has very low precedence,
such that it controls all comma-separated expressions found there.
The only operators with lower precedence are the logical operators
``and'', ``or'', and ``not'', which may be used to evaluate calls to list
operators without the need for extra parentheses:
<p>
<XMP>
    open HANDLE, "filename"
        or die "Can't open: $!\n";

</XMP>
<p>See also discussion of list operators in <EM>List Operators (Leftward)</EM>.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_logical_0">
Logical Not</A>
</H2>
Unary ``not'' returns the logical negation of the expression to its right.
It's the equivalent of ``!'' except for the very low precedence.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_logical_1">
Logical And</A>
</H2>
Binary ``and'' returns the logical conjunction of the two surrounding
expressions.  It's equivalent to &amp;&amp; except for the very low
precedence.  This means that it short-circuits: i.e. the right
expression is evaluated only if the left expression is true.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_logical_2">
Logical or and Exclusive Or</A>
</H2>
Binary ``or'' returns the logical disjunction of the two surrounding
expressions.  It's equivalent to || except for the very low
precedence.  This means that it short-circuits: i.e. the right
expression is evaluated only if the left expression is false.
<p>Binary ``xor'' returns the exclusive-OR of the two surrounding expressions.
It cannot short circuit, of course.

<A NAME="perlop_quote_0">
Quote and Quotelike Operators</A>
</H2>
While we usually think of quotes as literal values, in Perl they
function as operators, providing various kinds of interpolating and
pattern matching capabilities.  Perl provides customary quote characters
for these behaviors, but also provides a way for you to choose your
quote character for any of them.  In the following table, a <CODE>{}</CODE> represents
any pair of delimiters you choose.  Non-bracketing delimiters use
the same character fore and aft, but the 4 sorts of brackets 
(round, angle, square, curly) will all nest.
<p>
<XMP>
    Customary  Generic     Meaning    Interpolates
        ''       q{}       Literal         no
        ""      qq{}       Literal         yes

                 s{}{}   Substitution      yes
                tr{}{}   Translation       no

</XMP>
<p>For constructs that do interpolation, variables beginning with ``<CODE>$</CODE>'' or ``<CODE>@</CODE>''
are interpolated, as are the following sequences:
<p>
<XMP>
    \t          tab
    \n          newline
    \r          return
    \f          form feed
    \b          backspace
    \a          alarm (bell)
    \e          escape
    \033        octal char
    \x1b        hex char
    \c[         control char
    \l          lowercase next char
    \u          uppercase next char
    \L          lowercase till \E
    \U          uppercase till \E
    \E          end case modification
    \Q          quote regexp metacharacters till \E

</XMP>
<p>Patterns are subject to an additional level of interpretation as a
regular expression.  This is done as a second pass, after variables are
interpolated, so that regular expressions may be incorporated into the
pattern from the variables.  If this is not what you want, use <CODE>\Q</CODE> to
interpolate a variable literally.
<p>Apart from the above, there are no multiple levels of interpolation.  In
particular, contrary to the expectations of shell programmers, backquotes
do <EM>NOT</EM> interpolate within double quotes, nor do single quotes impede
evaluation of variables when used within double quotes.

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlop_pattern_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is just like the <CODE>/pattern/</CODE> search, except that it matches only
once between calls to the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_reset_0">reset()</A>
 operator.  This is a useful
optimization when you only want to see the first occurrence of
something in each file of a set of files, for instance.  Only <CODE>??</CODE>
patterns local to the current package are reset.
<p>This usage is vaguely deprecated, and may be removed in some future
version of Perl.

<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlop_pattern_gimosx_0">
/PATTERN/gimosx</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Searches a string for a pattern match, and in a scalar context returns
true (1) or false ('').  If no string is specified via the <CODE>=~</CODE> or
<CODE>!~</CODE> operator, the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 string is searched.  (The string specified with
<CODE>=~</CODE> need not be an lvalue--it may be the result of an expression
evaluation, but remember the <CODE>=~</CODE> binds rather tightly.)  See also

<A HREF="perlre.html">
the <EM>perlre</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>Options are:
<p><UL><LI>    g	Match globally, i.e. find all occurrences.</LI>
<LI>    i	Do case-insensitive pattern matching.</LI>
<LI>    m	Treat string as multiple lines.</LI>
<LI>    o	Only compile pattern once.</LI>
<LI>    s	Treat string as single line.</LI>
<LI>    x	Use extended regular expressions.</LI>
</UL>
<p>If ``/'' is the delimiter then the initial <CODE>m</CODE> is optional.  With the <CODE>m</CODE>
you can use any pair of non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace characters as
delimiters.  This is particularly useful for matching Unix path names
that contain ``/'', to avoid LTS (leaning toothpick syndrome).
<p>PATTERN may contain variables, which will be interpolated (and the
pattern recompiled) every time the pattern search is evaluated.  (Note
that 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__27">$)</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__8">$|</A>
 might not be interpolated because they look like
end-of-string tests.)  If you want such a pattern to be compiled only
once, add a <CODE>/o</CODE> after the trailing delimiter.  This avoids expensive
run-time recompilations, and is useful when the value you are
interpolating won't change over the life of the script.  However, mentioning
<CODE>/o</CODE> constitutes a promise that you won't change the variables in the pattern.
If you change them, Perl won't even notice.
<p>If the PATTERN evaluates to a null string, the last
successfully executed regular expression is used instead.
<p>If used in a context that requires a list value, a pattern match returns a
list consisting of the subexpressions matched by the parentheses in the
pattern, i.e. (<STRONG>$1</STRONG>, <STRONG>$2</STRONG>, <STRONG>$3</STRONG>...).  (Note that here <STRONG>$1</STRONG> etc. are also set, and
that this differs from Perl 4's behavior.)  If the match fails, a null
array is returned.  If the match succeeds, but there were no parentheses,
a list value of (1) is returned.
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(TTY, '/dev/tty');
    <TTY> =~ /^y/i && foo();    # do foo if desired
    if (/Version: *([0-9.]*)/) { $version = $1; }
    next if m#^/usr/spool/uucp#;
    # poor man's grep
    $arg = shift;
    while (<>) {
        print if /$arg/o;       # compile only once
    }
    if (($F1, $F2, $Etc) = ($foo =~ /^(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s*(.*)/))

</XMP>
<p>This last example splits <STRONG>$foo</STRONG> into the first two words and the
remainder of the line, and assigns those three fields to <STRONG>$F1</STRONG>, <STRONG>$F2</STRONG> and
<STRONG>$Etc</STRONG>.  The conditional is true if any variables were assigned, i.e. if
the pattern matched.
<p>The <CODE>/g</CODE> modifier specifies global pattern matching--that is, matching
as many times as possible within the string.  How it behaves depends on
the context.  In a list context, it returns a list of all the
substrings matched by all the parentheses in the regular expression.
If there are no parentheses, it returns a list of all the matched
strings, as if there were parentheses around the whole pattern.
<p>In a scalar context, <CODE>m//g</CODE> iterates through the string, returning TRUE
each time it matches, and FALSE when it eventually runs out of
matches.  (In other words, it remembers where it left off last time and
restarts the search at that point.  You can actually find the current
match position of a string using the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pos_0">pos()</A>
 function--see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html">
the <EM>perlfunc</EM> manpage</A>
.)
If you modify the string in any way, the match position is reset to the
beginning.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    # list context
    ($one,$five,$fifteen) = (`uptime` =~ /(\d+\.\d+)/g);
    # scalar context
    $/ = ""; $* = 1;  # $* deprecated in Perl 5
    while ($paragraph = <>) {
        while ($paragraph =~ /[a-z]['")]*[.!?]+['")]*\s/g) {
            $sentences++;

Searches a string for a pattern, and if found, replaces that pattern
with the replacement text and returns the number of substitutions
made.  Otherwise it returns false (0).
<p>If no string is specified via the <CODE>=~</CODE> or <CODE>!~</CODE> operator, the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>

variable is searched and modified.  (The string specified with <CODE>=~</CODE> must
be a scalar variable, an array element, a hash element, or an assignment
to one of those, i.e. an lvalue.)
<p>If the delimiter chosen is single quote, no variable interpolation is
done on either the PATTERN or the REPLACEMENT.  Otherwise, if the
PATTERN contains a <STRONG>$ </STRONG>that looks like a variable rather than an
end-of-string test, the variable will be interpolated into the pattern
at run-time.  If you only want the pattern compiled once the first time
the variable is interpolated, use the <CODE>/o</CODE> option.  If the pattern
evaluates to a null string, the last successfully executed regular
expression is used instead.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the <EM>perlre</EM> manpage</A>
 for further explanation on these.
<p>Options are:
<p><UL><LI>    e	Evaluate the right side as an expression.</LI>

<LI>    s	Treat string as single line.</LI>
<LI>    x	Use extended regular expressions.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Any non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace delimiter may replace the
slashes.  If single quotes are used, no interpretation is done on the
replacement string (the <CODE>/e</CODE> modifier overrides this, however).  If
backquotes are used, the replacement string is a command to execute
whose output will be used as the actual replacement text.  If the
PATTERN is delimited by bracketing quotes, the REPLACEMENT has its own
pair of quotes, which may or may not be bracketing quotes, e.g.
<CODE>s(foo)(bar)</CODE> or <CODE>s&lt;foo&gt;/bar/</CODE>.  A <CODE>/e</CODE> will cause the
replacement portion to be interpreter as a full-fledged Perl expression
and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
ed right then and there.  It is, however, syntax checked at
compile-time.

Translates all occurrences of the characters found in the search list

the number of characters replaced or deleted.  If no string is
specified via the =~ or !~ operator, the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 string is translated.  (The
string specified with =~ must be a scalar variable, an array element,
or an assignment to one of those, i.e. an lvalue.)  For <STRONG>sed</STRONG> devotees,
<CODE>y</CODE> is provided as a synonym for <CODE>tr</CODE>.  If the SEARCHLIST is
delimited by bracketing quotes, the REPLACEMENTLIST has its own pair of

<LI>    d	Delete found but unreplaced characters.</LI>
<LI>    s	Squash duplicate replaced characters.</LI>
</UL>
<p>If the <CODE>/c</CODE> modifier is specified, the SEARCHLIST character set is
complemented.  If the <CODE>/d</CODE> modifier is specified, any characters specified
by SEARCHLIST not found in REPLACEMENTLIST are deleted.  (Note
that this is slightly more flexible than the behavior of some <STRONG>tr</STRONG>
programs, which delete anything they find in the SEARCHLIST, period.)
If the <CODE>/s</CODE> modifier is specified, sequences of characters that were
translated to the same character are squashed down to a single instance of the
character.
<p>If the <CODE>/d</CODE> modifier is used, the REPLACEMENTLIST is always interpreted
exactly as specified.  Otherwise, if the REPLACEMENTLIST is shorter
than the SEARCHLIST, the final character is replicated till it is long
enough.  If the REPLACEMENTLIST is null, the SEARCHLIST is replicated.
This latter is useful for counting characters in a class or for
squashing character sequences in a class.

<p>
<XMP>
    $ARGV[1] =~ tr/A-Z/a-z/;    # canonicalize to lower case
    $cnt = tr/*/*/;             # count the stars in $_
    $cnt = $sky =~ tr/*/*/;     # count the stars in $sky
    $cnt = tr/0-9//;            # count the digits in $_
    tr/a-zA-Z//s;               # bookkeeper -> bokeper
    ($HOST = $host) =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
    tr/a-zA-Z/ /cs;             # change non-alphas to single space
    tr [\200-\377]
       [\000-\177];             # delete 8th bit

</XMP>
<p>If multiple translations are given for a character, only the first one is used:
<p>
<XMP>
    tr/AAA/XYZ/

</XMP>
<p>will translate any A to X.
<p>Note that because the translation table is built at compile time, neither
the SEARCHLIST nor the REPLACEMENTLIST are subjected to double quote
interpolation.  That means that if you want to use variables, you must use
an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
:
<p>
<XMP>
    eval "tr/$oldlist/$newlist/";
    die $@ if $@;
    eval "tr/$oldlist/$newlist/, 1" or die $@;

</XMP>
<p>
</DL>
.

<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_i_o_0">
I/O Operators</A>
</H2>
There are several I/O operators you should know about.  
A string is enclosed by backticks (grave accents) first undergoes
variable substitution just like a double quoted string.  It is then
interpreted as a command, and the output of that command is the value
of the pseudo-literal, like in a shell.  In a scalar context, a single
string consisting of all the output is returned.  In a list context,
a list of values is returned, one for each line of output.  (You can
set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__7">$/</A>
 to use a different line terminator.)  The command is executed
each time the pseudo-literal is evaluated.  The status value of the
command is returned in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__20">$?</A>
 (see 
<A HREF="perlvar.html">
the <EM>perlvar</EM> manpage</A>
 for the interpretation
of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__20">$?</A>
).  Unlike in <STRONG>csh</STRONG>, no translation is done on the return
data--newlines remain newlines.  Unlike in any of the shells, single
quotes do not hide variable names in the command from interpretation.
To pass a <STRONG>$ </STRONG>through to the shell you need to hide it with a backslash.
The generalized form of backticks is 
<A HREF="perlop.html#perlop_qx_string_0">qx//</A>
.  (Because backticks
always undergo shell expansion as well, see 
<A HREF="perlsec.html">
the <EM>perlsec</EM> manpage</A>
 for 
security concerns.)
<p>Evaluating a filehandle in angle brackets yields the next line from
that file (newline included, so it's never false until end of file, at
which time an undefined value is returned).  Ordinarily you must assign
that value to a variable, but there is one situation where an automatic
assignment happens.  <EM>If and ONLY if</EM> the input symbol is the only
thing inside the conditional of a <CODE>while</CODE> loop, the value is
automatically assigned to the variable 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
</A>
.  The assigned value is
then tested to see if it is defined.  (This may seem like an odd thing
to you, but you'll use the construct in almost every Perl script you
write.)  Anyway, the following lines are equivalent to each other:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (defined($_ = <STDIN>)) { print; }
    while (<STDIN>) { print; }
    for (;<STDIN>;) { print; }
    print while defined($_ = <STDIN>);
    print while <STDIN>;

</XMP>
<p>The filehandles STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are predefined.  (The
filehandles <CODE>stdin</CODE>, <CODE>stdout</CODE> and <CODE>stderr</CODE> will also work except in
packages, where they would be interpreted as local identifiers rather
than global.)  Additional filehandles may be created with the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>

function.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1"><EM>open</EM></A>
 for details on this.
<p>If a &lt;FILEHANDLE&gt; is used in a context that is looking for a list, a
list consisting of all the input lines is returned, one line per list
element.  It's easy to make a <EM>LARGE</EM> data space this way, so use with
care.
<p>The null filehandle &lt;&gt; is special and can be used to emulate the
behavior of <STRONG>sed</STRONG> and <STRONG>awk</STRONG>.  Input from &lt;&gt; comes either from
standard input, or from each file listed on the command line.  Here's
how it works: the first time &lt;&gt; is evaluated, the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
 array is
checked, and if it is null, <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_0">$ARGV</A>
[0]</CODE> is set to ``-'', which when opened
gives you standard input.  The 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
 array is then processed as a list
of filenames.  The loop
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        ...                     # code for each line
    }

</XMP>
<p>is equivalent to the following Perl-like pseudo code:
<p>
<XMP>
    unshift(@ARGV, '-') if $#ARGV < $[;
    while ($ARGV = shift) {
        open(ARGV, $ARGV);
        while (<ARGV>) {
            ...         # code for each line
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>except that it isn't so cumbersome to say, and will actually work.  It
really does shift array 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
 and put the current filename into variable

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_0">$ARGV</A>
.  It also uses filehandle <EM>ARGV</EM> internally--&lt;&gt; is just a synonym
for &lt;ARGV&gt;, which is magical.  (The pseudo code above doesn't work
because it treats &lt;ARGV&gt; as non-magical.)
<p>You can modify 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
 before the first &lt;&gt; as long as the array ends up
containing the list of filenames you really want.  Line numbers (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__6">$.</A>
)
continue as if the input were one big happy file.  (But see example
under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eof_1">eof()</A>
 for how to reset line numbers on each file.)
<p>If you want to set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
 to your own list of files, go right ahead.  If
you want to pass switches into your script, you can use one of the 
Getopts modules or put a loop on the front like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    while ($_ = $ARGV[0], /^-/) {
        shift;
        last if /^--$/;
        if (/^-D(.*)/) { $debug = $1 }
        if (/^-v/)     { $verbose++  }
        ...             # other switches
    }
    while (<>) {
        ...             # code for each line
    }

</XMP>
<p>The &lt;&gt; symbol will return FALSE only once.  If you call it again after
this it will assume you are processing another 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
 list, and if you
haven't set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
, will input from STDIN.
<p>If the string inside the angle brackets is a reference to a scalar
variable (e.g. &lt;<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>&gt;), then that variable contains the name of the
filehandle to input from, or a reference to the same.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    $fh = \*STDIN;
    $line = <$fh>;

</XMP>
<p>If the string inside angle brackets is not a filehandle or a scalar
variable containing a filehandle name or reference, then it is interpreted
as a filename pattern to be globbed, and either a list of filenames or the
next filename in the list is returned, depending on context.  One level of
<STRONG>$ </STRONG>interpretation is done first, but you can't say <CODE>&lt;<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>&gt;</CODE>
because that's an indirect filehandle as explained in the previous
paragraph.  In older version of Perl, programmers would insert curly
brackets to force interpretation as a filename glob: <CODE>&lt;<STRONG>${</STRONG>foo}&gt;</CODE>.
These days, it's considered cleaner to call the internal function directly
as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_glob_0">glob(<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>)</A>
, which is probably the right way to have done it in the
first place.)  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<*.c>) {
        chmod 0644, $_;
    }

</XMP>
<p>is equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FOO, "echo *.c | tr -s ' \t\r\f' '\\012\\012\\012\\012'|");
    while (<FOO>) {
        chop;
        chmod 0644, $_;
    }

</XMP>
<p>In fact, it's currently implemented that way.  (Which means it will not
work on filenames with spaces in them unless you have csh(1) on your
machine.)  Of course, the shortest way to do the above is:
<p>
<XMP>
    chmod 0644, <*.c>;

</XMP>
<p>Because globbing invokes a shell, it's often faster to call 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_readdir_0">readdir()</A>
 yourself
and just do your own 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_grep_1">grep()</A>
 on the filenames.  Furthermore, due to its current
implementation of using a shell, the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_glob_0">glob()</A>
 routine may get "Arg list too 
long" errors (unless you've installed tcsh(1L) as <EM>/bin/csh</EM>).
<p>A glob only evaluates its (embedded) argument when it is starting a new
list.  All values must be read before it will start over.  In a list
context this isn't important, because you automatically get them all
anyway.  In a scalar context, however, the operator returns the next value
each time it is called, or a FALSE value if you've just run out.  Again,
FALSE is returned only once.  So if you're expecting a single value from
a glob, it is much better to say
<p>
<XMP>
    ($file) = <blurch*>;

</XMP>
<p>than
<p>
<XMP>
    $file = <blurch*>;

</XMP>
<p>because the latter will alternate between returning a filename and
returning FALSE.  
<p>It you're trying to do variable interpolation, it's definitely better
to use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_glob_0">glob()</A>
 function, because the older notation can cause people
to become confused with the indirect filehandle notatin.
<p>
<XMP>
    @files = glob("$dir/*.[ch]");
    @files = glob($files[$i]);

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_constant_0">
Constant Folding</A>
</H2>
Like C, Perl does a certain amount of expression evaluation at
compile time, whenever it determines that all of the arguments to an
operator are static and have no side effects.  In particular, string
concatenation happens at compile time between literals that don't do
variable substitution.  Backslash interpretation also happens at
compile time.  You can say
<p>
<XMP>
    'Now is the time for all' . "\n" .
        'good men to come to.'

</XMP>
<p>and this all reduces to one string internally.  Likewise, if 
you say
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $file (@filenames) {
        if (-s $file > 5 + 100 * 2**16) { ... }
    } 

</XMP>
<p>the compiler will pre-compute the number that
expression represents so that the interpreter
won't have to.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlop_integer_0">
Integer arithmetic</A>
</H2>
By default Perl assumes that it must do most of its arithmetic in
floating point.  But by saying
<p>
<XMP>
    use integer;

</XMP>
<p>you may tell the compiler that it's okay to use integer operations
from here to the end of the enclosing BLOCK.  An inner BLOCK may
countermand this by saying 
<p>
<XMP>
    no integer;

</XMP>
<p>which lasts until the end of that BLOCK.

<A NAME="perlrun_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Upon startup, Perl looks for your script in one of the following
places:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Specified line by line via 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_e_0">-e</A>
 switches on the command line.
<p>
<LI>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.
(Note that systems supporting the #! notation invoke interpreters this way.)
<p>
<LI>Passed in implicitly via standard input.  This only works if there are
no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN script you
must explicitly specify a ``-'' for the script name.
<p>
</OL>
With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the.beginning, unless you've specified a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_x_0">-x</A>
 switch, in which case it
scans for the first line starting with #! and containing the word
``perl'', and starts there instead.  This is useful for running a script
embedded in a larger message.  (In this case you would indicate the end
of the script using the __END__ token.)
<p>As of Perl 5, the #! line is always examined for switches as the line is
being parsed.  Thus, if you're on a machine that only allows one argument
with the #! line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the #! line, you still
can get consistent switch behavior regardless of how Perl was invoked,
even if 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_x_0">-x</A>
 was used to find the beginning of the script.
<p>Because many operating systems silently chop off kernel interpretation of
the #! line after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the
command line, and some may not; you could even get a ``-'' without its
letter, if you're not careful.  You probably want to make sure that all
your switches fall either before or after that 32 character boundary.
Most switches don't actually care if they're processed redundantly, but
getting a - instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to
execute standard input instead of your script.  And a partial 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_i_1">-I</A>
 switch
could also cause odd results.
<p>Parsing of the #! switches starts wherever ``perl'' is mentioned in the line.
The sequences ``-*'' and ``- '' are specifically ignored so that you could,
if you were so inclined, say
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*- -p
    eval 'exec perl $0 -S ${1+"$@"}'
        if 0;

</XMP>
<p>to let Perl see the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_p_0">-p</A>
 switch.
<p>If the #! line does not contain the word ``perl'', the program named after
the #! is executed instead of the Perl interpreter.  This is slightly
bizarre, but it helps people on machines that don't do #!, because they
can tell a program that their SHELL is /usr/bin/perl, and Perl will then
dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.
<p>After locating your script, Perl compiles the entire script to an
internal form.  If there are any compilation errors, execution of the
script is not attempted.  (This is unlike the typical shell script,
which might run partway through before finding a syntax error.)
<p>If the script is syntactically correct, it is executed.  If the script
runs off the end without hitting an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exit_0">exit()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 operator, an implicit

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exit_0">exit(0)</A>
 is provided to indicate successful completion.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlrun_switches_0">
Switches</A>
</H2>
A single-character switch may be combined with the following switch, if
any.
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.bak    # same as -s -p -i.bak

</XMP>
<p>Switches include:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>
<STRONG>-0</STRONG>[<EM>digits</EM>]
</STRONG>
<DD>
specifies the record separator (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__7">$/</A>
) as an octal number.  If there are
no digits, the null character is the separator.  Other switches may
precede or follow the digits.  For example, if you have a version of
<STRONG>find</STRONG> which can print filenames terminated by the null character, you
can say this:
<p>
<XMP>
    find . -name '*.bak' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink

</XMP>
<p>The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode.
The value 0777 will cause Perl to slurp files whole since there is no
legal character with that value.

of the old file to make a backup copy.  If no extension is supplied, no
backup is made.  From the shell, saying
<p>
<XMP>
    $ perl -p -i.bak -e "s/foo/bar/; ... "

the selected filehandle.  Note that STDOUT is restored as the

<p>You can use

makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to search for the
script (unless the name of the script starts with a slash).  Typically
this is used to emulate #! startup on machines that don't support #!,
in the following manner:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    eval "exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 $*"
            if $running_under_some_shell;

</XMP>
<p>The system ignores the first line and feeds the script to /bin/sh,
which proceeds to try to execute the Perl script as a shell script.
The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus
starts up the Perl interpreter.  On some systems 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__28">$0</A>
 doesn't always
contain the full pathname, so the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_s_1">-S</A>
 tells Perl to search for the
script if necessary.  After Perl locates the script, it parses the
lines and ignores them because the variable <STRONG>$running_under_some_shell</STRONG>
is never true.  A better construct than 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__5">$*</A>
 would be <CODE><STRONG>${</STRONG>1+``$@''}</CODE>, which
handles embedded spaces and such in the filenames, but doesn't work if
the script is being interpreted by csh.  In order to start up sh rather
than csh, some systems may have to replace the #! line with a line
containing just a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl.  Other
systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct that
will work under any of csh, sh or Perl, such as the following:
<p>
<XMP>
        eval '(exit $?0)' && eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
        & eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 $argv:q'

some disk space (which you can minimize by stripping the executable).
(Still, a ``hello world'' executable comes out to about 200K on my

use the

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
First of all, you need to understand what references are in Perl.  See

<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
 for that.  
<p>Here are three very simple definitions that you should find reassuring.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>An object is simply a reference that happens to know which class it
belongs to.
<p>
<LI>A class is simply a package that happens to provide methods to deal
with object references.
<p>
<LI>A method is simply a subroutine that expects an object reference (or
a package name, for static methods) as the first argument.
<p>
</OL>
We'll cover these points now in more depth..
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_an_0">
An Object is Simply a Reference</A>
</H2>
Unlike say C++, Perl doesn't provide any special syntax for
constructors.  A constructor is merely a subroutine that returns a
reference to something ``blessed'' into a class, generally the
class that the subroutine is defined in.  Here is a typical
constructor:
<p>
<XMP>
    package Critter;
    sub new { bless {} }

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>{}</CODE> constructs a reference to an anonymous hash containing no 
key/value pairs.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bless_1">bless()</A>
 takes that reference and tells the object
it references that it's now a Critter, and returns the reference.
This is for convenience, since the referenced object itself knows that
it has been blessed, and its reference to it could have been returned 
directly, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub new {
        my $self = {};
        bless $self;
        return $self;
    }

</XMP>
<p>In fact, you often see such a thing in more complicated constructors
that wish to call methods in the class as part of the construction:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub new {
        my $self = {}
        bless $self;
        $self->initialize();
        return $self;
    }

</XMP>
<p>If you care about inheritance (and you should; see L<perlmod/"Modules:
Creation, Use and Abuse">), then you want to use the two-arg form of bless
so that your constructors may be inherited:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my $self = {};
        bless $self, $class
        $self->initialize();
        return $self;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Or if you expect people to call not just <CODE>CLASS-&gt;<EM>new()</EM></CODE> but also
<CODE><STRONG>$obj</STRONG>-&gt;<EM>new()</EM></CODE>, then use something like this.  The <EM>initialize()</EM>
method used will be of whatever <STRONG>$class</STRONG> we blessed the 
object into:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub new {
        my $this = shift;
        my $class = ref($this) || $this;
        my $self = {};
        bless $self, $class
        $self->initialize();
        return $self;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Within the class package, the methods will typically deal with the
reference as an ordinary reference.  Outside the class package,
the reference is generally treated as an opaque value that may
only be accessed through the class's methods.
<p>A constructor may re-bless a referenced object currently belonging to
another class, but then the new class is responsible for all cleanup
later.  The previous blessing is forgotten, as an object may only
belong to one class at a time.  (Although of course it's free to 
inherit methods from many classes.)
<p>A clarification:  Perl objects are blessed.  References are not.  Objects
know which package they belong to.  References do not.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bless_1">bless()</A>

function simply uses the reference in order to find the object.  Consider
the following example:
<p>
<XMP>
    $a = {};
    $b = $a;
    bless $a, BLAH;
    print "\$b is a ", ref($b), "\n";

</XMP>
<p>This reports <STRONG>$b</STRONG> as being a BLAH, so obviously 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bless_1">bless()</A>
 
operated on the object and not on the reference.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_a_0">
A Class is Simply a Package</A>
</H2>
Unlike say C++, Perl doesn't provide any special syntax for class
definitions.  You just use a package as a class by putting method
definitions into the class.
<p>There is a special array within each package called <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> which says
where else to look for a method if you can't find it in the current
package.  This is how Perl implements inheritance.  Each element of the
<STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> array is just the name of another package that happens to be a
class package.  The classes are searched (depth first) for missing
methods in the order that they occur in <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG>.  The classes accessible
through <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> are known as base classes of the current class. 
<p>If a missing method is found in one of the base classes, it is cached
in the current class for efficiency.  Changing <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> or defining new
subroutines invalidates the cache and causes Perl to do the lookup again.
<p>If a method isn't found, but an AUTOLOAD routine is found, then
that is called on behalf of the missing method.
<p>If neither a method nor an AUTOLOAD routine is found in <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG>, then one
last try is made for the method (or an AUTOLOAD routine) in a class
called UNIVERSAL.  If that doesn't work, Perl finally gives up and
complains.
<p>Perl classes only do method inheritance.  Data inheritance is left
up to the class itself.  By and large, this is not a problem in Perl,
because most classes model the attributes of their object using
an anonymous hash, which serves as its own little namespace to be
carved up by the various classes that might want to do something
with the object.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_a_1">
A Method is Simply a Subroutine</A>
</H2>
Unlike say C++, Perl doesn't provide any special syntax for method
definition.  (It does provide a little syntax for method invocation
though.  More on that later.)  A method expects its first argument
to be the object or package it is being invoked on.  There are just two
types of methods, which we'll call static and virtual, in honor of
the two C++ method types they most closely resemble.
<p>A static method expects a class name as the first argument.  It
provides functionality for the class as a whole, not for any individual
object belonging to the class.  Constructors are typically static
methods.  Many static methods simply ignore their first argument, since
they already know what package they're in, and don't care what package
they were invoked via.  (These aren't necessarily the same, since
static methods follow the inheritance tree just like ordinary virtual
methods.)  Another typical use for static methods is to look up an
object by name:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub find {
        my ($class, $name) = @_;
        $objtable{$name};
    }

</XMP>
<p>A virtual method expects an object reference as its first argument.
Typically it shifts the first argument into a ``self'' or ``this'' variable,
and then uses that as an ordinary reference.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub display {
        my $self = shift;
        my @keys = @_ ? @_ : sort keys %$self;
        foreach $key (@keys) {
            print "\t$key => $self->{$key}\n";
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_method_0">
Method Invocation</A>
</H2>
There are two ways to invoke a method, one of which you're already
familiar with, and the other of which will look familiar.  Perl 4
already had an ``indirect object'' syntax that you use when you say
<p>
<XMP>
    print STDERR "help!!!\n";

</XMP>
<p>This same syntax can be used to call either static or virtual methods.
We'll use the two methods defined above, the static method to lookup
an object reference and the virtual method to print out its attributes.
<p>
<XMP>
    $fred = find Critter "Fred";
    display $fred 'Height', 'Weight';

</XMP>
<p>These could be combined into one statement by using a BLOCK in the
indirect object slot:
<p>
<XMP>
    display {find Critter "Fred"} 'Height', 'Weight';

</XMP>
<p>For C++ fans, there's also a syntax using -&gt; notation that does exactly
the same thing.  The parentheses are required if there are any arguments.
<p>
<XMP>
    $fred = Critter->find("Fred");
    $fred->display('Height', 'Weight');

</XMP>
<p>or in one statement,
<p>
<XMP>
    Critter->find("Fred")->display('Height', 'Weight');

</XMP>
<p>There are times when one syntax is more readable, and times when the
other syntax is more readable.  The indirect object syntax is less
cluttered, but it has the same ambiguity as ordinary list operators.
Indirect object method calls are parsed using the same rule as list
operators: ``If it looks like a function, it is a function''.  (Presuming
for the moment that you think two words in a row can look like a
function name.  C++ programmers seem to think so with some regularity,
especially when the first word is ``new''.)  Thus, the parens of
<p>
<XMP>
    new Critter ('Barney', 1.5, 70)

</XMP>
<p>are assumed to surround ALL the arguments of the method call, regardless
of what comes after.  Saying
<p>
<XMP>
    new Critter ('Bam' x 2), 1.4, 45

</XMP>
<p>would be equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    Critter->new('Bam' x 2), 1.4, 45

</XMP>
<p>which is unlikely to do what you want.
<p>There are times when you wish to specify which class's method to use.
In this case, you can call your method as an ordinary subroutine
call, being sure to pass the requisite first argument explicitly:
<p>
<XMP>
    $fred =  MyCritter::find("Critter", "Fred");
    MyCritter::display($fred, 'Height', 'Weight');

</XMP>
<p>Note however, that this does not do any inheritance.  If you merely
wish to specify that Perl should <EM>START</EM> looking for a method in a
particular package, use an ordinary method call, but qualify the method
name with the package like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $fred = Critter->MyCritter::find("Fred");
    $fred->MyCritter::display('Height', 'Weight');

</XMP>
<p>If you're trying to control where the method search begins <EM>and</EM> you're
executing in the class itself, then you may use the SUPER pseudoclass,
which says to start looking in your base class's <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> list without having
to explicitly name it:
<p>
<XMP>
    $self->SUPER::display('Height', 'Weight');

</XMP>
<p>Please note that the <CODE>SUPER::</CODE> construct is <EM>only</EM> meaningful within the
class.
<p>Sometimes you want to call a method when you don't know the method name
ahead of time.  You can use the arrow form, replacing the method name
with a simple scalar variable containing the method name:
<p>
<XMP>
    $method = $fast ? "findfirst" : "findbest";
    $fred->$method(@args);

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_destructors_0">
Destructors</A>
</H2>
When the last reference to an object goes away, the object is
automatically destroyed.  (This may even be after you exit, if you've
stored references in global variables.)  If you want to capture control
just before the object is freed, you may define a DESTROY method in
your class.  It will automatically be called at the appropriate moment,
and you can do any extra cleanup you need to do.
<p>Perl doesn't do nested destruction for you.  If your constructor
reblessed a reference from one of your base classes, your DESTROY may
need to call DESTROY for any base classes that need it.  But this only
applies to reblessed objects--an object reference that is merely
<EM>CONTAINED</EM> in the current object will be freed and destroyed
automatically when the current object is freed.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_warning_0">
WARNING</A>
</H2>
An indirect object is limited to a name, a scalar variable, or a block,
because it would have to do too much lookahead otherwise, just like any
other postfix dereference in the language.  The left side of -&gt; is not so
limited, because it's an infix operator, not a postfix operator.  
<p>That means that below, A and B are equivalent to each other, and C and D
are equivalent, but AB and CD are different:
<p>
<XMP>
    A: method $obref->{"fieldname"} 
    B: (method $obref)->{"fieldname"}
    C: $obref->{"fieldname"}->method() 
    D: method {$obref->{"fieldname"}}

That's about all there is to it.  Now you just need to go off and buy a

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlobj_two_phased_0">
Two-Phased Garbage Collection</A>
</H2>
For most purposes, Perl uses a fast and simple reference-based
garbage collection system.  For this reason, there's an extra
dereference going on at some level, so if you haven't built
your Perl executable using your C compiler's <CODE>-O</CODE> flag, performance
will suffer.  If you <EM>have</EM> built Perl with <CODE>cc -O</CODE>, then this
probably won't matter.
<p>A more serious concern is that unreachable memory with a non-zero
reference count will not normally get freed.  Therefore, this is a bad
idea:  
<p>
<XMP>
    {
        my $a;
        $a = \$a;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Even thought <STRONG>$a</STRONG> <EM>should</EM> go away, it can't.  When building recursive data
structures, you'll have to break the self-reference yourself explicitly
if you don't care to leak.  For example, here's a self-referential
node such as one might use in a sophisticated tree structure:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub new_node {
        my $self = shift;
        my $class = ref($self) || $self;
        my $node = {};
        $node->{LEFT} = $node->{RIGHT} = $node;
        $node->{DATA} = [ @_ ];
        return bless $node => $class;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>If you create nodes like that, they (currently) won't go away unless you
break their self reference yourself.  (In other words, this is not to be
construed as a feature, and you shouldn't depend on it.)
<p>Almost.
<p>When an interpreter thread finally shuts down (usually when your program
exits), then a rather costly but complete mark-and-sweep style of garbage
collection is performed, and everything allocated by that thread gets
destroyed.  This is essential to support Perl as an embedded or a
multithreadable language.  For example, this program demonstrates Perl's
two-phased garbage collection:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl 
    package Subtle;
    sub new {
        my $test;
        $test = \$test;
        warn "CREATING " . \$test;
        return bless \$test;
    } 
    sub DESTROY {
        my $self = shift;
        warn "DESTROYING $self";
    } 
    package main;
    warn "starting program";
    {
        my $a = Subtle->new;
        my $b = Subtle->new;
        $$a = 0;  # break selfref
        warn "leaving block";
    } 
    warn "just exited block";
    warn "time to die...";
    exit;

</XMP>
<p>When run as <EM>/tmp/test</EM>, the following output is produced:
<p>
<XMP>
    starting program at /tmp/test line 18.
    CREATING SCALAR(0x8e5b8) at /tmp/test line 7.
    CREATING SCALAR(0x8e57c) at /tmp/test line 7.
    leaving block at /tmp/test line 23.
    DESTROYING Subtle=SCALAR(0x8e5b8) at /tmp/test line 13.
    just exited block at /tmp/test line 26.
    time to die... at /tmp/test line 27.
    DESTROYING Subtle=SCALAR(0x8e57c) during global destruction.

</XMP>
<p>Notice that ``global destruction'' bit there?  That's the thread
garbage collector reaching the unreachable.  
<p>Objects are always destructed, even when regular refs aren't and in fact
are destructed in a separate pass before ordinary refs just to try to
prevent object destructors from using refs that have been themselves
destructed.  Plain refs are only garbage collected if the destruct level
is greater than 0.  You can test the higher levels of global destruction
by setting the PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable, presuming
<CODE>-DDEBUGGING</CODE> was enabled during perl build time.
<p>A more complete garbage collection strategy will be implemented
at a future date.

SYNOPSIS</A>
</H1>
To declare subroutines:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub NAME;             # A "forward" declaration.
    sub NAME(PROTO);      #  ditto, but with prototypes
    sub NAME BLOCK        # A declaration and a definition.
    sub NAME(PROTO) BLOCK #  ditto, but with prototypes

<XMP>
    $subref = sub BLOCK;

</XMP>
<p>To import subroutines:
<p>
<XMP>
    use PACKAGE qw(NAME1 NAME2 NAME3);

</XMP>
<p>To call subroutines:
<p>
<XMP>
    NAME(LIST);    # & is optional with parens.
    NAME LIST;     # Parens optional if predeclared/imported.
    &NAME;         # Passes current @_ to subroutine.

</XMP>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlsub_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Like many languages, Perl provides for user-defined subroutines.  These
may be located anywhere in the main program, loaded in from other files
via the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>
, or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 keywords, or even generated on the
fly using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval</A>
 or anonymous subroutines (closures).  You can even call
a function indirectly using a variable containing its name or a CODE reference
to it, as in <CODE><STRONG>$var</STRONG> = \&amp;function</CODE>.
<p>The Perl model for function call and return values is simple: all
functions are passed as parameters one single flat list of scalars, and
all functions likewise return to their caller one single flat list of
scalars.  Any arrays or hashes in these call and return lists will
collapse, losing their identities--but you may always use
pass-by-reference instead to avoid this.  Both call and return lists may
contain as many or as few scalar elements as you'd like.  (Often a
function without an explicit return statement is called a subroutine, but
there's really no difference from the language's perspective.)
<p>Any arguments passed to the routine come in as the array <STRONG>@_</STRONG>.  Thus if you
called a function with two arguments, those would be stored in <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
[0]</CODE>
and <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
[1]</CODE>.  The array <STRONG>@_</STRONG> is a local array, but its values are implicit
references (predating 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
) to the actual scalar parameters.  The
return value of the subroutine is the value of the last expression
evaluated.  Alternatively, a return statement may be used to specify the
returned value and exit the subroutine.  If you return one or more arrays
and/or hashes, these will be flattened together into one large
indistinguishable list.
<p>Perl does not have named formal parameters, but in practice all you do is
assign to a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 list of these.  Any variables you use in the function
that aren't declared private are global variables.  For the gory details
on creating private variables, see the sections below on L<"Private
Variables via 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
``&gt; and <EM>''Temporary Values via 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
"</EM>.  To create
protected environments for a set of functions in a separate package (and
probably a separate file), see <EM>``Packages''</EM>.
<p>Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub max {
        my $max = shift(@_);
        foreach $foo (@_) {
            $max = $foo if $max < $foo;
        }
        return $max;
    }
    $bestday = max($mon,$tue,$wed,$thu,$fri);

</XMP>
<p>Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    # get a line, combining continuation lines
    #  that start with whitespace
    sub get_line {
        $thisline = $lookahead;  # GLOBAL VARIABLES!!
        LINE: while ($lookahead = <STDIN>) {
            if ($lookahead =~ /^[ \t]/) {
                $thisline .= $lookahead;
            }
            else {
                last LINE;
            }
        }
        $thisline;
    }
    $lookahead = <STDIN>;       # get first line
    while ($_ = get_line()) {
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>Use array assignment to a local list to name your formal arguments:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub maybeset {
        my($key, $value) = @_;
        $Foo{$key} = $value unless $Foo{$key};
    }

</XMP>
<p>This also has the effect of turning call-by-reference into call-by-value,
since the assignment copies the values.  Otherwise a function is free to
do in-place modifications of <STRONG>@_</STRONG> and change its callers values.
<p>
<XMP>
    upcase_in($v1, $v2);  # this changes $v1 and $v2
    sub upcase_in {
        for (@_) { tr/a-z/A-Z/ } 
    } 

</XMP>
<p>You aren't allowed to modify constants in this way, of course.  If an
argument were actually literal and you tried to change it, you'd take a
(presumably fatal) exception.   For example, this won't work:
<p>
<XMP>
    upcase_in("frederick");

</XMP>
<p>It would be much safer if the <EM>upcase_in()</EM> function 
were written to return a copy of its parameters instead
of changing them in place:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($v3, $v4) = upcase($v1, $v2);  # this doesn't
    sub upcase {
        my @parms = @_;
        for (@parms) { tr/a-z/A-Z/ } 
        # wantarray checks if we were called in list context
        return wantarray ? @parms : $parms[0];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Notice how this (unprototyped) function doesn't care whether it was passed
real scalars or arrays.  Perl will see everything as one big long flat <STRONG>@_</STRONG>
parameter list.  This is one of the ways where Perl's simple
argument-passing style shines.  The <EM>upcase()</EM> function would work perfectly
well without changing the <EM>upcase()</EM> definition even if we fed it things
like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    @newlist   = upcase(@list1, @list2);
    @newlist   = upcase( split /:/, $var );

</XMP>
<p>Do not, however, be tempted to do this:
<p>
<XMP>
    (@a, @b)   = upcase(@list1, @list2);

</XMP>
<p>Because like its flat incoming parameter list, the return list is also
flat.  So all you have managed to do here is stored everything in <STRONG>@a</STRONG> and
made <STRONG>@b</STRONG> an empty list.  See <EM>``Pass by Reference''</EM> for alternatives.
<p>A subroutine may be called using the ``&amp;'' prefix.  The ``&amp;'' is optional in
Perl 5, and so are the parens if the subroutine has been predeclared.
(Note, however, that the ``&amp;'' is <EM>NOT</EM> optional when you're just naming
the subroutine, such as when it's used as an argument to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
 or

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>
.  Nor is it optional when you want to do an indirect subroutine
call with a subroutine name or reference using the <CODE>&amp;
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__24">$<</A>
EM>subref()</EM></CODE> or
<CODE>&amp;{<STRONG>$subref</STRONG>}()</CODE> constructs.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
 for more on that.)
<p>Subroutines may be called recursively.  If a subroutine is called using
the ``&amp;'' form, the argument list is optional, and if omitted, no <STRONG>@_</STRONG> array is
set up for the subroutine: the <STRONG>@_</STRONG> array at the time of the call is
visible to subroutine instead.  This is an efficiency mechanism that
new users may wish to avoid.
<p>
<XMP>
    &foo(1,2,3);        # pass three arguments
    foo(1,2,3);         # the same
    foo();              # pass a null list
    &foo();             # the same
    &foo;               # foo() get current args, like foo(@_) !!
    foo;                # like foo() IFF sub foo pre-declared, else "foo"

</XMP>
<p>Not only does the ``&amp;'' form make the argument list optional, but it also
disables any prototype checking on the arguments you do provide.  This
is partly for historical reasons, and partly for having a convenient way
to cheat if you know what you're doing.  See the section on Prototypes below.
<p>
<H2> Private Variables via 
<A NAME="perlfunc_my_0">
my()</A>
</H2>
Synopsis:
<p>
<XMP>
    my $foo;            # declare $foo lexically local
    my (@wid, %get);    # declare list of variables local
    my $foo = "flurp";  # declare $foo lexical, and init it
    my @oof = @bar;     # declare @oof lexical, and init it

</XMP>
<p>A ``my'' declares the listed variables to be confined (lexically) to the
enclosing block, subroutine, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval</A>
, or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do/require/use</A>
'd file.  If
more than one value is listed, the list must be placed in parens.  All
listed elements must be legal lvalues.  Only alphanumeric identifiers may
be lexically scoped--magical builtins like $/ must currently be localized with
``local'' instead.  
<p>Unlike dynamic variables created by the ``local'' statement, lexical
variables declared with ``my'' are totally hidden from the outside world,
including any called subroutines (even if it's the same subroutine called
from itself or elsewhere--every call gets its own copy).
<p>(An 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, however, can see the lexical variables of the scope it is
being evaluated in so long as the names aren't hidden by declarations within
the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
 itself.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
.)
<p>The parameter list to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 may be assigned to if desired, which allows you
to initialize your variables.  (If no initializer is given for a
particular variable, it is created with the undefined value.)  Commonly
this is used to name the parameters to a subroutine.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    $arg = "fred";        # "global" variable
    $n = cube_root(27);
    print "$arg thinks the root is $n\n";
 fred thinks the root is 3
    sub cube_root {
        my $arg = shift;  # name doesn't matter
        $arg **= 1/3;
        return $arg;
    }                   

</XMP>
<p>The ``my'' is simply a modifier on something you might assign to.  So when
you do assign to the variables in its argument list, the ``my'' doesn't
change whether those variables is viewed as a scalar or an array.  So
<p>
<XMP>
    my ($foo) = <STDIN>;
    my @FOO = <STDIN>;

</XMP>
<p>both supply a list context to the righthand side, while
<p>
<XMP>
    my $foo = <STDIN>;

</XMP>
<p>supplies a scalar context.  But the following only declares one variable:
<p>
<XMP>
    my $foo, $bar = 1;

</XMP>
<p>That has the same effect as
<p>
<XMP>
    my $foo;
    $bar = 1;

</XMP>
<p>The declared variable is not introduced (is not visible) until after
the current statement.  Thus,
<p>
<XMP>
    my $x = $x;

</XMP>
<p>can be used to initialize the new <STRONG>$x</STRONG> with the value of the old <STRONG>$x</STRONG>, and 
the expression
<p>
<XMP>
    my $x = 123 and $x == 123

</XMP>
<p>is false unless the old <STRONG>$x</STRONG> happened to have the value 123.
<p>Some users may wish to encourage the use of lexically scoped variables.
As an aid to catching implicit references to package variables,
if you say
<p>
<XMP>
    use strict 'vars';

</XMP>
<p>then any variable reference from there to the end of the enclosing
block must either refer to a lexical variable, or must be fully
qualified with the package name.  A compilation error results
otherwise.  An inner block may countermand this with <STRONG>``no strict 'vars'''</STRONG>.
<p>A 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 has both a compile-time and a run-time effect.  At compile time,
the compiler takes notice of it; the principle usefulness of this is to
quiet 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict 'vars'</A>
.  The actual initialization doesn't happen
until run time, so gets executed every time through a loop.
<p>Variables declared with ``my'' are not part of any package and are therefore
never fully qualified with the package name.  In particular, you're not
allowed to try to make a package variable (or other global) lexical:
<p>
<XMP>
    my $pack::var;      # ERROR!  Illegal syntax
    my $_;              # also illegal (currently)

</XMP>
<p>In fact, a dynamic variable (also known as package or global variables)
are still accessible using the fully qualified :: notation even while a
lexical of the same name is also visible:
<p>
<XMP>
    package main;
    local $x = 10;
    my    $x = 20;
    print "$x and $::x\n";

</XMP>
<p>That will print out 20 and 10.
<p>You may declare ``my'' variables at the outer most scope of a file to
totally hide any such identifiers from the outside world.  This is similar
to a C's static variables at the file level.  To do this with a subroutine
requires the use of a closure (anonymous function).  If a block (such as
an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, function, or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_package_0">package</A>
) wants to create a private subroutine
that cannot be called from outside that block, it can declare a lexical
variable containing an anonymous sub reference:
<p>
<XMP>
    my $secret_version = '1.001-beta';
    my $secret_sub = sub { print $secret_version };
    &$secret_sub();

</XMP>
<p>As long as the reference is never returned by any function within the
module, no outside module can see the subroutine, since its name is not in
any package's symbol table.  Remember that it's not <EM>REALLY</EM> called
<STRONG>$some_pack::secret_version</STRONG> or anything; it's just <STRONG>$secret_version</STRONG>,
unqualified and unqualifiable.
<p>This does not work with object methods, however; all object methods have
to be in the symbol table of some package to be found.
<p>Just because the lexical variable is lexically (also called statically)
scoped doesn't mean that within a function it works like a C static.  It
normally works more like a C auto.  But here's a mechanism for giving a
function private variables with both lexical scoping and a static
lifetime.  If you do want to create something like C's static variables,
just enclose the whole function in an extra block, and put the
static variable outside the function but in the block.
<p>
<XMP>
    {
        my $secret_val = 0; 
        sub gimme_another {
            return ++$secret_val;
        } 
    } 
    # $secret_val now becomes unreachable by the outside
    # world, but retains its value between calls to gimme_another

</XMP>
<p>If this function is being sourced in from a separate file 
via 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
, then this is probably just fine.  If it's
all in the main program, you'll need to arrange for the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 
to be executed early, either by putting the whole block above
your pain program, or more likely, merely placing a BEGIN 
sub around it to make sure it gets executed before your program
starts to run:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub BEGIN {
        my $secret_val = 0; 
        sub gimme_another {
            return ++$secret_val;
        } 
    }

 about the BEGIN function.
<p>
<H2> Temporary Values via 
<A NAME="perlfunc_local_0">
local()</A>
</H2>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: In general, you should be using ``my'' instead of ``local'', because
it's faster and safer.  Execeptions to this include the global punctuation
variables, filehandles and formats, and direct manipulation of the Perl
symbol table itself.  Format variables often use ``local'' though, as do
other variables whose current value must be visible to called
subroutines.
<p>Synopsis:
<p>
<XMP>
    local $foo;                 # declare $foo dynamically local
    local (@wid, %get);         # declare list of variables local
    local $foo = "flurp";       # declare $foo dynamic, and init it
    local @oof = @bar;          # declare @oof dynamic, and init it
    local *FH;                  # localize $FH, @FH, %FH, &FH  ...
    local *merlyn = *randal;    # now $merlyn is really $randal, plus
                                #     @merlyn is really @randal, etc
    local *merlyn = 'randal';   # SAME THING: promote 'randal' to *randal
    local *merlyn = \$randal;   # just alias $merlyn, not @merlyn etc 

</XMP>
<p>A 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 modifies its listed variables to be local to the enclosing
block, (or subroutine, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval{}</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do</A>
) and I<the any called from
within that block&gt;.  A 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 just gives temporary values to global
(meaning package) variables.  This is known as dynamic scoping.  Lexical
scoping is done with ``my'', which works more like C's auto declarations.
<p>If more than one variable is given to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
, they must be placed in
parens.  All listed elements must be legal lvalues.  This operator works
by saving the current values of those variables in its argument list on a
hidden stack and restoring them upon exiting the block, subroutine or
eval.  This means that called subroutines can also reference the local
variable, but not the global one.  The argument list may be assigned to if
desired, which allows you to initialize your local variables.  (If no
initializer is given for a particular variable, it is created with an
undefined value.)  Commonly this is used to name the parameters to a
subroutine.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 0 .. 9 ) {
        $digits{$i} = $i;
    } 
    # assume this function uses global %digits hash
    parse_num();  
    # now temporarily add to %digits hash
    if ($base12) {
        # (NOTE: not claiming this is efficient!)
        local %digits  = (%digits, 't' => 10, 'e' => 11);
        parse_num();  # parse_num gets this new %digits!
    }
    # old %digits restored here

</XMP>
<p>Because 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 is a run-time command, and so gets executed every time
through a loop.  In releases of Perl previous to 5.0, this used more stack
storage each time until the loop was exited.  Perl now reclaims the space
each time through, but it's still more efficient to declare your variables
outside the loop.
<p>A local is simply a modifier on an lvalue expression.  When you assign to
a localized variable, the local doesn't change whether its list is viewed
as a scalar or an array.  So
<p>
<XMP>
    local($foo) = <STDIN>;
    local @FOO = <STDIN>;

</XMP>
<p>both supply a list context to the righthand side, while
<p>
<XMP>
    local $foo = <STDIN>;

</XMP>
<p>supplies a scalar context.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsub_passing_0">
Passing Symbol Table Entries (typeglobs)</A>
</H2>
[Note:  The mechanism described in this section was originally the only
way to simulate pass-by-reference in older versions of Perl.  While it
still works fine in modern versions, the new reference mechanism is
generally easier to work with.  See below.]
<p>Sometimes you don't want to pass the value of an array to a subroutine
but rather the name of it, so that the subroutine can modify the global
copy of it rather than working with a local copy.  In perl you can
refer to all objects of a particular name by prefixing the name
with a star: <CODE>*foo</CODE>.  This is often known as a ``type glob'', since the
star on the front can be thought of as a wildcard match for all the
funny prefix characters on variables and subroutines and such.
<p>When evaluated, the type glob produces a scalar value that represents
all the objects of that name, including any filehandle, format or
subroutine.  When assigned to, it causes the name mentioned to refer to
whatever ``*'' value was assigned to it.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub doubleary {
        local(*someary) = @_;
        foreach $elem (@someary) {
            $elem *= 2;
        }
    }
    doubleary(*foo);
    doubleary(*bar);

</XMP>
<p>Note that scalars are already passed by reference, so you can modify
scalar arguments without using this mechanism by referring explicitly
to 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
[0] etc.  You can modify all the elements of an array by passing
all the elements as scalars, but you have to use the * mechanism (or
the equivalent reference mechanism) to push, pop or change the size of
an array.  It will certainly be faster to pass the typeglob (or reference).
<p>Even if you don't want to modify an array, this mechanism is useful for
passing multiple arrays in a single LIST, since normally the LIST
mechanism will merge all the array values so that you can't extract out
the individual arrays.  For more on typeglobs, see <EM>``Typeglobs''</EM>.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsub_pass_0">
Pass by Reference</A>
</H2>
If you want to pass more than one array or hash into a function--or 
return them from it--and have them maintain their integrity,
then you're going to have to use an explicit pass-by-reference.
Before you do that, you need to understand references as detailed in 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
.
This section may not make much sense to you otherwise.
<p>Here are a few simple examples.  First, let's pass in several
arrays to a function and have it pop all of then, return a new
list of all their former last elements:
<p>
<XMP>
    @tailings = popmany ( \@a, \@b, \@c, \@d );
    sub popmany {
        my $aref;
        my @retlist = ();
        foreach $aref ( @_ ) {
            push @retlist, pop @$aref;
        } 
        return @retlist;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Here's how you might write a function that returns a 
list of keys occurring in all the hashes passed to it:
<p>
<XMP>
    @common = inter( \%foo, \%bar, \%joe ); 
    sub inter {
        my ($k, $href, %seen); # locals
        foreach $href (@_) {
            while ( $k = each %$href ) {
                $seen{$k}++;
            } 
        } 
        return grep { $seen{$_} == @_ } keys %seen;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>So far, we're just using the normal list return mechanism.
What happens if you want to pass or return a hash?  Well, 
if you're only using one of them, or you don't mind them 
concatenating, then the normal calling convention is ok, although
a little expensive.  
<p>Where people get into trouble is here:
<p>
<XMP>
    (@a, @b) = func(@c, @d);
or
    (%a, %b) = func(%c, %d);

</XMP>
<p>That syntax simply won't work.  It just sets <STRONG>@a</STRONG> or <STRONG>%a</STRONG> and clears the <STRONG>@b</STRONG> or
<STRONG>%b</STRONG>.  Plus the function didn't get passed into two separate arrays or
hashes: it got one long list in <STRONG>@_</STRONG>, as always.
<p>If you can arrange for everyone to deal with this through references, it's
cleaner code, although not so nice to look at.  Here's a function that
takes two array references as arguments, returning the two array elements
in order of how many elements they have in them:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($aref, $bref) = func(\@c, \@d);
    print "@$aref has more than @$bref\n";
    sub func {
        my ($cref, $dref) = @_;
        if (@$cref > @$dref) {
            return ($cref, $dref);
        } else {
            return ($dref, $cref);
        } 
    } 

</XMP>
<p>It turns out that you can actually do this also:
<p>
<XMP>
    (*a, *b) = func(\@c, \@d);
    print "@a has more than @b\n";
    sub func {
        local (*c, *d) = @_;
        if (@c > @d) {
            return (\@c, \@d);
        } else {
            return (\@d, \@c);
        } 
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Here we're using the typeglobs to do symbol table aliasing.  It's
a tad subtle, though, and also won't work if you're using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>

variables, since only globals (well, and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
s) are in the symbol table.
<p>If you're passing around filehandles, you could usually just use the bare
typeglob, like *STDOUT, but typeglobs references would be better because
they'll still work properly under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict 'refs'</A>
.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    splutter(\*STDOUT);
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh "her um well a hmmm\n";
    }
    $rec = get_rec(\*STDIN);
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar <$fh>;
    }

</XMP>
<p>If you're planning on generating new filehandles, you could do this:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub openit {
        my $name = shift;
        local *FH;
        return open (FH, $path) ? \*FH : undef;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Although that will actually produce a small memory leak.  See the bottom
of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1"><EM>open</EM></A>
 for a somewhat cleaner way using the FileHandle
functions supplied with the POSIX package.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsub_prototypes_0">
Prototypes</A>
</H2>
As of the 5.002 release of perl, if you declare
<p>
<XMP>
    sub mypush (\@@)

</XMP>
<p>then <EM>mypush()</EM> takes arguments exactly like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push()</A>
 does.  The declaration
of the function to be called must be visible at compile time.  The prototype
only affects the interpretation of new-style calls to the function, where
new-style is defined as not using the <CODE>&amp;</CODE> character.  In other words,
if you call it like a builtin function, then it behaves like a builtin
function.  If you call it like an old-fashioned subroutine, then it
behaves like an old-fashioned subroutine.  It naturally falls out from
this rule that prototypes have no influence on subroutine references
like <CODE>\&amp;foo</CODE> or on indirect subroutine calls like <CODE>&amp;{<STRONG>$subref</STRONG>}</CODE>.
<p>Method calls are not influenced by prototypes either, because the
function to be called is indeterminate at compile time, since it depends
on inheritance.
<p>Since the intent is primarily to let you define subroutines that work
like builtin commands, here are the prototypes for some other functions
that parse almost exactly like the corresponding builtins.
<p>
<XMP>
    Declared as                 Called as
    sub mylink ($$)             mylink $old, $new
    sub myvec ($$$)             myvec $var, $offset, 1
    sub myindex ($$;$)          myindex &getstring, "substr"
    sub mysyswrite ($$$;$)      mysyswrite $buf, 0, length($buf) - $off, $off
    sub myreverse (@)           myreverse $a,$b,$c
    sub myjoin ($@)             myjoin ":",$a,$b,$c
    sub mypop (\@)              mypop @array
    sub mysplice (\@$$@)        mysplice @array,@array,0,@pushme
    sub mykeys (\%)             mykeys %{$hashref}
    sub myopen (*;$)            myopen HANDLE, $name
    sub mypipe (**)             mypipe READHANDLE, WRITEHANDLE
    sub mygrep (&@)             mygrep { /foo/ } $a,$b,$c
    sub myrand ($)              myrand 42
    sub mytime ()               mytime

</XMP>
<p>Any backslashed prototype character represents an actual argument
that absolutely must start with that character.  The value passed
to the subroutine (as part of <CODE><STRONG>@_</STRONG></CODE>) will be a reference to the
actual argument given in the subroutine call, obtained by applying
<CODE>\</CODE> to that argument.
<p>Unbackslashed prototype characters have special meanings.  Any
unbackslashed <STRONG>@ </STRONG>or <STRONG>% </STRONG>eats all the rest of the arguments, and forces
list context.  An argument represented by <STRONG>$ </STRONG>forces scalar context.  An
&amp; requires an anonymous subroutine, which, if passed as the first
argument, does not require the ``sub'' keyword or a subsequent comma.  A
* does whatever it has to do to turn the argument into a reference to a
symbol table entry.
<p>A semicolon separates mandatory arguments from optional arguments.
(It is redundant before <STRONG>@ </STRONG>or %.)
<p>Note how the last three examples above are treated specially by the parser.
<EM>mygrep()</EM> is parsed as a true list operator, <EM>myrand()</EM> is parsed as a
true unary operator with unary precedence the same as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_rand_0">rand()</A>
, and
<EM>mytime()</EM> is truly argumentless, just like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_time_0">time()</A>
.  That is, if you
say
<p>
<XMP>
    mytime +2;

</XMP>
<p>you'll get <EM>mytime()</EM> + 2, not mytime(2), which is how it would be parsed
without the prototype.
<p>The interesting thing about &amp; is that you can generate new syntax with it:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub try (&$) {
        my($try,$catch) = @_;
        eval { &$try };
        if ($@) {
            local $_ = $@;
            &$catch;
        }
    }
    sub catch (&) { @_ }
    try {
        die "phooey";
    } catch {
        /phooey/ and print "unphooey\n";
    };

</XMP>
<p>That prints ``unphooey''.  (Yes, there are still unresolved
issues having to do with the visibility of <STRONG>@_</STRONG>.  I'm ignoring that
question for the moment.  (But note that if we make <STRONG>@_</STRONG> lexically
scoped, those anonymous subroutines can act like closures... (Gee,
is this sounding a little Lispish?  (Nevermind.))))
<p>And here's a reimplementation of grep:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub mygrep (&@) {
        my $code = shift;
        my @result;
        foreach $_ (@_) {
            push(@result, $_) if &$code;
        }
        @result;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Some folks would prefer full alphanumeric prototypes.  Alphanumerics have
been intentionally left out of prototypes for the express purpose of
someday in the future adding named, formal parameters.  The current
mechanism's main goal is to let module writers provide better diagnostics
for module users.  Larry feels the notation quite understandable to Perl
programmers, and that it will not intrude greatly upon the meat of the
module, nor make it harder to read.  The line noise is visually
encapsulated into a small pill that's easy to swallow.
<p>It's probably best to prototype new functions, not retrofit prototyping
into older ones.  That's because you must be especially careful about
silent impositions of differing list versus scalar contexts.  For example,
if you decide that a function should take just one parameter, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub func ($) {
        my $n = shift;
        print "you gave me $n\n";
    } 

</XMP>
<p>and someone has been calling it with an array or expression
returning a list:
<p>
<XMP>
    func(@foo);
    func( split /:/ );

</XMP>
<p>Then you've just supplied an automatic 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_scalar_0">scalar()</A>
 in front of their
argument, which can be more than a bit surprising.  The old <STRONG>@foo</STRONG>
which used to hold one thing doesn't get passed in.  Instead,
the <EM>func()</EM> now gets passed in 1, that is, the number of elments
in <STRONG>@foo</STRONG>.  And the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split()</A>
 gets called in a scalar context and
starts scribbling on your <STRONG>@_</STRONG> parameter list.
<p>This is all very powerful, of course, and should only be used in moderation
to make the world a better place.  
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsub_overriding_0">
Overriding Builtin Functions</A>
</H2>
Many builtin functions may be overridden, though this should only be
tried occasionally and for good reason.  Typically this might be
done by a package attempting to emulate missing builtin functionality
on a non-Unix system.
<p>Overriding may only be done by importing the name from a
module--ordinary predeclaration isn't good enough.  However, the
<CODE>subs</CODE> pragma (compiler directive) lets you, in effect, predeclare subs
via the import syntax, and these names may then override the builtin ones:
<p>
<XMP>
    use subs 'chdir', 'chroot', 'chmod', 'chown';
    chdir $somewhere;
    sub chdir { ... }

</XMP>
<p>Library modules should not in general export builtin names like ``open''
or ``chdir'' as part of their default <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> list, since these may
sneak into someone else's namespace and change the semantics unexpectedly.
Instead, if the module adds the name to the <STRONG>@EXPORT_OK</STRONG> list, then it's
possible for a user to import the name explicitly, but not implicitly.
That is, they could say
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module 'open';

</XMP>
<p>and it would import the open override, but if they said
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module;

</XMP>
<p>they would get the default imports without the overrides.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsub_autoloading_0">
Autoloading</A>
</H2>
If you call a subroutine that is undefined, you would ordinarily get an
immediate fatal error complaining that the subroutine doesn't exist.
(Likewise for subroutines being used as methods, when the method
doesn't exist in any of the base classes of the class package.) If,
however, there is an <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> subroutine defined in the package or
packages that were searched for the original subroutine, then that
<CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> subroutine is called with the arguments that would have been
passed to the original subroutine.  The fully qualified name of the
original subroutine magically appears in the <STRONG>$AUTOLOAD</STRONG> variable in the
same package as the <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routine.  The name is not passed as an
ordinary argument because, er, well, just because, that's why...
<p>Most <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routines will load in a definition for the subroutine in
question using eval, and then execute that subroutine using a special
form of ``goto'' that erases the stack frame of the <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routine
without a trace.  (See the standard <CODE>AutoLoader</CODE> module, for example.)
But an <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routine can also just emulate the routine and never
define it.   For example, let's pretend that a function that wasn't defined
should just call 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_system_1">system()</A>
 with those arguments.  All you'd do is this:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub AUTOLOAD {
        my $program = $AUTOLOAD;
        $program =~ s/.*:://;
        system($program, @_);
    } 
    date();
    who('am', i');
    ls('-l');

</XMP>
<p>In fact, if you preclare the functions you want to call that way, you don't
even need the parentheses:
<p>
<XMP>
    use subs qw(date who ls);
    date;
    who "am", "i";
    ls -l;

</XMP>
<p>A more complete example of this is the standard Shell module, which
can treat undefined subroutine calls as calls to Unix programs.
<p>Mechanisms are available for modules writers to help split the modules
up into autoloadable files.  See the standard AutoLoader module described
in <EM>Autoloader</EM>, the standard SelfLoader modules in <EM>SelfLoader</EM>, and

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The basic IPC facilities of Perl are built out of the good old Unix
signals, named pipes, pipe opens, the Berkeley socket routines, and SysV
IPC calls.  Each is used in slightly different situations.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlipc_signals_0">
Signals</A>
</H1>
Perl uses a simple signal handling model: the <STRONG>%SIG</STRONG> hash contains names or
references of user-installed signal handlers.  These handlers will be called
with an argument which is the name of the signal that triggered it.  A
signal may be generated intentionally from a particular keyboard sequence like
control-C or control-Z, sent to you from an another process, or
triggered automatically by the kernel when special events transpire, like
a child process exiting, your process running out of stack space, or 
hitting file size limit.
<p>For example, to trap an interrupt signal, set up a handler like this.
Notice how all we do is set with a global variable and then raise an
exception.  That's because on most systems libraries are not
re-entrant, so calling any 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
 functions (or even anything that needs to
malloc(3) more memory) could in theory trigger a memory fault
and subsequent core dump.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub catch_zap {
        my $signame = shift;
        $shucks++;
        die "Somebody sent me a SIG$signame";
    } 
    $SIG{INT} = 'catch_zap';  # could fail in modules
    $SIG{INT} = \&catch_zap;  # best strategy

</XMP>
<p>The names of the signals are the ones listed out by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_kill_0">kill -l</A>
 on your
system, or you can retrieve them from the Config module.  Set up an
<STRONG>@signame</STRONG> list indexed by number to get the name and a <STRONG>%signo</STRONG> table
indexed by name to get the number:
<p>
<XMP>
    use Config;
    defined $Config{sig_name} || die "No sigs?";
    foreach $name (split(' ', $Config{sig_name})) {
        $signo{$name} = $i;
        $signame[$i] = $name;
        $i++;
    }   

</XMP>
<p>So to check whether signal 17 and SIGALRM were the same, just do this:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "signal #17 = $signame[17]\n";
    if ($signo{ALRM}) { 
        print "SIGALRM is $signo{ALRM}\n";
    }   

</XMP>
<p>You may also choose to assign the strings <CODE>'IGNORE'</CODE> or <CODE>'DEFAULT'</CODE> as
the handler, in which case Perl will try to discard the signal or do the
default thing.  Some signals can be neither trapped nor ignored, such as
the KILL and STOP (but not the TSTP) signals.  One strategy for
temporarily ignoring signals is to use a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 statement, which will be
automatically restored once your block is exited.  (Remember that 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>

values are ``inherited'' by functions called from within that block.)
<p>
<XMP>
    sub precious {
        local $SIG{INT} = 'IGNORE';
        &more_functions;
    } 
    sub more_functions {
        # interrupts still ignored, for now...
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Sending a signal to a negative process ID means that you send the signal
to the entire Unix process-group.  This code send a hang-up signal to all
processes in the current process group <EM>except for</EM> the current process
itself:
<p>
<XMP>
    {
        local $SIG{HUP} = 'IGNORE';
        kill HUP => -$$;
        # snazzy writing of: kill('HUP', -$$)
    }

</XMP>
<p>Another interesting signal to send is signal number zero.  This doesn't
actually affect another process, but instead checks whether it's alive
or has changed its UID.  
<p>
<XMP>
    unless (kill 0 => $kid_pid) {
        warn "something wicked happened to $kid_pid";
    } 

</XMP>
<p>You might also want to employ anonymous functions for simple signal
handlers:
<p>
<XMP>
    $SIG{INT} = sub { die "\nOutta here!\n" };

</XMP>
<p>But that will be problematic for the more complicated handlers that need
to re-install themselves.  Because Perl's signal mechanism is currently
based on the signal(3) function from the C library, you may somtimes be so
misfortunate as to run on systems where that function is ``broken'', that
is, it behaves in the old unreliable SysV way rather than the newer, more
reasonable BSD and POSIX fashion.  So you'll see defensive people writing
signal handlers like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub REAPER { 
        $SIG{CHLD} = \&REAPER;  # loathe sysV
        $waitedpid = wait;
    }
    $SIG{CHLD} = \&REAPER;
    # now do something that forks...

</XMP>
<p>or even the more elaborate:
<p>
<XMP>
    use POSIX "wait_h";
    sub REAPER { 
        my $child;
        $SIG{CHLD} = \&REAPER;  # loathe sysV
        while ($child = waitpid(-1,WNOHANG)) {
            $Kid_Status{$child} = $?;
        } 
    }
    $SIG{CHLD} = \&REAPER;
    # do something that forks...

</XMP>
<p>Signal handling is also used for timeouts in Unix,   While safely
protected within an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval{}</A>
 block, you set a signal handler to trap
alarm signals and then schedule to have one delivered to you in some
number of seconds.  Then try your blocking operation, clearing the alarm
when it's done but not before you've exited your 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval{}</A>
 block.  If it
goes off, you'll use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 to jump out of the block, much as you might
using <EM>longjmp()</EM> or <EM>throw()</EM> in other languages.
<p>Here's an example:
<p>
<XMP>
    eval { 
        local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "alarm clock restart" };
        alarm 10; 
        flock(FH, 2);   # blocking write lock
        alarm 0; 
    };
    if ($@ and $@ !~ /alarm clock restart/) { die }

</XMP>
<p>For more complex signal handling, you might see the standard POSIX
module.  Lamentably, this is almost entirely undocumented, but
the <EM>t/lib/posix.t</EM> file from the Perl source distribution has some
examples in it.

<A NAME="perlipc_named_0">
Named Pipes</A>
</H1>
A named pipe (often referred to as a FIFO) is an old Unix IPC
mechanism for processes communicating on the same machine.  It works
just like a regular, connected anonymous pipes, except that the 
processes rendezvous using a filename and don't have to be related.
<p>To create a named pipe, use the Unix command mknod(1) or on some
systems, mkfifo(1).  These may not be in your normal path.
<p>
<XMP>
    # system return val is backwards, so && not ||
    #
    $ENV{PATH} .= ":/etc:/usr/etc";
    if  (      system('mknod',  $path, 'p') 
            && system('mkfifo', $path) )
    {
        die "mk{nod,fifo} $path failed;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>A fifo is convenient when you want to connect a process to an unrelated
one.  When you open a fifo, the program will block until there's something
on the other end.  
<p>For example, let's say you'd like to have your <EM>.signature</EM> file be a
named pipe that has a Perl program on the other end.  Now every time any
program (like a mailer, newsreader, finger program, etc.) tries to read
from that file, the reading program will block and your program will
supply the the new signature.  We'll use the pipe-checking file test 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_p_0">-p</A>

to find out whether anyone (or anything) has accidentally removed our fifo.
<p>
<XMP>
    chdir; # go home
    $FIFO = '.signature';
    $ENV{PATH} .= ":/etc:/usr/games";
    while (1) {
        unless (-p $FIFO) {
            unlink $FIFO;
            system('mknod', $FIFO, 'p') 
                && die "can't mknod $FIFO: $!";
        } 
        # next line blocks until there's a reader
        open (FIFO, "> $FIFO") || die "can't write $FIFO: $!";
        print FIFO "John Smith (smith\@host.org)\n", `fortune -s`;
        close FIFO;
        sleep 2;    # to avoid dup sigs
    }

<H1> Using 
<A NAME="perlfunc_open_1">
open()</A>
 for IPC</H1>
Perl's basic 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 statement can also be used for unidirectional interprocess
communication by either appending or prepending a pipe symbol to the second
argument to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
.  Here's how to start something up a child process you
intend to write to:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(SPOOLER, "| cat -v | lpr -h 2>/dev/null") 
                    || die "can't fork: $!";
    local $SIG{PIPE} = sub { die "spooler pipe broke" };
    print SPOOLER "stuff\n";
    close SPOOLER || die "bad spool: $! $?";

</XMP>
<p>And here's how to start up a child process you intend to read from:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(STATUS, "netstat -an 2>&1 |")
                    || die "can't fork: $!";
    while (<STATUS>) {
        next if /^(tcp|udp)/;
        print;
    } 
    close SPOOLER || die "bad netstat: $! $?";

</XMP>
<p>If one can be sure that a particular program is a Perl script that is
expecting filenames in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
, the clever programmer can write something
like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $ program f1 "cmd1|" - f2 "cmd2|" f3 < tmpfile

</XMP>
<p>and irrespective of which shell it's called from, the Perl program will
read from the file <EM>f1</EM>, the process <EM>cmd1</EM>, standard input (<EM>tmpfile</EM>
in this case), the <EM>f2</EM> file, the <EM>cmd2</EM> command, and finally the <EM>f3</EM>
file.  Pretty nifty, eh?
<p>You might notice that you could use backticks for much the
same effect as opening a pipe for reading:
<p>
<XMP>
    print grep { !/^(tcp|udp)/ } `netstat -an 2>&1`;
    die "bad netstat" if $?;

</XMP>
<p>While this is true on the surface, it's much more efficient to process the
file one line or record at a time because then you don't have to read the
whole thing into memory at once. It also gives you finer control of the
whole process, letting you to kill off the child process early if you'd
like.
<p>Be careful to check both the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 and the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_close_0">close()</A>
 return values.  If
you're <EM>writing</EM> to a pipe, you should also trap SIGPIPE.  Otherwise,
think of what happens when you start up a pipe to a command that doesn't
exist: the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 will in all likelihood succeed (it only reflects the

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_fork_0">fork()</A>
's success), but then your output will fail--spectacularly.  Perl
can't know whether the command worked because your command is actually
running in a separate process whose 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
 might have failed.  Therefore,
while readers of bogus commands just return a quick end of file, writers
to bogus command will trigger a signal they'd better be prepared to
handle.  Consider:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FH, "|bogus");
    print FH "bang\n";
    close FH;

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlipc_safe_0">
Safe Pipe Opens</A>
</H2>
Another interesting approach to IPC is making your single program go
multiprocess and communicate between (or even amongst) yourselves.  The

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 function will accept a file argument of either <CODE>``-|''</CODE> or <CODE>``|-''</CODE>
to do a very interesting thing: it forks a child connected to the
filehandle you've opened.  The child is running the same program as the
parent.  This is useful for safely opening a file when running under an
assumed UID or GID, for example.  If you open a pipe <EM>to</EM> minus, you can
write to the filehandle you opened and your kid will find it in his
STDIN.  If you open a pipe <EM>from</EM> minus, you can read from the filehandle
you opened whatever your kid writes to his STDOUT.
<p>
<XMP>
    use English;
    my $sleep_count = 0;
    do { 
        $pid = open(KID_TO_WRITE, "|-");
        unless (defined $pid) {
            warn "cannot fork: $!";
            die "bailing out" if $sleep_count++ > 6;
            sleep 10;
        } 
    } until defined $pid;
    if ($pid) {  # parent
        print KID_TO_WRITE @some_data;
        close(KID_TO_WRITE) || warn "kid exited $?";
    } else {     # child
        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID); # suid progs only
        open (FILE, "> /safe/file") 
            || die "can't open /safe/file: $!";
        while (<STDIN>) {
            print FILE; # child's STDIN is parent's KID
        } 
        exit;  # don't forget this
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Another common use for this construct is when you need to execute
something without the shell's interference.  With 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_system_1">system()</A>
, it's
straigh-forward, but you can't use a pipe open or backticks safely.
That's because there's no way to stop the shell from getting its hands on
your arguments.   Instead, use lower-level control to call 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
 directly.
<p>Here's a safe backtick or pipe open for read:
<p>
<XMP>
    # add error processing as above
    $pid = open(KID_TO_READ, "-|");
    if ($pid) {   # parent
        while (<KID_TO_READ>) {
            # do something interesting
        }         
        close(KID_TO_READ) || warn "kid exited $?";
    } else {      # child
        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID); # suid only
        exec($program, @options, @args)
            || die "can't exec program: $!";
        # NOTREACHED
    } 

</XMP>
<p>And here's a safe pipe open for writing:
<p>
<XMP>
    # add error processing as above
    $pid = open(KID_TO_WRITE, "|-");
    $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "whoops, $program pipe broke" };
    if ($pid) {  # parent
        for (@data) {
            print KID_TO_WRITE;
        } 
        close(KID_TO_WRITE) || warn "kid exited $?";
    } else {     # child
        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID);
        exec($program, @options, @args)
            || die "can't exec program: $!";
        # NOTREACHED
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Note that these operations are full Unix forks, which means they may not be
correctly implemented on alien systems.  Additionally, these are not true
multithreading.  If you'd like to learn more about threading, see the
<EM>modules</EM> file mentioned below in the 
<A HREF="perlipc.html#perlipc_see_0"><EM>SEE ALSO</EM></A>
 section.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlipc_bidirectional_0">
Bidirectional Communication</A>
</H2>
While this works reasonably well for unidirectional communication, what
about bidirectional communication?  The obvious thing you'd like to do
doesn't actually work:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(PROG_FOR_READING_AND_WRITING, "| some program |")

</XMP>
<p>and if you forget to use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 flag, then you'll miss out 
entirely on the diagnostic message:
<p>
<XMP>
    Can't do bidirectional pipe at -e line 1.

</XMP>
<p>If you really want to, you can use the standard <EM>open2()</EM> library function
to catch both ends.  There's also an <EM>open3()</EM> for tridirectional I/O so you
can also catch your child's STDERR, but doing so would then require an
awkward 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 loop and wouldn't allow you to use normal Perl input
operations.
<p>If you look at its source, you'll see that <EM>open2()</EM> uses low-level
primitives like Unix 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pipe_0">pipe()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
 to create all the connections.
While it might have been slightly more efficient by using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_socketpair_0">socketpair()</A>
, it
would have then been even less portable than it already is.  The <EM>open2()</EM>
and <EM>open3()</EM> functions are  unlikely to work anywhere except on a Unix
system or some other one purporting to be POSIX compliant.
<p>Here's an example of using <EM>open2()</EM>:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    use IPC::Open2;
    $pid = open2( \*Reader, \*Writer, "cat -u -n" );
    Writer->autoflush(); # default here, actually
    print Writer "stuff\n";
    $got = <Reader>;

</XMP>
<p>The problem with this is that Unix buffering is going to really
ruin your day.  Even though your <CODE>Writer</CODE> filehandle is autoflushed,
and the process on the other end will get your data in a timely manner,
you can't usually do anything to force it to actually give it back to you
in a similarly quick fashion.  In this case, we could, because we 
gave <EM>cat</EM> a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_u_0">-u</A>
 flag to make it unbuffered.  But very few Unix
commands are designed to operate over pipes, so this seldom works
unless you yourself wrote the program on the other end of the 
double-ended pipe.
<p>A solution to this is the non-standard <EM>Comm.pl</EM> library.  It uses
pseudo-ttys to make your program behave more reasonably:
<p>
<XMP>
    require 'Comm.pl';
    $ph = open_proc('cat -n');
    for (1..10) {
        print $ph "a line\n";
        print "got back ", scalar <$ph>;
    }

</XMP>
<p>This way you don't have to have control over the source code of the
program you're using.  The <EM>Comm</EM> library also has <EM>expect()</EM> 
and <EM>interact()</EM> functions.  Find the library (and hopefully its 
successor <EM>IPC::Chat</EM>) at your nearest CPAN archive as detailed
in the 
<A HREF="perlipc.html#perlipc_see_0"><EM>SEE ALSO</EM></A>
 section below.

<A NAME="perlipc_sockets_0">
Sockets: Client/Server Communication</A>
</H1>
While not limited to Unix-derived operating systems (e.g. WinSock on PCs
provides socket support, as do some VMS libraries), you may not have
sockets on your system, in which this section probably isn't going to do
you much good.  With sockets, you can do both virtual circuits (i.e. TCP
streams) and datagrams (i.e. UDP packets).  You may be able to do even more
depending on your system.
<p>The Perl function calls for dealing with sockets have the same names as
the corresponding system calls in C, but their arguments tend to differ
for two reasons: first, Perl filehandles work differently than C file
descriptors.  Second, Perl already knows the length of its strings, so you
don't need to pass that information.
<p>One of the major problems with old socket code in Perl was that it used
hard-coded values for some of the constants, which severely hurt
portability.  If you ever see code that does anything like explicitly
setting <CODE><STRONG>$AF_INET</STRONG> = 2</CODE>, you know you're in for big trouble:  An
immeasurably superior approach is to use the <CODE>Socket</CODE> module, which more
reliably grants access to various constants and functions you'll need.

Internet TCP Clients and Servers</A>

Use Internet-domain sockets when you want to do client-server

<p>Here's a sample TCP client using Internet-domain sockets:

    my ($remote,$port, $iaddr, $paddr, $proto, $line);

leave the address as INADDR_ANY so that the kernel can choose
the appropriate interface on multihomed hosts.  If you want sit
on a particular interface (like the external side of a gateway

instead.

<p>And here's a multithreaded version.  It's multithreaded in that
like most typical servers, it spawns (forks) a slave server to 
handle the client request so that the master server can quickly
go back to service a new client.

<p>This server takes the trouble to clone off a child version via 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_fork_0">fork()</A>
 for
each incoming request.  That way it can handle many requests at once,
which you might not always want.  Even if you don't 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_fork_0">fork()</A>
, the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_listen_0">listen()</A>

will allow that many pending connections.  Forking servers have to be
particularly careful about cleaning up their dead children (called
``zombies'' in Unix parlance), because otherwise you'll quickly fill up your
process table.
<p>We suggest that you use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>
 flag to use taint checking (see 
<A HREF="perlsec.html">
the <EM>perlsec</EM> manpage</A>
)
even if we aren't running setuid or setgid.  This is always a good idea
for servers and other programs run on behalf of someone else (like CGI
scripts), because it lessens the chances that people from the outside will
be able to compromise your system.
<p>Let's look at another TCP client.  This one connects to the TCP ``time''
service on a number of different machines and shows how far their clocks
differ from the system on which it's being run:

<A NAME="perlipc_unix_domain_0">
Unix-Domain TCP Clients and Servers</A>
</H2>
That's fine for Internet-domain clients and servers, but what local
communications?  While you can use the same setup, sometimes you don't
want to.  Unix-domain sockets are local to the current host, and are often
used internally to implement pipes.  Unlike Internet domain sockets, UNIX
domain sockets can show up in the file system with an ls(1) listing.
<p>
<XMP>
    $ ls -l /dev/log
    srw-rw-rw-  1 root            0 Oct 31 07:23 /dev/log

</XMP>
<p>You can test for these with Perl's 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_s_1">-S</A>
 file test:
<p>
<XMP>
    unless ( -S '/dev/log' ) {
        die "something's wicked with the print system";
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Here's a sample Unix-domain client:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    require 5.002;
    use Socket;
    use strict;
    my ($rendezvous, $line);
    $rendezvous = shift || '/tmp/catsock';
    socket(SOCK, PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)       || die "socket: $!";
    connect(SOCK, sockaddr_un($remote))         || die "connect: $!";
    while ($line = <SOCK>) {
        print $line;
    } 
    exit;

</XMP>
<p>And here's a corresponding server.  
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -Tw
    require 5.002;
    use strict;
    use Socket;
    use Carp;
    BEGIN { $ENV{PATH} = '/usr/ucb:/bin' }
    my $NAME = '/tmp/catsock';
    my $uaddr = sockaddr_un($NAME);
    my $proto = getprotobyname('tcp');
    socket(Server,PF_UNIX,SOCK_STREAM,0)        || die "socket: $!";
    unlink($NAME);
    bind  (Server, $uaddr)                      || die "bind: $!";
    listen(Server,SOMAXCONN)                    || die "listen: $!";
    logmsg "server started on $NAME";
    $SIG{CHLD} = \&REAPER;
    for ( $waitedpid = 0; 
          accept(Client,Server) || $waitedpid; 
          $waitedpid = 0, close Client) 
    {
        next if $waitedpid;
        logmsg "connection on $NAME";
        spawn sub { 
            print "Hello there, it's now ", scalar localtime, "\n";
            exec '/usr/games/fortune' or die "can't exec fortune: $!";
        };
    } 

</XMP>
<p>As you see, it's remarkably similar to the Internet domain TCP server, so
much so, in fact, that we've omitted several duplicate functions--<EM>spawn()</EM>,
<EM>logmsg()</EM>, <EM>ctime()</EM>, and <EM>REAPER()</EM>--which are exactly the same as in the
other server.
<p>So why would you ever want to use a Unix domain socket instead of a
simpler named pipe?  Because a named pipe doesn't give you sessions.  You
can't tell one process's data from another's.  With socket programming,
you get a separate session for each client: that's why 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_accept_0">accept()</A>
 takes two
arguments.
<p>For example, let's say that you have a long running database server daemon
that you want folks from the World Wide Web to be able to access, but only
if they go through a CGI interface.  You'd have a small, simple CGI
program that does whatever checks and logging you feel like, and then acts
as a Unix-domain client and connects to your private server.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlipc_udp_0">
UDP: Message Passing</A>
</H2>
Another kind of client-server setup is one that uses not connections, but
messages.  UDP communications involve much lower overhead but also provide
less reliability, as there are no promises that messages will arrive at
all, let alone in order and unmangled.  Still, UDP offers some advantages
over TCP, including being able to ``broadcast'' or ``multicast'' to a whole
bunch of destination hosts at once (usually on your local subnet).  If you
find yourself overly concerned about reliability and start building checks
into your message system, then you probably should just use TCP to start
with.
<p>Here's a UDP program similar to the sample Internet TCP client given
above.  However, instead of checking one host at a time, the UDP version
will check many of them asynchronously by simulating a multicast and then
using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 to do a timed-out wait for I/O.  To do something similar
with TCP, you'd have to use a different socket handle for each host.

SysV IPC</A>

While System V IPC isn't so widely used as sockets, it still has some
interesting uses.  You can't, however, effectively use SysV IPC or
Berkeley <EM>mmap()</EM> to have shared memory so as to share a variable amongst
several processes.  That's because Perl would reallocate your string when
you weren't wanting it to.
<p>Here's a small example showing shared memory usage.  
<p>
<XMP>
    $IPC_PRIVATE = 0;
    $IPC_RMID = 0;

    die unless defined $key;
    $message = "Message #1";
    shmwrite($key, $message, 0, 60 ) || die "$!";
    shmread($key,$buff,0,60) || die "$!";

<p>Most of these routines quietly but politely return

All these routines create system-specific portability problems.  As noted
elsewhere, Perl is at the mercy of your C libraries for much of its system
behaviour.  It's probably safest to assume broken SysV semantics for
signals and to stick with simple TCP and UDP socket operations; e.g. don't
try to pass open filedescriptors over a local UDP datagram socket if you
want your code to stand a chance of being portable.
<p>Because few vendors provide C libraries that are safely 
re-entrant, the prudent programmer will do little else within

<A NAME="perlform_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Perl has a mechanism to help you generate simple reports and charts.  To
facilitate this, Perl helps you code up your output page 
close to how it will look when it's printed.  It can keep
track of things like how many lines on a page, what page you're on, when to
print page headers, etc.  Keywords are borrowed from FORTRAN:

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_format_0">format()</A>
 to declare and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
 to execute; see their entries in

<A HREF="perlfunc.html">
the <EM>perlfunc</EM> manpage</A>
.  Fortunately, the layout is much more legible, more like
BASIC's PRINT USING statement.  Think of it as a poor man's nroff(1).
<p>Formats, like packages and subroutines, are declared rather than executed,
so they may occur at any point in your program.  (Usually it's best to
keep them all together though.) They have their own namespace apart from
all the other ``types'' in Perl.  This means that if you have a function
named ``Foo'', it is not the same thing as having a format named ``Foo''.
However, the default name for the format associated with a given
filehandle is the same as the name of the filehandle.  Thus, the default
format for STDOUT is name ``STDOUT'', and the default format for filehandle
TEMP is name ``TEMP''.  They just look the same.  They aren't.
<p>Output record formats are declared as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
    format NAME =
    FORMLIST
    .

</XMP>
<p>If name is omitted, format ``STDOUT'' is defined.  FORMLIST consists of a
sequence of lines, each of which may be of one of three types:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>A comment, indicated by putting a '#' in the first column.
<p>
<LI>A ``picture'' line giving the format for one output line.
<p>
<LI>An argument line supplying values to plug into the previous picture line.
<p>
</OL>
Picture lines are printed exactly as they look, except for certain fields.that substitute values into the line.  Each field in a picture line starts
with either ``@'' (at) or ``^'' (caret).  These lines do not undergo any kind
of variable interpolation.  The at field (not to be confused with the array
marker @) is the normal kind of field; the other kind, caret fields, are used
to do rudimentary multi-line text block filling.  The length of the field
is supplied by padding out the field with multiple ``&lt;'', ``&gt;'', or ``|''
characters to specify, respectively, left justification, right
justification, or centering.  If the variable would exceed the width
specified, it is truncated.
<p>As an alternate form of right justification, you may also use ``#''
characters (with an optional ``.'') to specify a numeric field.  This way
you can line up the decimal points.  If any value supplied for these
fields contains a newline, only the text up to the newline is printed.
Finally, the special field ``@*'' can be used for printing multi-line,
non-truncated values; it should appear by itself on a line.
<p>The values are specified on the following line in the same order as
the picture fields.  The expressions providing the values should be
separated by commas.  The expressions are all evaluated in a list context
before the line is processed, so a single list expression could produce
multiple list elements.  The expressions may be spread out to more than
one line if enclosed in braces.  If so, the opening brace must be the first
token on the first line.
<p>Picture fields that begin with ^ rather than <STRONG>@ </STRONG>are treated specially.
With a # field, the field is blanked out if the value is undefined.  For
other field types, the caret enables a kind of fill mode.  Instead of an
arbitrary expression, the value supplied must be a scalar variable name
that contains a text string.  Perl puts as much text as it can into the
field, and then chops off the front of the string so that the next time
the variable is referenced, more of the text can be printed.  (Yes, this
means that the variable itself is altered during execution of the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>

call, and is not returned.)  Normally you would use a sequence of fields
in a vertical stack to print out a block of text.  You might wish to end
the final field with the text ``...'', which will appear in the output if
the text was too long to appear in its entirety.  You can change which
characters are legal to break on by changing the variable 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__19">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__19">$:</A>
</A>
 (that's

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_line_break_characters_1">$FORMAT_LINE_BREAK_CHARACTERS</A>
 if you're using the English module) to a
list of the desired characters.
<p>Using caret fields can produce variable length records.  If the text
to be formatted is short, you can suppress blank lines by putting a
``~'' (tilde) character anywhere in the line.  The tilde will be translated
to a space upon output.  If you put a second tilde contiguous to the
first, the line will be repeated until all the fields on the line are
exhausted.  (If you use a field of the at variety, the expression you
supply had better not give the same value every time forever!)
<p>Top-of-form processing is by default handled by a format with the 
same name as the current filehandle with ``_TOP'' concatenated to it.
It's triggered at the top of each page.  See &lt;perlfunc/
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
&gt;.

<p>It is possible to intermix 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
s with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
s on the same output
channel, but you'll have to handle $- (

yourself.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlform_format_0">
Format Variables</A>
</H2>
The current format name is stored in the variable 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__17">$~</A>
 (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_name_1">$FORMAT_NAME</A>
),
and the current top of form format name is in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
 (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_top_name_1">$FORMAT_TOP_NAME</A>
).
The current output page number is stored in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__14">$%</A>
 (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_page_number_1">$FORMAT_PAGE_NUMBER</A>
),
and the number of lines on the page is in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__15">$=</A>
 (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_lines_per_page_1">$FORMAT_LINES_PER_PAGE</A>
).
Whether to autoflush output on this handle is stored in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__8">$|</A>

(
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_output_autoflush_0">$OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH</A>
).  The string output before each top of page (except
the first) is stored in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_l_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
L</A>
 (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_formfeed_1">$FORMAT_FORMFEED</A>
).  These variables are
set on a per-filehandle basis, so you'll need to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 into a different
one to affect them:
<p>
<XMP>
    select((select(OUTF), 
            $~ = "My_Other_Format",
            $^ = "My_Top_Format"
           )[0]);

</XMP>
<p>Pretty ugly, eh?  It's a common idiom though, so don't be too surprised
when you see it.  You can at least use a temporary variable to hold
the previous filehandle: (this is a much better approach in general,
because not only does legibility improve, you now have intermediary
stage in the expression to single-step the debugger through):
<p>
<XMP>
    $ofh = select(OUTF);
    $~ = "My_Other_Format";
    $^ = "My_Top_Format";
    select($ofh);

</XMP>
<p>If you use the English module, you can even read the variable names:
<p>
<XMP>
    use English;
    $ofh = select(OUTF);
    $FORMAT_NAME     = "My_Other_Format";
    $FORMAT_TOP_NAME = "My_Top_Format";
    select($ofh);

</XMP>
<p>But you still have those funny 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
s.  So just use the FileHandle
module.  Now, you can access these special variables using lower-case
method names instead:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    format_name     OUTF "My_Other_Format";
    format_top_name OUTF "My_Top_Format";

</XMP>
<p>Much better!

Since the values line may contain arbitrary expressions (for at fields, 
not caret fields), you can farm out more sophisticated processing
to other functions, like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sprintf_0">sprintf()</A>
 or one of your own.  For example:
<p>
<PRE>
    format Ident = 
        @&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
        &amp;commify(<STRONG>$n</STRONG>)
    .

</PRE>
<p>To get a real at or caret into the field, do this:
<p>
<XMP>
    format Ident = 
    I have an @ here.
            "@"
    .

</XMP>
<p>To center a whole line of text, do something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    format Ident = 
    @|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
            "Some text line"
    .

</XMP>
<p>There is no builtin way to say "float this to the right hand side
of the page, however wide it is."  You have to specify where it goes.
The truly desperate can generate their own format on the fly, based
on the current number of columns, and then 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
 it:
<p>
<XMP>
    $format  = "format STDOUT = \n";
             . '^' . '<' x $cols . "\n";
             . '$entry' . "\n";
             . "\t^" . "<" x ($cols-8) . "~~\n";
             . '$entry' . "\n";
             . ".\n";
    print $format if $Debugging;
    eval $format; 
    die $@ if $@;

</XMP>
<p>Which would generate a format looking something like this:
<p>
<PRE>
 format STDOUT = 
 ^&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

</H2>
While 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_top_name_1">$FORMAT_TOP_NAME</A>

there is no corresponding mechanism to automatically do the same thing
for a footer.  Not knowing how big a format is going to be until you
evaluate it is one of the major problems.  It's on the TODO list.
<p>Here's one strategy:  If you have a fixed-size footer, you can get footers
by checking 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_format_lines_left_1">$FORMAT_LINES_LEFT</A>
 before each 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
 and print the footer
yourself if necessary.
<p>Here's another strategy; open a pipe to yourself, using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open(MESELF, ``|-'')</A>
 
(see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1"><EM>open</EM></A>
) and always 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
 to MESELF instead of
STDOUT.  Have your child process postprocesses its STDIN to rearrange
headers and footers however you like.  Not very convenient, but doable.

perlref - Perl references and nested data structures
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlref_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Before release 5 of Perl it was difficult to represent complex data
structures, because all references had to be symbolic, and even that was
difficult to do when you wanted to refer to a variable rather than a
symbol table entry.  Perl 5 not only makes it easier to use symbolic
references to variables, but lets you have ``hard'' references to any piece
of data.  Any scalar may hold a hard reference.  Since arrays and hashes
contain scalars, you can now easily build arrays of arrays, arrays of
hashes, hashes of arrays, arrays of hashes of functions, and so on.
<p>Hard references are smart--they keep track of reference counts for you,
automatically freeing the thing referred to when its reference count
goes to zero.  If that thing happens to be an object, the object is
destructed.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
 for more about objects.  (In a sense,
everything in Perl is an object, but we usually reserve the word for
references to objects that have been officially ``blessed'' into a class package.)
<p>A symbolic reference contains the name of a variable, just as a
symbolic link in the filesystem merely contains the name of a file.  
The <CODE>*glob</CODE> notation is a kind of symbolic reference.  Hard references
are more like hard links in the file system: merely another way
at getting at the same underlying object, irrespective of its name.
<p>``Hard'' references are easy to use in Perl.  There is just one
overriding principle:  Perl does no implicit referencing or
dereferencing.  When a scalar is holding a reference, it always behaves
as a scalar.  It doesn't magically start being an array or a hash
unless you tell it so explicitly by dereferencing it.
<p>References can be constructed several ways.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>By using the backslash operator on a variable, subroutine, or value.
(This works much like the &amp; (address-of) operator works in C.)  Note
that this typically creates <EM>ANOTHER</EM> reference to a variable, since
there's already a reference to the variable in the symbol table.  But
the symbol table reference might go away, and you'll still have the
reference that the backslash returned.  Here are some examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    $scalarref = \$foo;
    $arrayref  = \@ARGV;
    $hashref   = \%ENV;
    $coderef   = \&handler;
    $globref   = \*STDOUT;

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>A reference to an anonymous array can be constructed using square
brackets:
<p>
<XMP>
    $arrayref = [1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c']];

</XMP>
<p>Here we've constructed a reference to an anonymous array of three elements
whose final element is itself reference to another anonymous array of three
elements.  (The multidimensional syntax described later can be used to
access this.  For example, after the above, <STRONG>$arrayref</STRONG>-&gt;[2][1] would have
the value ``b''.)
<p>Note that taking a reference to an enumerated list is not the same
as using square brackets--instead it's the same as creating
a list of references!
<p>
<XMP>
    @list = (\$a, \$b, \$c);  
    @list = \($a, $b, $c);      # same thing!

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>A reference to an anonymous hash can be constructed using curly
brackets:
<p>
<XMP>
    $hashref = {
        'Adam'  => 'Eve',
        'Clyde' => 'Bonnie',
    };

</XMP>
<p>Anonymous hash and array constructors can be intermixed freely to
produce as complicated a structure as you want.  The multidimensional
syntax described below works for these too.  The values above are
literals, but variables and expressions would work just as well, because
assignment operators in Perl (even within 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
) are executable
statements, not compile-time declarations.
<p>Because curly brackets (braces) are used for several other things
including BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to disambiguate braces at the
beginning of a statement by putting a <CODE>+</CODE> or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_return_0">return</A>
 in front so
that Perl realizes the opening brace isn't starting a BLOCK.  The economy and
mnemonic value of using curlies is deemed worth this occasional extra
hassle.
<p>For example, if you wanted a function to make a new hash and return a
reference to it, you have these options:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub hashem {        { @_ } }   # silently wrong
    sub hashem {       +{ @_ } }   # ok
    sub hashem { return { @_ } }   # ok

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>A reference to an anonymous subroutine can be constructed by using

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sub_2">sub</A>
 without a subname:
<p>
<XMP>
    $coderef = sub { print "Boink!\n" };

</XMP>
<p>Note the presence of the semicolon.  Except for the fact that the code
inside isn't executed immediately, a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sub_2">sub {}</A>
 is not so much a
declaration as it is an operator, like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do{}</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval{}</A>
.  (However, no
matter how many times you execute that line (unless you're in an

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval(``...'')</A>
), <CODE><STRONG>$coderef</STRONG></CODE> will still have a reference to the <EM>SAME</EM>
anonymous subroutine.)
<p>Anonymous subroutines act as closures with respect to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 variables,
that is, variables visible lexically within the current scope.  Closure
is a notion out of the Lisp world that says if you define an anonymous
function in a particular lexical context, it pretends to run in that
context even when it's called outside of the context.
<p>In human terms, it's a funny way of passing arguments to a subroutine when
you define it as well as when you call it.  It's useful for setting up
little bits of code to run later, such as callbacks.  You can even
do object-oriented stuff with it, though Perl provides a different
mechanism to do that already--see 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>You can also think of closure as a way to write a subroutine template without
using eval.  (In fact, in version 5.000, eval was the <EM>only</EM> way to get
closures.  You may wish to use ``require 5.001'' if you use closures.)
<p>Here's a small example of how closures works:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub newprint {
        my $x = shift;
        return sub { my $y = shift; print "$x, $y!\n"; };
    }
    $h = newprint("Howdy");
    $g = newprint("Greetings");
    # Time passes...
    &$h("world");
    &$g("earthlings");

</XMP>
<p>This prints
<p>
<XMP>
    Howdy, world!
    Greetings, earthlings!

</XMP>
<p>Note particularly that <STRONG>$x</STRONG> continues to refer to the value passed into
<EM>newprint()</EM> <EM>despite</EM> the fact that the ``my <STRONG>$x</STRONG>'' has seemingly gone out of
scope by the time the anonymous subroutine runs.  That's what closure
is all about.
<p>This only applies to lexical variables, by the way.  Dynamic variables
continue to work as they have always worked.  Closure is not something
that most Perl programmers need trouble themselves about to begin with.
<p>
<LI>References are often returned by special subroutines called constructors.
Perl objects are just references to a special kind of object that happens to know
which package it's associated with.  Constructors are just special
subroutines that know how to create that association.  They do so by
starting with an ordinary reference, and it remains an ordinary reference
even while it's also being an object.  Constructors are customarily
named <EM>new()</EM>, but don't have to be:
<p>
<XMP>
    $objref = new Doggie (Tail => 'short', Ears => 'long');

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>References of the appropriate type can spring into existence if you
dereference them in a context that assumes they exist.  Since we haven't
talked about dereferencing yet, we can't show you any examples yet.
<p>
<LI>References to filehandles can be created by taking a reference to 
a typeglob.  This is currently the best way to pass filehandles into or
out of subroutines, or to store them in larger data structures.
<p>
<XMP>
    splutter(\*STDOUT);
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh "her um well a hmmm\n";
    }
    $rec = get_rec(\*STDIN);
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar <$fh>;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
</OL>
That's it for creating references.  By now you're probably dying to.know how to use references to get back to your long-lost data.  There
are several basic methods.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Anywhere you'd put an identifier as part of a variable or subroutine
name, you can replace the identifier with a simple scalar variable
containing a reference of the correct type:
<p>
<XMP>
    $bar = $$scalarref;
    push(@$arrayref, $filename);
    $$arrayref[0] = "January";
    $$hashref{"KEY"} = "VALUE";
    &$coderef(1,2,3);
    print $globref "output\n";

</XMP>
<p>It's important to understand that we are specifically <EM>NOT</EM> dereferencing
<CODE><STRONG>$arrayref</STRONG>[0]</CODE> or <CODE><STRONG>$hashref</STRONG>{``KEY''}</CODE> there.  The dereference of the
scalar variable happens <EM>BEFORE</EM> it does any key lookups.  Anything more
complicated than a simple scalar variable must use methods 2 or 3 below.
However, a ``simple scalar'' includes an identifier that itself uses method
1 recursively.  Therefore, the following prints ``howdy''.
<p>
<XMP>
    $refrefref = \\\"howdy";
    print $$$$refrefref;

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>Anywhere you'd put an identifier as part of a variable or subroutine
name, you can replace the identifier with a BLOCK returning a reference
of the correct type.  In other words, the previous examples could be
written like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $bar = ${$scalarref};
    push(@{$arrayref}, $filename);
    ${$arrayref}[0] = "January";
    ${$hashref}{"KEY"} = "VALUE";
    &{$coderef}(1,2,3);
    $globref->print("output\n");  # iff you use FileHandle

</XMP>
<p>Admittedly, it's a little silly to use the curlies in this case, but
the BLOCK can contain any arbitrary expression, in particular,
subscripted expressions:
<p>
<XMP>
    &{ $dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3);      # call correct routine 

</XMP>
<p>Because of being able to omit the curlies for the simple case of <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
x</CODE>,
people often make the mistake of viewing the dereferencing symbols as
proper operators, and wonder about their precedence.  If they were,
though, you could use parens instead of braces.  That's not the case.
Consider the difference below; case 0 is a short-hand version of case 1,
<EM>NOT</EM> case 2:
<p>
<XMP>
    $$hashref{"KEY"}   = "VALUE";       # CASE 0
    ${$hashref}{"KEY"} = "VALUE";       # CASE 1
    ${$hashref{"KEY"}} = "VALUE";       # CASE 2
    ${$hashref->{"KEY"}} = "VALUE";     # CASE 3

</XMP>
<p>Case 2 is also deceptive in that you're accessing a variable
called <STRONG>%hashref</STRONG>, not dereferencing through <STRONG>$hashref</STRONG> to the hash
it's presumably referencing.  That would be case 3.
<p>
<LI>The case of individual array elements arises often enough that it gets
cumbersome to use method 2.  As a form of syntactic sugar, the two
lines like that above can be written:
<p>
<XMP>
    $arrayref->[0] = "January";
    $hashref->{"KEY"} = "VALUE";

</XMP>
<p>The left side of the array can be any expression returning a reference,
including a previous dereference.  Note that <CODE><STRONG>$array</STRONG>[<STRONG>$x</STRONG>]</CODE> is <EM>NOT</EM> the
same thing as <CODE><STRONG>$array</STRONG>-&gt;[<STRONG>$x</STRONG>]</CODE> here:
<p>
<XMP>
    $array[$x]->{"foo"}->[0] = "January";

</XMP>
<p>This is one of the cases we mentioned earlier in which references could
spring into existence when in an lvalue context.  Before this
statement, <CODE><STRONG>$array</STRONG>[<STRONG>$x</STRONG>]</CODE> may have been undefined.  If so, it's
automatically defined with a hash reference so that we can look up
<CODE>{``foo''}</CODE> in it.  Likewise <CODE><STRONG>$array</STRONG>[<STRONG>$x</STRONG>]-&gt;{``foo''}</CODE> will automatically get
defined with an array reference so that we can look up <CODE>[0]</CODE> in it.
<p>One more thing here.  The arrow is optional <EM>BETWEEN</EM> brackets
subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to
<p>
<XMP>
    $array[$x]{"foo"}[0] = "January";

</XMP>
<p>Which, in the degenerate case of using only ordinary arrays, gives you
multidimensional arrays just like C's:
<p>
<XMP>
    $score[$x][$y][$z] += 42;

</XMP>
<p>Well, okay, not entirely like C's arrays, actually.  C doesn't know how
to grow its arrays on demand.  Perl does.
<p>
<LI>If a reference happens to be a reference to an object, then there are
probably methods to access the things referred to, and you should probably
stick to those methods unless you're in the class package that defines the
object's methods.  In other words, be nice, and don't violate the object's
encapsulation without a very good reason.  Perl does not enforce
encapsulation.  We are not totalitarians here.  We do expect some basic
civility though.
<p>
</OL>
The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_ref_0">ref()</A>
 operator may be used to determine what type of thing the.reference is pointing to.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html">
the <EM>perlfunc</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bless_1">bless()</A>
 operator may be used to associate a reference with a package
functioning as an object class.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>A typeglob may be dereferenced the same way a reference can, since
the dereference syntax always indicates the kind of reference desired.
So <CODE>${*foo}</CODE> and <CODE>${\<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>}</CODE> both indicate the same scalar variable.
<p>Here's a trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a string:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "My sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that time.\n";

</XMP>
<p>The way it works is that when the <CODE>@{...}</CODE> is seen in the double-quoted
string, it's evaluated as a block.  The block creates a reference to an
anonymous array containing the results of the call to <CODE>mysub(1,2,3)</CODE>.  So
the whole block returns a reference to an array, which is then
dereferenced by <CODE>@{...}</CODE> and stuck into the double-quoted string. This
chicanery is also useful for arbitrary expressions:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "That yeilds @{[$n + 5]} widgets\n";

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlref_symbolic_0">
Symbolic references</A>
</H2>
We said that references spring into existence as necessary if they are
undefined, but we didn't say what happens if a value used as a
reference is already defined, but <EM>ISN'T</EM> a hard reference.  If you
use it as a reference in this case, it'll be treated as a symbolic
reference.  That is, the value of the scalar is taken to be the 
<A HREF="perlref.html#perlref_name_0">NAME</A>

of a variable, rather than a direct link to a (possibly) anonymous
value.
<p>People frequently expect it to work like this.  So it does.
<p>
<XMP>
    $name = "foo";
    $$name = 1;                 # Sets $foo
    ${$name} = 2;               # Sets $foo
    ${$name x 2} = 3;           # Sets $foofoo
    $name->[0] = 4;             # Sets $foo[0]
    @$name = ();                # Clears @foo
    &$name();                   # Calls &foo() (as in Perl 4)
    $pack = "THAT";
    ${"${pack}::$name"} = 5;    # Sets $THAT::foo without eval

</XMP>
<p>This is very powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it's possible
to intend (with the utmost sincerity) to use a hard reference, and
accidentally use a symbolic reference instead.  To protect against
that, you can say
<p>
<XMP>
    use strict 'refs';

</XMP>
<p>and then only hard references will be allowed for the rest of the enclosing
block.  An inner block may countermand that with 
<p>
<XMP>
    no strict 'refs';

</XMP>
<p>Only package variables are visible to symbolic references.  Lexical
variables (declared with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
) aren't in a symbol table, and thus are
invisible to this mechanism.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    local($value) = 10;
    $ref = \$value;
    {
        my $value = 20;
        print $$ref;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>This will still print 10, not 20.  Remember that 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 affects package
variables, which are all ``global'' to the package.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlref_not_so_symbolic_0">
Not-so-symbolic references</A>
</H2>
A new feature contributing to readability in 5.001 is that the brackets
around a symbolic reference behave more like quotes, just as they
always have within a string.  That is,
<p>
<XMP>
    $push = "pop on ";
    print "${push}over";

</XMP>
<p>has always meant to print ``pop on over'', despite the fact that push is
a reserved word.  This has been generalized to work the same outside
of quotes, so that
<p>
<XMP>
    print ${push} . "over";

</XMP>
<p>and even
<p>
<XMP>
    print ${ push } . "over";

</XMP>
<p>will have the same effect.  (This would have been a syntax error in
5.000, though Perl 4 allowed it in the spaceless form.)  Note that this
construct is <EM>not</EM> considered to be a symbolic reference when you're
using strict refs:
<p>
<XMP>
    use strict 'refs';
    ${ bareword };      # Okay, means $bareword.
    ${ "bareword" };    # Error, symbolic reference.

</XMP>
<p>Similarly, because of all the subscripting that is done using single
words, we've applied the same rule to any bareword that is used for
subscripting a hash.  So now, instead of writing
<p>
<XMP>
    $array{ "aaa" }{ "bbb" }{ "ccc" }

</XMP>
<p>you can just write
<p>
<XMP>
    $array{ aaa }{ bbb }{ ccc }

</XMP>
<p>and not worry about whether the subscripts are reserved words.  In the
rare event that you do wish to do something like
<p>
<XMP>
    $array{ shift }

</XMP>
<p>you can force interpretation as a reserved word by adding anything that
makes it more than a bareword:
<p>
<XMP>
    $array{ shift() }
    $array{ +shift }
    $array{ shift @_ }

</XMP>
<p>The 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch will warn you if it interprets a reserved word as a string.
But it will no longer warn you about using lowercase words, since the
string is effectively quoted.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlref_warning_0">
WARNING</A>
</H1>
You may not (usefully) use a reference as the key to a hash.  It will be
converted into a string:
<p>
<XMP>
    $x{ \$a } = $a;

</XMP>
<p>If you try to dereference the key, it won't do a hard dereference, and 
you won't accomplish what you're attemping.  You might want to do something
more like
<p>
<XMP>
    $r = \@a;
    $x{ $r } = $r;

</XMP>
<p>And then at least you can use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_values_0">values()</A>

real refs, instead of the

perlcall - Perl calling conventions from C

<A NAME="perlcall_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The purpose of this document is to show you how to call Perl subroutines
directly from C, i.e. how to write <EM>callbacks</EM>.
<p>Apart from discussing the C interface provided by Perl for writing
callbacks the document uses a series of examples to show how the
interface actually works in practice.  In addition some techniques for
coding callbacks are covered.
<p>Examples where callbacks are necessary include
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>* An Error Handler</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
You have created an XSUB interface to an application's C API.
<p>A fairly common feature in applications is to allow you to define a C
function that will be called whenever something nasty occurs. What we
would like is to be able to specify a Perl subroutine that will be
called instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>* An Event Driven Program</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
The classic example of where callbacks are used is when writing an
event driven program like for an X windows application.  In this case
your register functions to be called whenever specific events occur,
e.g. a mouse button is pressed, the cursor moves into a window or a
menu item is selected.
<p>
</DL>
Although the techniques described here are applicable when embedding.Perl in a C program, this is not the primary goal of this document.
There are other details that must be considered and are specific to
embedding Perl. For details on embedding Perl in C refer to

<A HREF="perlembed.html">
the <EM>perlembed</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>Before you launch yourself head first into the rest of this document,
it would be a good idea to have read the following two documents -

<A HREF="perlxs.html">
the <EM>perlxs</EM> manpage</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlguts.html">

<A NAME="perlcall_the_0">
THE PERL_CALL FUNCTIONS</A>
</H1>
Although this stuff is easier to explain using examples, you first need
be aware of a few important definitions.
<p>Perl has a number of C functions that allow you to call Perl
subroutines.  They are
<p>
<XMP>
    I32 perl_call_sv(SV* sv, I32 flags) ;
    I32 perl_call_pv(char *subname, I32 flags) ;
    I32 perl_call_method(char *methname, I32 flags) ;
    I32 perl_call_argv(char *subname, I32 flags, register char **argv) ;

</XMP>
<p>The key function is 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
.  All the other functions are
fairly simple wrappers which make it easier to call Perl subroutines in
special cases. At the end of the day they will all call 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>

to actually invoke the Perl subroutine.
<p>All the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> functions have a <CODE>flags</CODE> parameter which is
used to pass a bit mask of options to Perl.  This bit mask operates
identically for each of the functions.  The settings available in the
bit mask are discussed in 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_flag_0"><EM>FLAG VALUES</EM></A>
.
<p>Each of the functions will now be discussed in turn.

</STRONG>
<DD>

<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
 takes two parameters, the first, <CODE>sv</CODE>, is an SV*.
This allows you to specify the Perl subroutine to be called either as a
C string (which has first been converted to an SV) or a reference to a
subroutine. The section, 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_using_2">Using perl_call_sv</A>

<DD>
The function, 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
, is similar to 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
 except it
expects its first parameter to be a C char* which identifies the Perl
subroutine you want to call, e.g. 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv(``fred'', 0)</A>

subroutine you want to call is in another package, just include the
package name in the string, e.g. <CODE>``pkg::fred''</CODE>.

</STRONG>
<DD>
The function 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_method_0">perl_call_method</A>
 is used to call a method from a Perl
class.  The parameter <CODE>methname</CODE> corresponds to the name of the method
to be called.  Note that the class that the method belongs to is passed
on the Perl stack rather than in the parameter list. This class can be
either the name of the class (for a static method) or a reference to an
object (for a virtual method).  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>

<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_argv_0">perl_call_argv</A>
 calls the Perl subroutine specified by the C string
stored in the <CODE>subname</CODE> parameter. It also takes the usual <CODE>flags</CODE>
parameter.  The final parameter, <CODE>argv</CODE>, consists of a NULL terminated
list of C strings to be passed as parameters to the Perl subroutine.
See 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_using_3">Using perl_call_argv</A>
.
<p>
</DL>
All the functions return an integer. This is a count of the number of.items returned by the Perl subroutine. The actual items returned by the
subroutine are stored on the Perl stack.
<p>As a general rule you should <EM>always</EM> check the return value from
these functions.  Even if you are expecting only a particular number of
values to be returned from the Perl subroutine, there is nothing to
stop someone from doing something unexpected - don't say you haven't

context&gt; shows an example of this behaviour.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_g_array_0">
G_ARRAY</A>
</H2>
Calls the Perl subroutine in a list context.
<p>As with G_SCALAR, this flag has 2 effects
<p>
<OL>
<LI>it indicates to the subroutine being called that it is executing in an
array context (if it executes 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_wantarray_0">wantarray</A>
 the result will be true).
<p>
<LI>it ensures that all items returned from the subroutine will be
accessible when control returns from the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function.
<p>
</OL>
The value returned by the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function indicates how may.items have been returned by the Perl subroutine.
<p>If 0, the you have specified the G_DISCARD flag.
<p>If not 0, then it will be a count of the number of items returned by
the subroutine. These items will be stored on the Perl stack.  The
section 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_returning_1">Returning a list of values</A>
 gives an example of using the
G_ARRAY flag and the mechanics of accessing the returned items from the
Perl stack.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_g_discard_0">
G_DISCARD</A>
</H2>
By default, the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> functions place the items returned from
by the Perl subroutine on the stack.  If you are not interested in
these items, then setting this flag will make Perl get rid of them
automatically for you.  Note that it is still possible to indicate a
context to the Perl subroutine by using either G_SCALAR or G_ARRAY.
<p>If you do not set this flag then it is <EM>very</EM> important that you make
sure that any temporaries (i.e. parameters passed to the Perl
subroutine and values returned from the subroutine) are disposed of
yourself.  The section 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_returning_0">Returning a Scalar</A>
 gives details of how to
explicitly dispose of these temporaries and the section I<Using Perl to
dispose of temporaries&gt; discusses the specific circumstances where you
can ignore the problem and let Perl deal with it for you.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_g_noargs_0">
G_NOARGS</A>
</H2>
Whenever a Perl subroutine is called using one of the <EM>perl_call_*</EM>
functions, it is assumed by default that parameters are to be passed to
the subroutine.  If you are not passing any parameters to the Perl
subroutine, you can save a bit of time by setting this flag.  It has
the effect of not creating the <CODE><STRONG>@_</STRONG></CODE> array for the Perl subroutine.
<p>Although the functionality provided by this flag may seem
straightforward, it should be used only if there is a good reason to do
so.  The reason for being cautious is that even if you have specified
the G_NOARGS flag, it is still possible for the Perl subroutine that
has been called to think that you have passed it parameters.
<p>In fact, what can happen is that the Perl subroutine you have called
can access the <CODE><STRONG>@_</STRONG></CODE> array from a previous Perl subroutine.  This will
occur when the code that is executing the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function has
itself been called from another Perl subroutine. The code below
illustrates this
<p>
<XMP>
    sub fred
      { print "@_\n"  }
    sub joe
      { &fred }
    &joe(1,2,3) ;

</XMP>
<p>This will print
<p>
<XMP>
    1 2 3

</XMP>
<p>What has happened is that <CODE>fred</CODE> accesses the <CODE><STRONG>@_</STRONG></CODE> array which
belongs to <CODE>joe</CODE>.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_g_eval_0">
G_EVAL	</A>
</H2>
It is possible for the Perl subroutine you are calling to terminate
abnormally, e.g. by calling 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die</A>
 explicitly or by not actually
existing.  By default, when either of these of events occurs, the
process will terminate immediately.  If though, you want to trap this
type of event, specify the G_EVAL flag.  It will put an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval { }</A>

around the subroutine call.
<p>Whenever control returns from the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function you need to
check the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 variable as you would in a normal Perl script.
<p>The value returned from the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function is dependent on
what other flags have been specified and whether an error has
occurred.  Here are all the different cases that can occur
<p>
<UL>
<LI>If the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function returns normally, then the value
returned is as specified in the previous sections.
<p>
<LI>If G_DISCARD is specified, the return value will always be 0.
<p>
<LI>If G_ARRAY is specified <EM>and</EM> an error has occurred, the return value
will always be 0.
<p>
<LI>If G_SCALAR is specified <EM>and</EM> an error has occurred, the return value
will be 1 and the value on the top of the stack will be 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>
. This
means that if you have already detected the error by checking 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 and
you want the program to continue, you must remember to pop the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>

from the stack.
<p>
</UL>
See 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_using_0">Using G_EVAL</A>
 for details of using G_EVAL..
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_g_keeperr_0">
G_KEEPERR</A>
</H2>
You may have noticed that using the G_EVAL flag described above will
<STRONG>always</STRONG> clear the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 variable and set it to a string describing
the error iff there was an error in the called code.  This unqualified
resetting of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 can be problematic in the reliable identification of
errors using the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval {}</A>
 mechanism, because the possibility exists
that perl will call other code (end of block processing code, for
example) between the time the error causes 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 to be set within

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval {}</A>
, and the subsequent statement which checks for the value of

<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 gets executed in the user's script.
<p>This scenario will mostly be applicable to code that is meant to be
called from within destructors, asynchronous callbacks, signal
handlers, <CODE>__DIE__</CODE> or <CODE>__WARN__</CODE> hooks, and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie</A>
 functions.  In
such situations, you will not want to clear 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
 at all, but simply to
append any new errors to any existing value of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
.
<p>The G_KEEPERR flag is meant to be used in conjunction with G_EVAL in
<EM>perl_call_*</EM> functions that are used to implement such code.  This flag
has no effect when G_EVAL is not used.
<p>When G_KEEPERR is used, any errors in the called code will be prefixed
with the string ``\t(in cleanup)'', and appended to the current value
of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
.
<p>The G_KEEPERR flag was introduced in Perl version 5.002.
<p>See

As mentioned above, you can determine the context of the currently

KNOWN PROBLEMS</A>
</H1>
This section outlines all known problems that exist in the
<EM>perl_call_*</EM> functions.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>If you are intending to make use of both the G_EVAL and G_SCALAR flags
in your code, use a version of Perl greater than 5.000.  There is a bug
in version 5.000 of Perl which means that the combination of these two
flags will not work as described in the section 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_flag_0">FLAG VALUES</A>
.
<p>Specifically, if the two flags are used when calling a subroutine and
that subroutine does not call 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die</A>
, the value returned by
<EM>perl_call_*</EM> will be wrong.
<p>
<LI>In Perl 5.000 and 5.001 there is a problem with using <EM>perl_call_*</EM> if
the Perl sub you are calling attempts to trap a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die</A>
.
<p>The symptom of this problem is that the called Perl sub will continue
to completion, but whenever it attempts to pass control back to the
XSUB, the program will immediately terminate.
<p>For example, say you want to call this Perl sub
<p>
<XMP>
    sub fred
    {
        eval { die "Fatal Error" ; }
        print "Trapped error: $@\n" 
            if $@ ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>via this XSUB
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    Call_fred()
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        perl_call_pv("fred", G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS) ;
        fprintf(stderr, "back in Call_fred\n") ;

</XMP>
<p>When <CODE>Call_fred</CODE> is executed it will print
<p>
<XMP>
    Trapped error: Fatal Error

</XMP>
<p>As control never returns to <CODE>Call_fred</CODE>, the <CODE>``back in Call_fred''</CODE>
string will not get printed.
<p>To work around this problem, you can either upgrade to Perl 5.002 (or
later), or use the G_EVAL flag with <EM>perl_call_*</EM> as shown below
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    Call_fred()

EXAMPLES</A>

Enough of the definition talk, let's have a few examples.
<p>Perl provides many macros to assist in accessing the Perl stack.
Wherever possible, these macros should always be used when interfacing
to Perl internals.  Hopefully this should make the code less vulnerable
to any changes made to Perl in the future.
<p>Another point worth noting is that in the first series of examples I
have made use of only the 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>

to keep the code simpler and ease you into the topic.  Wherever
possible, if the choice is between using 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
 and

<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>

<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>

This first trivial example will call a Perl subroutine, <EM>PrintUID</EM>, to
print out the UID of the process.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub PrintUID
    {
        print "UID is $<\n" ;

<p>Simple, eh.
<p>A few points to note about this example.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Ignore <CODE>dSP</CODE> and <CODE>PUSHMARK(sp)</CODE> for now. They will be discussed in
the next example.
<p>
<LI>We aren't passing any parameters to <EM>PrintUID</EM> so G_NOARGS can be
specified.
<p>
<LI>We aren't interested in anything returned from <EM>PrintUID</EM>, so
G_DISCARD is specified. Even if <EM>PrintUID</EM> was changed to actually
return some value(s), having specified G_DISCARD will mean that they
will be wiped by the time control returns from 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
.
<p>
<LI>As 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
 is being used, the Perl subroutine is specified as a
C string. In this case the subroutine name has been 'hard-wired' into the
code.
<p>
<LI>Because we specified G_DISCARD, it is not necessary to check the value
returned from 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>

<p>
</OL>

<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_passing_0">

Now let's make a slightly more complex example. This time we want to
call a Perl subroutine, <CODE>LeftString</CODE>, which will take 2 parameters - a
string (<CODE><STRONG>$s</STRONG></CODE>) and an integer (<CODE><STRONG>$n</STRONG></CODE>).  The subroutine will simply
print the first <CODE><STRONG>$n</STRONG></CODE> characters of the string.
<p>So the Perl subroutine would look like this
<p>
<XMP>
    sub LeftString
    {
        my($s, $n) = @_ ;
        print substr($s, 0, $n), "\n" ;

</XMP>
<p>The C function required to call <EM>LeftString</EM> would look like this.

        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(b)));
        PUTBACK ;
        perl_call_pv("LeftString", G_DISCARD);
    }

</XMP>
<p>Here are a few notes on the C function <EM>call_LeftString</EM>.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Parameters are passed to the Perl subroutine using the Perl stack.
This is the purpose of the code beginning with the line <CODE>dSP</CODE> and
ending with the line <CODE>PUTBACK</CODE>.
<p>
<LI>If you are going to put something onto the Perl stack, you need to know
where to put it. This is the purpose of the macro <CODE>dSP</CODE> - it declares
and initializes a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local</A>
 copy of the Perl stack pointer.
<p>All the other macros which will be used in this example require you to
have used this macro.
<p>The exception to this rule is if you are calling a Perl subroutine
directly from an XSUB function. In this case it is not necessary to
explicitly use the <CODE>dSP</CODE> macro - it will be declared for you
automatically.
<p>
<LI>Any parameters to be pushed onto the stack should be bracketed by the
<CODE>PUSHMARK</CODE> and <CODE>PUTBACK</CODE> macros.  The purpose of these two macros, in
this context, is to automatically count the number of parameters you
are pushing. Then whenever Perl is creating the <CODE><STRONG>@_</STRONG></CODE> array for the
subroutine, it knows how big to make it.
<p>The <CODE>PUSHMARK</CODE> macro tells Perl to make a mental note of the current
stack pointer. Even if you aren't passing any parameters (like the
example shown in the section 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_no_0">No Parameters, Nothing returned</A>
) you
must still call the <CODE>PUSHMARK</CODE> macro before you can call any of the
<EM>perl_call_*</EM> functions - Perl still needs to know that there are no
parameters.
<p>The <CODE>PUTBACK</CODE> macro sets the global copy of the stack pointer to be
the same as our local copy. If we didn't do this 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>

wouldn't know where the two parameters we pushed were - remember that
up to now all the stack pointer manipulation we have done is with our
local copy, <EM>not</EM> the global copy.
<p>
<LI>The only flag specified this time is G_DISCARD. Since we are passing 2
parameters to the Perl subroutine this time, we have not specified
G_NOARGS.
<p>
<LI>Next, we come to XPUSHs. This is where the parameters actually get
pushed onto the stack. In this case we are pushing a string and an
integer.
<p>See the section <EM>``XSUB'S and the Argument Stack''</EM> for details
on how the XPUSH macros work.
<p>
<LI>Finally, <EM>LeftString</EM> can now be called via the 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>

function.

Now for an example of dealing with the items returned from a Perl

<p>Here is a Perl subroutine, <EM>Adder</EM>,  which takes 2 integer parameters
and simply returns their sum.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub Adder
    {
        my($a, $b) = @_ ;
        $a + $b ;

<p>Since we are now concerned with the return value from <EM>Adder</EM>, the C

        PUTBACK ;
        FREETMPS ;
        LEAVE ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Points to note this time are
<p>
<OL>
<LI>The only flag specified this time was G_SCALAR. That means the <CODE><STRONG>@_</STRONG></CODE>
array will be created and that the value returned by <EM>Adder</EM> will
still exist after the call to 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
.
<p>
<LI>Because we are interested in what is returned from <EM>Adder</EM> we cannot
specify G_DISCARD. This means that we will have to tidy up the Perl
stack and dispose of any temporary values ourselves. This is the
purpose of
<p>
<XMP>
    ENTER ;
    SAVETMPS ;

</XMP>
<p>at the start of the function, and
<p>
<XMP>
    FREETMPS ;
    LEAVE ;

</XMP>
<p>at the end. The <CODE>ENTER</CODE>/<CODE>SAVETMPS</CODE> pair creates a boundary for any
temporaries we create.  This means that the temporaries we get rid of
will be limited to those which were created after these calls.
<p>The <CODE>FREETMPS</CODE>/<CODE>LEAVE</CODE> pair will get rid of any values returned by
the Perl subroutine, plus it will also dump the mortal SV's we have
created.  Having <CODE>ENTER</CODE>/<CODE>SAVETMPS</CODE> at the beginning of the code
makes sure that no other mortals are destroyed.
<p>Think of these macros as working a bit like using <CODE>{</CODE> and <CODE>}</CODE> in Perl
to limit the scope of local variables.
<p>See the section 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_using_6">Using Perl to dispose of temporaries</A>
 for details of
an alternative to using these macros.
<p>
<LI>The purpose of the macro <CODE>SPAGAIN</CODE> is to refresh the local copy of the
stack pointer. This is necessary because it is possible that the memory
allocated to the Perl stack has been re-allocated whilst in the

<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
 call.
<p>If you are making use of the Perl stack pointer in your code you must
always refresh the your local copy using SPAGAIN whenever you make use
of the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> functions or any other Perl internal function.
<p>
<LI>Although only a single value was expected to be returned from <EM>Adder</EM>,
it is still good practice to check the return code from 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>

anyway.
<p>Expecting a single value is not quite the same as knowing that there
will be one. If someone modified <EM>Adder</EM> to return a list and we
didn't check for that possibility and take appropriate action the Perl
stack would end up in an inconsistent state. That is something you
<EM>really</EM> don't want to ever happen.
<p>
<LI>The <CODE>POPi</CODE> macro is used here to pop the return value from the stack.
In this case we wanted an integer, so <CODE>POPi</CODE> was used.
<p>Here is the complete list of POP macros available, along with the types
they return.
<p><UL><LI>    POPs	SV</LI>
<LI>    POPp	pointer</LI>
<LI>    POPn	double</LI>
<LI>    POPi	integer</LI>
<LI>    POPl	long</LI>
</UL>
<p>
<LI>The final <CODE>PUTBACK</CODE> is used to leave the Perl stack in a consistent
state before exiting the function.  This is necessary because when we
popped the return value from the stack with <CODE>POPi</CODE> it updated only our
local copy of the stack pointer.  Remember, <CODE>PUTBACK</CODE> sets the global
stack pointer to be the same as our local copy.

Returning a list in a scalar context</A>
</H2>
Say the Perl subroutine in the previous section was called in a scalar
context, like this
<p>
<XMP>
    static void
    call_AddSubScalar(a, b)
    int a ;
    int b ;
    {
        dSP ;
        int count ;
        int i ;
        ENTER ;
        SAVETMPS;
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(a)));
        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(b)));
        PUTBACK ;
        count = perl_call_pv("AddSubtract", G_SCALAR);
        SPAGAIN ;
        printf ("Items Returned = %d\n", count) ;
        for (i = 1 ; i <= count ; ++i)
            printf ("Value %d = %d\n", i, POPi) ;
        PUTBACK ;
        FREETMPS ;
        LEAVE ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>The other modification made is that <EM>call_AddSubScalar</EM> will print the
number of items returned from the Perl subroutine and their value (for
simplicity it assumes that they are integer).  So if
<EM>call_AddSubScalar</EM> is called
<p>
<XMP>
    call_AddSubScalar(7, 4) ;

</XMP>
<p>then the output will be
<p>
<XMP>
    Items Returned = 1
    Value 1 = 3

</XMP>
<p>In this case the main point to note is that only the last item in the
list returned from the subroutine, <EM>Adder</EM> actually made it back to
<EM>call_AddSubScalar</EM>.

<p>To be able to access the two parameters that were pushed onto the stack
after they return from

 it is necessary to make a note

<p>The reason this is necessary is that the area of the Perl stack which

<OL>
<LI>We want to be able to catch the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die</A>
 so we have used the G_EVAL
flag.  Not specifying this flag would mean that the program would
terminate immediately at the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die</A>
 statement in the subroutine
<EM>Subtract</EM>.
<p>
<LI>The code 
<p>
<XMP>
    if (SvTRUE(GvSV(errgv)))
    {
        printf ("Uh oh - %s\n", SvPV(GvSV(errgv), na)) ;
        POPs ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>is the direct equivalent of this bit of Perl
<p>
<XMP>
    print "Uh oh - $@\n" if $@ ;

</XMP>
<p><CODE>errgv</CODE> is a perl global of type <CODE>GV *</CODE> that points to the
symbol table entry containing the error.  <CODE>GvSV(errgv)</CODE> therefore
refers to the C equivalent of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
.
<p>
<LI>Note that the stack is popped using <CODE>POPs</CODE> in the block where
<CODE>SvTRUE(GvSV(errgv))</CODE> is true.  This is necessary because whenever a
<EM>perl_call_*</EM> function invoked with G_EVAL|G_SCALAR returns an error,
the top of the stack holds the value 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>
. Since we want the
program to continue after detecting this error, it is essential that
the stack is tidied up by removing the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>

<A NAME="perlcall_using_1">
Using G_KEEPERR</A>
</H2>
Consider this rather facetious example, where we have used an XS
version of the call_Subtract example above inside a destructor:
<p>
<XMP>
    package Foo;
    sub new { bless {}, $_[0] }
    sub Subtract { 
        my($a,$b) = @_;
        die "death can be fatal" if $a < $b ;
        $a - $b;
    }
    sub DESTROY { call_Subtract(5, 4); }
    sub foo { die "foo dies"; }
    package main;
    eval { Foo->new->foo };
    print "Saw: $@" if $@;             # should be, but isn't

</XMP>
<p>This example will fail to recognize that an error occurred inside the

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval {}</A>
.  Here's why: the call_Subtract code got executed while perl
was cleaning up temporaries when exiting the eval block, and since
call_Subtract is implemented with 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
 using the G_EVAL
flag, it promptly reset 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
.  This results in the failure of the
outermost test for 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__22">$@</A>
, and thereby the failure of the error trap.
<p>Appending the G_KEEPERR flag, so that the 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
 call in
call_Subtract reads:
<p>
<XMP>
        count = perl_call_pv("Subtract", G_EVAL|G_SCALAR|G_KEEPERR);

<p>will preserve the error and restore reliable error handling.

<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_using_2">
Using perl_call_sv</A>
</H2>
In all the previous examples I have 'hard-wired' the name of the Perl
subroutine to be called from C.  Most of the time though, it is more
convenient to be able to specify the name of the Perl subroutine from
within the Perl script.
<p>Consider the Perl code below
<p>
<XMP>
    sub fred
    {
        print "Hello there\n" ;
    }
    CallSubPV("fred") ;

</XMP>
<p>Here is a snippet of XSUB which defines <EM>CallSubPV</EM>.
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    CallSubPV(name)
        char *  name
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        perl_call_pv(name, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS) ;

</XMP>
<p>That is fine as far as it goes. The thing is, the Perl subroutine 
can be specified only as a string.  For Perl 4 this was adequate,
but Perl 5 allows references to subroutines and anonymous subroutines.
This is where 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
 is useful.
<p>The code below for <EM>CallSubSV</EM> is identical to <EM>CallSubPV</EM> except
that the <CODE>name</CODE> parameter is now defined as an SV* and we use

<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
 instead of 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_pv_0">perl_call_pv</A>
.
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    CallSubSV(name)
        SV *    name
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        perl_call_sv(name, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS) ;

</XMP>
<p>Since we are using an SV to call <EM>fred</EM> the following can all be used
<p>
<XMP>
    CallSubSV("fred") ;
    CallSubSV(\&fred) ;
    $ref = \&fred ;
    CallSubSV($ref) ;
    CallSubSV( sub { print "Hello there\n" } ) ;

</XMP>
<p>As you can see, 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_sv_0">perl_call_sv</A>
 gives you much greater flexibility in
how you can specify the Perl subroutine.
<p>You should note that if it is necessary to store the SV (<CODE>name</CODE> in the
example above) which corresponds to the Perl subroutine so that it can
be used later in the program, it not enough to just store a copy of the
pointer to the SV. Say the code above had been like this
<p>
<XMP>
    static SV * rememberSub ;
    void
    SaveSub1(name)
        SV *    name
        CODE:
        rememberSub = name ;
    void
    CallSavedSub1()
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        perl_call_sv(rememberSub, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS) ;

</XMP>
<p>The reason this is wrong is that by the time you come to use the
pointer <CODE>rememberSub</CODE> in <CODE>CallSavedSub1</CODE>, it may or may not still refer
to the Perl subroutine that was recorded in <CODE>SaveSub1</CODE>.  This is
particularly true for these cases
<p>
<XMP>
    SaveSub1(\&fred) ;
    CallSavedSub1() ;
    SaveSub1( sub { print "Hello there\n" } ) ;
    CallSavedSub1() ;

</XMP>
<p>By the time each of the <CODE>SaveSub1</CODE> statements above have been executed,
the SV*'s which corresponded to the parameters will no longer exist.
Expect an error message from Perl of the form
<p>
<XMP>
    Can't use an undefined value as a subroutine reference at ...

</XMP>
<p>for each of the <CODE>CallSavedSub1</CODE> lines.
<p>Similarly, with this code 
<p>
<XMP>
    $ref = \&fred ;
    SaveSub1($ref) ;
    $ref = 47 ;
    CallSavedSub1() ;

</XMP>
<p>you can expect one of these messages (which you actually get is dependant on 
the version of Perl you are using) 
<p>
<XMP>
    Not a CODE reference at ...
    Undefined subroutine &main::47 called ...

</XMP>
<p>The variable <CODE><STRONG>$ref</STRONG></CODE> may have referred to the subroutine <CODE>fred</CODE>
whenever the call to <CODE>SaveSub1</CODE> was made but by the time
<CODE>CallSavedSub1</CODE> gets called it now holds the number <CODE>47</CODE>. Since we
saved only a pointer to the original SV in <CODE>SaveSub1</CODE>, any changes to
<CODE><STRONG>$ref</STRONG></CODE> will be tracked by the pointer <CODE>rememberSub</CODE>. This means that
whenever <CODE>CallSavedSub1</CODE> gets called, it will attempt to execute the
code which is referenced by the SV* <CODE>rememberSub</CODE>.  In this case
though, it now refers to the integer <CODE>47</CODE>, so expect Perl to complain
loudly.
<p>A similar but more subtle problem is illustrated with this code
<p>
<XMP>
    $ref = \&fred ;
    SaveSub1($ref) ;
    $ref = \&joe ;
    CallSavedSub1() ;

</XMP>
<p>This time whenever <CODE>CallSavedSub1</CODE> get called it will execute the Perl
subroutine <CODE>joe</CODE> (assuming it exists) rather than <CODE>fred</CODE> as was 
originally requested in the call to <CODE>SaveSub1</CODE>.
<p>To get around these problems it is necessary to take a full copy of the
SV.  The code below shows <CODE>SaveSub2</CODE> modified to do that
<p>
<XMP>
    static SV * keepSub = (SV*)NULL ;
    void
    SaveSub2(name)
        SV *    name
        CODE:
        /* Take a copy of the callback */
        if (keepSub == (SV*)NULL)
            /* First time, so create a new SV */
            keepSub = newSVsv(name) ;
        else
            /* Been here before, so overwrite */
            SvSetSV(keepSub, name) ;
    void
    CallSavedSub2()
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        perl_call_sv(keepSub, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS) ;

</XMP>
<p>In order to avoid creating a new SV every time <CODE>SaveSub2</CODE> is called,
the function first checks to see if it has been called before.  If not,
then space for a new SV is allocated and the reference to the Perl
subroutine, <CODE>name</CODE> is copied to the variable <CODE>keepSub</CODE> in one
operation using <CODE>newSVsv</CODE>.  Thereafter, whenever <CODE>SaveSub2</CODE> is called
the existing SV, <CODE>keepSub</CODE>, is overwritten with the new value using
<CODE>SvSetSV</CODE>.

</XMP>
<p>It just implements a very simple class to manage an array.  Apart from
the constructor, <CODE>new</CODE>, it declares methods, one static and one
virtual. The static method, <CODE>PrintID</CODE>, simply prints out the class
name and a version number. The virtual method, <CODE>Display</CODE>, prints out a
single element of the array.  Here is an all Perl example of using it.
<p>
<XMP>
    $a = new Mine ('red', 'green', 'blue') ;
    $a->Display(1) ;
    PrintID Mine;

</XMP>
<p>will print
<p>
<XMP>
    1: green
    This is Class Mine version 1.0 

</XMP>
<p>Calling a Perl method from C is fairly straightforward. The following
things are required
<p>
<UL>
<LI>a reference to the object for a virtual method or the name of the class
for a static method.
<p>
<LI>the name of the method.
<p>
<LI>any other parameters specific to the method.
<p>
</UL>
Here is a simple XSUB which illustrates the mechanics of calling both.the <CODE>PrintID</CODE> and <CODE>Display</CODE> methods from C.
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    call_Method(ref, method, index)
        SV *    ref
        char *  method
        int             index
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp);
        XPUSHs(ref);
        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(index))) ;
        PUTBACK;
        perl_call_method(method, G_DISCARD) ;
    void
    call_PrintID(class, method)
        char *  class
        char *  method
        CODE:
        PUSHMARK(sp);
        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(class, 0))) ;
        PUTBACK;
        perl_call_method(method, G_DISCARD) ;

</XMP>
<p>So the methods <CODE>PrintID</CODE> and <CODE>Display</CODE> can be invoked like this
<p>
<XMP>
    $a = new Mine ('red', 'green', 'blue') ;
    call_Method($a, 'Display', 1) ;
    call_PrintID('Mine', 'PrintID') ;

</XMP>
<p>The only thing to note is that in both the static and virtual methods,
the method name is not passed via the stack - it is used as the first
parameter to 
<A HREF="perlcall.html#perlcall_perl_call_method_0">perl_call_method</A>
.
<p>

<A NAME="perlcall_using_5">

Using Perl to dispose of temporaries</A>
</H2>
In the examples given to date, any temporaries created in the callback
(i.e. parameters passed on the stack to the <EM>perl_call_*</EM> function or
values returned via the stack) have been freed by one of these methods
<p>
<UL>
<LI>specifying the G_DISCARD flag with <EM>perl_call_*</EM>.
<p>
<LI>explicitly disposed of using the <CODE>ENTER</CODE>/<CODE>SAVETMPS</CODE> -
<CODE>FREETMPS</CODE>/<CODE>LEAVE</CODE> pairing.
<p>
</UL>
There is another method which can be used, namely letting Perl do it.for you automatically whenever it regains control after the callback
has terminated.  This is done by simply not using the
<p>
<XMP>
    ENTER ;
    SAVETMPS ;
    ...
    FREETMPS ;
    LEAVE ;

</XMP>
<p>sequence in the callback (and not, of course, specifying the G_DISCARD
flag).
<p>If you are going to use this method you have to be aware of a possible
memory leak which can arise under very specific circumstances.  To
explain these circumstances you need to know a bit about the flow of
control between Perl and the callback routine.
<p>The examples given at the start of the document (an error handler and
an event driven program) are typical of the two main sorts of flow
control that you are likely to encounter with callbacks.  There is a
very important distinction between them, so pay attention.
<p>In the first example, an error handler, the flow of control could be as
follows.  You have created an interface to an external library.
Control can reach the external library like this
<p>
<XMP>
    perl --> XSUB --> external library

</XMP>
<p>Whilst control is in the library, an error condition occurs. You have
previously set up a Perl callback to handle this situation, so it will
get executed. Once the callback has finished, control will drop back to
Perl again.  Here is what the flow of control will be like in that
situation
<p>
<XMP>
    perl --> XSUB --> external library
                      ...
                      error occurs
                      ...
                      external library --> perl_call --> perl
                                                          |
    perl <-- XSUB <-- external library <-- perl_call <----+

</XMP>
<p>After processing of the error using <EM>perl_call_*</EM> is completed,
control reverts back to Perl more or less immediately.
<p>In the diagram, the further right you go the more deeply nested the
scope is.  It is only when control is back with perl on the extreme
left of the diagram that you will have dropped back to the enclosing
scope and any temporaries you have left hanging around will be freed.
<p>In the second example, an event driven program, the flow of control
will be more like this
<p>
<XMP>
    perl --> XSUB --> event handler
                      ...
                      event handler --> perl_call --> perl 
                                                       |
                      event handler <-- perl_call --<--+
                      ...
                      event handler --> perl_call --> perl 
                                                       |
                      event handler <-- perl_call --<--+
                      ...
                      event handler --> perl_call --> perl 
                                                       |
                      event handler <-- perl_call --<--+

</XMP>
<p>In this case the flow of control can consist of only the repeated
sequence
<p>
<XMP>
    event handler --> perl_call --> perl

</XMP>
<p>for the practically the complete duration of the program.  This means
that control may <EM>never</EM> drop back to the surrounding scope in Perl at
the extreme left.
<p>So what is the big problem? Well, if you are expecting Perl to tidy up
those temporaries for you, you might be in for a long wait.  For Perl
to actually dispose of your temporaries, control must drop back to the
enclosing scope at some stage.  In the event driven scenario that may
never happen.  This means that as time goes on, your program will
create more and more temporaries, none of which will ever be freed. As
each of these temporaries consumes some memory your program will
eventually consume all the available memory in your system - kapow!
<p>So here is the bottom line - if you are sure that control will revert
back to the enclosing Perl scope fairly quickly after the end of your
callback, then it isn't absolutely necessary to explicitly dispose of
any temporaries you may have created. Mind you, if you are at all
uncertain about what to do, it doesn't do any harm to tidy up anyway.

<H2> 
<A NAME="perlcall_strategies_0">
Strategies for storing Callback Context Information</A>
</H2>
<p>Potentially one of the trickiest problems to overcome when designing a
callback interface can be figuring out how to store the mapping between
the C callback function and the Perl equivalent.
<p>To help understand why this can be a real problem first consider how a
callback is set up in an all C environment.  Typically a C API will
provide a function to register a callback.  This will expect a pointer
to a function as one of its parameters.  Below is a call to a
hypothetical function <CODE>register_fatal</CODE> which registers the C function
to get called when a fatal error occurs.
<p>
<XMP>
    register_fatal(cb1) ;

</XMP>
<p>The single parameter <CODE>cb1</CODE> is a pointer to a function, so you must
have defined <CODE>cb1</CODE> in your code, say something like this
<p>
<XMP>
    static void
    cb1()
    {
        printf ("Fatal Error\n") ;
        exit(1) ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Now change that to call a Perl subroutine instead
<p>
<XMP>
    static SV * callback = (SV*)NULL;
    static void
    cb1()
    {
        dSP ;
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        /* Call the Perl sub to process the callback */
        perl_call_sv(callback, G_DISCARD) ;
    }
    void
    register_fatal(fn)
        SV *    fn
        CODE:
        /* Remember the Perl sub */
        if (callback == (SV*)NULL)
            callback = newSVsv(fn) ;
        else
            SvSetSV(callback, fn) ;
        /* register the callback with the external library */
        register_fatal(cb1) ;

</XMP>
<p>where the Perl equivalent of <CODE>register_fatal</CODE> and the callback it
registers, <CODE>pcb1</CODE>, might look like this
<p>
<XMP>
    # Register the sub pcb1
    register_fatal(\&pcb1) ;
    sub pcb1
    {
        die "I'm dying...\n" ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>The mapping between the C callback and the Perl equivalent is stored in
the global variable <CODE>callback</CODE>.
<p>This will be adequate if you ever need to have only 1 callback
registered at any time. An example could be an error handler like the
code sketched out above. Remember though, repeated calls to
<CODE>register_fatal</CODE> will replace the previously registered callback
function with the new one.
<p>Say for example you want to interface to a library which allows asynchronous
file i/o.  In this case you may be able to register a callback whenever
a read operation has completed. To be of any use we want to be able to
call separate Perl subroutines for each file that is opened.  As it
stands, the error handler example above would not be adequate as it
allows only a single callback to be defined at any time. What we
require is a means of storing the mapping between the opened file and
the Perl subroutine we want to be called for that file.
<p>Say the i/o library has a function <CODE>asynch_read</CODE> which associates a C
function <CODE>ProcessRead</CODE> with a file handle <CODE>fh</CODE> - this assumes that it
has also provided some routine to open the file and so obtain the file
handle.
<p>
<XMP>
    asynch_read(fh, ProcessRead)

</XMP>
<p>This may expect the C <EM>ProcessRead</EM> function of this form
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    ProcessRead(fh, buffer)
    int fh ;
    char *      buffer ;
    {
         ... 
    }

</XMP>
<p>To provide a Perl interface to this library we need to be able to map
between the <CODE>fh</CODE> parameter and the Perl subroutine we want called.  A
hash is a convenient mechanism for storing this mapping.  The code
below shows a possible implementation
<p>
<XMP>
    static HV * Mapping = (HV*)NULL ;
    void
    asynch_read(fh, callback)
        int     fh
        SV *    callback
        CODE:
        /* If the hash doesn't already exist, create it */
        if (Mapping == (HV*)NULL)
            Mapping = newHV() ;
        /* Save the fh -> callback mapping */
        hv_store(Mapping, (char*)&fh, sizeof(fh), newSVsv(callback), 0) ;
        /* Register with the C Library */
        asynch_read(fh, asynch_read_if) ;

</XMP>
<p>and <CODE>asynch_read_if</CODE> could look like this
<p>
<XMP>
    static void
    asynch_read_if(fh, buffer)
    int fh ;
    char *      buffer ;
    {
        dSP ;
        SV ** sv ;
        /* Get the callback associated with fh */
        sv =  hv_fetch(Mapping, (char*)&fh , sizeof(fh), FALSE) ;
        if (sv == (SV**)NULL)
            croak("Internal error...\n") ;
        PUSHMARK(sp) ;
        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(fh))) ;
        XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(buffer, 0))) ;
        PUTBACK ;
        /* Call the Perl sub */
        perl_call_sv(*sv, G_DISCARD) ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>For completeness, here is <CODE>asynch_close</CODE>.  This shows how to remove
the entry from the hash <CODE>Mapping</CODE>.
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    asynch_close(fh)
        int     fh
        CODE:
        /* Remove the entry from the hash */
        (void) hv_delete(Mapping, (char*)&fh, sizeof(fh), G_DISCARD) ;
        /* Now call the real asynch_close */
        asynch_close(fh) ;

</XMP>
<p>So the Perl interface would look like this
<p>
<XMP>
    sub callback1
    {
        my($handle, $buffer) = @_ ;
    }
    # Register the Perl callback
    asynch_read($fh, \&callback1) ;
    asynch_close($fh) ;

</XMP>
<p>The mapping between the C callback and Perl is stored in the global
hash <CODE>Mapping</CODE> this time. Using a hash has the distinct advantage that
it allows an unlimited number of callbacks to be registered.
<p>What if the interface provided by the C callback doesn't contain a
parameter which allows the file handle to Perl subroutine mapping?  Say
in the asynchronous i/o package, the callback function gets passed only
the <CODE>buffer</CODE> parameter like this
<p>
<XMP>
    void
    ProcessRead(buffer)
    char *      buffer ;
    {
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>Without the file handle there is no straightforward way to map from the
C callback to the Perl subroutine.
<p>In this case a possible way around this problem is to pre-define a
series of C functions to act as the interface to Perl, thus
<p>
<XMP>

        Map[index].PerlSub = (SV*)NULL ;
        asynch_close(fh) ;

</XMP>
<p>In this case the functions <CODE>fn1</CODE>, <CODE>fn2</CODE> and <CODE>fn3</CODE> are used to
remember the Perl subroutine to be called. Each of the functions holds
a separate hard-wired index which is used in the function <CODE>Pcb</CODE> to
access the <CODE>Map</CODE> array and actually call the Perl subroutine.
<p>There are some obvious disadvantages with this technique.
<p>Firstly, the code is considerably more complex than with the previous
example.
<p>Secondly, there is a hard-wired limit (in this case 3) to the number of
callbacks that can exist simultaneously. The only way to increase the
limit is by modifying the code to add more functions and then
re-compiling.  None the less, as long as the number of functions is
chosen with some care, it is still a workable solution and in some
cases is the only one available.
<p>To summarize, here are a number of possible methods for you to consider
for storing the mapping between C and the Perl callback
<p>
<OL>
<LI>For a lot of situations, like interfacing to an error handler, this may
be a perfectly adequate solution.
<p>
<LI>If it is impossible to tell from the parameters passed back from the C
callback what the context is, then you may need to create a sequence of C
callback interface functions, and store pointers to each in an array.
<p>
<LI>A hash is an ideal mechanism to store the mapping between C and Perl.

<A NAME="perlcall_alternate_0">
Alternate Stack Manipulation</A>
</H2>
<p>Although I have made use of only the <CODE>POP*</CODE> macros to access values
returned from Perl subroutines, it is also possible to bypass these
macros and read the stack using the <CODE>ST</CODE> macro (See 
<A HREF="perlxs.html">
the <EM>perlxs</EM> manpage</A>
 for a
full description of the <CODE>ST</CODE> macro).
<p>Most of the time the <CODE>POP*</CODE> macros should be adequate, the main
problem with them is that they force you to process the returned values
in sequence. This may not be the most suitable way to process the
values in some cases. What we want is to be able to access the stack in
a random order. The <CODE>ST</CODE> macro as used when coding an XSUB is ideal
for this purpose.
<p>The code below is the example given in the section I<Returning a list
of values&gt; recoded to use <CODE>ST</CODE> instead of <CODE>POP*</CODE>.
<p>
<XMP>
    static void
    call_AddSubtract2(a, b)

</XMP>
<p>Notes
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Notice that it was necessary to define the variable <CODE>ax</CODE>.  This is
because the <CODE>ST</CODE> macro expects it to exist.  If we were in an XSUB it
would not be necessary to define <CODE>ax</CODE> as it is already defined for
you.
<p>
<LI>The code
<p>
<XMP>
        SPAGAIN ;
        sp -= count ;
        ax = (sp - stack_base) + 1 ;

</XMP>
<p>sets the stack up so that we can use the <CODE>ST</CODE> macro.
<p>
<LI>Unlike the original coding of this example, the returned
values are not accessed in reverse order.  So <CODE>ST(0)</CODE> refers to the
first value returned by the Perl subroutine and <CODE>ST(count-1)</CODE> 
refers to the last.

<A NAME="perlembed_compiling_0">
Compiling your C program</A>
</H2>
Every C program that uses Perl must link in the <EM>perl library</EM>.  
<p>What's that, you ask?  Perl is itself written in C; the perl library
is the collection of compiled C programs that were used to create your
perl executable (<EM>/usr/bin/perl</EM> or equivalent).  (Corollary: you
can't use Perl from your C program unless Perl has been compiled on
your machine, or installed properly--that's why you shouldn't blithely
copy Perl executables from machine to machine without also copying the
<EM>lib</EM> directory.)
<p>Your C program will--usually--allocate, ``run'', and deallocate a
<EM>PerlInterpreter</EM> object, which is defined in the perl library.  
<p>If your copy of Perl is recent enough to contain this documentation
(5.002 or later), then the perl library (and <EM>EXTERN.h</EM> and
<EM>perl.h</EM>, which you'll also need) will
reside in a directory resembling this:
<p>
<XMP>
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/your_architecture_here/CORE

</XMP>
<p>or perhaps just

<p>Execute this statement for a hint about where to find CORE:
<p>
<XMP>
    perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{archlib}'

</XMP>
<p>Here's how you might compile the example in the next section,

<A HREF="perlembed.html#perlembed_adding_0"><EM>Adding a Perl interpreter to your C program</EM></A>
,
on a DEC Alpha running the OSF operating system:
<p>
<XMP>
    % cc -o interp interp.c -L/usr/local/lib/perl5/alpha-dec_osf/CORE 
    -I/usr/local/lib/perl5/alpha-dec_osf/CORE -lperl -lm

</XMP>
<p>You'll have to choose the appropriate compiler (<EM>cc</EM>, <EM>gcc</EM>, et al.)  and
library directory (<EM>/usr/local/lib/...</EM>)  for your machine.  If your
compiler complains that certain functions are undefined, or that it
can't locate <EM>-lperl</EM>, then you need to change the path following the
-L.  If it complains that it can't find <EM>EXTERN.h</EM> or <EM>perl.h</EM>, you need
to change the path following the -I.  
<p>You may have to add extra libraries as well.  Which ones?
Perhaps those printed by 
<p>
<XMP>
   perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{libs}'

<A NAME="perlembed_adding_0">
Adding a Perl interpreter to your C program</A>

In a sense, perl (the C program) is a good example of embedding Perl
(the language), so I'll demonstrate embedding with <EM>miniperlmain.c</EM>,
from the source distribution.  Here's a bastardized, non-portable version of
<EM>miniperlmain.c</EM> containing the essentials of embedding:
<p>
<XMP>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <EXTERN.h>               /* from the Perl distribution     */
    #include <perl.h>                 /* from the Perl distribution     */
    
    static PerlInterpreter *my_perl;  /***    The Perl interpreter    ***/
   
    int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)
    {
        my_perl = perl_alloc();
        perl_construct(my_perl);
        perl_parse(my_perl, NULL, argc, argv, env);
        perl_run(my_perl);
        perl_destruct(my_perl);
        perl_free(my_perl);
    }

</XMP>
<p>Now compile this program (I'll call it <EM>interp.c</EM>) into an executable:
<p>
<XMP>
    % cc -o interp interp.c -L/usr/local/lib/perl5/alpha-dec_osf/CORE 
    -I/usr/local/lib/perl5/alpha-dec_osf/CORE -lperl -lm

</XMP>
<p>After a successful compilation, you'll be able to use <EM>interp</EM> just
like perl itself:
<p>
<XMP>
    % interp
    print "Pretty Good Perl \n";
    print "10890 - 9801 is ", 10890 - 9801;
    <CTRL-D>
    Pretty Good Perl
    10890 - 9801 is 1089

</XMP>
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    % interp -e 'printf("%x", 3735928559)'
    deadbeef

</XMP>
<p>You can also read and execute Perl statements from a file while in the

    }

</XMP>
<p>where <EM>showtime</EM> is a Perl subroutine that takes no arguments (that's the
<EM>G_NOARGS</EM>) and for which I'll ignore the return value (that's the 
<EM>G_DISCARD</EM>).  Those flags, and others, are discussed in 
<A HREF="perlcall.html">
the <EM>perlcall</EM> manpage</A>

<p>I'll define the <EM>showtime</EM> subroutine in a file called <EM>showtime.pl</EM>:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "I shan't be printed.";
    
    sub showtime {
        print time;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Simple enough.  Now compile and run:

<p>If you want to pass some arguments to the Perl subroutine, or
you want to access the return value, you'll need to manipulate the

<A NAME="perlembed_evaluating_0">
Evaluating a Perl statement from your C program</A>
</H2>
NOTE: This section, and the next, employ some very brittle techniques
for evaluting strings of Perl code.  Perl 5.002 contains some nifty
features that enable A Better Way (such as with <EM>perl_eval_sv</EM>).
Look for updates to this document soon.
<p>One way to evaluate a Perl string is to define a function (we'll call 
ours <EM><EM>perl_eval()</EM></EM>) that wraps around Perl's 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1"><EM>eval</EM></A>
.
<p>Arguably, this is the only routine you'll ever need to execute
snippets of Perl code from within your C program.  Your string can be
as long as you wish; it can contain multiple statements; it can
use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0"><EM>require</EM></A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2"><EM>do</EM></A>
 to include external Perl
files.  
<p>Our <EM><EM>perl_eval()</EM></EM> lets us evaluate individual Perl strings, and then 
extract variables for coercion into C types.  The following program, 
<EM>string.c</EM>, executes three Perl strings, extracting an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_int_0">int</A>
 from
the first, a <CODE>float</CODE> from the second, and a <CODE>char *</CODE> from the third.

Fiddling with the Perl stack from your C program</A>
</H2>
When trying to explain stacks, most computer science textbooks mumble
something about spring-loaded columns of cafeteria plates: the last
thing you pushed on the stack is the first thing you pop off.  That'll
do for our purposes: your C program will push some arguments onto "the Perl
stack", shut its eyes while some magic happens, and then pop the
results--the return value of your Perl subroutine--off the stack.
   
First you'll need to know how to convert between C types and Perl
types, with <EM>newSViv()</EM> and <EM>sv_setnv()</EM> and <EM>newAV()</EM> and all their
friends.  They're described in 
<A HREF="perlguts.html">

.
<p>Then you'll need to know how to manipulate the Perl stack.  That's
described in 
<A HREF="perlcall.html">
the <EM>perlcall</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>Once you've understood those, embedding Perl in C is easy.  
<p>Since C has no built-in function for integer exponentiation, let's
make Perl's ** operator available to it (this is less useful than it

        return $a ** $b;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Now I'll create a C program, <EM>power.c</EM>, with a function
<EM><EM>PerlPower()</EM></EM> that contains all the perlguts necessary to push the

perldebug - Perl debugging
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldebug_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
First of all, have you tried using the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch?
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldebug_debugging_0">
Debugging</A>
</H2>
If you invoke Perl with a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_d_0">-d</A>
 switch, your script will be run under the
debugger.  However, the Perl debugger is not a separate program as it is
in a C environment.  Instead, the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_d_0">-d</A>
 flag tells the compiler to insert
source information into the pseudocode it's about to hand to the
interpreter.  (That means your code must compile correctly for the
debugger to work on it.)  Then when the interpreter starts up, it
pre-loads a Perl library file containing the debugger itself.  The program
will halt before the first executable statement (but see below) and ask
you for one of the following commands:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_h_0">
h</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Prints out a help message.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_t_0">
T</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Stack trace.
If you do bizarre things to your <STRONG>@_</STRONG> arguments in a subroutine, the stack
backtrace will not always show the original values.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_s_0">
s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Single step.  Executes until it reaches the beginning of another
statement.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_n_0">
n</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Next.  Executes over subroutine calls, until it reaches the beginning
of the next statement.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_f_0">
f</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Finish.  Executes statements until it has finished the current
subroutine.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_c_1">
c</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Continue.  Executes until the next breakpoint is reached.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_c_1">
c line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Continue to the specified line.  Inserts a one-time-only breakpoint at
the specified line.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_cr_0">
<CR&gt;</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Repeat last n or s.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_l_0">
l min+incr</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
List incr+1 lines starting at min.  If min is omitted, starts where
last listing left off.  If incr is omitted, previous value of incr is
used.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>l min-max</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
List lines in the indicated range.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_l_2">
l line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
List just the indicated line.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_l_3">
l</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
List previous window.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_w_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
List window (a few lines worth of code) around line.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_l_3">
l subname</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
List subroutine.  If it's a long subroutine it just lists the
beginning.  Use ``l'' to list more.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_pattern_0">
/pattern/</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Regular expression search forward in the source code for pattern; the
final / is optional.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_pattern_1">
?pattern?</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Regular expression search backward in the source code for pattern; the
final ? is optional.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_l_4">
L</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
List lines that have breakpoints or actions.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_s_1">
S</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Lists the names of all subroutines.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<DD>
Toggle trace mode on or off.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_b_0">
b line [ condition ]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint.  If line is omitted, sets a breakpoint on the line
that is about to be executed.  If a condition is specified, it is
evaluated each time the statement is reached and a breakpoint is taken
only if the condition is true.  Breakpoints may only be set on lines
that begin an executable statement.  Conditions don't use <CODE>if</CODE>:
<p>
<XMP>
    b 237 $x > 30
    b 33 /pattern/i

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_b_1">
b subname [ condition ]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set breakpoint at first executable line of subroutine.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_d_0">
d line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Delete breakpoint.  If line is omitted, deletes the breakpoint on the
line that is about to be executed.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_d_1">
D</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Delete all breakpoints.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_a_0">
a line command</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set an action for line.  A multiline command may be entered by
backslashing the newlines.  This command is Perl code, not another
debugger command.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_a_1">
A</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Delete all line actions.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug__1">
< command</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set an action to happen before every debugger prompt.  A multiline
command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug__2">
&gt; command</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set an action to happen after the prompt when you've just given a
command to return to executing the script.  A multiline command may be
entered by backslashing the newlines.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_v_0">
V package [symbols]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Display all (or some) variables in package (defaulting to the <CODE>main</CODE>
package) using a data pretty-printer (hashes show their keys and values so
you see what's what, control characters are made printable, etc.).  Make
sure you don't put the type specifier (like $) there, just the symbol
names, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    V DB filename line 

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>X [symbols] </EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Same as as ``V'' command, but within the current package.  
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug__3">
! number</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Redo a debugging command.  If number is omitted, redoes the previous
command.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>! -number</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Redo the command that was that many commands ago.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>H -number</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Display last n commands.  Only commands longer than one character are
listed.  If number is omitted, lists them all.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_q_0">
q or ^D</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Quit.  (``quit'' doesn't work for this.)
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_command_0">
command</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Execute command as a Perl statement.  A missing semicolon will be
supplied.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldebug_p_0">
p expr</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Same as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print DB::OUT expr</A>
.  The DB::OUT filehandle is opened to
/dev/tty, regardless of where STDOUT may be redirected to.
<p>
</DL>
Any command you type in that isn't recognized by the debugger will be.directly executed (
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval</A>
'd) as Perl code.  Leading white space will
cause the debugger to think it's <CODE>NOT</CODE> a debugger command.
<p>If you have any compile-time executable statements (code within a BEGIN 
block or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 statement), these will <EM>NOT</EM> be stopped by debugger,
although 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>
s will.  From your own code, however, you can transfer
control back to the debugger using the following statement, which is harmless
if the debugger is not running:
<p>
<XMP>
    $DB::single = 1;

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldebug_customization_0">
Customization</A>
</H2>
If you want to modify the debugger, copy <EM>perl5db.pl</EM> from the Perl
library to another name and modify it as necessary.  You'll also want
to set environment variable PERL5DB to say something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require "myperl5db.pl" }

</XMP>
<p>You can do some customization by setting up a <EM>.perldb</EM> file which
contains initialization code.  For instance, you could make aliases
like these (the last one in particular most people seem to expect to 
be there):
<p>
<XMP>
    $DB::alias{'len'} = 's/^len(.*)/p length($1)/';
    $DB::alias{'stop'} = 's/^stop (at|in)/b/';
    $DB::alias{'.'} = 's/^\./p '
                    . '"\$DB::sub(\$DB::filename:\$DB::line):\t"'
                    . ',\$DB::dbline[\$DB::line]/' ;

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldebug_other_0">
Other resources</A>
</H2>
You did try the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch, didn't you?
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldebug_bugs_0">
BUGS</A>
</H1>
If your program 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exit_0">exit()</A>
s or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
s, so does the debugger.
<p>There's no builtin way to restart the debugger without exiting and coming back
into it.  You could use an alias like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $DB::alias{'rerun'} = 'exec "perl -d $DB::filename"';

</XMP>
<p>But you'd lose any pending breakpoint information, and that might not
be the right path, etc.

perlre - Perl regular expressions
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlre_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
This page describes the syntax of regular expressions in Perl.  For a
description of how to actually 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 regular expressions in matching
operations, plus various examples of the same, see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_m_0">m//</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_s_0">s///</A>
 in

<A HREF="perlop.html">
the <EM>perlop</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>The matching operations can
have various modifiers, some of which relate to the interpretation of
the regular expression inside.  These are:
<p>
<XMP>
    i   Do case-insensitive pattern matching.
    m   Treat string as multiple lines.
    s   Treat string as single line.
    x   Extend your pattern's legibility with whitespace and comments.

</XMP>
<p>These are usually written as ``the <CODE>/x</CODE> modifier'', even though the delimiter
in question might not actually be a slash.  In fact, any of these
modifiers may also be embedded within the regular expression itself using
the new <CODE>(?...)</CODE> construct.  See below.
<p>The <CODE>/x</CODE> modifier itself needs a little more explanation.  It tells
the regular expression parser to ignore whitespace that is not
backslashed or within a character class.  You can use this to break up
your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts.  The <CODE>#</CODE>
character is also treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment,
just as in ordinary Perl code.  Taken together, these features go a
long way towards making Perl 5 a readable language.  See the C comment
deletion code in 
<A HREF="perlop.html">
the <EM>perlop</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlre_regular_0">
Regular Expressions</A>
</H2>
The patterns used in pattern matching are regular expressions such as
those supplied in the Version 8 regexp routines.  (In fact, the
routines are derived (distantly) from Henry Spencer's freely
redistributable reimplementation of the V8 routines.)
See 
<A HREF="perlre.html#perlre_version_0"><EM>Version 8 Regular Expressions</EM></A>
 for details.
<p>In particular the following metacharacters have their standard <EM>egrep</EM>-ish
meanings:
<p>
<XMP>
    \   Quote the next metacharacter
    ^   Match the beginning of the line
    .   Match any character (except newline)
    $   Match the end of the line (or before newline at the end)
    |   Alternation
    ()  Grouping
    []  Character class

</XMP>
<p>By default, the ``^'' character is guaranteed to match only at the
beginning of the string, the ``$'' character only at the end (or before the
newline at the end) and Perl does certain optimizations with the
assumption that the string contains only one line.  Embedded newlines
will not be matched by ``^'' or ``$''.  You may, however, wish to treat a
string as a multi-line buffer, such that the ``^'' will match after any
newline within the string, and ``$'' will match before any newline.  At the
cost of a little more overhead, you can do this by using the /m modifier
on the pattern match operator.  (Older programs did this by setting 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__5">$*</A>
,
but this practice is deprecated in Perl 5.)
<p>To facilitate multi-line substitutions, the ``.'' character never matches a
newline unless you use the <CODE>/s</CODE> modifier, which tells Perl to pretend
the string is a single line--even if it isn't.  The <CODE>/s</CODE> modifier also
overrides the setting of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__5">$*</A>
, in case you have some (badly behaved) older
code that sets it in another module.
<p>The following standard quantifiers are recognized:
<p>
<XMP>
    *      Match 0 or more times
    +      Match 1 or more times
    ?      Match 1 or 0 times
    {n}    Match exactly n times
    {n,}   Match at least n times
    {n,m}  Match at least n but not more than m times

</XMP>
<p>(If a curly bracket occurs in any other context, it is treated
as a regular character.)  The ``*'' modifier is equivalent to <CODE>{0,}</CODE>, the ``+''
modifier to <CODE>{1,}</CODE>, and the ``?'' modifier to <CODE>{0,1}</CODE>.  n and m are limited
to integral values less than 65536.
<p>By default, a quantified subpattern is ``greedy'', that is, it will match as
many times as possible without causing the rest of the pattern not to match.  
The standard quantifiers are all ``greedy'', in that they match as many
occurrences as possible (given a particular starting location) without
causing the pattern to fail.  If you want it to match the minimum number
of times possible, follow the quantifier with a ``?'' after any of them.
Note that the meanings don't change, just the ``gravity'':
<p>
<XMP>
    *?     Match 0 or more times
    +?     Match 1 or more times
    ??     Match 0 or 1 time
    {n}?   Match exactly n times
    {n,}?  Match at least n times
    {n,m}? Match at least n but not more than m times

</XMP>
<p>Since patterns are processed as double quoted strings, the following
also work:
<p>
<XMP>
    \t          tab
    \n          newline
    \r          return
    \f          form feed
    \a          alarm (bell)
    \e          escape (think troff)
    \033        octal char (think of a PDP-11)
    \x1B        hex char
    \c[         control char
    \l          lowercase next char (think vi)
    \u          uppercase next char (think vi)
    \L          lowercase till \E (think vi)
    \U          uppercase till \E (think vi)
    \E          end case modification (think vi)
    \Q          quote regexp metacharacters till \E

</XMP>
<p>In addition, Perl defines the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    \w  Match a "word" character (alphanumeric plus "_")
    \W  Match a non-word character
    \s  Match a whitespace character
    \S  Match a non-whitespace character
    \d  Match a digit character
    \D  Match a non-digit character

</XMP>
<p>Note that <CODE>\w</CODE> matches a single alphanumeric character, not a whole
word.  To match a word you'd need to say <CODE>\w+</CODE>.  You may use <CODE>\w</CODE>,
<CODE>\W</CODE>, <CODE>\s</CODE>, <CODE>\S</CODE>, <CODE>\d</CODE> and <CODE>\D</CODE> within character classes (though not
as either end of a range).
<p>Perl defines the following zero-width assertions:
<p>
<XMP>
    \b  Match a word boundary
    \B  Match a non-(word boundary)
    \A  Match only at beginning of string
    \Z  Match only at end of string (or before newline at the end)
    \G  Match only where previous m//g left off

</XMP>
<p>A word boundary (<CODE>\b</CODE>) is defined as a spot between two characters that
has a <CODE>\w</CODE> on one side of it and and a <CODE>\W</CODE> on the other side of it (in
either order), counting the imaginary characters off the beginning and
end of the string as matching a <CODE>\W</CODE>.  (Within character classes <CODE>\b</CODE>
represents backspace rather than a word boundary.)  The <CODE>\A</CODE> and <CODE>\Z</CODE> are
just like ``^'' and ``$'' except that they won't match multiple times when the
<CODE>/m</CODE> modifier is used, while ``^'' and ``$'' will match at every internal line
boundary.  To match the actual end of the string, not ignoring newline,
you can use <CODE>\Z(?!\n)</CODE>.
<p>When the bracketing construct <CODE>( ... )</CODE> is used, \&lt;digit&gt; matches the
digit'th substring.  Outside of the pattern, always use ``$'' instead of ``\''
in front of the digit.  (While the \&lt;digit&gt; notation can on rare occasion work
outside the current pattern, this should not be relied upon.  See the
WARNING below.) The scope of $&lt;digit&gt; (and 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__2">$`</A>
, <CODE>$&amp;</CODE>, and 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__3">$'</A>
)
extends to the end of the enclosing BLOCK or eval string, or to the next
successful pattern match, whichever comes first.  If you want to use
parentheses to delimit a subpattern (e.g. a set of alternatives) without
saving it as a subpattern, follow the ( with a ?.
<p>You may have as many parentheses as you wish.  If you have more
than 9 substrings, the variables <STRONG>$10</STRONG>, <STRONG>$11</STRONG>, ... refer to the
corresponding substring.  Within the pattern, \10, \11, etc. refer back
to substrings if there have been at least that many left parens before
the backreference.  Otherwise (for backward compatibility) \10 is the
same as \010, a backspace, and \11 the same as \011, a tab.  And so
on.  (\1 through \9 are always backreferences.)
<p>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__4">$+</A>
 returns whatever the last bracket match matched.  <CODE>$&amp;</CODE> returns the
entire matched string.  (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__28">$0</A>
 used to return the same thing, but not any
more.)  
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__2">$`</A>
 returns everything before the matched string.  
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__3">$'</A>
 returns
everything after the matched string.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    s/^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/;     # swap first two words
    if (/Time: (..):(..):(..)/) {
        $hours = $1;
        $minutes = $2;
        $seconds = $3;
    }

</XMP>
<p>You will note that all backslashed metacharacters in Perl are
alphanumeric, such as <CODE>\b</CODE>, <CODE>\w</CODE>, <CODE>\n</CODE>.  Unlike some other regular expression
languages, there are no backslashed symbols that aren't alphanumeric.
So anything that looks like \\, \(, \), \&lt;, \&gt;, \{, or \} is always
interpreted as a literal character, not a metacharacter.  This makes it
simple to quote a string that you want to use for a pattern but that
you are afraid might contain metacharacters.  Simply quote all the
non-alphanumeric characters:
<p>
<XMP>
    $pattern =~ s/(\W)/\\$1/g;

</XMP>
<p>You can also use the built-in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_quotemeta_0">quotemeta()</A>
 function to do this.
An even easier way to quote metacharacters right in the match operator
is to say
<p>
<XMP>
    /$unquoted\Q$quoted\E$unquoted/

</XMP>
<p>Perl 5 defines a consistent extension syntax for regular expressions.
The syntax is a pair of parens with a question mark as the first thing
within the parens (this was a syntax error in Perl 4).  The character
after the question mark gives the function of the extension.  Several
extensions are already supported:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlre_text_0">
(?#text)</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A comment.  The text is ignored.  If the <CODE>/x</CODE> switch is used to enable
whitespace formatting, a simple <CODE>#</CODE> will suffice.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlre_regexp_0">
(?:regexp)</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This groups things like ``()'' but doesn't make backrefences like ``()'' does.  So
<p>
<XMP>
    split(/\b(?:a|b|c)\b/)

A zero-width positive lookahead assertion.  For example, <CODE>/\w+(?=\t)/</CODE>
matches a word followed by a tab, without including the tab in <CODE>$&amp;</CODE>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlre_regexp_2">
(?!regexp)</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A zero-width negative lookahead assertion.  For example <CODE>/foo(?!bar)/</CODE>
matches any occurrence of ``foo'' that isn't followed by ``bar''.  Note
however that lookahead and lookbehind are NOT the same thing.  You cannot
use this for lookbehind: <CODE>/(?!foo)bar/</CODE> will not find an occurrence of
``bar'' that is preceded by something which is not ``foo''.  That's because
the <CODE>(?!foo)</CODE> is just saying that the next thing cannot be ``foo''--and
it's not, it's a ``bar'', so ``foobar'' will match.  You would have to do
something like <CODE>/(?foo)...bar/</CODE> for that.   We say ``like'' because there's
the case of your ``bar'' not having three characters before it.  You could
cover that this way: <CODE>/(?:(?!foo)...|^..?)bar/</CODE>.  Sometimes it's still
easier just to say:
<p>
<XMP>
    if (/foo/ && $` =~ /bar$/)

<DD>
One or more embedded pattern-match modifiers.  This is particularly
useful for patterns that are specified in a table somewhere, some of
which want to be case sensitive, and some of which don't.  The case
insensitive ones merely need to include <CODE>(?i)</CODE> at the front of the
pattern.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    $pattern = "foobar";
    if ( /$pattern/i )
    # more flexible:
    $pattern = "(?i)foobar";
    if ( /$pattern/ )

</XMP>
<p>
</DL>
The specific choice of question mark for this and the new minimal.matching construct was because 1) question mark is pretty rare in older
regular expressions, and 2) whenever you see one, you should stop
and ``question'' exactly what is going on.  That's psychology...
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlre_backtracking_0">
Backtracking</A>
</H2>
A fundamental feature of regular expression matching involves the notion
called <EM>backtracking</EM>.  which is used (when needed) by all regular
expression quantifiers, namely <CODE>*</CODE>, <CODE>*?</CODE>, <CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>+?</CODE>, <CODE>{n,m}</CODE>, and
<CODE>{n,m}?</CODE>.
<p>For a regular expression to match, the <EM>entire</EM> regular expression must
match, not just part of it.  So if the beginning of a pattern containing a
quantifier succeeds in a way that causes later parts in the pattern to
fail, the matching engine backs up and recalculates the beginning
part--that's why it's called backtracking.
<p>Here is an example of backtracking:  Let's say you want to find the
word following ``foo'' in the string ``Food is on the foo table.'':
<p>
<XMP>
    $_ = "Food is on the foo table.";
    if ( /\b(foo)\s+(\w+)/i ) {
        print "$2 follows $1.\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>When the match runs, the first part of the regular expression (<CODE>\b(foo)</CODE>)
finds a possible match right at the beginning of the string, and loads up
<STRONG>$1</STRONG> with ``Foo''.  However, as soon as the matching engine sees that there's
no whitespace following the ``Foo'' that it had saved in <STRONG>$1</STRONG>, it realizes its
mistake and starts over again one character after where it had had the
tentative match.  This time it goes all the way until the next occurrence
of ``foo''. The complete regular expression matches this time, and you get
the expected output of ``table follows foo.''
<p>Sometimes minimal matching can help a lot.  Imagine you'd like to match
everything between ``foo'' and ``bar''.  Initially, you write something
like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $_ =  "The food is under the bar in the barn.";
    if ( /foo(.*)bar/ ) {
        print "got <$1>\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>Which perhaps unexpectedly yields:
<p>
<XMP>
  got <d is under the bar in the >

</XMP>
<p>That's because <CODE>.*</CODE> was greedy, so you get everything between the
<EM>first</EM> ``foo'' and the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0">last</A>
 ``bar''.  In this case, it's more effective
to use minimal matching to make sure you get the text between a ``foo''
and the first ``bar'' thereafter.
<p>
<XMP>
    if ( /foo(.*?)bar/ ) { print "got <$1>\n" }
  got <d is under the >

</XMP>
<p>Here's another example: let's say you'd like to match a number at the end
of a string, and you also want to keep the preceding part the match.
So you write this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $_ = "I have 2 numbers: 53147";
    if ( /(.*)(\d*)/ ) {                                # Wrong!
        print "Beginning is <$1>, number is <$2>.\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>That won't work at all, because <CODE>.*</CODE> was greedy and gobbled up the
whole string. As <CODE>\d*</CODE> can match on an empty string the complete
regular expression matched successfully.
<p>
<XMP>
    Beginning is <I have 2: 53147>, number is <>.

</XMP>
<p>Here are some variants, most of which don't work:
<p>
<XMP>
    $_ = "I have 2 numbers: 53147";
    @pats = qw{
        (.*)(\d*)
        (.*)(\d+)
        (.*?)(\d*)
        (.*?)(\d+)
        (.*)(\d+)$
        (.*?)(\d+)$
        (.*)\b(\d+)$
        (.*\D)(\d+)$
    };
    for $pat (@pats) {
        printf "%-12s ", $pat;
        if ( /$pat/ ) {
            print "<$1> <$2>\n";
        } else {
            print "FAIL\n";
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>That will print out:
<p>
<XMP>
    (.*)(\d*)    <I have 2 numbers: 53147> <>
    (.*)(\d+)    <I have 2 numbers: 5314> <7>
    (.*?)(\d*)   <> <>
    (.*?)(\d+)   <I have > <2>
    (.*)(\d+)$   <I have 2 numbers: 5314> <7>
    (.*?)(\d+)$  <I have 2 numbers: > <53147>
    (.*)\b(\d+)$ <I have 2 numbers: > <53147>
    (.*\D)(\d+)$ <I have 2 numbers: > <53147>

</XMP>
<p>As you see, this can be a bit tricky.  It's important to realize that a
regular expression is merely a set of assertions that gives a definition
of success.  There may be 0, 1, or several different ways that the
definition might succeed against a particular string.  And if there are
multiple ways it might succeed, you need to understand backtracking in
order to know which variety of success you will achieve.
<p>When using lookahead assertions and negations, this can all get even
tricker.  Imagine you'd like to find a sequence of nondigits not 
followed by ``123''.  You might try to write that as
<p>
<XMP>
        $_ = "ABC123";
        if ( /^\D*(?!123)/ ) {                          # Wrong!
            print "Yup, no 123 in $_\n";
        }

</XMP>
<p>But that isn't going to match; at least, not the way you're hoping.  It
claims that there is no 123 in the string.  Here's a clearer picture of
why it that pattern matches, contrary to popular expectations:
<p>
<XMP>
    $x = 'ABC123' ;
    $y = 'ABC445' ;
    print "1: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(ABC)(?!123)/ ;
    print "2: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(ABC)(?!123)/ ;
    print "3: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?!123)/ ;
    print "4: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?!123)/ ;

</XMP>
<p>This prints
<p>
<XMP>
    2: got ABC
    3: got AB
    4: got ABC

</XMP>
<p>You might have expected test 3 to fail because it just seems to a more
general purpose version of test 1.  The important difference between
them is that test 3 contains a quantifier (<CODE>\D*</CODE>) and so can use
backtracking, whereas test 1 will not.  What's happening is
that you've asked "Is it true that at the start of <STRONG>$x</STRONG>, following 0 or more
nondigits, you have something that's not 123?"  If the pattern matcher had
let <CODE>\D*</CODE> expand to ``ABC'', this would have caused the whole pattern to
fail.  
The search engine will initially match <CODE>\D*</CODE> with ``ABC''.  Then it will
try to match <CODE>(?!123</CODE> with ``123'' which, of course, fails.  But because
a quantifier (<CODE>\D*</CODE>) has been used in the regular expression, the
search engine can backtrack and retry the match differently
in the hope of matching the complete regular expression.  
<p>Well now, 
the pattern really, <EM>really</EM> wants to succeed, so it uses the
standard regexp backoff-and-retry and lets <CODE>\D*</CODE> expand to just ``AB'' this
time.  Now there's indeed something following ``AB'' that is not
``123''.  It's in fact ``C123'', which suffices.
<p>We can deal with this by using both an assertion and a negation.  We'll
say that the first part in <STRONG>$1</STRONG> must be followed by a digit, and in fact, it
must also be followed by something that's not ``123''.  Remember that the
lookaheads are zero-width expressions--they only look, but don't consume
any of the string in their match.  So rewriting this way produces what
you'd expect; that is, case 5 will fail, but case 6 succeeds:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "5: got $1\n" if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/ ;
    print "6: got $1\n" if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/ ;
    6: got ABC

</XMP>
<p>In other words, the two zero-width assertions next to each other work like
they're ANDed together, just as you'd use any builtin assertions:  <CODE>/^$/</CODE>
matches only if you're at the beginning of the line AND the end of the
line simultaneously.  The deeper underlying truth is that juxtaposition in
regular expressions always means AND, except when you write an explicit OR
using the vertical bar.  <CODE>/ab/</CODE> means match ``a'' AND (then) match ``b'',
although the attempted matches are made at different positions because ``a''
is not a zero-width assertion, but a one-width assertion.
<p>One warning: particularly complicated regular expressions can take
exponential time to solve due to the immense number of possible ways they
can use backtracking to try match.  For example this will take a very long
time to run
<p>
<XMP>
    /((a{0,5}){0,5}){0,5}/

</XMP>
<p>And if you used <CODE>*</CODE>'s instead of limiting it to 0 through 5 matches, then
it would take literally forever--or until you ran out of stack space.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlre_version_0">
Version 8 Regular Expressions</A>
</H2>
In case you're not familiar with the ``regular'' Version 8 regexp
routines, here are the pattern-matching rules not described above.
<p>Any single character matches itself, unless it is a <EM>metacharacter</EM>
with a special meaning described here or above.  You can cause
characters which normally function as metacharacters to be interpreted
literally by prefixing them with a ``\'' (e.g. ``\.'' matches a ``.'', not any
character; ``\\'' matches a ``\'').  A series of characters matches that
series of characters in the target string, so the pattern <CODE>blurfl</CODE>
would match ``blurfl'' in the target string.
<p>You can specify a character class, by enclosing a list of characters
in <CODE>[]</CODE>, which will match any one of the characters in the list.  If the
first character after the ``['' is ``^'', the class matches any character not
in the list.  Within a list, the ``-'' character is used to specify a
range, so that <CODE>a-z</CODE> represents all the characters between ``a'' and ``z'',
inclusive.
<p>Characters may be specified using a metacharacter syntax much like that
used in C: ``\n'' matches a newline, ``\t'' a tab, ``\r'' a carriage return,
``\f'' a form feed, etc.  More generally, \<EM>nnn</EM>, where <EM>nnn</EM> is a string
of octal digits, matches the character whose ASCII value is <EM>nnn</EM>.
Similarly, \x<EM>nn</EM>, where <EM>nn</EM> are hexidecimal digits, matches the
character whose ASCII value is <EM>nn</EM>. The expression \c<EM>x</EM> matches the
ASCII character control-<EM>x</EM>.  Finally, the ``.'' metacharacter matches any
character except ``\n'' (unless you use <CODE>/s</CODE>).
<p>You can specify a series of alternatives for a pattern using ``|'' to
separate them, so that <CODE>fee|fie|foe</CODE> will match any of ``fee'', ``fie'',
or ``foe'' in the target string (as would <CODE>f(e|i|o)e</CODE>).  Note that the
first alternative includes everything from the last pattern delimiter
(``('', ``['', or the beginning of the pattern) up to the first ``|'', and
the last alternative contains everything from the last ``|'' to the next
pattern delimiter.  For this reason, it's common practice to include
alternatives in parentheses, to minimize confusion about where they
start and end.  Note however that ``|'' is interpreted as a literal with
square brackets, so if you write <CODE>[fee|fie|foe]</CODE> you're really only
matching <CODE>[feio|]</CODE>.
<p>Within a pattern, you may designate subpatterns for later reference by
enclosing them in parentheses, and you may refer back to the <EM>n</EM>th
subpattern later in the pattern using the metacharacter \<EM>n</EM>.
Subpatterns are numbered based on the left to right order of their
opening parenthesis.  Note that a backreference matches whatever
actually matched the subpattern in the string being examined, not the
rules for that subpattern.  Therefore, <CODE>(0|0x)\d*\s\1\d*</CODE> will
match ``0x1234 0x4321'',but not ``0x1234 01234'', since subpattern 1
actually matched ``0x'', even though the rule <CODE>0|0x</CODE> could
potentially match the leading 0 in the second number.
<p>
<H2> WARNING on \1 vs <STRONG>$1</STRONG></H2>
Some people get too used to writing things like
<p>
<XMP>
    $pattern =~ s/(\W)/\\\1/g;

</XMP>
<p>This is grandfathered for the RHS of a substitute to avoid shocking the
<STRONG>sed</STRONG> addicts, but it's a dirty habit to get into.  That's because in
PerlThink, the right-hand side of a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_s_0">s///</A>
 is a double-quoted string.  <CODE>\1</CODE> in
the usual double-quoted string means a control-A.  The customary Unix
meaning of <CODE>\1</CODE> is kludged in for 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_s_0">s///</A>
.  However, if you get into the habit
of doing that, you get yourself into trouble if you then add an <CODE>/e</CODE>
modifier.
<p>
<XMP>
    s/(\d+)/ \1 + 1 /eg;

</XMP>
<p>Or if you try to do
<p>
<XMP>
    s/(\d+)/\1000/;

</XMP>
<p>You can't disambiguate that by saying <CODE>\{1}000</CODE>, whereas you can fix it with
<CODE><STRONG>${</STRONG>1}000</CODE>.  Basically, the operation of interpolation should not be confused
with the operation of matching a backreference.  Certainly they mean two
different things on the <EM>left</EM> side of the

<A NAME="perlsec_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Perl is designed to make it easy to write secure setuid and setgid
scripts.  Unlike shells, which are based on multiple substitution
passes on each line of the script, Perl uses a more conventional
evaluation scheme with fewer hidden ``gotchas''.  Additionally, since the
language has more built-in functionality, it has to rely less upon
external (and possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its
purposes.
<p>Beyond the obvious problems that stem from giving special privileges to
such flexible systems as scripts, on many operating systems, setuid
scripts are inherently insecure right from the start.  This is because
that between the time that the kernel opens up the file to see what to
run, and when the now setuid interpreter it ran turns around and reopens
the file so it can interpret it, things may have changed, especially if
you have symbolic links on your system.
<p>Fortunately, sometimes this kernel ``feature'' can be disabled.
Unfortunately, there are two ways to disable it.  The system can simply
outlaw scripts with the setuid bit set, which doesn't help much.
Alternately, it can simply ignore the setuid bit on scripts.  If the
latter is true, Perl can emulate the setuid and setgid mechanism when it
notices the otherwise useless setuid/gid bits on Perl scripts.  It does
this via a special executable called <STRONG>suidperl</STRONG> that is automatically
invoked for you if it's needed.
<p>If, however, the kernel setuid script feature isn't disabled, Perl will
complain loudly that your setuid script is insecure.  You'll need to
either disable the kernel setuid script feature, or put a C wrapper around
the script.  See the program <STRONG>wrapsuid</STRONG> in the <EM>eg</EM> directory of your
Perl distribution for how to go about doing this.
<p>There are some systems on which setuid scripts are free of this inherent
security bug.  For example, recent releases of Solaris are like this.  On
such systems, when the kernel passes the name of the setuid script to open
to the interpreter, rather than using a pathname subject to mettling, it
instead passes /dev/fd/3.  This is a special file already opened on the
script, so that there can be no race condition for evil scripts to
exploit.  On these systems, Perl should be compiled with
<CODE>-DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW</CODE>.  The <STRONG>Configure</STRONG> program that builds
Perl tries to figure this out for itself.
<p>When executing a setuid script, or when you have turned on taint checking
explicitly using the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>
 flag, Perl takes special precautions to
prevent you from falling into any obvious traps.  (In some ways, a Perl
script is more secure than the corresponding C program.)  Any command line
argument, environment variable, or input is marked as ``tainted'', and may
not be used, directly or indirectly, in any command that invokes a
subshell, or in any command that modifies files, directories, or
processes.  Any variable that is set within an expression that has
previously referenced a tainted value also becomes tainted (even if it is
logically impossible for the tainted value to influence the variable).
For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo = shift;               # $foo is tainted
    $bar = $foo,'bar';          # $bar is also tainted
    $xxx = <>;                  # Tainted
    $path = $ENV{'PATH'};       # Tainted, but see below
    $abc = 'abc';               # Not tainted
    system "echo $foo";         # Insecure
    system "/bin/echo", $foo;   # Secure (doesn't use sh)
    system "echo $bar";         # Insecure
    system "echo $abc";         # Insecure until PATH set
    $ENV{'PATH'} = '/bin:/usr/bin';
    $ENV{'IFS'} = '' if $ENV{'IFS'} ne '';
    $path = $ENV{'PATH'};       # Not tainted
    system "echo $abc";         # Is secure now!
    open(FOO,"$foo");           # OK
    open(FOO,">$foo");          # Not OK
    open(FOO,"echo $foo|");     # Not OK, but...
    open(FOO,"-|") || exec 'echo', $foo;        # OK
    $zzz = `echo $foo`;         # Insecure, zzz tainted
    unlink $abc,$foo;           # Insecure
    umask $foo;                 # Insecure
    exec "echo $foo";           # Insecure
    exec "echo", $foo;          # Secure (doesn't use sh)
    exec "sh", '-c', $foo;      # Considered secure, alas

</XMP>
<p>The taintedness is associated with each scalar value, so some elements
of an array can be tainted, and others not.
<p>If you try to do something insecure, you will get a fatal error saying
something like ``Insecure dependency'' or ``Insecure PATH''.  Note that you
can still write an insecure system call or exec, but only by explicitly
doing something like the last example above.  You can also bypass the
tainting mechanism by referencing subpatterns--Perl presumes that if
you reference a substring using <STRONG>$1</STRONG>, <STRONG>$2</STRONG>, etc, you knew what you were
doing when you wrote the pattern:
<p>
<XMP>
    $ARGV[0] =~ /^-P(\w+)$/;
    $printer = $1;              # Not tainted

</XMP>
<p>This is fairly secure since <CODE>\w+</CODE> doesn't match shell metacharacters.
Use of <CODE>/.+/</CODE> would have been insecure, but Perl doesn't check for that,
so you must be careful with your patterns.  This is the <EM>ONLY</EM> mechanism
for untainting user supplied filenames if you want to do file operations
on them (unless you make <CODE>$&gt;</CODE> equal to <CODE>$&lt;</CODE> ).
<p>For ``Insecure <STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{PATH}'' messages, you need to set <CODE><STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{'PATH'}</CODE> to a known
value, and each directory in the path must be non-writable by the world.
A frequently voiced gripe is that you can get this message even
if the pathname to an executable is fully qualified.  But Perl can't
know that the executable in question isn't going to execute some other
program depending on the PATH.
<p>It's also possible to get into trouble with other operations that don't
care whether they use tainted values.  Make judicious use of the file
tests in dealing with any user-supplied filenames.  When possible, do
opens and such after setting <CODE>$&gt; = $&lt;</CODE>.  (Remember group IDs,
too!) Perl doesn't prevent you from opening tainted filenames for reading,
so be careful what you print out.  The tainting mechanism is intended to
prevent stupid mistakes, not to remove the need for thought.
<p>This gives us a reasonably safe way to open a file or pipe: just reset the
id set to the original IDs.  Here's a way to do backticks reasonably
safely.  Notice how the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
 is not called with a string that the shell
could expand.  By the time we get to the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0">exec()</A>
, tainting is turned off,
however, so be careful what you call and what you pass it.

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):
<p>
<XMP>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (mandatory).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (non-trappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).

</XMP>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch.  Warnings may
be captured by setting <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
Q</CODE> to a reference to a routine that will be
called on each warning instead of printing it.  See 
<A HREF="perlvar.html">
the <EM>perlvar</EM> manpage</A>
.
Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1"><EM>eval</EM></A>
.
<p>Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are denoted with a 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>
,
just as in a printf format.  Note that some message start with a 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>
!
The symbols <CODE>"%-?@</CODE> sort before the letters, while <CODE>[</CODE> and <CODE>\</CODE> sort after.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>
``my'' variable 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 can't be in a package
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make sense
to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>

if you want to localize a package variable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>``no'' not allowed in expression</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The ``no'' keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the <EM>perlmod</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>``use'' not allowed in expression</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The ``use'' keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the <EM>perlmod</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<STRONG>% </STRONG>may only be used in unpack
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, since the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other
way.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unpack_0"><EM>unpack</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 (...) interpreted as function
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list operators arguments 
found inside the parens.  See 
<A HREF="perlop.html#perlop_terms_0"><EM>Terms and List Operators (Leftward)</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 argument is not a HASH element
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The argument to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_delete_0">delete()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exists_0">exists()</A>
 must be a hash element, such as
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref->[12]->{"susie"}

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 did not return a true value
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a ``1;'', though any true value would
do.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0"><EM>require</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 found where operator expected
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.  If it
sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,
it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an operator or
delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 had compilation errors.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The final summary message when a <CODE>perl -c</CODE> fails.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 has too many errors.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 matches null string many times
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the <EM>perlre</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 never introduced
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of scope
before it could possibly have been used.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 syntax OK
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The final summary message when a <CODE>perl -c</CODE> succeeds.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 Command not found.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 Expression syntax.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 Undefined variable.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 not found
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell 
instead of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_p_0">
-P</A>
 not allowed for setuid/setgid script
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The script would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name,
which provides a race condition that breaks security.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_t_0">
-T</A>
 and <CODE>-B</CODE> not implemented on filehandles
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag__1">
500 Server error</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
See Server error.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag__2">
?+* follows nothing in regexp</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You started a regular expression with a quantifier.  Backslash it
if you meant it literally.   See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the <EM>perlre</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<STRONG>@ </STRONG>outside of string
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You had a pack template that specified an absolution position outside
the string being unpacked.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pack_0"><EM>pack</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_accept_0">
accept()</A>
 on closed fd
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_socket_0">socket()</A>
 call?  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_accept_0"><EM>accept</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Allocation too large: <STRONG>%lx</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MSDOS machine.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_arg_0">
Arg too short for msgsnd</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_msgsnd_0">msgsnd()</A>
 requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Ambiguous use of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 resolved as 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, paren pair or declaration.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_args_0">
Args must match #! line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Argument ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' isn't numeric
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that
expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Array <STRONG>@%</STRONG>s missing the <STRONG>@ </STRONG>in argument <STRONG>%d</STRONG> of <STRONG>%<</STRONG>EM>s()</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(D) Really old Perl let you omit the <STRONG>@ </STRONG>on array names in some spots.  This
is now heavily deprecated.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
assertion botched: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Assertion failed: file ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
''
</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_assignment_0">
Assignment to both a list and a scalar</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x<STRONG>%lx</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will
be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be outside any
of those arenas.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_1">
Attempt to free temp prematurely</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the <EM>free_tmps()</EM>
routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before
the <EM>free_tmps()</EM> routine gets a chance, which means that the <EM>free_tmps()</EM>
routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free
it.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_2">
Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_3">
Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it
would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.  This
could indicate that <EM>SvREFCNT_dec()</EM> was called too many times, or that
<EM>SvREFCNT_inc()</EM> was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized
when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad arg length for 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
, is <STRONG>%d</STRONG>, should be <STRONG>%d</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_msgctl_0">msgctl()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_semctl_0">semctl()</A>
 or

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_shmctl_0">shmctl()</A>
.  In C parlance, the correct sized are, respectively,
<STRONG>sizeof(struct msqid_ds *)</STRONG>, <STRONG>sizeof(struct semid_ds *)</STRONG> and
<STRONG>sizeof(struct shmid_ds *)</STRONG>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_1">
Bad associative array</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad filehandle: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol
has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
, or
did it in another package.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad <EM>free()</EM> ignored
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) An internal routine called <EM>free()</EM> on something that had never been
<EM>malloc()</EM>ed in the first place.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad name after <STRONG>%s::</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn't
finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside of quotes,
so
<p>
<XMP>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;

</XMP>
<p>is not the same as
<p>
<XMP>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = "mypack::$var";

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_5">
Bad symbol for array</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_6">
Bad symbol for filehandle</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_7">
Bad symbol for hash</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_badly_0">
Badly places ()'s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bind_0">
bind()</A>
 on closed fd
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_socket_0">socket()</A>
 call?  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bind_0"><EM>bind</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bizarre copy of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not copiable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_callback_0">
Callback called exit</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <EM>perl_call_sv()</EM>
exited by calling exit.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't ``last'' outside a block</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A ``last'' statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a
current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't count as a
``loopish'' block.  You can usually double the curlies to get the same
effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0"><EM>last</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't ``next'' outside a block</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A ``next'' statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't
count as a ``loopish'' block.  You can usually double the curlies to get
the same effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0"><EM>last</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't ``redo'' outside a block</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A ``redo'' statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't
count as a ``loopish'' block.  You can usually double the curlies to get
the same effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0"><EM>last</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't bless non-reference value</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl ``enforces''
encapsulation of objects.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_4">
Can't break at that line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) A warning intended for while running within the debugger, indicating
the line number specified wasn't the location of a statement that could
be stopped at.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't call method ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' in empty package ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
''
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't call method ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' on unblessed reference
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A method call must know what package it's supposed to run in.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but
you didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't
an object reference until it has been blessed.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the <EM>perlobj</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't call method ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' without a package or object reference
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns
neither an object reference nor a package name.  (Perhaps it's null?)
Something like this will reproduce the error:
<p>
<XMP>
    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF->process(1,2,3);

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't chdir to 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You called <CODE>perl -x/foo/bar</CODE>, but <CODE>/foo/bar</CODE> is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't coerce 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 to integer in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:
<p>
<XMP>
    *foo += 1;

</XMP>
<p>You CAN say
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;

</XMP>
<p>but then <STRONG>$foo</STRONG> no longer contains a glob.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't coerce 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 to number in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't coerce 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 to string in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_12">
Can't create pipe mailbox</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The process is suffering from exhausted quotas
or other plumbing problems.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't declare 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 in my
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Only scalar, array and hash variables may be declared as lexical variables.
They must have ordinary identifiers as names.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't do inplace edit on 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated reason.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_15">
Can't do inplace edit without backup</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You're on a system such as MSDOS that gets confused if you try reading
from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_i_0">-i</A>
<CODE>.bak</CODE>, or some
such.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't do inplace edit: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 &gt; 14 characters
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) There isn't enough room in the filename to make a backup name for the file.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't do inplace edit: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 is not a regular file
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) You tried to use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_i_0">-i</A>
 switch on a special file, such as a file in
/dev, or a FIFO.  The file was ignored.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_18">
Can't do setegid!</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_setegid_0">setegid()</A>
 call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_19">
Can't do seteuid!</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_20">
Can't do setuid</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_30">
Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference between
access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.  Under VMS,
access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so
that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.  Unfortunately, Perl
assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes
it, instead of the filespec, to the access checking routine.  It will try to
retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer,
but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_stat_1">stat()</A>

routine, since the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up and
returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking routine
knows about the Perl 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_stat_1">stat</A>
 operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever
see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal

in any of the libraries mentioned in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_inc_0">@INC</A>

(W) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates
a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a backreference
to a matched substring is only valid as part of a regular expression pattern.
Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints

(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This is

Deep recursion on subroutine ``

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "

found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
``sub'', ``package'', ``require'', or ``use'' statement.  If you're
referencing something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have
to define the subroutine or package before the current location.  You
can use an empty ``sub foo;'' or ``package FOO;'' to enter a ``forward''
declaration.

(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Since Perl may have to deal with file

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS system

(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement

<A NAME="perldiag_glob_0">
Glob not terminated</A>

<DD>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
the line, and you really meant a ``less than''.

<DT><STRONG>
Global symbol ``

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_illegal_0">
Illegal division by zero</A>

<DD>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in your

The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid,
or when you specify

<A NAME="perldiag_internal_0">
Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</A>

(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number
of times you've called 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_fork_0">fork</A>

script or a subprocess (see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exec_0"><EM>exec</EM></A>
).  Somehow, this count
has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating
this

.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Literal <STRONG>@%</STRONG>s now requires backslash
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether you wanted an
array interpolated or a literal @.  It did this when the string was
first used at runtime.  Now strings are parsed at compile time, and
ambiguous instances of <STRONG>@ </STRONG>must be disambiguated, either by putting a
backslash to indicate a literal, or by declaring (or using) the array
within the program before the string (lexically).  (Someday it will simply
assume that an unbackslashed <STRONG>@ </STRONG>interpolates an array.)

<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Missing operator before 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "

(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "

the previous line just because you saw this message.

<EM>Modification of a read-only value attempted</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a

catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }

Multidimensional syntax

<A NAME="perldiag_nested_0">

<DD>
(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parens.  So
things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.
<p>Note, however, that the minimal matching quantifiers, *?, +? and ?? appear
to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See

(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid

another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least securable.

Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_5">
No command into which to pipe on command line</A>

<DD>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the

right.

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single value of
an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).
The difference is that <STRONG>$foo</STRONG>[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while <STRONG>@foo</STRONG>[&amp;bar] behaves
like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its
subscript, which can do weird things if you're only expecting one subscript.
<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, since
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See

the user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment

This is almost always an error, because

    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.

<p>Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on

The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, since Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<CODE>perl -c</CODE> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of <STRONG>20 questions</STRONG>.

<DD>
(F) Configure couldn't find the

probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they
think the U.S. Govermnment thinks it's a secret, or at least that they

(D) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use, generally
because there's a better way to do it, and also because the old way has
bad side effects.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;``'' is deprecated</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(D) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you
wish to use a blank line as the terminator of the here-document.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Use of implicit split to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> is deprecated
</STRONG>
<DD>
(D) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber a
subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results of
a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split()</A>
 explicitly to an array (or list).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_use_7">
Use of uninitialized value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined.  It was
interpreted as a ``'' or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.  To suppress this
warning assign an initial value to your variables.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Useless use of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 in void context
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing
with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value
from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very often
this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse
your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd get this
if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said
<p>
<XMP>
    $one, $two = 1, 2;

</XMP>
<p>when you meant to say
<p>
<XMP>
    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);

</XMP>
<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say
<p>
<XMP>
    $array = (1,2);

</XMP>
<p>when you should have said
<p>
<XMP>
    $array = [1,2];

</XMP>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See

<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
 for more on this.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Variable ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' is not exported
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) While ``use strict'' in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported
by that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character
on the front of your variable.

(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead

into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Warning: unable to close filehandle 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The implicit 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_close_0">close()</A>
 done by an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 got an error indication on the 
close(0.  This usually indicates your filesystem ran out of disk space.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Warning: Use of ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' without parens is ambiguous
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks like a
binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or
unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand function
has a default argument of 1.0, and you write
<p>
<XMP>
    rand + 5;

</XMP>
<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as
<p>
<XMP>
    rand() + 5;

</XMP>
<p>but in actual fact, you got
<p>
<XMP>
    rand(+5);

</XMP>
<p>So put in parens to say what you really mean.

<A NAME="perldiag_write_0">

(W) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_x_0">
X outside of string</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being unpacked.  See

Xsub ``

<DT><STRONG>
You can't use 
<A NAME="perlrun_l_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file it
already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
Use a filename instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) And you probably never will, since you probably don't have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to use the wrapsuid script in
the eg directory to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
You need to quote ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
''
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.  Unfortunately, you
already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5
will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is
probably not what you want.  (If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
[gs]<EM>etsockopt()</EM> on closed fd
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You tried to get or set a socket option on a closed socket.
Did you forget to check the return value of your 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_socket_0">socket()</A>

See

\1 better written as <STRONG>$1</STRONG>

<DD>
(W) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.  The use
of backslashes is grandfathered on the righthand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better
if there are more than 9 backreferences.

<A NAME="perldiag__6">

<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to another
command.  You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's stopping you
from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits' output into two
streams, such as
<p>
<XMP>
    open(OUT,">$ARGV[0]") or die "Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!";

<A NAME="perltrap_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The biggest trap of all is forgetting to use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch; see

<A HREF="perlrun.html">
the <EM>perlrun</EM> manpage</A>
.  The second biggest trap is not making your entire program
runnable under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict</A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perltrap_awk_0">
Awk Traps</A>
</H2>
Accustomed <STRONG>awk</STRONG> users should take special note of the following:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The English module, loaded via
<p>
<XMP>
    use English;

</XMP>
<p>allows you to refer to special variables (like 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_rs_0">$RS</A>
) as 
though they were in <STRONG>awk</STRONG>; see 
<A HREF="perlvar.html">
the <EM>perlvar</EM> manpage</A>
 for details.
<p>
<LI>Semicolons are required after all simple statements in Perl (except
at the end of a block).  Newline is not a statement delimiter.
<p>
<LI>Curly brackets are required on <CODE>if</CODE>s and <CODE>while</CODE>s.
<p>
<LI>Variables begin with ``$'' or ``@'' in Perl.
<p>
<LI>Arrays index from 0.  Likewise string positions in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_substr_1">substr()</A>
 and

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_index_1">index()</A>
.
<p>
<LI>You have to decide whether your array has numeric or string indices.
<p>
<LI>Associative array values do not spring into existence upon mere
reference.
<p>
<LI>You have to decide whether you want to use string or numeric
comparisons.
<p>
<LI>Reading an input line does not split it for you.  You get to split it
yourself to an array.  And 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split()</A>
 operator has different
arguments.
<p>
<LI>The current input line is normally in 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
, not 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__28">$0</A>
.  It generally does
not have the newline stripped.  (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__28">$0</A>
 is the name of the program
executed.)  See 
<A HREF="perlvar.html">
the <EM>perlvar</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<LI>$&lt;<EM>digit</EM>&gt; does not refer to fields--it refers to substrings matched by
the last match pattern.
<p>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
 statement does not add field and record separators unless
you set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__9">$,</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__6">$.</A>
.  You can set 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_ofs_0">$OFS</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_ors_0">$ORS</A>
 if you're using
the English module.
<p>
<LI>You must open your files before you print to them.
<p>
<LI>The range operator is ``..'', not comma.  The comma operator works as in
C.
<p>
<LI>The match operator is ``=~'', not ``~''.  (``~'' is the one's complement
operator, as in C.)
<p>
<LI>The exponentiation operator is ``**'', not ``^''.  ``^'' is the XOR
operator, as in C.  (You know, one could get the feeling that <STRONG>awk</STRONG> is
basically incompatible with C.)
<p>
<LI>The concatenation operator is ``.'', not the null string.  (Using the
null string would render <CODE>/pat/ /pat/</CODE> unparsable, since the third slash
would be interpreted as a division operator--the tokener is in fact
slightly context sensitive for operators like ``/'', ``?'', and ``&gt;''.
And in fact, ``.'' itself can be the beginning of a number.)
<p>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exit_0">exit</A>
, and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>

C Traps</A>

Cerebral C programmers should take note of the following:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Curly brackets are required on <CODE>if</CODE>'s and <CODE>while</CODE>'s.
<p>
<LI>You must use <CODE>elsif</CODE> rather than <CODE>else if</CODE>.
<p>
<LI>The <CODE>break</CODE> and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 keywords from C become in 
Perl 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0">last</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
, respectively.
Unlike in C, these do <EM>NOT</EM> work within a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do { } while</A>
 construct.
<p>
<LI>There's no switch statement.  (But it's easy to build one on the fly.)
<p>
<LI>Variables begin with ``$'' or ``@'' in Perl.
<p>
<LI>
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_printf_1">printf()</A>
 does not implement the ``*'' format for interpolating
field widths, but it's trivial to use interpolation of double-quoted
strings to achieve the same effect.
<p>
<LI>Comments begin with ``#'', not ``/*''.
<p>
<LI>You can't take the address of anything, although a similar operator
in Perl 5 is the backslash, which creates a reference.
<p>
<LI><CODE>ARGV</CODE> must be capitalized.  <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_0">$ARGV</A>

Sharp shell programmers should take note of the following:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The backtick operator does variable interpretation without regard to
the presence of single quotes in the command.
<p>
<LI>The backtick operator does no translation of the return value, unlike <STRONG>csh</STRONG>.
<p>
<LI>Shells (especially <STRONG>csh</STRONG>) do several levels of substitution on each
command line.  Perl does substitution only in certain constructs
such as double quotes, backticks, angle brackets, and search patterns.
<p>
<LI>Shells interpret scripts a little bit at a time.  Perl compiles the
entire program before executing it (except for <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> blocks, which
execute at compile time).

<LI>The arguments are available via

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perltrap_perl_0">
Perl Traps</A>
</H2>
Practicing Perl Programmers should take note of the following:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Remember that many operations behave differently in a list
context than they do in a scalar one.  See 
<A HREF="perldata.html">
the <EM>perldata</EM> manpage</A>
 for details.
<p>
<LI>Avoid barewords if you can, especially all lower-case ones.
You can't tell just by looking at it whether a bareword is 
a function or a string.  By using quotes on strings and 
parens on function calls, you won't ever get them confused.
<p>
<LI>You cannot discern from mere inspection which built-ins
are unary operators (like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_chop_1">chop()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_chdir_0">chdir()</A>
) 
and which are list operators (like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unlink_0">unlink()</A>
).
(User-defined subroutines can <STRONG>only</STRONG> be list operators, never
unary ones.)  See 
<A HREF="perlop.html">
the <EM>perlop</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>
<LI>People have a hard time remembering that some functions
default to 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
, or 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_argv_1">@ARGV</A>
, or whatever, but that others which
you might expect to do not.  
<p>
<LI><EM>* </EM>
The &lt;FH&gt; construct is not the name of the filehandle, it is a readline
operation on that handle.  The data read is only assigned to 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 if the
file read is the sole condition in a while loop:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<FH>)      { }
    while ($_ = <FH>) { }..
    <FH>;  # data discarded!

</XMP>
<p>
<LI><EM>* </EM>
Remember not to use ``<CODE>=</CODE>'' when you need ``<CODE>=~</CODE>'';
these two constructs are quite different:
<p>
<XMP>
    $x =  /foo/;
    $x =~ /foo/;

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do {}</A>
 construct isn't a real loop that you can use 
loop control on.
<p>
<LI>Use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 for local variables whenever you can get away with 
it (but see 
<A HREF="perlform.html">
the <EM>perlform</EM> manpage</A>
 for where you can't).  
Using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 actually gives a local value to a global 
variable, which leaves you open to unforeseen side-effects
of dynamic scoping.
<p>
<LI>If you localize an exported variable in a module, its exported value will
not change.  The local name becomes an alias to a new value but the
external name is still an alias for the original.
<p>
</UL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perltrap_perl_1">
Perl4 Traps</A>
</H2>
Penitent Perl 4 Programmers should take note of the following
incompatible changes that occurred between release 4 and release 5:
<p>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>@</CODE> now always interpolates an array in double-quotish strings.  Some programs
may now need to use backslash to protect any <CODE>@</CODE> that shouldn't interpolate.
<p>
<LI>Barewords that used to look like strings to Perl will now look like subroutine
calls if a subroutine by that name is defined before the compiler sees them.
For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub SeeYa { die "Hasta la vista, baby!" }
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = SeeYa;

</XMP>
<p>In Perl 4, that set the signal handler; in Perl 5, it actually calls the
function!  You may use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch to find such places.
<p>
<LI>Symbols starting with <CODE>_</CODE> are no longer forced into package <CODE>main</CODE>, except
for 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 itself (and <STRONG>@_</STRONG>, etc.).
<p>
<LI>Double-colon is now a valid package separator in an identifier.  Thus these
behave differently in perl4 vs. perl5:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "$a::$b::$c\n";
    print "$var::abc::xyz\n";

</XMP>
<p>
<LI><CODE>s'<STRONG>$lhs</STRONG>'<STRONG>$rhs</STRONG>'</CODE> now does no interpolation on either side.  It used to
interpolate <CODE><STRONG>$lhs</STRONG></CODE> but not <CODE><STRONG>$rhs</STRONG></CODE>.
<p>
<LI>The second and third arguments of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_splice_2">splice()</A>
 are now evaluated in scalar
context (as the book says) rather than list context.
<p>
<LI>These are now semantic errors because of precedence:
<p>
<XMP>
    shift @list + 20;   
    $n = keys %map + 20; 

</XMP>
<p>Because if that were to work, then this couldn't:
<p>
<XMP>
    sleep $dormancy + 20;

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>The precedence of assignment operators is now the same as the precedence
of assignment.  Perl 4 mistakenly gave them the precedence of the associated
operator.  So you now must parenthesize them in expressions like
<p>
<XMP>
    /foo/ ? ($a += 2) : ($a -= 2);

</XMP>
<p>Otherwise
<p>
<XMP>
    /foo/ ? $a += 2 : $a -= 2;

</XMP>
<p>would be erroneously parsed as
<p>
<XMP>
    (/foo/ ? $a += 2 : $a) -= 2;

</XMP>
<p>On the other hand,
<p>
<XMP>
    $a += /foo/ ? 1 : 2;

</XMP>
<p>now works as a C programmer would expect.
<p>
<LI>
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open FOO || die</A>
 is now incorrect.  You need parens around the filehandle.
While temporarily supported, using such a construct will 
generate a non-fatal (but non-suppressible) warning.
<p>
<LI>The elements of argument lists for formats are now evaluated in list
context.  This means you can interpolate list values now.
<p>
<LI>You can't do a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_goto_2">goto</A>
 into a block that is optimized away.  Darn.
<p>
<LI>It is no longer syntactically legal to use whitespace as the name
of a variable, or as a delimiter for any kind of quote construct.
Double darn.
<p>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_caller_0">caller()</A>
 function now returns a false value in a scalar context if there
is no caller.  This lets library files determine if they're being required.
<p>
<LI><CODE>m//g</CODE> now attaches its state to the searched string rather than the
regular expression.
<p>
<LI>
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_reverse_0">reverse</A>
 is no longer allowed as the name of a sort subroutine.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>taintperl</STRONG> is no longer a separate executable.  There is now a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_t_0">-T</A>

switch to turn on tainting when it isn't turned on automatically.
<p>
<LI>Double-quoted strings may no longer end with an unescaped <CODE>$</CODE> or <CODE>@</CODE>.
<p>
<LI>The archaic <CODE>while/if</CODE> BLOCK BLOCK syntax is no longer supported.
<p>
<LI>Negative array subscripts now count from the end of the array.
<p>
<LI>The comma operator in a scalar context is now guaranteed to give a
scalar context to its arguments.
<p>
<LI>The <CODE>**</CODE> operator now binds more tightly than unary minus.  
It was documented to work this way before, but didn't.
<p>
<LI>Setting <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__13">$#</A>
array</CODE> lower now discards array elements.
<p>
<LI>
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_delete_0">delete()</A>
 is not guaranteed to return the old value for 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
d arrays,
since this capability may be onerous for some modules to implement.
<p>
<LI>The construct ``this is 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
x'' used to interpolate the pid at that
point, but now tries to dereference <STRONG>$x</STRONG>.  
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
 by itself still
works fine, however.
<p>
<LI>The meaning of foreach has changed slightly when it is iterating over a
list which is not an array.  This used to assign the list to a
temporary array, but no longer does so (for efficiency).  This means
that you'll now be iterating over the actual values, not over copies of
the values.  Modifications to the loop variable can change the original
values.  To retain Perl 4 semantics you need to assign your list
explicitly to a temporary array and then iterate over that.  For
example, you might need to change
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $var (grep /x/, @list) { ... }

</XMP>
<p>to
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $var (my @tmp = grep /x/, @list) { ... }

</XMP>
<p>Otherwise changing <CODE><STRONG>$var</STRONG></CODE> will clobber the values of <STRONG>@list</STRONG>.  (This most often
happens when you use 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
</A>
 for the loop variable, and call subroutines in
the loop that don't properly localize 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
</A>
.)
<p>
<LI>Some error messages will be different.
<p>
<LI>Some bugs may have been inadvertently removed.

perlbot - Bag'o Object Tricks (the BOT)
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perlbot_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The following collection of tricks and hints is intended to whet curious
appetites about such things as the use of instance variables and the
mechanics of object and class relationships.  The reader is encouraged to
consult relevant textbooks for discussion of Object Oriented definitions and
methodology.  This is not intended as a tutorial for object-oriented
programming or as a comprehensive guide to Perl's object oriented features,
nor should it be construed as a style guide.
<p>The Perl motto still holds:  There's more than one way to do it.

<A NAME="perlbot_oo_0">
OO SCALING TIPS</A>
</H1>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Do not attempt to verify the type of <STRONG>$self</STRONG>.  That'll break if the class is
inherited, when the type of <STRONG>$self</STRONG> is valid but its package isn't what you
expect.  See rule 5.
<p>
<LI>If an object-oriented (OO) or indirect-object (IO) syntax was used, then the
object is probably the correct type and there's no need to become paranoid
about it.  Perl isn't a paranoid language anyway.  If people subvert the OO
or IO syntax then they probably know what they're doing and you should let
them do it.  See rule 1.
<p>
<LI>Use the two-argument form of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bless_1">bless()</A>
.  Let a subclass use your constructor.
See 
<A HREF="perlbot.html#perlbot_inheriting_0"><EM>INHERITING A CONSTRUCTOR</EM></A>
.
<p>
<LI>The subclass is allowed to know things about its immediate superclass, the
superclass is allowed to know nothing about a subclass.
<p>
<LI>Don't be trigger happy with inheritance.  A ``using'', ``containing'', or
``delegation'' relationship (some sort of aggregation, at least) is often more
appropriate.  See 
<A HREF="perlbot.html#perlbot_object_0"><EM>OBJECT RELATIONSHIPS</EM></A>
, 
<A HREF="perlbot.html#perlbot_using_0"><EM>USING RELATIONSHIP WITH SDBM</EM></A>
,
and <EM>``DELEGATION''</EM>.
<p>
<LI>The object is the namespace.  Make package globals accessible via the
object.  This will remove the guess work about the symbol's home package.
See 
<A HREF="perlbot.html#perlbot_class_0"><EM>CLASS CONTEXT AND THE OBJECT</EM></A>
.
<p>
<LI>IO syntax is certainly less noisy, but it is also prone to ambiguities which
can cause difficult-to-find bugs.  Allow people to use the sure-thing OO
syntax, even if you don't like it.
<p>
<LI>Do not use function-call syntax on a method.  You're going to be bitten
someday.  Someone might move that method into a superclass and your code
will be broken.  On top of that you're feeding the paranoia in rule 2.
<p>
<LI>Don't assume you know the home package of a method.  You're making it
difficult for someone to override that method.  See 
<A HREF="perlbot.html#perlbot_thinking_0"><EM>THINKING OF CODE REUSE</EM></A>

THINKING OF CODE REUSE</A>

One strength of Object-Oriented languages is the ease with which old code

hinder code reuse and then how one can promote code reuse.
<p>This first example illustrates a class which uses a fully-qualified method
call to access the ``private'' method <EM>BAZ()</EM>.  The second example will show
that it is impossible to override the <EM>BAZ()</EM> method.

<p>Now we try to override the <EM>BAZ()</EM> method.  We would like FOO::<EM>bar()</EM> to call
GOOP::<EM>BAZ()</EM>, but this cannot happen because FOO::<EM>bar()</EM> explicitly calls
FOO::private::<EM>BAZ()</EM>.

CLASS CONTEXT AND THE OBJECT</A>
</H1>
Use the object to solve package and class context problems.  Everything a
method needs should be available via the object or should be passed as a
parameter to the method.
<p>A class will sometimes have static or global data to be used by the
methods.  A subclass may want to override that data and replace it with new
data.  When this happens the superclass may not know how to find the new
copy of the data.
<p>This problem can be solved by using the object to define the context of the
method.  Let the method look in the object for a reference to the data.  The
alternative is to force the method to go hunting for the data ("Is it in my
class, or in a subclass?  Which subclass?"), and this can be inconvenient
and will lead to hackery.  It is better to just let the object tell the
method where that data is located.

DELEGATION</A>
</H1>
Some classes, such as SDBM_File, cannot be effectively subclassed because
they create foreign objects.  Such a class can be extended with some sort of
aggregation technique such as the ``using'' relationship mentioned earlier or
by delegation.
<p>The following example demonstrates delegation using an <EM>AUTOLOAD()</EM> function to
perform message-forwarding.  This will allow the Mydbm object to behave
exactly like an SDBM_File object.  The Mydbm class could now extend the
behavior by adding custom <EM>FETCH()</EM> and <EM>STORE()</EM> methods, if this is desired.
<p>
<XMP>
        package Mydbm;
        require SDBM_File;

        @ISA = qw(Tie::Hash);
        sub TIEHASH {
                my $type = shift;
                my $ref = SDBM_File->new(@_);

                $AUTOLOAD =~ s/^Mydbm:://;

perldsc - Perl Data Structures Cookbook
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldsc_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The single feature most sorely lacking in the Perl programming language
prior to its 5.0 release was complex data structures.  Even without direct
language support, some valiant programmers did manage to emulate them, but
it was hard work and not for the faint of heart.  You could occasionally
get away with the <CODE><STRONG>$m</STRONG>{<STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>,<STRONG>$b</STRONG>}</CODE> notation borrowed from <EM>awk</EM> in which the
keys are actually more like a single concatenated string <CODE>``<STRONG>$LoL</STRONG><STRONG>$b</STRONG>''</CODE>, but
traversal and sorting were difficult.  More desperate programmers even
hacked Perl's internal symbol table directly, a strategy that proved hard
to develop and maintain--to put it mildly.
<p>The 5.0 release of Perl let us have complex data structures.  You
may now write something like this and all of a sudden, you'd have a array
with three dimensions!
<p>
<XMP>
    for $x (1 .. 10) {
        for $y (1 .. 10) {
            for $z (1 .. 10) {
                $LoL[$x][$y][$z] = 
                    $x ** $y + $z;
            }
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>Alas, however simple this may appear, underneath it's a much more
elaborate construct than meets the eye!
<p>How do you print it out?  Why can't you just say 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG></A>
?  How do
you sort it?  How can you pass it to a function or get one of these back
from a function?  Is is an object?  Can you save it to disk to read
back later?  How do you access whole rows or columns of that matrix?  Do
all the values have to be numeric?  
<p>As you see, it's quite easy to become confused.  While some small portion
of the blame for this can be attributed to the reference-based
implementation, it's really more due to a lack of existing documentation with
examples designed for the beginner.
<p>This document is meant to be a detailed but understandable treatment of
the many different sorts of data structures you might want to develop.  It should
also serve as a cookbook of examples.  That way, when you need to create one of these
complex data structures, you can just pinch, pilfer, or purloin
a drop-in example from here.
<p>Let's look at each of these possible constructs in detail.  There are separate
documents on each of the following:

</STRONG>

<p>
</DL>
But for now, let's look at some of the general issues common to all.of these types of data structures. 
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldsc_references_0">
REFERENCES</A>
</H1>
The most important thing to understand about all data structures in Perl
-- including multidimensional arrays--is that even though they might
appear otherwise, Perl <CODE><STRONG>@ARRAY</STRONG></CODE>s and <CODE><STRONG>%HASH</STRONG></CODE>es are all internally
one-dimensional.  They can only hold scalar values (meaning a string,
number, or a reference).  They cannot directly contain other arrays or
hashes, but instead contain <EM>references</EM> to other arrays or hashes.
<p>You can't use a reference to a array or hash in quite the same way that
you would a real array or hash.  For C or C++ programmers unused to distinguishing
between arrays and pointers to the same, this can be confusing.  If so,
just think of it as the difference between a structure and a pointer to a
structure.  
<p>You can (and should) read more about references in the perlref(1) man
page.  Briefly, references are rather like pointers that know what they
point to.  (Objects are also a kind of reference, but we won't be needing
them right away--if ever.)  That means that when you have something that
looks to you like an access to two-or-more-dimensional array and/or hash,
that what's really going on is that in all these cases, the base type is
merely a one-dimensional entity that contains references to the next
level.  It's just that you can 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 it as though it were a
two-dimensional one.  This is actually the way almost all C
multidimensional arrays work as well.
<p>
<XMP>
    $list[7][12]                        # array of arrays
    $list[7]{string}                    # array of hashes
    $hash{string}[7]                    # hash of arrays
    $hash{string}{'another string'}     # hash of hashes

</XMP>
<p>Now, because the top level only contains references, if you try to print
out your array in with a simple 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
 function, you'll get something
that doesn't look very nice, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    @LoL = ( [2, 3], [4, 5, 7], [0] );
    print $LoL[1][2];
  7
    print @LoL;
  ARRAY(0x83c38)ARRAY(0x8b194)ARRAY(0x8b1d0)

</XMP>
<p>That's because Perl doesn't (ever) implicitly dereference your variables.
If you want to get at the thing a reference is referring to, then you have
to do this yourself using either prefix typing indicators, like
<CODE>${<STRONG>$blah</STRONG>}</CODE>, <CODE>@{<STRONG>$blah</STRONG>}</CODE>, <CODE>@{<STRONG>$blah</STRONG>[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]}</CODE>, or else postfix pointer arrows,
like <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>-&gt;[3]</CODE>, <CODE><STRONG>$h</STRONG>-&gt;{fred}</CODE>, or even <CODE><STRONG>$ob</STRONG>-&gt;<EM>method()</EM>-&gt;[3]</CODE>.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldsc_common_0">
COMMON MISTAKES</A>
</H1>
The two most common mistakes made in constructing something like
an array of arrays is either accidentally counting the number of
elements or else taking a reference to the same memory location
repeatedly.  Here's the case where you just get the count instead
of a nested array:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @list = somefunc($i);
        $LoL[$i] = @list;       # WRONG!
    } 

</XMP>
<p>That's just the simple case of assigning a list to a scalar and getting
its element count.  If that's what you really and truly want, then you
might do well to consider being a tad more explicit about it, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @list = somefunc($i);
        $counts[$i] = scalar @list;     
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Here's the case of taking a reference to the same memory location
again and again:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @list = somefunc($i);
        $LoL[$i] = \@list;      # WRONG!
    } 

</XMP>
<p>So, just what's the big problem with that?  It looks right, doesn't it?
After all, I just told you that you need an array of references, so by
golly, you've made me one!
<p>Unfortunately, while this is true, it's still broken.  All the references
in <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG> refer to the <EM>very same place</EM>, and they will therefore all hold
whatever was last in <STRONG>@list</STRONG>!  It's similar to the problem demonstrated in
the following C program:
<p>
<XMP>
    #include <pwd.h>
    main() {
        struct passwd *getpwnam(), *rp, *dp;
        rp = getpwnam("root");
        dp = getpwnam("daemon");
        printf("daemon name is %s\nroot name is %s\n", 
                dp->pw_name, rp->pw_name);
    }

</XMP>
<p>Which will print
<p>
<XMP>
    daemon name is daemon
    root name is daemon 

</XMP>
<p>The problem is that both <CODE>rp</CODE> and <CODE>dp</CODE> are pointers to the same location
in memory!  In C, you'd have to remember to <EM>malloc()</EM> yourself some new
memory.  In Perl, you'll want to use the array constructor <CODE>[]</CODE> or the
hash constructor <CODE>{}</CODE> instead.   Here's the right way to do the preceding
broken code fragments
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @list = somefunc($i);
        $LoL[$i] = [ @list ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>The square brackets make a reference to a new array with a <EM>copy</EM>
of what's in <STRONG>@list</STRONG> at the time of the assignment.  This is what
you want.  
<p>Note that this will produce something similar, but it's
much harder to read:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @list = 0 .. $i;
        @{$LoL[$i]} = @list;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Is it the same?  Well, maybe so--and maybe not.  The subtle difference
is that when you assign something in square brackets, you know for sure
it's always a brand new reference with a new <EM>copy</EM> of the data.
Something else could be going on in this new case with the <CODE>@{<STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]}}</CODE>
dereference on the left-hand-side of the assignment.  It all depends on
whether <CODE><STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]</CODE> had been undefined to start with, or whether it
already contained a reference.  If you had already populated <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG> with
references, as in
<p>
<XMP>
    $LoL[3] = \@another_list;

</XMP>
<p>Then the assignment with the indirection on the left-hand-side would
use the existing reference that was already there:
<p>
<XMP>
    @{$LoL[3]} = @list;

</XMP>
<p>Of course, this <EM>would</EM> have the ``interesting'' effect of clobbering
<STRONG>@another_list</STRONG>.  (Have you ever noticed how when a programmer says
something is ``interesting'', that rather than meaning ``intriguing'',
they're disturbingly more apt to mean that it's ``annoying'',
``difficult'', or both?  :-)
<p>So just remember to always use the array or hash constructors with <CODE>[]</CODE>
or <CODE>{}</CODE>, and you'll be fine, although it's not always optimally
efficient.  
<p>Surprisingly, the following dangerous-looking construct will
actually work out fine:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i (1..10) {
        my @list = somefunc($i);
        $LoL[$i] = \@list;
    } 

</XMP>
<p>That's because 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 is more of a run-time statement than it is a
compile-time declaration <EM>per se</EM>.  This means that the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 variable is
remade afresh each time through the loop.  So even though it <EM>looks</EM> as
though you stored the same variable reference each time, you actually did
not!  This is a subtle distinction that can produce more efficient code at
the risk of misleading all but the most experienced of programmers.  So I
usually advise against teaching it to beginners.  In fact, except for
passing arguments to functions, I seldom like to see the gimme-a-reference
operator (backslash) used much at all in code.  Instead, I advise
beginners that they (and most of the rest of us) should try to use the
much more easily understood constructors <CODE>[]</CODE> and <CODE>{}</CODE> instead of
relying upon lexical (or dynamic) scoping and hidden reference-counting to
do the right thing behind the scenes.
<p>In summary:
<p>
<XMP>
    $LoL[$i] = [ @list ];       # usually best
    $LoL[$i] = \@list;          # perilous; just how my() was that list?
    @{ $LoL[$i] } = @list;      # way too tricky for most programmers

</XMP>
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldsc_caveat_0">
CAVEAT ON PRECEDENCE </A>
</H1>
Speaking of things like <CODE>@{<STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]}</CODE>, the following are actually the
same thing:
<p>
<XMP>
    $listref->[2][2]    # clear
    $$listref[2][2]     # confusing

</XMP>
<p>That's because Perl's precedence rules on its five prefix dereferencers
(which look like someone swearing: <CODE>$ @ * % &amp;</CODE>) make them bind more
tightly than the postfix subscripting brackets or braces!  This will no
doubt come as a great shock to the C or C++ programmer, who is quite
accustomed to using <CODE>*a[i]</CODE> to mean what's pointed to by the <EM>i'th</EM>
element of <CODE>a</CODE>.  That is, they first take the subscript, and only then
dereference the thing at that subscript.  That's fine in C, but this isn't C.
<p>The seemingly equivalent construct in Perl, <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
listref[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]</CODE> first does
the deref of <CODE><STRONG>$listref</STRONG></CODE>, making it take <STRONG>$listref</STRONG> as a reference to an
array, and then dereference that, and finally tell you the <EM>i'th</EM> value
of the array pointed to by <STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>. If you wanted the C notion, you'd have to
write <CODE>${<STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]}</CODE> to force the <CODE><STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[<STRONG>$i</STRONG>]</CODE> to get evaluated first
before the leading <CODE>$</CODE> dereferencer.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> WHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS 
<A NAME="perlfunc_use_1">
use strict</A>
</H1>
If this is starting to sound scarier than it's worth, relax.  Perl has
some features to help you avoid its most common pitfalls.  The best
way to avoid getting confused is to start every program like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;

</XMP>
<p>This way, you'll be forced to declare all your variables with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
 and
also disallow accidental ``symbolic dereferencing''.  Therefore if you'd done
this:
<p>
<XMP>
    my $listref = [
        [ "fred", "barney", "pebbles", "bambam", "dino", ],
        [ "homer", "bart", "marge", "maggie", ],
        [ "george", "jane", "alroy", "judy", ],
    ];
    print $listref[2][2];

</XMP>
<p>The compiler would immediately flag that as an error <EM>at compile time</EM>,
because you were accidentally accessing <CODE><STRONG>@listref</STRONG></CODE>, an undeclared
variable, and it would thereby remind you to instead write:
<p>
<XMP>
    print $listref->[2][2]

</XMP>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perldsc_debugging_0">
DEBUGGING</A>
</H1>
The standard Perl debugger in 5.001 doesn't do a very nice job of 
printing out complex data structures.  However, the perl5db that
Ilya Zakharevich &lt;<EM><A HREF="MAILTO:ilya@math.ohio-state.edu">ilya@math.ohio-state.edu</A></EM>&gt;
wrote, which is accessible at
<p>
<XMP>
    ftp://ftp.perl.com/pub/perl/ext/perl5db-kit-0.9.tar.gz

</XMP>
<p>has several new features, including command line editing as well
as the <CODE>x</CODE> command to dump out complex data structures.  For example, 
given the assignment to <STRONG>$LoL</STRONG> above, here's the debugger output:
<p>
<XMP>
    DB<1> X $LoL
    $LoL = ARRAY(0x13b5a0)
       0  ARRAY(0x1f0a24)
          0  'fred'
          1  'barney'
          2  'pebbles'
          3  'bambam'
          4  'dino'
       1  ARRAY(0x13b558)
          0  'homer'
          1  'bart'
          2  'marge'
          3  'maggie'
       2  ARRAY(0x13b540)
          0  'george'
          1  'jane'
          2  'alroy'
          3  'judy'

</XMP>
<p>There's also a lower-case <STRONG>x</STRONG> command which is nearly the same.

Database Ties</A>
</H1>
You cannot easily tie a multilevel data structure (such as a hash of
hashes) to a dbm file.  The first problem is that all but GDBM and
Berkeley DB have size limitations, but beyond that, you also have problems
with how references are to be represented on disk.  One experimental
module that does attempt to partially address this need is the MLDBM
module.  Check your nearest CPAN site as described in 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the <EM>perlmod</EM> manpage</A>
 for
source code to MLDBM.

<A NAME="perllol_declaration_0">
Declaration and Access of Lists of Lists</A>
</H1>
The simplest thing to build is a list of lists (sometimes called an array
of arrays).  It's reasonably easy to understand, and almost everything
that applies here will also be applicable later on with the fancier data
structures.
<p>A list of lists, or an array of an array if you would, is just a regular
old array <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG> that you can get at with two subscripts, like <STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[3][2].  Here's
a declaration of the array:
<p>
<XMP>
    # assign to our array a list of list references
    @LoL = ( 
           [ "fred", "barney" ],
           [ "george", "jane", "elroy" ],
           [ "homer", "marge", "bart" ],
    );
    print $LoL[2][2];
  bart

</XMP>
<p>Now you should be very careful that the outer bracket type
is a round one, that is, parentheses.  That's because you're assigning to
an <STRONG>@list</STRONG>, so you need parens.  If you wanted there <EM>not</EM> to be an <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG>,
but rather just a reference to it, you could do something more like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    # assign a reference to list of list references
    $ref_to_LoL = [
        [ "fred", "barney", "pebbles", "bambam", "dino", ],
        [ "homer", "bart", "marge", "maggie", ],
        [ "george", "jane", "alroy", "judy", ],
    ];
    print $ref_to_LoL->[2][2];

</XMP>
<p>Notice that the outer bracket type has changed, and so our access syntax 
has also changed.  That's because unlike C, in perl you can't freely
interchange arrays and references thereto.  <STRONG>$ref_to_LoL</STRONG> is a reference to an 
array, whereas <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG> is an array proper.  Likewise, <STRONG>$LoL</STRONG>[2] is not an 
array, but an array ref.  So how come you can write these:
<p>
<XMP>
    $LoL[2][2]
    $ref_to_LoL->[2][2]

</XMP>
<p>instead of having to write these:
<p>
<XMP>
    $LoL[2]->[2]
    $ref_to_LoL->[2]->[2]

</XMP>
<p>Well, that's because the rule is that on adjacent brackets only (whether
square or curly), you are free to omit the pointer dereferencing array.
But you need not do so for the very first one if it's a scalar containing
a reference, which means that <STRONG>$ref_to_LoL</STRONG> always needs it.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="perllol_growing_0">
Growing Your Own</A>
</H1>
That's all well and good for declaration of a fixed data structure,
but what if you wanted to add new elements on the fly, or build
it up entirely from scratch?
<p>First, let's look at reading it in from a file.  This is something like
adding a row at a time.  We'll assume that there's a flat file in which
each line is a row and each word an element.  If you're trying to develop an
<STRONG>@LoL</STRONG> list containing all these, here's the right way to do that:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        @tmp = split;
        push @LoL, [ @tmp ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>You might also have loaded that from a function:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        $LoL[$i] = [ somefunc($i) ];
    }

</XMP>
<p>Or you might have had a temporary variable sitting around with the
list in it.  
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        @tmp = somefunc($i);
        $LoL[$i] = [ @tmp ];
    }

</XMP>
<p>It's very important that you make sure to use the <CODE>[]</CODE> list reference
constructor.  That's because this will be very wrong:
<p>
<XMP>
    $LoL[$i] = @tmp;

</XMP>
<p>You see, assigning a named list like that to a scalar just counts the 
number of elements in <STRONG>@tmp</STRONG>, which probably isn't what you want.  
<p>If you are running under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict</A>
, you'll have to add some
declarations to make it happy:
<p>
<XMP>
    use strict;
    my(@LoL, @tmp);
    while (<>) {
        @tmp = split;
        push @LoL, [ @tmp ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Of course, you don't need the temporary array to have a name at all:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        push @LoL, [ split ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>You also don't have to use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push()</A>
.  You could just make a direct assignment
if you knew where you wanted to put it:
<p>
<XMP>
    my (@LoL, $i, $line);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) 
        $line = <>;
        $LoL[$i] = [ split ' ', $line ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>or even just
<p>
<XMP>
    my (@LoL, $i);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) 
        $LoL[$i] = [ split ' ', <> ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>You should in general be leary of using potential list functions
in a scalar context without explicitly stating such.  
This would be clearer to the casual reader:
<p>
<XMP>
    my (@LoL, $i);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) 
        $LoL[$i] = [ split ' ', scalar(<>) ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>If you wanted to have a <STRONG>$ref_to_LoL</STRONG> variable as a reference to an array,
you'd have to do something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        push @$ref_to_LoL, [ split ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Actually, if you were using strict, you'd not only have to declare <STRONG>$ref_to_LoL</STRONG> as
you had to declare <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG>, but you'd <EM>also</EM> having to initialize it to a
reference to an empty list.  (This was a bug in 5.001m that's been fixed
for the 5.002 release.)
<p>
<XMP>
    my $ref_to_LoL = [];
    while (<>) {
        push @$ref_to_LoL, [ split ];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Ok, now you can add new rows.  What about adding new columns?  If you're
just dealing with matrices, it's often easiest to use simple assignment:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $x (1 .. 10) {
        for $y (1 .. 10) {
            $LoL[$x][$y] = func($x, $y);
        }
    }
    for $x ( 3, 7, 9 ) {
        $LoL[$x][20] += func2($x);
    } 

</XMP>
<p>It doesn't matter whether those elements are already 
there or not: it'll gladly create them for you, setting
intervening elements to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>
 as need be.
<p>If you just wanted to append to a row, you'd have
to do something a bit funnier looking:
<p>
<XMP>
    # add new columns to an existing row
    push @{ $LoL[0] }, "wilma", "betty";

</XMP>
<p>Notice that I <EM>couldn't</EM> just say:
<p>
<XMP>
    push $LoL[0], "wilma", "betty";  # WRONG!

</XMP>
<p>In fact, that wouldn't even compile.  How come?  Because the argument
to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push()</A>
 must be a real array, not just a reference to such.

<A NAME="perllol_access_0">
Access and Printing</A>
</H1>
Now it's time to print your data structure out.  How 
are you going to do that?  Well, if you only want one
of the elements, it's trivial:
<p>
<XMP>
    print $LoL[0][0];

</XMP>
<p>If you want to print the whole thing, though, you can't
just say 
<p>
<XMP>
    print @LoL;         # WRONG

</XMP>
<p>because you'll just get references listed, and perl will never
automatically dereference things for you.  Instead, you have to 
roll yourself a loop or two.  This prints the whole structure,
using the shell-style <EM>for()</EM> construct to loop across the outer
set of subscripts.  
<p>
<XMP>
    for $aref ( @LoL ) {
        print "\t [ @$aref ],\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>If you wanted to keep track of subscripts, you might do this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#LoL ) {
        print "\t elt $i is [ @{$LoL[$i]} ],\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>or maybe even this.  Notice the inner loop.
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#LoL ) {
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$LoL[$i]} ) {
            print "elt $i $j is $LoL[$i][$j]\n";
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated.  That's why 
sometimes is easier to take a temporary on your way through:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#LoL ) {
        $aref = $LoL[$i];
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$aref} ) {
            print "elt $i $j is $LoL[$i][$j]\n";
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>Hm... that's still a bit ugly.  How about this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#LoL ) {
        $aref = $LoL[$i];
        $n = @$aref - 1;
        for $j ( 0 .. $n ) {
            print "elt $i $j is $LoL[$i][$j]\n";
        }
    }

<A NAME="perllol_slices_0">
Slices</A>
</H1>
If you want to get at a slide (part of a row) in a multidimensional
array, you're going to have to do some fancy subscripting.  That's
because while we have a nice synonym for single elements via the
pointer arrow for dereferencing, no such convenience exists for slices.
(Remember, of course, that you can always write a loop to do a slice
operation.)
<p>Here's how to do one operation using a loop.  We'll assume an <STRONG>@LoL</STRONG>
variable as before.
<p>
<XMP>
    @part = ();
    $x = 4;     
    for ($y = 7; $y < 13; $y++) {
        push @part, $LoL[$x][$y];
    } 

</XMP>
<p>That same loop could be replaced with a slice operation:
<p>
<XMP>
    @part = @{ $LoL[4] } [ 7..12 ];

</XMP>
<p>but as you might well imagine, this is pretty rough on the reader.
<p>Ah, but what if you wanted a <EM>two-dimensional slice</EM>, such as having
<STRONG>$x</STRONG> run from 4..8 and <STRONG>$y</STRONG> run from 7 to 12?  Hm... here's the simple way:
<p>
<XMP>
    @newLoL = ();
    for ($startx = $x = 4; $x <= 8; $x++) {
        for ($starty = $y = 7; $x <= 12; $y++) {
            $newLoL[$x - $startx][$y - $starty] = $LoL[$x][$y];
        }
    } 

</XMP>
<p>We can reduce some of the looping through slices 
<p>
<XMP>
    for ($x = 4; $x <= 8; $x++) {
        push @newLoL, [ @{ $LoL[$x] } [ 7..12 ] ];
    }

</XMP>
<p>If you were into Schwartzian Transforms, you would probably
have selected map for that
<p>
<XMP>
    @newLoL = map { [ @{ $LoL[$_] } [ 7..12 ] ] } 4 .. 8;

</XMP>
<p>Although if your manager accused of seeking job security (or rapid
insecurity) through inscrutable code, it would be hard to argue. :-)
If I were you, I'd put that in a function:
<p>
<XMP>
    @newLoL = splice_2D( \@LoL, 4 => 8, 7 => 12 );
    sub splice_2D {
        my $lrr = shift;        # ref to list of list refs!
        my ($x_lo, $x_hi, 
            $y_lo, $y_hi) = @_;
        return map { 
            [ @{ $lrr->[$_] } [ $y_lo .. $y_hi ] ] 
        } $x_lo .. $x_hi;
    }

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldata_variable_0">
Variable names</A>
</H2>
Perl has three data structures: scalars, arrays of scalars, and
associative arrays of scalars, known as ``hashes''.  Normal arrays are
indexed by number, starting with 0.  (Negative subscripts count from
the end.)  Hash arrays are indexed by string.
<p>Scalar values are always named with '$', even when referring to a scalar
that is part of an array.  It works like the English word ``the''.  Thus
we have:
<p>
<XMP>
    $days               # the simple scalar value "days"
    $days[28]           # the 29th element of array @days
    $days{'Feb'}        # the 'Feb' value from hash %days
    $#days              # the last index of array @days

</XMP>
<p>but entire arrays or array slices are denoted by '@', which works much like
the word ``these'' or ``those'':
<p>
<XMP>
    @days               # ($days[0], $days[1],... $days[n])
    @days[3,4,5]        # same as @days[3..5]
    @days{'a','c'}      # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})

</XMP>
<p>and entire hashes are denoted by '%':
<p>
<XMP>
    %days               # (key1, val1, key2, val2 ...)

</XMP>
<p>In addition, subroutines are named with an initial '&amp;', though this is
optional when it's otherwise unambiguous (just as ``do'' is often
redundant in English).  Symbol table entries can be named with an
initial '*', but you don't really care about that yet.
<p>Every variable type has its own namespace.  You can, without fear of
conflict, use the same name for a scalar variable, an array, or a hash
(or, for that matter, a filehandle, a subroutine name, or a label).
This means that <STRONG>$foo</STRONG> and <STRONG>@foo</STRONG> are two different variables.  It also
means that <CODE><STRONG>$foo</STRONG>[1]</CODE> is a part of <STRONG>@foo</STRONG>, not a part of <STRONG>$foo</STRONG>.  This may
seem a bit weird, but that's okay, because it is weird.
<p>Since variable and array references always start with '$', '@', or '%',
the ``reserved'' words aren't in fact reserved with respect to variable
names.  (They ARE reserved with respect to labels and filehandles,
however, which don't have an initial special character.  You can't have
a filehandle named ``log'', for instance.  Hint: you could say

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open(LOG,'logfile')</A>
 rather than 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open(log,'logfile')</A>
.  Using uppercase
filehandles also improves readability and protects you from conflict
with future reserved words.)  Case <EM>IS</EM> significant--``FOO'', ``Foo'' and
``foo'' are all different names.  Names that start with a letter or
underscore may also contain digits and underscores.
<p>It is possible to replace such an alphanumeric name with an expression
that returns a reference to an object of that type.  For a description
of this, see 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>Names that start with a digit may only contain more digits.  Names
which do not start with a letter, underscore,  or digit are limited to
one character, e.g.  
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__14">$%</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
.  (Most of these one character names
have a predefined significance to Perl.  For instance, 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
 is the
current process id.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldata_context_0">
Context</A>
</H2>
The interpretation of operations and values in Perl sometimes depends
on the requirements of the context around the operation or value.
There are two major contexts: scalar and list.  Certain operations
return list values in contexts wanting a list, and scalar values
otherwise.  (If this is true of an operation it will be mentioned in
the documentation for that operation.)  In other words, Perl overloads
certain operations based on whether the expected return value is
singular or plural.  (Some words in English work this way, like ``fish''
and ``sheep''.)
<p>In a reciprocal fashion, an operation provides either a scalar or a
list context to each of its arguments.  For example, if you say
<p>
<XMP>
    int( <STDIN> )

</XMP>
<p>the integer operation provides a scalar context for the &lt;STDIN&gt;
operator, which responds by reading one line from STDIN and passing it
back to the integer operation, which will then find the integer value
of that line and return that.  If, on the other hand, you say
<p>
<XMP>
    sort( <STDIN> )

</XMP>
<p>then the sort operation provides a list context for &lt;STDIN&gt;, which
will proceed to read every line available up to the end of file, and
pass that list of lines back to the sort routine, which will then
sort those lines and return them as a list to whatever the context
of the sort was.
<p>Assignment is a little bit special in that it uses its left argument to
determine the context for the right argument.  Assignment to a scalar
evaluates the righthand side in a scalar context, while assignment to
an array or array slice evaluates the righthand side in a list
context.  Assignment to a list also evaluates the righthand side in a
list context.
<p>User defined subroutines may choose to care whether they are being
called in a scalar or list context, but most subroutines do not
need to care, because scalars are automatically interpolated into
lists.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_wantarray_0"><EM>wantarray</EM></A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldata_scalar_0">
Scalar values</A>
</H2>
All data in Perl is a scalar or an array of scalars or a hash of scalars.
Scalar variables may contain various kinds of singular data, such as
numbers, strings, and references.  In general, conversion from one form to
another is transparent.  (A scalar may not contain multiple values, but
may contain a reference to an array or hash containing multiple values.)
Because of the automatic conversion of scalars, operations and functions
that return scalars don't need to care (and, in fact, can't care) whether
the context is looking for a string or a number.
<p>Scalars aren't necessarily one thing or another.  There's no place to
declare a scalar variable to be of type ``string'', or of type ``number'', or
type ``filehandle'', or anything else.  Perl is a contextually polymorphic
language whose scalars can be strings, numbers, or references (which
includes objects).  While strings and numbers are considered pretty
much same thing for nearly all purposes, references are strongly-typed
uncastable pointers with built-in reference-counting and destructor
invocation.
<p>A scalar value is interpreted as TRUE in the Boolean sense if it is not
the null string or the number 0 (or its string equivalent, ``0'').  The
Boolean context is just a special kind of scalar context.  
<p>There are actually two varieties of null scalars: defined and
undefined.  Undefined null scalars are returned when there is no real
value for something, such as when there was an error, or at end of
file, or when you refer to an uninitialized variable or element of an
array.  An undefined null scalar may become defined the first time you
use it as if it were defined, but prior to that you can use the

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
 operator to determine whether the value is defined or not.
<p>To find out whether a given string is a valid non-zero number, it's usually
enough to test it against both numeric 0 and also lexical ``0'' (although
this will cause 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 noises).  That's because strings that aren't
numbers count as 0, just as the do in <EM>awk</EM>:
<p>
<XMP>
    if ($str == 0 && $str ne "0")  {
        warn "That doesn't look like a number";
    } 

</XMP>
<p>That's usually preferable because otherwise you won't treat IEEE notations
like <CODE>NaN</CODE> or <CODE>Infinity</CODE> properly.  At other times you might prefer to
use a regular expression to check whether data is numeric.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the <EM>perlre</EM> manpage</A>

for details on regular expressions.
<p>
<XMP>
    warn "has nondigits"        if     /\D/;
    warn "not a whole number"   unless /^\d+$/;
    warn "not an integer"       unless /^[+-]?\d+$/     
    warn "not a decimal number" unless /^[+-]?\d+\.?\d*$/ 
    warn "not a C float" 
        unless /^([+-]?)(?=\d|\.\d)\d*(\.\d*)?([Ee]([+-]?\d+))?$/;

</XMP>
<p>The length of an array is a scalar value.  You may find the length of
array <STRONG>@days</STRONG> by evaluating <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__13">$#</A>
days</CODE>, as in <STRONG>csh</STRONG>.  (Actually, it's not
the length of the array, it's the subscript of the last element, since
there is (ordinarily) a 0th element.)  Assigning to <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__13">$#</A>
days</CODE> changes the
length of the array.  Shortening an array by this method destroys
intervening values.  Lengthening an array that was previously shortened
<EM>NO LONGER</EM> recovers the values that were in those elements.  (It used to
in Perl 4, but we had to break this make to make sure destructors were
called when expected.)  You can also gain some measure of efficiency by
preextending an array that is going to get big.  (You can also extend
an array by assigning to an element that is off the end of the array.)
You can truncate an array down to nothing by assigning the null list ()
to it.  The following are equivalent:
<p>
<XMP>
    @whatever = ();
    $#whatever = $[ - 1;

</XMP>
<p>If you evaluate a named array in a scalar context, it returns the length of
the array.  (Note that this is not true of lists, which return the
last value, like the C comma operator.)  The following is always true:
<p>
<XMP>
    scalar(@whatever) == $#whatever - $[ + 1;

</XMP>
<p>Version 5 of Perl changed the semantics of $[: files that don't set
the value of $[ no longer need to worry about whether another
file changed its value.  (In other words, use of $[ is deprecated.)
So in general you can just assume that
<p>
<XMP>
    scalar(@whatever) == $#whatever + 1;

</XMP>
<p>Some programmers choose to use an explicit conversion so nothing's
left to doubt:
<p>
<XMP>
    $element_count = scalar(@whatever);

</XMP>
<p>If you evaluate a hash in a scalar context, it returns a value which is
true if and only if the hash contains any key/value pairs.  (If there
are any key/value pairs, the value returned is a string consisting of
the number of used buckets and the number of allocated buckets, separated
by a slash.  This is pretty much only useful to find out whether Perl's
(compiled in) hashing algorithm is performing poorly on your data set.
For example, you stick 10,000 things in a hash, but evaluating <STRONG>%HASH</STRONG> in
scalar context reveals ``1/16'', which means only one out of sixteen buckets
has been touched, and presumably contains all 10,000 of your items.  This
isn't supposed to happen.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldata_scalar_1">
Scalar value constructors</A>
</H2>
Numeric literals are specified in any of the customary floating point or
integer formats:
<p>
<XMP>
    12345
    12345.67
    .23E-10
    0xffff              # hex
    0377                # octal
    4_294_967_296       # underline for legibility

</XMP>
<p>String literals are usually delimited by either single or double quotes.  They
work much like shell quotes:  double-quoted string literals are subject
to backslash and variable substitution; single-quoted strings are not
(except for ``<CODE>\'</CODE>'' and ``<CODE>\\</CODE>'').  The usual Unix backslash rules apply for making
characters such as newline, tab, etc., as well as some more exotic
forms.  See <EM>qq</EM> for a list.
<p>You can also embed newlines directly in your strings, i.e. they can end
on a different line than they begin.  This is nice, but if you forget
your trailing quote, the error will not be reported until Perl finds
another line containing the quote character, which may be much further
on in the script.  Variable substitution inside strings is limited to
scalar variables, arrays, and array slices.  (In other words,
identifiers beginning with <STRONG>$ </STRONG>or @, followed by an optional bracketed
expression as a subscript.)  The following code segment prints out "The
price is <STRONG>$100</STRONG>."
<p>
<XMP>
    $Price = '$100';    # not interpreted
    print "The price is $Price.\n";     # interpreted

</XMP>
<p>As in some shells, you can put curly brackets around the identifier to
delimit it from following alphanumerics.  In fact, an identifier
within such curlies is forced to be a string, as is any single
identifier within a hash subscript.  Our earlier example,
<p>
<XMP>
    $days{'Feb'}

</XMP>
<p>can be written as
<p>
<XMP>
    $days{Feb}

</XMP>
<p>and the quotes will be assumed automatically.  But anything more complicated
in the subscript will be interpreted as an expression.
<p>Note that a
single-quoted string must be separated from a preceding word by a
space, since single quote is a valid (though deprecated) character in
an identifier (see <EM>Packages</EM>).
<p>Two special literals are __LINE__ and __FILE__, which represent the
current line number and filename at that point in your program.  They
may only be used as separate tokens; they will not be interpolated into
strings.  In addition, the token __END__ may be used to indicate the
logical end of the script before the actual end of file.  Any following
text is ignored, but may be read via the DATA filehandle.  (The DATA
filehandle may read data only from the main script, but not from any
required file or evaluated string.)  The two control characters ^D and
^Z are synonyms for __END__ (or __DATA__ in a module; see <EM>SelfLoader</EM> for 
details on __DATA__).
<p>A word that has no other interpretation in the grammar will
be treated as if it were a quoted string.  These are known as
``barewords''.  As with filehandles and labels, a bareword that consists
entirely of lowercase letters risks conflict with future reserved
words, and if you use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 switch, Perl will warn you about any
such words.  Some people may wish to outlaw barewords entirely.  If you
say
<p>
<XMP>
    use strict 'subs';

</XMP>
<p>then any bareword that would NOT be interpreted as a subroutine call
produces a compile-time error instead.  The restriction lasts to the
end of the enclosing block.  An inner block may countermand this 
by saying 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_no_0">no strict 'subs'</A>
.
<p>Array variables are interpolated into double-quoted strings by joining all
the elements of the array with the delimiter specified in the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__11">$"</A>

variable (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_list_separator_0">$LIST_SEPARATOR</A>
 in English), space by default.  The following
are equivalent:
<p>
<XMP>
    $temp = join($",@ARGV);
    system "echo $temp";
    system "echo @ARGV";

</XMP>
<p>Within search patterns (which also undergo double-quotish substitution)
there is a bad ambiguity:  Is <CODE>/<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>[bar]/</CODE> to be interpreted as
<CODE>/<STRONG>${</STRONG>foo}[bar]/</CODE> (where <CODE>[bar]</CODE> is a character class for the regular
expression) or as <CODE>/<STRONG>${</STRONG>foo[bar]}/</CODE> (where <CODE>[bar]</CODE> is the subscript to array
<STRONG>@foo</STRONG>)?  If <STRONG>@foo</STRONG> doesn't otherwise exist, then it's obviously a
character class.  If <STRONG>@foo</STRONG> exists, Perl takes a good guess about <CODE>[bar]</CODE>,
and is almost always right.  If it does guess wrong, or if you're just
plain paranoid, you can force the correct interpretation with curly
brackets as above.
<p>A line-oriented form of quoting is based on the shell ``here-doc'' syntax.
Following a <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> you specify a string to terminate the quoted material,
and all lines following the current line down to the terminating string
are the value of the item.  The terminating string may be either an
identifier (a word), or some quoted text.  If quoted, the type of
quotes you use determines the treatment of the text, just as in regular
quoting.  An unquoted identifier works like double quotes.  There must
be no space between the <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> and the identifier.  (If you put a space it
will be treated as a null identifier, which is valid, and matches the
first blank line.)  The terminating string must appear by itself 
(unquoted and with no surrounding whitespace) on the terminating line.

<p>Just don't forget that you have to put a semicolon on the end 
to finish the statement, as Perl doesn't know you're not going to 
try to do this:

        print &lt;&lt;ABC
    179231
    ABC
        + 20;

<H2> 
<A NAME="perldata_list_0">
List value constructors</A>
</H2>
List values are denoted by separating individual values by commas
(and enclosing the list in parentheses where precedence requires it):
<p>
<XMP>
    (LIST)

</XMP>
<p>In a context not requiring a list value, the value of the list
literal is the value of the final element, as with the C comma operator.
For example,
<p>
<XMP>
    @foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);

</XMP>
<p>assigns the entire list value to array foo, but
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);

</XMP>
<p>assigns the value of variable bar to variable foo.  Note that the value
of an actual array in a scalar context is the length of the array; the
following assigns to <STRONG>$foo</STRONG> the value 3:
<p>
<XMP>
    @foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);
    $foo = @foo;                # $foo gets 3

</XMP>
<p>You may have an optional comma before the closing parenthesis of an
list literal, so that you can say:
<p>
<XMP>
    @foo = (
        1,
        2,
        3,
    );

</XMP>
<p>LISTs do automatic interpolation of sublists.  That is, when a LIST is
evaluated, each element of the list is evaluated in a list context, and
the resulting list value is interpolated into LIST just as if each
individual element were a member of LIST.  Thus arrays lose their
identity in a LIST--the list
<p>
<XMP>
    (@foo,@bar,&SomeSub)

</XMP>
<p>contains all the elements of <STRONG>@foo</STRONG> followed by all the elements of <STRONG>@bar</STRONG>,
followed by all the elements returned by the subroutine named SomeSub when
it's called in a list context.
To make a list reference that does <EM>NOT</EM> interpolate, see 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
.
<p>The null list is represented by ().  Interpolating it in a list
has no effect.  Thus ((),(),()) is equivalent to ().  Similarly,
interpolating an array with no elements is the same as if no
array had been interpolated at that point.
<p>A list value may also be subscripted like a normal array.  You must
put the list in parentheses to avoid ambiguity.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    # Stat returns list value.
    $time = (stat($file))[8];
    # SYNTAX ERROR HERE.
    $time = stat($file)[8];  # OOPS, FORGOT PARENS
    # Find a hex digit.
    $hexdigit = ('a','b','c','d','e','f')[$digit-10];
    # A "reverse comma operator".
    return (pop(@foo),pop(@foo))[0];

</XMP>
<p>Lists may be assigned to if and only if each element of the list
is legal to assign to:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($a, $b, $c) = (1, 2, 3);
    ($map{'red'}, $map{'blue'}, $map{'green'}) = (0x00f, 0x0f0, 0xf00);

</XMP>
<p>Array assignment in a scalar context returns the number of elements
produced by the expression on the right side of the assignment:
<p>
<XMP>
    $x = (($foo,$bar) = (3,2,1));       # set $x to 3, not 2
    $x = (($foo,$bar) = f());           # set $x to f()'s return count

</XMP>
<p>This is very handy when you want to do a list assignment in a Boolean
context, since most list functions return a null list when finished,
which when assigned produces a 0, which is interpreted as FALSE.
<p>The final element may be an array or a hash:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($a, $b, @rest) = split;
    local($a, $b, %rest) = @_;

</XMP>
<p>You can actually put an array or hash anywhere in the list, but the first one
in the list will soak up all the values, and anything after it will get
a null value.  This may be useful in a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
.
<p>A hash literal contains pairs of values to be interpreted
as a key and a value:
<p>
<XMP>
    # same as map assignment above
    %map = ('red',0x00f,'blue',0x0f0,'green',0xf00);

</XMP>
<p>While literal lists and named arrays are usually interchangeable, that's
not the case for hashes.  Just because you can subscript a list value like
a normal array does not mean that you can subscript a list value as a
hash.  Likewise, hashes included as parts of other lists (including
parameters lists and return lists from functions) always flatten out into
key/value pairs.  That's why it's good to use references sometimes.
<p>It is often more readable to use the <CODE>=&gt;</CODE> operator between key/value
pairs.  The <CODE>=&gt;</CODE> operator is mostly just a more visually distinctive
synonym for a comma, but it also quotes its left-hand operand, which makes
it nice for initializing hashes:
<p>
<XMP>
    %map = (
                 red   => 0x00f,
                 blue  => 0x0f0,
                 green => 0xf00,
   );

</XMP>
<p>or for initializing hash references to be used as records:
<p>
<XMP>
    $rec = {
                witch => 'Mable the Merciless',
                cat   => 'Fluffy the Ferocious',
                date  => '10/31/1776',
    };

</XMP>
<p>or for using call-by-named-parameter to complicated functions:
<p>
<XMP>
   $field = $query->radio_group( 
               name      => 'group_name',
               values    => ['eenie','meenie','minie'],
               default   => 'meenie',
               linebreak => 'true',
               labels    => \%labels
   );

</XMP>
<p>Note that just because a hash is initialized in that order doesn't
mean that it comes out in that order.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sort_2"><EM>sort</EM></A>
 for examples
of how to arrange for an output ordering.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perldata_typeglobs_0">
Typeglobs and FileHandles</A>
</H2>
Perl uses an internal type called a <EM>typeglob</EM> to hold an entire
symbol table entry.  The type prefix of a typeglob is a <CODE>*</CODE>, because
it represents all types.  This used to be the preferred way to 
pass arrays and hashes by reference into a function, but now that
we have real references, this is seldom needed.
<p>One place where you still use typeglobs (or references thereto)
is for passing or storing filehandles.  If you want to save away
a filehandle, do it this way:
<p>
<XMP>
    $fh = *STDOUT;

</XMP>
<p>or perhaps as a real reference, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $fh = \*STDOUT;

</XMP>
<p>This is also the way to create a local filehandle.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub newopen {
        my $path = shift;
        local *FH;  # not my!
        open (FH, $path) || return undef;
        return \*FH;
    }
    $fh = newopen('/etc/passwd');

</XMP>
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the <EM>perlref</EM> manpage</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlsub.html">
the <EM>perlsub</EM> manpage</A>
, and <EM>``Symbols Tables''</EM> for more
discussion on typeglobs.  See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1"><EM>open</EM></A>
 for other ways of
generating filehandles.

				JABBERWOCKY.
		'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
		  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
		All mimsy were the borogoves,
		  And the mome raths outgrabe.

		"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
		  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
		Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
		  The frumious Bandersnatch!"

		He took his vorpal sword in hand:
		  Long time the manxome foe he sought--
		So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
		  And stood awhile in thought.

		And, as in uffish thought he stood,
		  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
		Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
		  And burbled as it came!           

		One, two! One, two! And through and through
		  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
		He left it dead, and with his head
		  He went galumphing back.

		"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
		  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
		O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
		  He chortled in his joy.

		'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
		  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
		All mimsy were the borogoves,
		  And the mome raths outgrabe.

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
A Perl script consists of a sequence of declarations and statements.
The only things that need to be declared in Perl are report formats
and subroutines.  See the sections below for more information on those
declarations.  All uninitialized user-created objects are assumed to
start with a null or 0 value until they are defined by some explicit
operation such as assignment.  (Though you can get warnings about the
use of undefined values if you like.)  The sequence of statements is
executed just once, unlike in <STRONG>sed</STRONG> and <STRONG>awk</STRONG> scripts, where the
sequence of statements is executed for each input line.  While this means
that you must explicitly loop over the lines of your input file (or
files), it also means you have much more control over which files and
which lines you look at.  (Actually, I'm lying--it is possible to do an
implicit loop with either the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_n_0">-n</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_p_0">-p</A>
 switch.  It's just not the
mandatory default like it is in <STRONG>sed</STRONG> and <STRONG>awk</STRONG>.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_declarations_0">
Declarations</A>
</H2>
Perl is, for the most part, a free-form language.  (The only
exception to this is format declarations, for obvious reasons.) Comments
are indicated by the ``#'' character, and extend to the end of the line.  If
you attempt to use <CODE>/* */</CODE> C-style comments, it will be interpreted
either as division or pattern matching, depending on the context, and C++
<CODE>//</CODE> comments just look like a null regular expression, so don't do
that.
<p>A declaration can be put anywhere a statement can, but has no effect on
the execution of the primary sequence of statements--declarations all
take effect at compile time.  Typically all the declarations are put at
the beginning or the end of the script.  However, if you're using 
lexically-scoped private variables created with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
, you'll have to make sure
your format or subroutine definition is within the same block scope
as the my if you expect to to be able to access those private variables.
<p>Declaring a subroutine allows a subroutine name to be used as if it were a
list operator from that point forward in the program.  You can declare a
subroutine (prototyped to take one scalar parameter) without defining it by saying just:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub myname ($);
    $me = myname $0             or die "can't get myname";

</XMP>
<p>Note that it functions as a list operator though, not as a unary
operator, so be careful to use <CODE>or</CODE> instead of <CODE>||</CODE> there.
<p>Subroutines declarations can also be loaded up with the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>
 statement
or both loaded and imported into your namespace with a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 statement.
See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the <EM>perlmod</EM> manpage</A>
 for details on this.
<p>A statement sequence may contain declarations of lexically-scoped
variables, but apart from declaring a variable name, the declaration acts
like an ordinary statement, and is elaborated within the sequence of
statements as if it were an ordinary statement.  That means it actually
has both compile-time and run-time effects.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_simple_0">
Simple statements</A>
</H2>
The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated for its
side effects.  Every simple statement must be terminated with a
semicolon, unless it is the final statement in a block, in which case
the semicolon is optional.  (A semicolon is still encouraged there if the
block takes up more than one line, since you may eventually add another line.)
Note that there are some operators like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval {}</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do {}</A>
 that look
like compound statements, but aren't (they're just TERMs in an expression), 
and thus need an explicit termination if used as the last item in a statement.
<p>Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a <EM>SINGLE</EM> modifier,
just before the terminating semicolon (or block ending).  The possible
modifiers are:
<p>
<XMP>
    if EXPR
    unless EXPR
    while EXPR
    until EXPR

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>if</CODE> and <CODE>unless</CODE> modifiers have the expected semantics,
presuming you're a speaker of English.  The <CODE>while</CODE> and <CODE>until</CODE>
modifiers also have the usual ``while loop'' semantics (conditional
evaluated first), except when applied to a do-BLOCK (or to the
now-deprecated do-SUBROUTINE statement), in which case the block
executes once before the conditional is evaluated.  This is so that you
can write loops like:
<p>
<XMP>
    do {
        $line = <STDIN>;
        ...
    } until $line  eq ".\n";

</XMP>
<p>See 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2"><EM>do</EM></A>
.  Note also that the loop control
statements described later will <EM>NOT</EM> work in this construct, since
modifiers don't take loop labels.  Sorry.  You can always wrap
another block around it to do that sort of thing.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_compound_0">
Compound statements</A>
</H2>
In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is called a block.
Sometimes a block is delimited by the file containing it (in the case
of a required file, or the program as a whole), and sometimes a block
is delimited by the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).
<p>But generally, a block is delimited by curly brackets, also known as braces.
We will call this syntactic construct a BLOCK.
<p>The following compound statements may be used to control flow:
<p>
<XMP>
    if (EXPR) BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK
    LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK
    LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK

</XMP>
<p>Note that, unlike C and Pascal, these are defined in terms of BLOCKs,
not statements.  This means that the curly brackets are <EM>required</EM>--no
dangling statements allowed.  If you want to write conditionals without
curly brackets there are several other ways to do it.  The following
all do the same thing:
<p>
<XMP>
    if (!open(FOO)) { die "Can't open $FOO: $!"; }
    die "Can't open $FOO: $!" unless open(FOO);
    open(FOO) or die "Can't open $FOO: $!";     # FOO or bust!
    open(FOO) ? 'hi mom' : die "Can't open $FOO: $!";
                        # a bit exotic, that last one

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>if</CODE> statement is straightforward.  Since BLOCKs are always
bounded by curly brackets, there is never any ambiguity about which
<CODE>if</CODE> an <CODE>else</CODE> goes with.  If you use <CODE>unless</CODE> in place of <CODE>if</CODE>,
the sense of the test is reversed.
<p>The <CODE>while</CODE> statement executes the block as long as the expression is
true (does not evaluate to the null string or 0 or ``0'').  The LABEL is
optional, and if present, consists of an identifier followed by a colon.
The LABEL identifies the loop for the loop control statements 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
,

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0">last</A>
, and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_redo_0">redo</A>
.  If the LABEL is omitted, the loop control statement
refers to the innermost enclosing loop.  This may include dynamically
looking back your call-stack at run time to find the LABEL.  Such
desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 flag.
<p>If there is a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 BLOCK, it is always executed just before the
conditional is about to be evaluated again, just like the third part of a
<CODE>for</CODE> loop in C.  Thus it can be used to increment a loop variable, even
when the loop has been continued via the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
 statement (which is
similar to the C 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 statement).
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_loop_0">
Loop Control</A>
</H2>
The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
 command is like the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 statement in C; it starts
the next iteration of the loop:
<p>
<XMP>
    LINE: while (<STDIN>) {
        next LINE if /^#/;      # discard comments
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0">last</A>
 command is like the <CODE>break</CODE> statement in C (as used in
loops); it immediately exits the loop in question.  The

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 block, if any, is not executed:
<p>
<XMP>
    LINE: while (<STDIN>) {
        last LINE if /^$/;      # exit when done with header
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_redo_0">redo</A>
 command restarts the loop block without evaluating the
conditional again.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 block, if any, is <EM>not</EM> executed.
This command is normally used by programs that want to lie to themselves
about what was just input.
<p>For example, when processing a file like <EM>/etc/termcap</EM>.
If your input lines might end in backslashes to indicate continuation, you
want to skip ahead and get the next record.
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        chomp;
        if (s/\\$//) { 
            $_ .= <>; 
            redo unless eof();
        }
        # now process $_
    } 

</XMP>
<p>which is Perl short-hand for the more explicitly written version:
<p>
<XMP>
    LINE: while ($line = <ARGV>) {
        chomp($line);
        if ($line =~ s/\\$//) { 
            $line .= <ARGV>; 
            redo LINE unless eof(); # not eof(ARGV)!
        }
        # now process $line
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Or here's a a simpleminded Pascal comment stripper (warning: assumes no { or } in strings)
<p>
<XMP>
    LINE: while (<STDIN>) {
        while (s|({.*}.*){.*}|$1 |) {}
        s|{.*}| |;
        if (s|{.*| |) {
            $front = $_;
            while (<STDIN>) {
                if (/}/) {      # end of comment?
                    s|^|$front{|;
                    redo LINE;
                }
            }
        }
        print;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Note that if there were a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 block on the above code, it would get
executed even on discarded lines.
<p>If the word <CODE>while</CODE> is replaced by the word <CODE>until</CODE>, the sense of the
test is reversed, but the conditional is still tested before the first
iteration.
<p>In either the <CODE>if</CODE> or the <CODE>while</CODE> statement, you may replace ``(EXPR)''
with a BLOCK, and the conditional is true if the value of the last
statement in that block is true.  While this ``feature'' continues to work in 
version 5, it has been deprecated, so please change any occurrences of ``if BLOCK'' to
``if (do BLOCK)''.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_for_0">
For Loops</A>
</H2>
Perl's C-style <CODE>for</CODE> loop works exactly like the corresponding <CODE>while</CODE> loop;
that means that this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for ($i = 1; $i < 10; $i++) {
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>is the same as this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 10) {
        ...
    } continue {
        $i++;
    }

</XMP>
<p>Besides the normal array index looping, <CODE>for</CODE> can lend itself
to many other interesting applications.  Here's one that avoids the
problem you get into if you explicitly test for end-of-file on 
an interactive file descriptor causing your program to appear to 
hang.
<p>
<XMP>
    $on_a_tty = -t STDIN && -t STDOUT;
    sub prompt { print "yes? " if $on_a_tty }
    for ( prompt(); <STDIN>; prompt() ) {
        # do something
    } 

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_foreach_0">
Foreach Loops</A>
</H2>
The <CODE>foreach</CODE> loop iterates over a normal list value and sets the
variable VAR to be each element of the list in turn.  The variable is
implicitly local to the loop and regains its former value upon exiting the
loop.  If the variable was previously declared with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my</A>
, it uses that
variable instead of the global one, but it's still localized to the loop.
This can cause problems if you have subroutine or format declarations
within that block's scope.
<p>The <CODE>foreach</CODE> keyword is actually a synonym for the <CODE>for</CODE> keyword, so
you can use <CODE>foreach</CODE> for readability or <CODE>for</CODE> for brevity.  If VAR is
omitted, 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 is set to each value.  If LIST is an actual array (as opposed
to an expression returning a list value), you can modify each element of
the array by modifying VAR inside the loop.  That's because the <CODE>foreach</CODE>
loop index variable is an implicit alias for each item in the list that
you're looping over.
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/ }
    foreach $elem (@elements) {
        $elem *= 2;
    }
    for $count (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,'BOOM') {
        print $count, "\n"; sleep(1);
    }
    for (1..15) { print "Merry Christmas\n"; }
    foreach $item (split(/:[\\\n:]*/, $ENV{TERMCAP})) {
        print "Item: $item\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>Here's how a C programmer might code up a particular algorithm in Perl:
<p>
<XMP>
    for ($i = 0; $i < @ary1; $i++) {
        for ($j = 0; $j < @ary2; $j++) {
            if ($ary1[$i] > $ary2[$j]) {
                last; # can't go to outer :-(
            }
            $ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j];
        }
        # this is where that last takes me
    }

</XMP>
<p>Whereas here's how a Perl programmer more confortable with the idiom might
do it:
<p>
<XMP>
    OUTER: foreach $wid (@ary1) { 
    INNER:   foreach $jet (@ary2) {
                next OUTER if $wid > $jet;
                $wid += $jet;
             } 
          } 

</XMP>
<p>See how much easier this is?  It's cleaner, safer, and faster.  It's
cleaner because it's less noisy.  It's safer because if code gets added
between the inner and outer loops later on, the new code won't be
accidentally executed, the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
 explicitly iterates the other loop
rather than merely terminating the inner one.  And it's faster because
Perl executes a <CODE>foreach</CODE> statement more rapidly than it would the
equivalent <CODE>for</CODE> loop.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_basic_0">
Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements</A>
</H2>
A BLOCK by itself (labeled or not) is semantically equivalent to a loop
that executes once.  Thus you can use any of the loop control
statements in it to leave or restart the block.  (Note that this
is <EM>NOT</EM> true in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval{}</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sub_2">sub{}</A>
, or contrary to popular belief 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do{}</A>
 blocks,
which do <EM>NOT</EM> count as loops.)  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 block
is optional.  
<p>The BLOCK construct is particularly nice for doing case
structures.
<p>
<XMP>
    SWITCH: {
        if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; }
        if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; }
        if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
        $nothing = 1;
    }

</XMP>
<p>There is no official switch statement in Perl, because there are
already several ways to write the equivalent.  In addition to the
above, you could write
<p>
<XMP>
    SWITCH: {
        $abc = 1, last SWITCH  if /^abc/;
        $def = 1, last SWITCH  if /^def/;
        $xyz = 1, last SWITCH  if /^xyz/;
        $nothing = 1;
    }

</XMP>
<p>(That's actually not as strange as it looks once you realize that you can
use loop control ``operators'' within an expression,  That's just the normal
C comma operator.)
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    SWITCH: {
        /^abc/ && do { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; };
        /^def/ && do { $def = 1; last SWITCH; };
        /^xyz/ && do { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; };
        $nothing = 1;
    }

</XMP>
<p>or formatted so it stands out more as a ``proper'' switch statement:
<p>
<XMP>
    SWITCH: {
        /^abc/      && do { 
                            $abc = 1; 
                            last SWITCH; 
                       };
        /^def/      && do { 
                            $def = 1; 
                            last SWITCH; 
                       };
        /^xyz/      && do { 
                            $xyz = 1; 
                            last SWITCH; 
                        };
        $nothing = 1;
    }

</XMP>
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    SWITCH: {
        /^abc/ and $abc = 1, last SWITCH;
        /^def/ and $def = 1, last SWITCH;
        /^xyz/ and $xyz = 1, last SWITCH;
        $nothing = 1;
    }

</XMP>
<p>or even, horrors,
<p>
<XMP>
    if (/^abc/)
        { $abc = 1 }
    elsif (/^def/)
        { $def = 1 }
    elsif (/^xyz/)
        { $xyz = 1 }
    else
        { $nothing = 1 }

</XMP>
<p>A common idiom for a switch statement is to use <CODE>foreach</CODE>'s aliasing to make
a temporary assignment to 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__0">$_</A>
 for convenient matching:
<p>
<XMP>
    SWITCH: for ($where) {
                /In Card Names/     && do { push @flags, '-e'; last; };
                /Anywhere/          && do { push @flags, '-h'; last; };
                /In Rulings/        && do {                    last; };
                die "unknown value for form variable where: `$where'";
            } 

</XMP>
<p>Another interesting approach to a switch statement is arrange
for a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_do_2">do</A>
 block to return the proper value:
<p>
<XMP>
    $amode = do {
        if     ($flag & O_RDONLY) { "r" } 
        elsif  ($flag & O_WRONLY) { ($flag & O_APPEND) ? "a" : "w" } 
        elsif  ($flag & O_RDWR)   {
            if ($flag & O_CREAT)  { "w+" }
            else                  { ($flag & O_APPEND) ? "a+" : "r+" }
        }
    };

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_goto_0">
Goto</A>
</H2>
Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_goto_2">goto</A>
 statement.
A loop's LABEL is not actually a valid target for a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_goto_2">goto</A>
;
it's just the name of the loop.  There are three forms: goto-LABEL,
goto-EXPR, and goto-&amp;NAME.
<p>The goto-LABEL form finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes
execution there.  It may not be used to go into any construct that
requires initialization, such as a subroutine or a foreach loop.  It
also can't be used to go into a construct that is optimized away.  It
can be used to go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope,
including out of subroutines, but it's usually better to use some other
construct such as last or die.  The author of Perl has never felt the
need to use this form of goto (in Perl, that is--C is another matter).
<p>The goto-EXPR form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically.  This allows for computed gotos per FORTRAN, but isn't
necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:
<p>
<XMP>
    goto ("FOO", "BAR", "GLARCH")[$i];

</XMP>
<p>The goto-&amp;NAME form is highly magical, and substitutes a call to the
named subroutine for the currently running subroutine.  This is used by
<EM>AUTOLOAD()</EM> subroutines that wish to load another subroutine and then
pretend that the other subroutine had been called in the first place
(except that any modifications to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> in the current subroutine are
propagated to the other subroutine.)  After the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_goto_2">goto</A>
, not even 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_caller_0">caller()</A>

will be able to tell that this routine was called first.
<p>In almost all cases like this, it's usually a far, far better idea to use the
structured control flow mechanisms of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0">last</A>
, or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_redo_0">redo</A>
 instead of
resorting to a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_goto_2">goto</A>
.  For certain applications, the catch and throw pair of

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval{}</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 for exception processing can also be a prudent approach.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perlsyn_pods_0">
PODs: Embedded Documentation</A>
</H2>
Perl has a mechanism for intermixing documentation with source code.
While it's expecting the beginning of a new statement, if the compiler
encounters a line that begins with an equal sign and a word, like this
<p>
<XMP>
    =head1 Here There Be Pods!

</XMP>
<p>Then that text and all remaining text up through and including a line
beginning with <CODE>=cut</CODE> will be ignored.  The format of the intervening
text is described in 
<A HREF="perlpod.html">
the <EM>perlpod</EM> manpage</A>
. 
<p>This allows you to intermix your source code
and your documentation text freely, as in
<p>
<XMP>
    =item snazzle($)
    The snazzle() function will behave in the most spectacular 
    form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting
    cybernetic pyrotechnics.
    =cut back to the compiler, nuff of this pod stuff!
    sub snazzle($) {
        my $thingie = shift;
        .........
    } 

</XMP>
<p>Note that pod translators should only look at paragraphs beginning 
with a pod diretive (it makes parsing easier), whereas the compiler
actually knows to look for pod escapes even in the middle of a 
paragraph.  This means that the following secret stuff will be
ignored by both the compiler and the translators.
<p>
<XMP>
    $a=3;
    =secret stuff
     warn "Neither POD nor CODE!?"
    =cut back
    print "got $a\n";

</XMP>
<p>You probably shouldn't rely upon the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_warn_0">warn()</A>
 being podded out forever.
Not all pod translators are well-behaved in this regard, and perhaps
the compiler will become pickier.

Aethelmar's (Unsung) Song

Out of the Eastrealm there came a new war cry,
Aethelmarc, Aethelmarc puts up a fight.
We want to go kingdom but they just won't let us;
Now they may have to; we've got enought knights.
	Sing me a song of Aethelmarc;
	Aethelmarc wants to go kingdom, it just isn't fair.
	War makes so much money, the Eastrealm can't give it up;
	Let us go and we'll give you a share.
Onto the feild there came a new banner,
Aethelmarc, Aethelmarc put up fight.
We tried to be nice; they forbade us with candor;
Keeping us pris'ners is just not polite!
	Sing me a song of Aethelmarc,
	Aethelmarc wants to go kingdom, it just ins't fair.
	War makes so much money, the Eastrealm can't give it up;
	Let us go kingdom we'll give you are share.
Danceing the dance of flashing bright steel,
Aethelmarc, Aethelmarc puts up a fight.
The East forged a weapon which now we wield;
We'll take the freedom which is our birthright!
	Sing me a song of Aethelmarc,
	Aethlmarc wants to go kingdom, it just ins't fair.
	War makes so much money, the Eastrealm can't give it up;
	Maybe we alli with the Midrealm next year.

--no idea who came up with this....and forgetting the name of the 
knight who wrote the orginal (and I should not be).
--note: why this...just doing my duty to my crown and insighting
a little rebellion....*heh*

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Prior to release 5.0 of Perl, a programmer could use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>

to magically connect an on-disk database in the standard Unix dbm(3x)
format to a <STRONG>%HASH</STRONG> in their program.  However, their Perl was either
built with one particular dbm library or another, but not both, and
you couldn't extend this mechanism to other packages or types of variables.
<p>Now you can.
<p>The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 function binds a variable to a class (package) that will provide
the implementation for access methods for that variable.  Once this magic
has been performed, accessing a tied variable automatically triggers
method calls in the proper class.  All of the complexity of the class is
hidden behind magic methods calls.  The method names are in ALL CAPS,
which is a convention that Perl uses to indicate that they're called
implicitly rather than explicitly--just like the <EM>BEGIN()</EM> and <EM>END()</EM>
functions.
<p>In the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 call, <CODE>VARIABLE</CODE> is the name of the variable to be
enchanted.  <CODE>CLASSNAME</CODE> is the name of a class implementing objects of
the correct type.  Any additional arguments in the 
<A HREF="perltie.html#perltie_list_0">LIST</A>
 are passed to
the appropriate constructor method for that class--meaning 
<A HREF="perltie.html#perltie_tiescalar_0">TIESCALAR()</A>
,

<A HREF="perltie.html#perltie_tiearray_0">TIEARRAY()</A>
, or 
<A HREF="perltie.html#perltie_tiehash_0">TIEHASH()</A>
.  (Typically these are arguments such as might be
passed to the <EM>dbminit()</EM> function of C.) The object returned by the ``new''
method is also returned by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 function, which would be useful if
you wanted to access other methods in <CODE>CLASSNAME</CODE>. (You don't actually
have to return a reference to a right ``type'' (e.g. HASH or <CODE>CLASSNAME</CODE>)
so long as it's a properly blessed object.)  You can also retrieve
a reference to the underlying object using the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tied_0">tied()</A>
 function.
<p>Unlike 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
, the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 function will not 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>
 a module
for you--you need to do that explicitly yourself.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perltie_tying_0">
Tying Scalars</A>
</H2>
A class implementing a tied scalar should define the following methods:
TIESCALAR, FETCH, STORE, and possibly DESTROY.
<p>Let's look at each in turn, using as an example a tie class for
scalars that allows the user to do something like:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie $his_speed, 'Nice', getppid();
    tie $my_speed,  'Nice', $$;

</XMP>
<p>And now whenever either of those variables is accessed, its current
system priority is retrieved and returned.  If those variables are set,
then the process's priority is changed!
<p>We'll use Jarkko Hietaniemi <EM>&lt;<A HREF="MAILTO:Jarkko.Hietaniemi@hut.fi">Jarkko.Hietaniemi@hut.fi</A>&gt;</EM>'s
BSD::Resource class (not included) to access the PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_MIN,
and PRIO_MAX constants from your system, as well as the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_getpriority_0">getpriority()</A>
 and

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_setpriority_0">setpriority()</A>
 system calls.  Here's the preamble of the class.
<p>
<XMP>
    package Nice;
    use Carp;
    use BSD::Resource;
    use strict;
    $Nice::DEBUG = 0 unless defined $Nice::DEBUG;

</XMP>
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_tiescalar_0">
TIESCALAR classname, LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is the constructor for the class.  That means it is
expected to return a blessed reference to a new scalar
(probably anonymous) that it's creating.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub TIESCALAR {
        my $class = shift;
        my $pid = shift || $$; # 0 means me
        if ($pid !~ /^\d+$/) {
            carp "Nice::Tie::Scalar got non-numeric pid $pid" if $^W;
            return undef;
        }
        unless (kill 0, $pid) { # EPERM or ERSCH, no doubt
            carp "Nice::Tie::Scalar got bad pid $pid: $!" if $^W;
            return undef;
        }
        return bless \$pid, $class;
    }

</XMP>
<p>This tie class has chosen to return an error rather than raising an
exception if its constructor should fail.  While this is how 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
 works,
other classes may well not wish to be so forgiving.  It checks the global
variable 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_w_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
W</A>
 to see whether to emit a bit of noise anyway.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_fetch_0">
FETCH this</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered every time the tied variable is accessed
(read).  It takes no arguments beyond its self reference, which is the
object representing the scalar we're dealing with.  Since in this case
we're just using a SCALAR ref for the tied scalar object, a simple 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__23">$$</A>
self
allows the method to get at the real value stored there.  In our example
below, that real value is the process ID to which we've tied our variable.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub FETCH {
        my $self = shift;
        confess "wrong type" unless ref $self;
        croak "usage error" if @_;
        my $nicety;
        local($!) = 0;
        $nicety = getpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, $$self);
        if ($!) { croak "getpriority failed: $!" }
        return $nicety;
    }

</XMP>
<p>This time we've decided to blow up (raise an exception) if the renice
fails--there's no place for us to return an error otherwise, and it's
probably the right thing to do.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_store_0">
STORE this, value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered every time the tied variable is set
(assigned).  Beyond its self reference, it also expects one (and only one)
argument--the new value the user is trying to assign.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub STORE {
        my $self = shift;
        confess "wrong type" unless ref $self;
        my $new_nicety = shift;
        croak "usage error" if @_;
        if ($new_nicety < PRIO_MIN) {
            carp sprintf
              "WARNING: priority %d less than minimum system priority %d",
                  $new_nicety, PRIO_MIN if $^W;
            $new_nicety = PRIO_MIN;
        }
        if ($new_nicety > PRIO_MAX) {
            carp sprintf
              "WARNING: priority %d greater than maximum system priority %d",
                  $new_nicety, PRIO_MAX if $^W;
            $new_nicety = PRIO_MAX;
        }
        unless (defined setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, $$self, $new_nicety)) {
            confess "setpriority failed: $!";
        }
        return $new_nicety;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_destroy_0">
DESTROY this</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered when the tied variable needs to be destructed.
As with other object classes, such a method is seldom ncessary, since Perl
deallocates its moribund object's memory for you automatically--this isn't
C++, you know.  We'll use a DESTROY method here for debugging purposes only.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub DESTROY {
        my $self = shift;
        confess "wrong type" unless ref $self;
        carp "[ Nice::DESTROY pid $$self ]" if $Nice::DEBUG;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
</DL>
That's about all there is to it.  Actually, it's more than all there.is to it, since we've done a few nice things here for the sake
of completeness, robustness, and general aesthetics.  Simpler
TIESCALAR classes are certainly possible.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perltie_tying_1">
Tying Arrays</A>
</H2>
A class implementing a tied ordinary array should define the following
methods: TIEARRAY, FETCH, STORE, and perhaps DESTROY.
<p><STRONG>WARNING</STRONG>: Tied arrays are <EM>incomplete</EM>.  They are also distinctly lacking
something for the <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__13">$#</A>
ARRAY</CODE> access (which is hard, as it's an lvalue), as
well as the other obvious array functions, like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pop_0">pop()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_shift_0">shift()</A>
,

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unshift_0">unshift()</A>
, and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_splice_2">splice()</A>
.
<p>For this discussion, we'll implement an array whose indices are fixed at
its creation.  If you try to access anything beyond those bounds, you'll
take an exception.  (Well, if you access an individual element; an
aggregate assignment would be missed.) For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    require Bounded_Array;
    tie @ary, Bounded_Array, 2;
    $| = 1;
    for $i (0 .. 10) {
        print "setting index $i: ";
        $ary[$i] = 10 * $i;
        $ary[$i] = 10 * $i;
        print "value of elt $i now $ary[$i]\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>The preamble code for the class is as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
    package Bounded_Array;
    use Carp;
    use strict;

</XMP>
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_tiearray_0">
TIEARRAY classname, LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is the constructor for the class.  That means it is expected to
return a blessed reference through which the new array (probably an
anonymous ARRAY ref) will be accessed.
<p>In our example, just to show you that you don't <EM>really</EM> have to return an
ARRAY reference, we'll choose a HASH reference to represent our object.
A HASH works out well as a generic record type: the <CODE>{BOUND}</CODE> field will
store the maximum bound allowed, and the <CODE>{ARRAY}</CODE> field will hold the
true ARRAY ref.  If someone outside the class tries to dereference the
object returned (doubtless thinking it an ARRAY ref), they'll blow up.
This just goes to show you that you should respect an object's privacy.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub TIEARRAY {
        my $class = shift;
        my $bound = shift;
        confess "usage: tie(\@ary, 'Bounded_Array', max_subscript)"
            if @_ || $bound =~ /\D/;
        return bless {
            BOUND => $bound,
            ARRAY => [],
        }, $class;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_fetch_1">
FETCH this, index</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered every time an individual element the tied array
is accessed (read).  It takes one argument beyond its self reference: the
index whose value we're trying to fetch.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub FETCH {
      my($self,$idx) = @_;
      if ($idx > $self->{BOUND}) {
        confess "Array OOB: $idx > $self->{BOUND}";
      }
      return $self->{ARRAY}[$idx];
    }

</XMP>
<p>As you may have noticed, the name of the FETCH method (et al.) is the same
for all accesses, even though the constructors differ in names (TIESCALAR
vs TIEARRAY).  While in theory you could have the same class servicing
several tied types, in practice this becomes cumbersome, and it's easiest
to simply keep them at one tie type per class.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_store_1">
STORE this, index, value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered every time an element in the tied array is set
(written).  It takes two arguments beyond its self reference: the index at
which we're trying to store something and the value we're trying to put
there.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub STORE {
      my($self, $idx, $value) = @_;
      print "[STORE $value at $idx]\n" if _debug;
      if ($idx > $self->{BOUND} ) {
        confess "Array OOB: $idx > $self->{BOUND}";
      }
      return $self->{ARRAY}[$idx] = $value;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_destroy_0">
DESTROY this</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered when the tied variable needs to be destructed.
As with the sclar tie class, this is almost never needed in a
language that does its own garbage collection, so this time we'll
just leave it out.
<p>
</DL>
The code we presented at the top of the tied array class accesses many.elements of the array, far more than we've set the bounds to.  Therefore,
it will blow up once they try to access beyond the 2nd element of <STRONG>@ary</STRONG>, as
the following output demonstrates:
<p>
<XMP>
    setting index 0: value of elt 0 now 0
    setting index 1: value of elt 1 now 10
    setting index 2: value of elt 2 now 20
    setting index 3: Array OOB: 3 > 2 at Bounded_Array.pm line 39
            Bounded_Array::FETCH called at testba line 12

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="perltie_tying_2">
Tying Hashes</A>
</H2>
As the first Perl data type to be tied (see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
), associative arrays
have the most complete and useful 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 implementation.  A class
implementing a tied associative array should define the following
methods:  TIEHASH is the constructor.  FETCH and STORE access the key and
value pairs.  EXISTS reports whether a key is present in the hash, and
DELETE deletes one.  CLEAR empties the hash by deleting all the key and
value pairs.  FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY implement the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>

functions to iterate over all the keys.  And DESTROY is called when the
tied variable is garbage collected.
<p>If this seems like a lot, then feel free to merely inherit
from the standard Tie::Hash module for most of your methods, redefining only
the interesting ones.  See <EM>Tie::Hash</EM> for details.
<p>Remember that Perl distinguishes between a key not existing in the hash,
and the key existing in the hash but having a corresponding value of

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef</A>
.  The two possibilities can be tested with the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exists_0">
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exists_0">exists()</A>
</A>
 and

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
</A>
 functions.
<p>Here's an example of a somewhat interesting tied hash class:  it gives you
a hash representing a particular user's dotfiles.  You index into the hash
with the name of the file (minus the dot) and you get back that dotfile's
contents.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    use DotFiles;
    tie %dot, DotFiles;
    if ( $dot{profile} =~ /MANPATH/ ||
         $dot{login}   =~ /MANPATH/ ||
         $dot{cshrc}   =~ /MANPATH/    )
    {
        print "you seem to set your manpath\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>Or here's another sample of using our tied class:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %him, DotFiles, 'daemon';
    foreach $f ( keys %him ) {
        printf "daemon dot file %s is size %d\n",
            $f, length $him{$f};
    }

</XMP>
<p>In our tied hash DotFiles example, we use a regular
hash for the object containing several important
fields, of which only the <CODE>{LIST}</CODE> field will be what the
user thinks of as the real hash.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_user_0">
USER</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
whose dot files this object represents
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_home_0">
HOME</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
where those dotfiles live
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_clobber_0">
CLOBBER</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
whether we should try to change or remove those dot files
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_list_0">
LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
the hash of dotfile names and content mappings
<p>
</DL>
Here's the start of <EM>Dotfiles.pm</EM>:.
    package DotFiles;
    use Carp;
    sub whowasi { (caller(1))[3] . '()' }
    my <STRONG>$DEBUG</STRONG> = 0;
    sub debug { <STRONG>$DEBUG</STRONG> = <STRONG>@_</STRONG> ? shift : 1 }
<p>For our example, we want to able to emit debugging info to help in tracing
during development.  We keep also one convenience function around
internally to help print out warnings; <EM>whowasi()</EM> returns the function name
that calls it.
<p>Here are the methods for the DotFiles tied hash.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_tiehash_0">
TIEHASH classname, LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is the constructor for the class.  That means it is expected to
return a blessed reference through which the new object (probably but not
necessarily an anonymous hash) will be accessed.
<p>Here's the constructor:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub TIEHASH {
        my $self = shift;
        my $user = shift || $>;
        my $dotdir = shift || '';
        croak "usage: @{[&whowasi]} [USER [DOTDIR]]" if @_;
        $user = getpwuid($user) if $user =~ /^\d+$/;
        my $dir = (getpwnam($user))[7]
                || croak "@{[&whowasi]}: no user $user";
        $dir .= "/$dotdir" if $dotdir;
        my $node = {
            USER    => $user,
            HOME    => $dir,
            LIST    => {},
            CLOBBER => 0,
        };
        opendir(DIR, $dir)
                || croak "@{[&whowasi]}: can't opendir $dir: $!";
        foreach $dot ( grep /^\./ && -f "$dir/$_", readdir(DIR)) {
            $dot =~ s/^\.//;
            $node->{LIST}{$dot} = undef;
        }
        closedir DIR;
        return bless $node, $self;
    }

</XMP>
<p>It's probably worth mentioning that if you're going to filetest the
return values out of a readdir, you'd better prepend the directory
in question.  Otherwise, since we didn't 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_chdir_0">chdir()</A>
 there, it would
have been testing the wrong file.  
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_fetch_2">
FETCH this, key</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered every time an element in the tied hash is
accessed (read).  It takes one argument beyond its self reference: the key
whose value we're trying to fetch.
<p>Here's the fetch for our DotFiles example.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub FETCH {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        my $dot = shift;
        my $dir = $self->{HOME};
        my $file = "$dir/.$dot";
        unless (exists $self->{LIST}->{$dot} || -f $file) {
            carp "@{[&whowasi]}: no $dot file" if $DEBUG;
            return undef;
        }
        if (defined $self->{LIST}->{$dot}) {
            return $self->{LIST}->{$dot};
        } else {
            return $self->{LIST}->{$dot} = `cat $dir/.$dot`;
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>It was easy to write by having it call the Unix cat(1) command, but it
would probably be more portable to open the file manually (and somewhat
more efficient).  Of course, since dot files are a Unixy concept, we're
not that concerned.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_store_2">
STORE this, key, value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered every time an element in the tied hash is set
(written).  It takes two arguments beyond its self reference: the index at
which we're trying to store something, and the value we're trying to put
there.
<p>Here in our DotFiles example, we'll be careful not to let
them try to overwrite the file unless they've called the <EM>clobber()</EM>
method on the original object reference returned by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub STORE {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        my $dot = shift;
        my $value = shift;
        my $file = $self->{HOME} . "/.$dot";
        my $user = $self->{USER};
        croak "@{[&whowasi]}: $file not clobberable"
            unless $self->{CLOBBER};
        open(F, "> $file") || croak "can't open $file: $!";
        print F $value;
        close(F);
    }

</XMP>
<p>If they wanted to clobber something, they might say:
<p>
<XMP>
    $ob = tie %daemon_dots, 'daemon';
    $ob->clobber(1);
    $daemon_dots{signature} = "A true daemon\n";

</XMP>
<p>Another way to lay hands on a reference to the underlying object is to
use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tied_0">tied()</A>
 function, so they might alternately have set clobber
using:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %daemon_dots, 'daemon';
    tied(%daemon_dots)->clobber(1);

</XMP>
<p>The clobber method is simply:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub clobber {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->{CLOBBER} = @_ ? shift : 1;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_delete_0">
DELETE this, key</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method is triggered when we remove an element from the hash,
typically by using the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_delete_0">delete()</A>
 function.  Again, we'll
be careful to check whether they really want to clobber files.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub DELETE   {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        my $dot = shift;
        my $file = $self->{HOME} . "/.$dot";
        croak "@{[&whowasi]}: won't remove file $file"
            unless $self->{CLOBBER};
        delete $self->{LIST}->{$dot};
        unlink($file) || carp "@{[&whowasi]}: can't unlink $file: $!";
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_clear_0">
CLEAR this</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method is triggered when the whole hash is to be cleared, usually by
assigning the empty list to it.
<p>In our example, that would remove all the user's dotfiles!  It's such a
dangerous thing that they'll have to set CLOBBER to something higher than
1 to make it happen.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub CLEAR    {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        croak "@{[&whowasi]}: won't remove all dotfiles for $self->{USER}"
            unless $self->{CLOBBER} > 1;
        my $dot;
        foreach $dot ( keys %{$self->{LIST}}) {
            $self->DELETE($dot);
        }
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_exists_0">
EXISTS this, key</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method is triggered when the user uses the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exists_0">exists()</A>
 function
on a particular hash.  In our example, we'll look at the <CODE>{LIST}</CODE>
hash element for this:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub EXISTS   {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        my $dot = shift;
        return exists $self->{LIST}->{$dot};
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_firstkey_0">
FIRSTKEY this</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method will be triggered when the user is going
to iterate through the hash, such as via a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>

call.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub FIRSTKEY {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        my $a = keys %{$self->{LIST}};          # reset each() iterator
        each %{$self->{LIST}}
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_nextkey_0">
NEXTKEY this, lastkey</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method gets triggered during a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>
 iteration.  It has a
second argument which is the last key that had been accessed.  This is
useful if you're carrying about ordering or calling the iterator from more
than one sequence, or not really storing things in a hash anywhere.
<p>For our example, we our using a real hash so we'll just do the simple
thing, but we'll have to indirect through the LIST field.
<p>
<XMP>
    sub NEXTKEY  {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
        my $self = shift;
        return each %{ $self->{LIST} }
    }

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perltie_destroy_0">
DESTROY this</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This method is triggered when a tied hash is about to go out of
scope.  You don't really need it unless you're trying to add debugging
or have auxiliary state to clean up.  Here's a very simple function:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub DESTROY  {
        carp &whowasi if $DEBUG;
    }

</XMP>
<p>
</DL>
Note that functions such as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_values_0">values()</A>
 may return huge array.values when used on large objects, like DBM files.  You may prefer to
use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>
 function to iterate over such.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    # print out history file offsets
    use NDBM_File;
    tie(%HIST, NDBM_File, '/usr/lib/news/history', 1, 0);
    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
        print $key, ' = ', unpack('L',$val), "\n";
    }
    untie(%HIST);

</XMP>

<A NAME="perltie_bugs_0">
BUGS</A>
</H1>
Tied arrays are <EM>incomplete</EM>.  They are also distinctly lacking something
for the <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__13">$#</A>
ARRAY</CODE> access (which is hard, as it's an lvalue), as well as
the other obvious array functions, like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pop_0">pop()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_shift_0">shift()</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unshift_0">unshift()</A>
,
and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_splice_2">splice()</A>
.
<p>You cannot easily tie a multilevel data structure (such as a hash of
hashes) to a dbm file.  The first problem is that all but GDBM and
Berkeley DB have size limitations, but beyond that, you also have problems
with how references are to be represented on disk.  One experimental
module that does attempt to partially address this need is the MLDBM
module.  Check your nearest CPAN site as described in 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the <EM>perlmod</EM> manpage</A>
 for
source code to MLDBM.

Plan:
	The most merciful thing in the world... is the inability of the 
human mind to correlate all its contents.  We live on a placid island of 
ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant 
that we should voyage far.  The sciences, each straining in its own 
direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piercing 
together of dissociated knowledge will open such terrifying vistas of 
reality... that we shall either go mad from revelation or flee from the 
deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

perlstyle - Perl style guide

<A NAME="perlstyle_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
Each programmer will, of course, have his or her own preferences in
regards to formatting, but there are some general guidelines that will
make your programs easier to read, understand, and maintain.  
<p>The most important thing is to run your programs under the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>

flag at all times.  You may turn it off explicitly for particular
portions of code via the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_w_0">
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__18">$^</A>
W</A>
 variable if you must.  You should
also always run under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict</A>
 or know the reason why not.
The &lt;use sigtrap&gt; and even &lt;use diagnostics&gt; pragmas may also prove
useful.
<p>Regarding aesthetics of code lay out, about the only thing Larry
cares strongly about is that the closing curly brace of
a multi-line BLOCK should line up with the keyword that started the construct.
Beyond that, he has other preferences that aren't so strong:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>4-column indent.
<p>
<LI>Opening curly on same line as keyword, if possible, otherwise line up.
<p>
<LI>Space before the opening curly of a multiline BLOCK.
<p>
<LI>One-line BLOCK may be put on one line, including curlies.
<p>
<LI>No space before the semicolon.
<p>
<LI>Semicolon omitted in ``short'' one-line BLOCK.
<p>
<LI>Space around most operators.
<p>
<LI>Space around a ``complex'' subscript (inside brackets).
<p>
<LI>Blank lines between chunks that do different things.
<p>
<LI>Uncuddled elses.
<p>
<LI>No space between function name and its opening paren.
<p>
<LI>Space after each comma.
<p>
<LI>Long lines broken after an operator (except ``and'' and ``or'').
<p>
<LI>Space after last paren matching on current line.
<p>
<LI>Line up corresponding items vertically.
<p>
<LI>Omit redundant punctuation as long as clarity doesn't suffer.
<p>
</UL>
Larry has his reasons for each of these things, but he doen't claim that.everyone else's mind works the same as his does.
<p>Here are some other more substantive style issues to think about:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Just because you <EM>CAN</EM> do something a particular way doesn't mean that
you <EM>SHOULD</EM> do it that way.  Perl is designed to give you several
ways to do anything, so consider picking the most readable one.  For
instance
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FOO,$foo) || die "Can't open $foo: $!";

</XMP>
<p>is better than
<p>
<XMP>
    die "Can't open $foo: $!" unless open(FOO,$foo);

</XMP>
<p>because the second way hides the main point of the statement in a
modifier.  On the other hand
<p>
<XMP>
    print "Starting analysis\n" if $verbose;

</XMP>
<p>is better than
<p>
<XMP>
    $verbose && print "Starting analysis\n";

</XMP>
<p>since the main point isn't whether the user typed 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_v_0">-v</A>
 or not.
<p>Similarly, just because an operator lets you assume default arguments
doesn't mean that you have to make use of the defaults.  The defaults
are there for lazy systems programmers writing one-shot programs.  If
you want your program to be readable, consider supplying the argument.
<p>Along the same lines, just because you <EM>CAN</EM> omit parentheses in many
places doesn't mean that you ought to:
<p>
<XMP>
    return print reverse sort num values %array;
    return print(reverse(sort num (values(%array))));

</XMP>
<p>When in doubt, parenthesize.  At the very least it will let some poor
schmuck bounce on the <STRONG>% </STRONG>key in <STRONG>vi</STRONG>.
<p>Even if you aren't in doubt, consider the mental welfare of the person
who has to maintain the code after you, and who will probably put
parens in the wrong place.
<p>
<LI>Don't go through silly contortions to exit a loop at the top or the
bottom, when Perl provides the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_last_0">last</A>
 operator so you can exit in
the middle.  Just ``outdent'' it a little to make it more visible:
<p>
<XMP>
    LINE:
        for (;;) {
            statements;
          last LINE if $foo;
            next LINE if /^#/;
            statements;
        }

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>Don't be afraid to use loop labels--they're there to enhance
readability as well as to allow multi-level loop breaks.  See the
previous example.
<p>
<LI>Avoid using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_grep_1">grep()</A>
 (or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_map_1">map()</A>
) or `backticks` in a void context, that is,
when you just throw away their return values.  Those functions all 
have return values, so use them.  Otherwise use a <EM>foreach()</EM> loop or
the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_system_1">system()</A>
 function instead.
<p>
<LI>For portability, when using features that may not be implemented on
every machine, test the construct in an eval to see if it fails.  If
you know what version or patchlevel a particular feature was
implemented, you can test 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar__30">$]</A>
 (
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_perl_version_0">$PERL_VERSION</A>
 in <CODE>English</CODE>) to see if it
will be there.  The <CODE>Config</CODE> module will also let you interrogate values
determined by the <STRONG>Configure</STRONG> program when Perl was installed.
<p>
<LI>Choose mnemonic identifiers.  If you can't remember what mnemonic means,
you've got a problem.
<p>
<LI><EM>* </EM>
While short identifiers like <STRONG>$gotit</STRONG> are probably ok, use underscores to
separate words.  It is generally easier to read <STRONG>$var_names_like_this</STRONG> than
<STRONG>$VarNamesLikeThis</STRONG>, especially for non-native speakers of English. It's
also a simple rule that works consistently with VAR_NAMES_LIKE_THIS.
<p>Package names are sometimes an exception to this rule.  Perl informally
reserves lowercase module names for ``pragma'' modules like <CODE>integer</CODE> and
<CODE>strict</CODE>.  Other modules should begin with a capital letter and use mixed
case, but probably without underscores due to limitations in primitive
filesystems' representations of module names as files that must fit into a
few sparse bites.
<p>
<LI>You may find it helpful to use letter case to indicate the scope 
or nature of a variable. For example: 
<p>
<XMP>
    $ALL_CAPS_HERE   constants only (beware clashes with perl vars!)  
    $Some_Caps_Here  package-wide global/static 
    $no_caps_here    function scope my() or local() variables 

</XMP>
<p>Function and method names seem to work best as all lowercase. 
E.g., <STRONG>$obj</STRONG>-&gt;<EM>as_string()</EM>. 
<p>You can use a leading underscore to indicate that a variable or
function should not be used outside the package that defined it.
<p>
<LI>If you have a really hairy regular expression, use the <CODE>/x</CODE> modifier and
put in some whitespace to make it look a little less like line noise.
Don't use slash as a delimiter when your regexp has slashes or backslashes.
<p>
<LI>Use the new ``and'' and ``or'' operators to avoid having to parenthesize
list operators so much, and to reduce the incidence of punctuational
operators like <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> and <CODE>||</CODE>.  Call your subroutines as if they were
functions or list operators to avoid excessive ampersands and parens.
<p>
<LI>Use here documents instead of repeated 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print()</A>
 statements.
<p>
<LI>Line up corresponding things vertically, especially if it'd be too long
to fit on one line anyway.  
<p>
<XMP>
    $IDX = $ST_MTIME;       
    $IDX = $ST_ATIME       if $opt_u; 
    $IDX = $ST_CTIME       if $opt_c;     
    $IDX = $ST_SIZE        if $opt_s;     
    mkdir $tmpdir, 0700 or die "can't mkdir $tmpdir: $!";
    chdir($tmpdir)      or die "can't chdir $tmpdir: $!";
    mkdir 'tmp',   0777 or die "can't mkdir $tmpdir/tmp: $!";

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>Always check the return codes of system calls.  Good error messages should
go to STDERR, include which program caused the problem, what the failed
system call and arguments were, and VERY IMPORTANT) should contain the
standard system error message for what went wrong.  Here's a simple but
sufficient example:
<p>
<XMP>
    opendir(D, $dir)     or die "can't opendir $dir: $!";

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>Line up your translations when it makes sense:
<p>
<XMP>
    tr [abc]
       [xyz];

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>Think about reusability.  Why waste brainpower on a one-shot when you
might want to do something like it again?  Consider generalizing your
code.  Consider writing a module or object class.  Consider making your
code run cleanly with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use strict</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_w_0">-w</A>
 in effect.  Consider giving away
your code.  Consider changing your whole world view.  Consider... oh,
never mind.
<p>
<LI>Be consistent.
<p>
<LI>Be nice.
<p>
</UL>

Project:
I transfer the light from one candle to another.
Plan:
Say goodbye on a night like this
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say hello on a day like today
Say it everytime you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can't stand here like this anymore
For always and ever is always for you
I want it to be perfect
Like before
I want to change it all

  -- "a night like this", the cure

<H1>NAME</H1>
fstab - static information about the filesystems
<H1>SYNOPSIS</H1>
#include <fstab.h>
<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
The file
<B>fstab</B>
contains descriptive information about the various file systems.
<B>fstab</B>
is only read by programs, and not written; it is the duty of the system
administrator to properly create and maintain this file.  Each filesystem
is described on a separate line; fields on each line are separated by tabs
or spaces. The order of records in
<B>fstab</B>
is important because fsck (8), mount (8), and umount (8) sequentially iterate through
<B>fstab</B>
doing their thing.
<P>
The first field,
<B>fs_spec</B>
describes the block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted.
<P>
The second field,
<B>fs_file</B>
describes the mount point for the filesystem. For swap partitions, this
field should be specified as ``none''.
<P>
The third field,
<B>fs_vfstype</B>
describes the type of the filesystem.  The system currently supports three
types of filesystems:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>minix</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem, supporting filenames of length 14 or 30 characters.
<LI>
<B>ext</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem with longer filenames and larger inodes.  This
filesystem has been replaced by the
<B>ext2</B>
file system, and should no longer be used.
<LI>
<B>ext2</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem with longer filenames, larger inodes, and lots of other
features.
<LI>
<B>xiafs</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem with longer filenames, larger inodes, and lots of other
features.
<LI>
<B>msdos</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem for MS-DOS partitions.
<LI>
<B>hpfs</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem for HPFS partitions.
<LI>
<B>iso9660</B>
<BR>
a local filesystem used for CD-ROM drives.
<LI>
<B>nfs</B>
<BR>
a filesystem for mounting partitions from remote systems.
<LI>
<B>swap</B>
<BR>
a disk partition to be used for swapping.
</UL>
<P>
If
<B>vfs_fstype</B>
is specified as ``ignore'' the entry is ignored. This is useful to show
disk partitions which are currently unused.
<P>
The fourth field,
<B>fs_mntops</B>
describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.
It is formatted as a comma separated list of options.  It contains at least
the type of mount plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem
type.  For documentation on all of the available options, see mount (8).
<P>
The fifth field,
<B>fs_freq</B>
is used for these filesystems by the dump (8) command to determine which
filesystems need to be dumped.  If the fifth field is not present, a value
of zero is returned and dump will assume that the filesystem does not need
to be dumped.
<P>
The sixth field,
<B>fs_passno</B>
is used by the fsck (8) program to determine the order in which filesystem
checks are done at reboot time. The root filesystem should be specified
with a
<B>fs_passno</B>
of 1, and other filesystems should have a 
<B>fs_passno</B>
of 2.  Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially, but
filesystems on different drives will be checked at the same time to utilize
parallelism available in the hardware. If the sixth field is not present
or zero, a value of zero is returned and fsck will assume that the filesystem
does not need to be checked.
<P>
The proper way to read records from
<B>fstab</B>
is to use the routines getmntent (3).
<H1>FILES</H1>
<B>/etc/fstab</B>
resides in
<B>/etc</B>

Well, I'm here, but that is never a guarentee that I'll stay here.
	If you need me, the people at the given adress will most likely 
know where to find me.

Most likely, I will be out traveling the country since that is what I 
like to do and tend to take off doing from time to time.
But I'll be around.   .......(sometime).  Or I'll be in Aulstralia.  One 
or the other......Never know.

Well, my angelic self is off on another adventure....see you when I get 
here.  Or there, whichever the case may be.

<B>-t</B>
<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<B>edquota</B>
is a quota editor.  One or more users or groups may be specified on the command
line.  For each user or group a temporary file is created with an
<B>ASCII</B>
representation of the current disk quotas for that user or group and an editor
is then invoked on the file. The quotas may then be modified, new
quotas added, etc.  Upon leaving the editor,
<B>edquota</B>
reads the temporary file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect
the changes made.
<P>
The editor invoked is
<B>vi (1)</B>
unless the
<B>EDITOR</B>
environment variable specifies otherwise.
<P>
Only the super-user may edit quotas.  (In order for quotas to be
established on a file system, the root directory of the file system must
contain a file, owned by root, called
<B>quota.user</B>
or
<B>quota.group</B>
. See
<A HREF="quotaon(8).html">quotaon (8)</A>
for details.)
<H1>OPTIONS</H1>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>-u</B>
<BR>
Edit the userquota. This is the default.
<LI>
<B>-g</B>
<BR>
Edit the groupquota.
<LI>
<B>-p</B>
<BR>
Duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user specified for each user specified.
This is the normal mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.
<LI>
<B>-t</B>
<BR>
Edit the soft time limits for each file system. If the time limits are zero,
the default time limits in &ltlinux/quota.h&gt are used. Time units of sec(onds),
min(utes), hour(s), day(s), week(s), and month(s) are understood. Time limits
are printed in the greatest possible time unit such that the value is greater
than or equal to one.

quotacheck - scan a file system for disk usages
<H1>SYNOPSIS</H1>
<B>quotacheck</B>
[-g] [-u] [-v] -a
<BR>
<B>quotacheck</B>
[-g] [-u] [-v] filesys ...
<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<B>Quotacheck</B>
performs a filesystems scan for usage of files and directories, used
by either user or group. The output is the quota file for the 
corresponding filesystem. By default the names for these files are:
<UL>
<LI>
A user scan: 
<B>quota.user</B>
<LI>
A group scan:
<B>quota.group</B>
</UL>
<P>
The resulting file consist of a
<B>struct dqblk</B>
for each possible id up to the highest existing uid or gid and contains the
values for the disk file and block usage and possibly excess time for these
values. ( for definitions of
<B>struct dqblk</B>
see
<B>&ltlinux/quota.h&gt</B>
)
<P>
<B>Quotacheck</B>
should be run each time the system boots and mounts non-valid file systems.
This is most likely to happen after a system crash.
<P>
The speed of the scan decrease with the amount of directories increasing.
The time needed doubles when disk usage is doubled as well. A 100 MB partition
used for 94% is scanned in 1 minute, the same partition used for 50% is
done in 25 seconds.
<H1>OPTIONS</H1>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>-v</B>
<BR>
This way the program will give some usefull information about what it is
doing, plus some fancy stuff.
<LI>
<B>-d</B>
<BR>
This means debug. It will result in a lot of information which can be used
in debugging the program. The output is very verbose and the scan
will not be fast.
<LI>
<B>-u</B>
<BR>
This flag tells the program to scan the disk and to count the files and
directories used by a certain uid. This is the default action.
<LI>
<B>-g</B>
<BR>
This flag forces the program to count the the files and directories
used by a certain gid.
</UL>
<H1>NOTE</H1>
<B>Quotacheck</B>
should only be run as Super User. Non-privilidged users are presumably not allowed
to read all the directories on the given file system.

Plan:
	Ok, now that I've gotten some of this figured out I'll just write 
something really quickly.  A favorite quote of mine from quite a few 
years back.  Not that anyone will ever read it but...

	"Glass jaw, alcohol whore
	 Cardboard cadillac on the floor
	 Lame brain, drunk again
	 Stupid dum dum, cold plum insane"
			- PWEI

	** Sigh **  All of the memories, and all the weight of all the 
years lay heavy on my mind.  Ah well, so has it been so shall it be.  
Hope everything goes well for everyone.

	Now, hopefully this will work and my .project file will be 
properly updated and see if it works.  If it does you'll at least know 
where I am if I'm on.

BONN, GERMANY, 1996 JUN 25 (NB) -- Edzard Schmidt-Jotzig, the German  
Justizminister, has revealed that a new set of Cyberspace regulations 
will be introduced later this year. 

According to officials with the Justizministerium, the legislation  
will free Internet service providers (ISPs) in Germany from having to 
be responsible for policing their services for pornography and/or 
neo-nazi information. 

The legislation is similar to that currently being proposed by the  
European Commission (EC), and will only allow prosecution where it can 
be demonstrated that the ISP was aware of such transgressions, yet did 
nothing about it. 

Sources suggest that the legislation could take some time to be  
debated by the Bundesrat, as several states in Germany are known 
to favor the introduction of their own more rigorous rules. 

Such legislation may not have come in time for German Internet users,  
Newsbytes notes. Several ISPs in Germany are now spooling a mirror of 
their outbound Usenet feed to the de-cix site. According to reports 
from Germany, all postings to newsgroups will "occasionally" be 
checked for compliance with German laws. 

Plans call for a so-called Internet Content Task Force (ICTF) will be  
able to either cancel unwanted postings or even bar whole newsgroups 
from access in Germany. Plans also call for the ICTF to support any 
investigations carried out by the legal German authorities with their 
log files. 

[...]

The announcement of plans to introduce Internet legislation confirms  
plans announced last month that no draconian Internet-specific 
legislation would be introduced. As reported last month by Newsbytes, 
Juergen Ruettgers, the popular German research and technology 
minister, said that the Internet service provider (ISP) industry in 
Germany should be able to regulate its own affairs, rather than rely 
on the government for stringent controls. 

Ruettgers said at the time that the German government would not  
tolerate the distribution of neo-Nazi propaganda, child pornography, 
or other such information in the Internet. He told journalists that 
such information distribution is already outlawed under German law, 
so there is no need for Internet-specific legislation. 

Ruettgers admitted, however, that the current mood in the US  
surrounding the Internet is such that the German government is under 
pressure to act on the perceived problem. He also noted that the 
various state governments could use the issue to strengthen their own 
legislation, and so damage the expansion of the Internet in Germany. 

According to Ruettgers, the best way to encourage the creation of new  
jobs in the fledgling ISP industry in Germany is to leave it well 
alone as regards regulation. Any legislation that is required, he 
said, could be integrated fairly easily into the current crop of laws 
being introduced this year in preparation for the open competition 
rules mandated by the European Commission (EC) for January, 1998, 
introduction.

    Wild Card

    Could the hard-won victory
    against the Communications
    Decency Act be wasted by a
    lone wolf's lawsuit in New
    York?

    By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)


    There's a wild card in the ongoing legal
    assault on the Communications Decency Act
    (CDA): a little-known online journalist
    named Joe Shea, who this April filed a
    lawsuit against the CDA in federal court in
    New York City. 

    While most eyes have focused on the
    Philadelphia federal courtroom, where a
    high-profile coalition of 45 civil liberties
    groups, individuals, and corporations won
    a ringing victory on June 12, Shea has been
    quietly moving ahead with his own lawsuit
    and expects a decision late this week.

    If the Department of Justice (DoJ), which is
    defending the CDA, loses Shea's case and
    defies conventional wisdom by appealing it
    instead of the Philadelphia case to the
    Supreme Court, the fallout might be
    disastrous.

    The detailed court record that the American
    Library Association (ALA) and American
    Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorneys
    painstakingly assembled would be largely
    for nothing. An estimated $1 million in
    attorneys' fees would be gone. And the
    nation's high court would define the ground
    rules of speech in cyberspace based on
    Shea's weaker, narrower lawsuit, which
    challenges only part of the CDA.

SUMMARY

The NSW Attorney-General is still intent in imposing his net-ignorant
legislation to censor the Internet and has ignored requests from
business and the Internet using public to avoid censorship.  On 11 July
the State and Federal Attorneys-General will consider the proposed NSW
legislation as the basis for national legislation.  Now is the time to
contact your State and Federal Attorney-General and urge them to
listen to the business community and the Internet using public.

______________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND

The NSW Attorney-General has announced draft NSW Internet censorship
legislation which will be considered as the basis for national
legislation at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of
Attorneys-General (SCAG) on 11 July.  However each State is likely to
implement differing versions of a national model, adding or removing
parts as they see fit.  It seems likely that the Net community would
need to comply with the laws of the most repressive State.

Since the launch of the STOP! Campaign to stop Australian Net
censorship legislation on June 9, there has been increasing opposition
to the NSW proposals as the issues become more widely known. The issues
have been reported in the press across the nation. Recent editorials in
The Australian and The West Australian have expressed concern regarding
restriction on freedom of speech and the conceptual and practical
problems of the proposed laws.

It is apparent that it is not only the global nature of the Internet
which is being largely ignored. So too are the difficulties for
Internet Services Providers and users in being aware of and complying
with laws which vary from State to State.

Despite repeated requests, an official copy of the draft legislation 
has still not been provided.  The proposed legislation is based on the 
1995 DCA Consultation Paper which in its turn was based on the 1994 
BBS Task Force Report.  It appears that very little, if any, of the 
widespread criticism of both the Paper and the Report has been taken 
into account in deciding whether any legislation is required, or of 
its content.

Whilst there are indications that contact with State Attorneys-General
and their advisers is beginning to have some effect, much more is
needed.

______________________________________________________________________
ANALYSIS

The Draft Bill is technically incompetent.
The Draft Bill errs in creating offences of transmission.
The Draft Bill criminalises innocent conduct.
The Draft Bill is unnecessary.
The Draft Bill will fail in its objectives.
The Draft Bill is unenforceable.
The Draft Bill must be rejected outright.

The NSW proposals will:
- require ISPs to "monitor material being transmitted", including 
    private E-Mail.
- incriminate someone who has a hyptertext link to a site which is 
    prohibited (construed as advertising).
- assign the same liability to an innocent receiver of objectionable
    material as its creator.
- incriminate ISPs who "make available for access" material unsuitable
    for minors under 15.
- subject innocent Internet users to criminal sanctions, while doing
    little to achieve its stated aim of protecting children.

&gt; Seth, I'm no libertarian, but I do have a problem with any system that says
&gt; a private individual or business can't select, edit, censor, or whatever you
&gt; want to call it. I mean, what exactly are you suggesting?  Would we
&gt; *require* the operators of web servers to post any materials submitted ...

	There's a whole range of actions that could take place that don't
*require* anything. The fact that this is an immediate, knee-jerk
reaction along the same lines, now yet another person, says something
very significant. As I said, it's a real mental tick. Anytime something
negative is said about private action, bang, are-you-proposing-to-compel...
	We could begin by not having this immediate flaming at the
critic whenever a business is criticized. Bad publicity can have a very
potent effect on private conduct, but actions are less likely to be
changed if any complainant seeking assistance has to pass through a gauntlet
of "business is holy, how dare you question it".
	The typical tactics of influencing business are publicity
campaigns and boycotts. Boycotts are sometimes criticized themselves,
but for the scope of this discussion, I'll just point out that they are
a type of private action that doesn't require any government
intervention, We've got to get past the idea that business conduct can't
be opposed, and the immediate leap into absurdity at the very thought is
a symptom of how deeply this blindness is rooted.

The text of Hatch's bill, from Jim's Computer underground Digest. As I
wrote in Fight-Censorship Dispatch #13: 

  * Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), chair of Senate Judiciary, held a hearing
    on June 4 where family values activists testified in support of
    Hatch's bill that gives you 15 years for creating or viewing a
    GIF that "appears to be" or is said to be kiddie porn -- even if
    it's actually a morphed photo of an adult.

The American Library Association and the ACLU, among other groups, oppose 
this bill as currently written.

((MODERATORS' NOTE: This week, C-CSPAN televised the hearings of S
1237, which would greatly expand the definition of "child
pornography" in a way that some feel would restrict otherwise
protected expression of art, literature, and even communication of
fantasy. Below is the text of the Bill)).

Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1995 (Introduced in the Senate)

   S 1237 IS

   104th CONGRESS

   1st Session

   S. 1237

   To amend certain provisions of law relating to child pornography, and
   for other purposes.

   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

  SEPTEMBER 13 (LEGISLATIVE DAY, SEPTEMBER 5), 1995

   Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. ABRAHAM, Mr. GRASSLEY, and Mr. THURMOND)
   introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to
   the Committee on the Judiciary

     _________________________________________________________________


   A BILL

   To amend certain provisions of law relating to child pornography, and
   for other purposes.

   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
       States of America in Congress assembled,

  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

   This Act may be cited as the `Child Pornography Prevention Act of
       1995'.

  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

   Congress finds that--

        (1) the use of children in the production of sexually explicit
            material, including photographs, films, videos, computer
            images, and other visual depictions, is a form of sexual
            abuse which can result in physical or psychological harm, or
            both, to the children involved;

        (2) child pornography permanently records the victim's abuse, and
            its continued existence causes the child victims of sexual
            abuse continuing harm by haunting those children in future
            years;

        (3) child pornography is often used as part of a method of
            seducing other children into sexual activity; a child who is
            reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to
            pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be
            convinced by viewing depictions of other children `having
            fun' participating in such activity;

        (4) prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornography
            encourages the possessors of such material to destroy them,
            thereby helping to protect the victims of child pornography
            and to eliminate the market for the sexually exploitative use
            of children; and

        (5) the elimination of child pornography and the protection of
            children from sexual exploitation provide a compelling
            governmental interest for prohibiting the production,
            distribution, possession, or viewing of child pornography.

  SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

   Section 2256 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--

        (1) in paragraph (2)(E), by inserting before the semicolon the
            following: `, or the buttocks of any minor, or the breast of
            any female minor';

        (2) in paragraph (5), by inserting before the semicolon the
            following: `, and data stored on computer disk or by
            electronic means which is capable of conversion into a visual
            image';

        (3) in paragraph (6), by striking `and';

        (4) in paragraph (7), by striking the period and inserting `;
            and'; and

        (5) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

        `(8) `child pornography' means any visual depiction, including
            any photograph, film, video, picture, drawing, or computer or
            computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced
            by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually
            explicit conduct, where--

             `(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the
                 use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;

             `(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor
                 engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or

             `(C) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted,
                 presented, described, or distributed in such a manner
                 that conveys the impression that the material is or
                 contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in
                 sexually explicit conduct.'.

  SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES RELATING TO MATERIAL CONSTITUTING OR CONTAINING
  CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

   (a) IN GENERAL- Section 2252 of title 18, United States Code, is
       amended to read as follows:

    `Sec. 2252. Certain activities relating to material constituting or
    containing child pornography

   `(a) Any person who--

        `(1) knowingly mails, transports, or ships in interstate or

        `(2) knowingly receives or distributes--

Reed Hundt's comments below on the ACTA petition and Internet telephony 
in general are encouraging, but I note he doesn't rule out all 
Net-regulation by the FCC. Instead, he just rules out "thoughtless" 
regulation.

(This posting contains some of my personal opinions.)

FCC Chairman Reed Hundt has recently made statements indicating that
he supports Internet voice technology and is inclined to oppose the
petition that calls for its regulation.  This good news comes from the
Voice On the Net coalition (which represents companies offering
Internet voice technologies).  While Hundt does not indicate what
swayed him in the statements quoted below, I find it gratifying that
he makes essentially the same points emphasized by the CPSR comment to
the FCC.

The speech in its entirety is at the site:

	http://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Hundt/spreh629.txt

Most of it sounds like a person who wants to talk himself out of a
job--it's all about letting the market determine what happens rather
than government regulation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The FCC has received a petition from the America's Carriers'
Telecommunications Association asking that we restrict the sale of
"Internet phone" software, because the providers of that software do
not comply with the rules that apply to telecommunications carriers.
Similar issues are being discussed in other countries, including
Canada.  We've just finished getting comments on that petition.  We're
in the process of reviewing those comments now, but I would just note
that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration,
the Administration's telecommunications expert, has filed very
thoughtful and well-reasoned comments with us asking us to reject this
petition.

I am also strongly inclined to believe that the right answer at this
time is not to place restrictions on software providers, or to subject
Internet telephony to the same rules that apply to conventional
circuit-switched voice carriers.  On the Internet, voice traffic is
just a particular kind of data, and imposing traditional regulatory
divisions on that data is both counterproductive and futile.  Even if
most of the FCC wasn't working around the clock on implementation of
the Telecommunications Act, I can't imagine that we would have the
time to keep track of all the bits passing over the Internet to
separate the "acceptable" data packets from the "unacceptable" voice
packets.

More importantly, we shouldn't be looking for ways to subject new
technologies to old rules.  Instead, we should be trying to fix the
old rules so that if those new technologies really are better, they
will flourish in the marketplace.  For years, some engineers have been
telling us that voice over a packet switched network wasn't possible.
The latency periods were too great, they said, and you'd never get
acceptable quality.  Well, it is going to be possible, and in the
short period of time since the first commercial products became
available, the quality has been rapidly improving.  But the last thing
we want to do is stop that improvement by thoughtless regulation.

Internet telephony may well become, in time, a competitive alternative
to traditional circuit-switched voice telephony.  After all, as the
growth of the cellular industry demonstrates, people are willing to
give up a significant level of quality in exchange for other benefits.
In the cellular case the benefit is the ability to make a call from
virtually anywhere, in the case of Internet telephony the benefit is a
vastly lower price.  This is especially true, for example, for
international telephone calls.

Eric Adler of the Kansas City Star caught some less-covered moments from
the Olympics.  Including this one:

	Foreign journalists getting pepper spray in the face as they
	tried to enter their offices after the Olympic Park bombing.
	Police wanted to secure the building. Reporters wanted to file
	stories. Struck by the spray, some journalists fell to their knees, 
	vomiting.

House approves anti-terrorism bill
By Rose Aguilar

August 2, 1996, 6:15 p.m. PST

          The United States House of Representatives tonight approved the
          Anti-Terrorism act of 1996 by a sweeping 389 to 22 vote, but to
          the relief of Net activists passed a version free of amendments
          that would have regulated Net content, restricted encryption
          technology, and expanded the use of wiretapping.

          The Democrats fought hard for the encryption, Internet, and
          wiretapping provisions, but lost to arguments from
          conservatives and libertarians that the provisions would be an
          infringement of citizens' First Amendments rights. The law that
          was approved by the house also did not include the amendment
          re-introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would have made
          it a felony to publish information about bombs and bomb-making
          on the Internet.

[...]

          The anti-terrorism section of the bill adds several
          terrorism-related crimes to the list of offenses included in
          the federal antiracketeering law. Under this section, the
          penalty for unlawful disclosure of information obtained from a
          wiretap doubles from 5 to 10 years.

          The bill went to the Senate today. Supporters would like the
          bill to be approved without changes and then sent to the
          President. The Senate may vote as early as Saturday or may
          decide to make changes and wait to approve its own version
          until next month.

          "I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said online
          activist Declan McCullagh. "The Senate may or may not act
          tomorrow, but I think the Net has a reprieve from the Net
          crackdown in terms of bomb information until September," he
          said.

Louis Freeh beats his fear-mongering drum while singing his wiretap tune....


From: http://www.cnn.com

FBI chief: U.S. 'under attack' by terrorists
August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 6:05 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States may face "a very difficult time"
coping with terrorists, and new counter-terrorism weapons are needed,
FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.

On expanded wiretap powers being sought by the FBI as part of that
defense, he said: "We're simply trying to catch up with technology. And
that is critical."

[ ... ]

He referred to the two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 24
servicemen; the bombing that killed one woman at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta; and the still-unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800.

Although the combined incidents have "completely consumed" law
enforcement personnel, Freeh said the wiretap proposals would not give
the government "expansive powers" and would not lead to "an avalanche of
new electronic surveillance."

"The United States and its interests both here and around the world are
clearly under attack. And we may be in for a very difficult time with
respect to continuation of these types of things," Freeh said.

Anti-terrorism negotiations

Freeh spoke a day after the White House, after wrangling with key
Republican lawmakers, won tentative agreement on a package of
anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority.

[ ... ]

The negotiators, led by Craig and White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, hoped to have a package ready for a vote by the end of the
week.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders summoned
Attorney General Janet Reno, Panetta and Freeh to a private meeting
Thursday to explain why some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't
been spent.

"We have been somewhat behind in the hiring of people" for
anti-terrorism programs, because of the time needed to screen applicants
for such sensitive work, Freeh explained during his Senate testimony
Thursday.

   Scientology. On Flag, I trained to be an auditor (a Scientology

NETCOM SETTLES SUIT WITH CHURCH

Out-of-court deal with Scientologists

BY MARK LEIBOVICH
Mercury News Staff Writer

A lawsuit that many in the online community feared would set a
precedent restricting freedom of expression on the internet was
resolved quitely Saturday in an out-of-court settlement in San
Jose.

Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc. announced it has
settled the intellectual property dispute initiated by
Religious Technology Center, the publishing wing of the Church
of Scientology.

RTC had brought a claim against Netcom, seeking to prohibited
what is viewed as illegal postings of sacred church writings,
some of which it claimed were protected under US copyright
laws.  Both parties agreed not to disclose specific details
of the settlement.

According to a statement, Netcom as set up a protocol on its
company home page for handling future intellectual property
disputes.

[...]

The full text of the protocol can be found on Netcom's home
page, at
http://www.netcom.com/about/protectcopy.html

[...]

"I would hate to see Netcom be put in the position of having
to police the material posted on its service," says Howard
Rheingold, a well-known digital community guru, and author of
the 1993 book Virtual Community, who is not familiar with the
details of the case.

&gt;From the Sunday times:-

AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into
the computers of the European parliament and
European commission as part of an international
espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and
political secrets, according to investigators, write
Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. 

The European parliament has called in British
communications experts to improve its security and
to block further attempts by American govern ment
agents to spy on its workings. 

Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg
offices say they have discovered several recent
instances in which its communications system was
compromised by American hacking. They have also
found evidence that the Americans used information
obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations
last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). 

Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the
European parliament, said he was shocked by the
disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the
American ambassador [to the European Union]," he
said. 

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese
and French governments of hacking into their
communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets. 

The European parliament's computer network links
more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and
other staff to each other, and to the European
commission headquarters in Brussels and the council
of ministers. 

Traffic across the network by telephone and
computers includes details of the private medical
and financial records of many MEPs and officials,
and discussion documents on confidential issues,
including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The
records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE
and fraud are also stored on the system. 

European parliament sources say the Americans
accessed the network by compromising the
information exchanges that link the parliament's
internal networks with the Internet and external
users. 

The devices, called "routers", filter entry to the
European parliament's network. It is understood the
Americans were able to obtain access to what is
called the simple network management protocol
(SNMP), the language that enables the networks to
talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact
that parts of the system were manufactured by two
American firms. 

The breach came to light when officials believed
that American negotiators had been given advance
warning of confidential European Union positions
in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established
that the system had been penetrated just days before
the talks," an EU source said. "Our principal
concern is not to establish what has already been
copied but to ensure that it does not happen again.
This is an on-going problem." 

A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of
data processing at the commission, confirmed that
allegations of hacking had been investigated.
However, she said she was unable to provide any
details.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense authorization appropriations bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of 
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.
                  
   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

This is the truly astonishing thing to me about terrorism in America. If,
at least for the sake of argument, the goal of terrorism in America is to
weaken the country through such attacks, it's phenomenally stupid to hand
terrorists a victory on a silver platter by gutting our Constitution as our
response.

Why bother to bring down the American government when the American
government can do a pretty good job of peeling way the nation's alleged
principles all on it own in the name of political brownie points?

           O'REILLY ANNOUNCES "NETACTIVISM" GUIDE TO
           USING THE INTERNET IN GRASSROOTS POLITICS
  Veteran Grassroots Activist Shares the Secrets of Online Success

SEBASTOPOL, CA--It's no secret that the American citizen is fed up with
politics as usual. Fewer people are voting in every election, and those
who do vote aren't sure it matters. During this presidential primary
season, noted Internet publisher O'Reilly & Associates is releasing in
"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet," a book that will show
ordinary people who want to reclaim politics--from the neighborhood to
the national level--how to use the power of the Internet to make a
difference.

Written by veteran political activist and former Philadelphia city
councilman Ed Schwartz, "NetActivism" is a no-hype guide that shows
readers how to use the Internet to find out what the government really
does, as well as how to organize around a cause or a community with
online tools like electronic mailing lists, online debates, and Web
sites.

A leader in citizen movements for more than 30 years, author Schwartz
embraced the Internet not because it's cool, but because it gets the
job done. He has an extensive online presence: a Web site
(http://libertynet.org/community/phila/natl.html) that serves community
activists across the country, a mailing list that discusses civic
values, and ties to a community network that organizes citizens across
the city of Philadelphia. "NetActivism" features real-world examples
from Schwartz's Institute for Civic Values and a host of other citizen
groups, including the Downtown Minneapolis Residents Association and
Project VoteSmart.

Community activists, politicians--and any concerned citizens who care
about their community--will find "NetActivism" packed with advice on
conducting online research, getting the right equipment and software,
using online networks in local communities, and crafting political
campaigns on the Net.

"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet" will be released on
September 24. Produced by O'Reilly affiliate Songlione Studios for
O'Reilly's Songline Guide imprint, "NetActivism" includes a CD-ROM with
Internet software and limited free online time.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ed Schwartz, founder and president of the Institute for the Study of
Civic Values, has been a national leader in movements to revitalize
neighborhoods and expand citizen participation in government for more
than 25 years.  In the 1970s, he built a city-wide coalition of
community organizations that led to his upset election to the
Philadelphia City Council as a councilman-at-large in 1984. Between
1987 and 1992, he served as director of Philadelphia's Office of
Housing and Community Development, overseeing the rehabilitation of
more than 4,000 houses and apartments for low-income residents of the
City. In 1992, he returned to the Institute for the Study of Civic
Values full-time to develop new models for community planning and
citizen empowerment for the 1990's.

Dr. Schwartz, who received his Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers
University, has written widely on problems related to civic
participation, neighborhood development, and America's democratic
heritage. His first book, "Will the Revolution Succeed?" has been
followed by articles and reviews in The New York Times Book Review, The
Nation, The American Prospect, Shelterforce, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
and The Philadelphia Daily News. The work of the Institute for the
Study of Civic Values itself is profiled extensively in Robert Bellah's
award-winning book, "Habits of the Heart."

Bryan,

I've taken the liberty of forwarding your note, along with my prepended
comments, to the fight-censorship mailing list.

I confess I'm not sure what recourse you have now that GeoCities has killed
your web site's graphics. Their current policy says that "nudity or
pornographic material of any kind" is verboten. Do you have the URLs to
other nude sites that remain on GeoCities?

At http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homeguide.html, I found:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a summary of things that are not permitted as part of
the GeoCities free Personal Home Page Program:

1.Material that is grossly offensive to the Web community including
blatant expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity

2.Pages that promote or provide instructional information about illegal
activities

3.Pages that promote physical harm or injury against any group or
individual

4.The use of free Personal Home Pages for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the following:

Soliciting for advertisers or sponsors

Displaying a sponsorship banner of any kind, including those that are
generated by "banner exchange" services

Displaying banners for services that provide cash or cash-equivalent
prizes to users in exchange for hyperlinks to their web site.

Conducting raffles or contests that require any type of entry fee

5.Pages that contain nudity or pornographic material of any kind

6.Pages that exploit images of children under 18 years of age

7.Restricted or Password-only access pages

8.Hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible
page)

9.Use of the page (or directory) as storage for remote loading

10.Use of the page as a door or signpost to another server

11.Use of copyrighted material without the prior permission from the
author
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.

Does anyone else have any insights?

Subject: censorship at www.geocities.com

Over a month ago I responded to a soliciation for a free personal home page
from www.geocities.com (which is advertised on their home page). They are
promoting theme-based neighborhoods for the home pages. The only content
guidelines were that nothing injurious to any person or group is permitted.
Based on those guidlelines, I felt the server a safe place to display my art
work and I placed my drawings of male nudes on an available address in
GeoCities' WestHollywood neighborhood. I have noticed other sites on
GeoCities with an equal amount of nudity. The only difference was my site
displayed the blue ribbon online freedom icon with a link to the EFF site.

Well, 30 days  and 10,000 hits to my site later (I heavily promoted my site
with listings in many art related directories), I awakened one morning to a
barage of e-mail from people informing me my site had been stripped of all
its graphics--everything from the blue ribbon icon to my nude art work, only
part of which contained male frontal nudity, to the photo of myself
fully-clothed. Later I was to receive an impersonal e-mail notification from
 GeoCities informing me that I was violating their content guidelines which
they now claim prohibit nudity (which I did not find in their posted
guidelines all the while other nude sites remain on GeoCities).

I am very distressed that after all my work and sincere efforts to produce a
tasteful site (which I received many e-mail compliments on wordwide),  I
would have it stripped bare in Nazi style of all the graphics, the essence of
my artistic energy.

Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
of expression in art and lifestyles.

Usually, tracking international net-censorship efforts is depressing.
However, this UPI report on the pissing match between N. Korea and S. Korea
made me laugh aloud. The North Koreans are posturing brilliantly -- truly
trying to force Seoul's hand, and using the Net to do it.

        TOKYO, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea's official news agency blasted
South Korea Tuesday for allegedly blocking its citizens' access to a new
Internet page sponsored by Pyongyang, a report monitored in Tokyo said.
        ``What they (Seoul) should block is not the North Korean Page but the
U.S. channel dealing with methods of murder and robbery and pornographic
scenes too shameful to watch,'' the Korean Central News Agency dispatch
said.
        The KCNA report quoted researcher Kim Hyong-sok of the Information
and Culture Center of North Korea as saying the history of the Internet
has seen no example of people being punished for monitoring certain
sites.
        ``Such punishment would cause bitter condemnation from the
international community,'' said Kim.
        Bristling with slogans about the ``great leader comrade Kim Il-sung,''
the Internet page has upset South Korean leaders, said KCNA, to the
point of having access to the site banned.
        ``The puppet Agency for National Security Planning and Prosecution
officially asked the Internet service organ in South Korea to block the
channel,'' said the KCNA report.
        The North Korean mouthpiece said the officials in Seoul should not
``trouble themselves'' because they do not have the equipment to block
the Internet page anyway.

[So Malaysia will censor only material that some government bureaucrat
finds "offensive?" What a commitment to free speech! Cynically, Declan]


         KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Reuter) - Malaysia on Thursday
unveils plans for a ``multimedia super corridor'' (MSC), which it
hopes will attract a new breed of foreign investors and propel
the country into the 21st century.

[...]

         [Proj director] Azzman said Malaysia would guarantee the
free flow of information. Sceptics have questioned that commitment in
a country where newspapers are licensed and the Printing and
Publications Act has been used to muzzle dissent.
         ``We have not censored the Internet, so the free flow of
information is very much the order of the day,'' said Azzman who
is director general of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronic Systems, a government agency that provides sole
access to the Internet in the country.
         ``We won't police what they do as long as it is within the
confines of the company,'' he said, adding companies in the MSC
can receive information from abroad, process it and then
transmit it out of the country without interference.
         The government would act only if illegal or offensive
materials like pornography were distributed within Malaysia.
         Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had agreed to set up a
regional office after meeting Mahathir last month. A ``couple of
dozen'' others have expressed ``keen interest'', Azzman said.
         The corridor would link the new airport and the futuristic
Putrajaya federal capital with the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a
mammoth office highrise project featuring the Petronas Towers,
the world's tallest buildings.

   BEIJING -- When it comes to controlling the Internet, China is
trying to learn from a little neighbor.
   In June, Beijing sent Zeng Jianhui, a top official, to Singapore to
pick up tips on expanding the use of the Internet within strict
limits. Singapore, a critic of unfettered dissent and Western culture,
is trying to become the network's model censor.
   ``China has a lot to learn from Singapore's experience,'' says a
Chinese government official studying Internet restrictions.

[...]

   Worried that the new electronic communications medium is spinning
out of its control and could undermine Communist propaganda, the
Chinese leadership decided in February to put teeth into Internet
regulations and prevent computer-disseminated pornography and
antigovernment material.
   The government is uneasy about cyberspace connections between
overseas democracy activists and Chinese dissidents, which blossomed
during political protests on the streets of Beijing and other major
cities during the spring of 1989. The few Chinese activists who are
not imprisoned or under detention are closely watched amid a
government crackdown on crime and political unrest.

[...]

   ``This is not having any negative effect on the Internet's
development in China,'' says Wang Jun, an official in the
telecommunications ministry's data communication bureau. ``It's just a
precautionary procedure.''

[...]

   In May, China launched a nationwide computer network that allows
only limited access to the Internet. The venture aims to avoid
breaking China's censorship laws by creating its own content and
making available only information useful for businesses.
   The new edited network, which is 60 percent owned by the official
New China News Agency and was launched in conjunction with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, does not face a censorship
problem because ``there is nothing illegal on the network,'' says
Joyce Wong, an executive with the Hong Kong-based China Internet Corp.

CSIS Calls Itself Canadas Political Police & States ARA Torched
Zundels House

Since the outrageously biased Heritage Front Affair Report published by
the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), a group of appointed
political has-beens and bagmen, we have had serious concerns that
Canadas security apparatus is utterly out of control and is spying
wholesale and contrary to the CSIS Act on legitimatre, non-violent
dissent. Some very disturbing confirmation of our fears has recently
come our way.

In February of this year, Kitchener, Ontario electronics businessman
Michael Rothe  was interviewed by two CSIS agents, who identified
themselves to him as such and showed ID. They were identified as Peter
and Angela. Rothe had organized several meetings in Kitchener for
British historian David Irving, who has since, under pressure from the
censorship lobby been banned from Canada, while planeloads of Tamil
terrorists and Jamican drug pushers and gunsels seem to have open access
to this country. The interview was taped. The revelations on thios tape
are staggering.

ANGELA: Have you heard of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
PETER: You can bet its real!.... Ill explain what we are. First, the
Canadian Security Intelligence service is like the BFK in Germany.
These are the dreaded so-called Federal  Constitution Protection  Police
(Bundesverfassungsschutz), which spy on the German right and are
blatantly a political police force. Just in case the frightened German
immigrant didnt get the point, Peter added: Were the political
police. Angela and I are from the counter-terrorism branch. ... We are
interested in the Heritage Front. He was then asked a number of
questions as to how he got involved in politics, how hed been contacted
by the Hereitage Front andf what he thought of this group, which CSIS,
through its agent Grant Bristow had helped fund and lead!
PETER: Did you ever meet Paul Fromm. Hes C-FAR and CAFE. The school
teacher from Mississauga. He would have been at the this David Irving
[meeting]. False!!!. Fromm was actually in Vancouver that day.
PETER: In Toronto, Wolfgang [Droege of the Heritage Front] has beren
much troubled by a group that calls itself Anti-Racist Action, ARA. This
is a collection of anarchists, Trotskyists, Stalinists.
ANGELA: The ARA that Peter described firebombed Ernst Zundel. Im sure
youve heard about the problem various leaders of the so-called right
wing have received firebombs. Shes apparently referring to the May 7,
1995 arson attack on Ernst Zundels Toronto residence/office, and
firebombings of Don Andrews and Nicola Polinuk.
PETER: So, were interested to know, ... were there ever  threats made
to you? That ought to put the fear of the Lord into him,

So, here we have CSISs descriptin of themselves as a political
police. Frightening! Then. theres the clear assertion that the
perpetratrors of the fire at Zundels and the firebombings in spring,
1995, were the ARA. If so, why havent they been arrested? Are they
being protected by the Canadian security establishment? Readers should
contact Solicitor-General Herb Gray and ask these questions. Ontario
readers should contact Solicitor-General Bob Runciman and ask why, in
light of this information, no charges have been laid by the Metropolitan
Toronto Police in these clearly political acts of terrorism. Had such an
attack been perpetrated on the offices of one the currently privileged
minoiorities, is there any doubt that every rightwinger to the starboard
of Joe Clark would have been hauled in for questioning?

______________________________________________________________________
SUMMARY

On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.

This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.

* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.

* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.

* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.

______________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND

This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.

Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.

In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.

Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.

Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export.
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography.
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.

What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.

2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this
   release for contact information for several such organisations.

3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:

&gt; What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
&gt; to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else have any insights?

I have a friend whose site containing nudity was treated in a very
similar way:  Wendy.

	http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4750

She had some beautifully tasteful partial nudes of herself on her
page; I would consider them erotic, not pornographic.  Unlike 
thie site in question here, I'd say that the main intent was to
show viewers a good time; there was essentially no content other
than the pictures.

When the hit counter went through the roof, they found her site and
apparently warned her a couple of times about its content not being
acceptable.  But she also played a mean trick on another Internet
user, which probably also contributed to her deletion.  It was apparently
some sort of revenge thing; I'm not sure who's right and who's wrong.
In my communications with her, I considered her a rather sweet lady
but not too frightfully verbal.  She certainly talked quite clearly
with her pictures, which revealed a stunningly perfect body.

I helped organize a brief protest campaign to Geocities which apparently
resulted in the reinstatement of her page, sans a few of the "best"
pictures.  And there, as far as I know, it remains.

The lesson from this would seem to be that you can probably get
Geocities to bend if you have enough friends.  (I probably don't
need to tell any of you here that being a gorgeous 25 year old girl
who loves to show off her body is one great way of acquiring
instant friends &lt;grin&gt;).

I hope this helps!

Best
D

&gt;Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
&gt;space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
&gt;sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
&gt;"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom

As a free service, Geocities has the right to determine which pages it
decides to sponsor.  This is not a good incident to espouse free speech

Two prime examples of site with PHOTOS  containng male frontal nudity on
GeoCities are:

Rob's Bound & Gagged
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3100

contains graphic photos of sadomaochism showing male genetalia

Nude Celebrities
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3102

My site only contained abstract pencil drawings with no sexual activity
portrayed.

There are dozens of sites containing nudity on GeoCities and obviously
something else is going on here.

Certainly, GeoCities has the right to determine which pages it decides to
sponsor. It may even have the right to offer the pages on on basis and then
pull them off under a new set of rules, after the page creator has invested
time in making them and publicizing their location. (I have the impression
from the initial message that this is what happened - can someone who knows
clarify this point?)

However, that does not mean they're not slimy for causing this kind of
unnecessary inconvenience, and it doesn't mean they shouldn't be called on
their acts and others who might be considering dealing with them alerted to
the possibility of a problem.

I personally would like to hear from GeoCities on why they chose to pull
the pages off. Did their policy change at any point, and if so, why did
they change it?

Um... and what would that be? Please go on. Obviously there is some
conspiracy forcing you to pay $7.50/month or so for unrestricted web
service, rather than getting it for free, but which conspiracy?

Yes, but it's not necessarily something sinister.  From the evidence
I've seen GeoCities is just responding to the "squeaky wheels."  When
a page gets a pile of hits they check it out.  I'm not especially
impressed with the actions they're taking, but I doubt there's any
plot to stifle free thinking on the net.

Get this one.  I just heard it on the afternoon news.  Two young boys were
seriously burned after a failed attempt at making napalm on their kitchen
stove.  Sounds like the normal fun activities of bored youth on summer break
right?  But hey - where did they get the recipe?  From the Anarchists
Cookbook in the library?  No - they got it from -- GASP -- the Anarchists
Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
-- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
sort of convention) are deciding whether or not to press charges.  See -
just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

     A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
     federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict
     his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a
     twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a
     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

     The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military
     technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which
     encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet,
     is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control.
     The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by
     defining "export" to include discussing technical information about
     non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students
     registered for Professor Junger's course.

     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

     Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on
     the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans
     to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this
     fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach,
     and to whom.

     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Folks, I apologize for the mail problems. I still haven't quite figured 
out exactly what happened -- I'm not at home, but in NYC on business, so 
I wasn't able to log on this evening until now.

Seems as though the problem happened when I forwarded a fight-censorship
message to cypherpunks, which has among its subscribers a nonexistent
address at axcess.net.in. For some reason, a poorly-configured machine at
axcess.net.in started repeatedly resending the forwarded message back to
fight-censorship. Odd. I think I've blocked it from doing it again. 

I blame the problem on AOL, of course.

On a topic more germane to the list, I was in Times Square with Glenn and
some NYC webperns this evening, having dinner in a delightful greasy
burger joint. For no apparent reason, a woman sitting next to me started
to describe, in painstaking detail, how to kill someone with a hatpin. (A
jab to the nerve center in the solar plexus, if you must know.)

I started to think to myself, especially after Dara's note earlier, that 
this kind of material should be banned! Censor biology texts on the Net!

Yours in protecting children from dangerous knowledge,

Declan

Subject: Washington Post letter by Sen. Burns

     Sen. Burns' letter to The Washington Post today contained something of 
     an error, in case you couldn't tell.
     
     A line from the original letter was deleted.
     
     The line that read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights" 
     should instead read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of current wiretapping authority, it is a drastic expansion. 
     it lays the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights."
     
     Fortunately, the overall meaning of the letter is left largely intact.


[Attached is Burns' letter. --Declan]
   


                      `SPEAKING IN CODE ON THE INTERNET'
   
   Friday, August 9 1996; Page A16
   The Washington Post
   
   
   The Post's editorial July 27 on my Pro-CODE bill to ease restrictions
   on encoded, or "encrypted," computer messages ["Speaking in Code on
   the Internet"] was generally balanced but deleted a couple of key
   points.
   
   First, my bill would not "lift" restrictions on the export of strong
   encryption technology, which is designed to allow people to protect
   their computer files and messages. Instead, it would allow the
   Commerce Department merely to ease export restrictions to a level of
   computer security that it deems is "generally available" in the
   nations we trade with.
   
   This bill does not open the floodgates. Instead, it is an
   acknowledgment of the real world and that high-tech U.S. companies
   must be allowed to compete in an increasingly vital sector of the
   world economy. One trade group stated the United States stands to lose
   $60 billion in market share and 216,000 jobs under the current
   restrictions.
   
   Second, the administration's proposal to seek a copy of decoder "keys"
   for our electronic information is not simply an extension of the
   groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights. Imagine a Craig
   Livingstone or an Aldrich Ames being designated the "trusted third
   party" who holds the keys.
   
   Supporters of my bill have never maintained that some criminals will
   not attempt to use encryption to evade law enforcement. But the bill
   is an attempt to address the encryption status quo, not some long-ago
   world to which the FBI would like to return. (FBI Director Louis Freeh
   stated in the hearing July 25 that he would even like to restrict
   encryption imports.)
   
   While the White House indicates it might be willing to give people
   stronger encryption, it insists that the trade-off must be a copy of
   our decoder keys. It's a deal Americans will never accept and a plan
   that has yet to be proven feasible.
   
   Denying millions of law-abiding people the use of a legitimate and
   increasingly necessary security product for "law enforcement" reasons
   is like banning deadbolt locks because they make it a little harder to
   kick down the doors of a few drug dealers.

Excuse me?  Last I heard, Feinstein (who wouldn't be caught dead in SD this
week&gt;, was sponsoring the worst censorship bill currently in Congress.  
And, lest we forget, Sen. Exon was (and is) a Democrat.  Sure, there are 
censors in the Republican Party (can you say Christian Coalition?), but 
that's a rather wide brush you're painting the Republicans with.  On the 
net, party lines don't quite fit.  As I think we've discussed here and 
elsewhere, it's net.experience that is the divider.

&gt; &gt; just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
&gt; &gt; morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.
No truer words were ever spoken &lt;g&gt;, speaking as one of the corrupted 
myself... :)

&gt;         But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
&gt; you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?)
Uhhhh... no.  The last time I went to Computer City, I didn't have to 
have a criminal background check or wait five days.  Actually, in VA, we 
don't have to wait 5 days, but that doesn't matter.  Back-of-the-truck 
sales, like you must be referring to, are illegal anyway, and if the 
police would enforce current laws, we might not have to worry about that.

&gt; therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
&gt; weapon every year...
More like &lt;maximum&gt; a few thousand over several years.  Remember, there 
are a hell of a lot more accidental car deaths than accidental gun 
deaths, though.  There's your few dozen thousand.

&gt;         ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
&gt; Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
&gt; extrapolation) dangerous?
Good point.  Guns, though, in a way like computers, require a 
mis-intentioned person to become dangerous.  Computers aren't designed to 
put holes in people or things (as Kurt Vonnegut would say).  In both 
cases, though, an unreasonable person has to make an irrational decision 
in order to cause harm.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Purchasing an AK47 is illegal in several states, and in those which do
allow machine gun ownership by citizens, you must receive an OK from
local law enforcement and obtain a BATF special permit.  

Modems do not require local law enforcement sign offs...yet.

             CLINTON: GOP LISTENING TO 'GUN LOBBY OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'
                                          
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) -- President Clinton on Saturday
   accused the Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts to fight terrorism
   by kowtowing to the gun lobby.
   
   In his weekly radio address from Jackson, where the president and his family
   are vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had stripped his anti-terrorism
   bill of valuable tools "that law enforcement needs to help them find out,
   track down and shut down terrorists."
   
   The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
   anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and marking
   explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to the dealer who
   sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill and the assault weapons
   ban.

   legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and explosive taggant
   issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism bill of its own that
   excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not vote on the measure before
   adjourning for its August recess.

After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?

   By VIVIENNE WALT 
   THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
   
   At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
   Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.
   
   Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship from
   his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a white
   supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service provider, the
   teenager posted the site's entire contents in a compressed "mirror" file...
   
   Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a task
   force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech -- something the
   Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe, has laws against.

[...]
   
   One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
   virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) pushed his
   proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony,
   punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
   
   "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
   of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
   the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
   how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
   can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

[...]
   
   In a last-minute maneuver on Aug. 2, House members dropped the Internet
   controls and wiretapping provisions from their Anti-Terrorism Act, approved
   it by 389-22, and went home for the rest of the summer, leaving the Senate
   in a quandary about what to do after Labor Day. "We just couldn't come up
   with a bipartisan bill," says Sen. Feinstein's press secretary Susan
   Kennedy.
   
   Like Washington, Paris empties out in August for la vacance. But on Sept.
   26, the fight picks up in the French capital at a top-level meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   
   Justice Department officials, and 'Net activists, are set to travel to Paris
   to argue about key escrow...

   "This is an example of the Justice Department trying to dictate foreign
   policy," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center in Washington, who sits on the OECD's advisory panel on encryption.

[...]
   
   "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
   subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
   Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
   of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
   the Web.
   
   Rabbi Cooper and others have lobbied Internet providers to expel the
   extremist sites. "Will they eventually find somewhere else? Probably. But
   that still makes it a worthwhile thing to do," he says.

The face of net-activism is changing. I'm writing this from a science
fiction writers' and editors' party in upstate New York, where we've been
talking about net-politics and online communities.

The fronts we face now are three: national, state, and international. 
We've fought the national fight in the CDA, Clipper, and recent crypto and
terrorist debates. It's been where most of our efforts have focused. 

State politics lags behind that of Capitol Hill. State legislators are
starting to try to ram through bills similar to the CDA -- and, worse yet,
ones that are substantially different. We've discussed some on
fight-censorship.

The ACLU is the only cyber-liberties group tracking them. Yesterday I
stopped by Ann Beeson's office in Manhattan to talk about the Georgia bill
and other laws the group is planning to challenge. 

(Congratulations are in order. No longer a temporary ACLU fellow, Ann is
now a full-time staff attorney in the national office. It's a
well-deserved promotion!)

Then I walked across Bryant Park to the headquarters of Human Rights
Watch, an international civil rights group. They don't have a substantial
online presence now, but they did publish a fabulous global
net-restrictions report ("Silencing the Net") this spring -- and they have
what the Net needs right now: expertise in dealing with international
groups like G-7 and an extensive network of affiliates around the world. 
They seemed interested in doing more online work, which is wonderful. 

Afterwards Charles Platt and Ann, Glenn and their SOs and I went to dinner
at Sam's Noodle Shop on 29th and chatted about our CDA lawsuit and the
human genome project. 

The two aren't necessarily related, unless you count discerning what
congenital defects DoJ attorney Jason "The Weasel" Baron has. Yes, I'm
hardly unbiased. Anyone who threatens to have me arrested for interviewing
government witnesses is a splendid example of a censorhappy Fed
bureaucrat. As a side note, the weasel has been showing up to more and
more DC cyber-regulation events, like the Freedom Forum's panel on crypto
and censorship, and the FTC's panel on net-regulation and privacy. (Wonder
what he's up to?)

So the growing net-involvement of ACLU and HRW is just in time. They have
the well-established state and international affiliates, respectively,
that other groups lack. Hopefully, the affiliates can forward reports
uphill to the parent groups and help in fighting laws and policies locally. 

We need all the help and international expertise we can get -- as we've
seen recently at the Paris summit, governments have this annoying,
persistent habit of working backroom deals. The G-7 resolution (also
endorsed by Russia) said: 

  We call on all States to:

  6. note the risk of terrorist using electronic or wire communications
       systems and networks to carry out criminal acts and the need to
       find means, consistent with national law, to prevent such
       criminality.

  11. accelerate consultation, in appropriate bilateral or multilateral fora,
       on the use of encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
       government access to data and communications in order, inter alia,
       to prevent or investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the
       privacy of legitimate communications.

I've been putting whatever international information I come across at

Congress may be in recess, but Bill Clinton is still dreaming of expanded
FBI wiretap authority.  In this week's radio address, Clinton sought to
paint the GOP into a corner by depicting the opponents of his
"anti-terrorism" plan as "gun nuts."

Expect the White House to continue beating this drum throughout September.

      Clinton: GOP Listening To 'Gun
      Lobby Over Law Enforcement'

      JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) --
      President Clinton on Saturday accused the
      Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts
      to fight terrorism by kowtowing to the gun
      lobby.

      In his weekly radio address from Jackson,
      where the president and his family are
      vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had
      stripped his anti-terrorism bill of valuable tools "that law
      enforcement needs to help them find out, track down and shut down
      terrorists."

      The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
      anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and
      marking explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to
      the dealer who sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill
      and the assault weapons ban.

      [ ... ]

      Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti-
      terrorism legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and
      explosive taggant issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism
      bill of its own that excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not
      vote on the measure before adjourning for its August recess.

      [ ... ]

      "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
      country and the safety of our people," he said.

      The United States, he said, is not immune to terrorism, citing the
      Oklahoma City bombing and last month's bombing in Centennial
      Olympic Park in Atlanta as "brutal evidence."

Um, well, except that
- there are serious safety questions concerning adding taggants to black
and smokeless powder
- a taggant provision is of dubious utility in catching terrorist bombers,
since black powder is not difficult to make (and presumably anyone serious
about planting pipe bombs and not getting caught would take this small
additional step for self-protection)
- it's hard to see how taggants would help LE track powder anyway, since
powder from a given manufacturing lot can be and commonly is shipped to
dealers all over the country.

I do think the issues are separable, and the wiretapping provisions are
obviously of considerably greater relevance to this list (and to
free-speech activism) than the taggant nonsense is. But I wanted to correct
the misapprehension; as we know from bitter experience with the CDA,
getting non-facts accepted as conventional wisdom is one of the first steps
in promulgating bad laws and in demonizing those who oppose them.

&gt;    Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.

I believe this is false. As far as I know, no one has objected, other than
by calling him naive. Frank is on vacation and off the net until early
September, so I imagine the WSJ was unable to reach him for this story. 
People reacted to his action the same way they did to our Zundelsite mirrors
- -- despite the fact that Zundel is just a harmless neo-Nazi propagandist,
while Lemire is a bit more... activist. For *his* side of the story, see
http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html

&gt;    Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship
&gt;    from his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a
&gt;    white supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service
&gt;    provider,

This is false. He heard that they were being protested. Lemire has not been
kicked off. His site remains at http://www.ftcnet.com/~freedom, and the site
that the SWC-Canada was far more concerned about, www.ftcnet.com/~skinhds,
is still online, too. Oddly, none of the stores in the US press even mention
the skinheads site. The initial reports in the Canadian press didn't even
mention Lemire, because it really wasn't about him.

Funny... the Skinheads site admits that they won and will not be censored. 
Take a look at http://alpha.ftcnet.com/~skinhds/ -- "Well my site has
weathered the storm of controversy and is still afloat.  Despite the best
efforts of some of the enemies of free speech my service provider did not
capitulate."

I wonder how long Lemire plans to milk the publicity. Maybe trolling the
Wall Street Journal was enough.

&gt;    the teenager posted the site's entire contents in a
&gt;    compressed "mirror" file... 

This is false. Lemire created and posted the archive, soliciting mirror
sites. The first one online was www.alpha.org, but they've been having
technical problems, so Frank's was announced first. Frank's web page simply
links to Lemire's archive on ftcnet.com. Frank did not compile and is not
distributing the site's entire contents. 

&gt;    Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a
&gt;    task force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech --
&gt;    something the Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe,
&gt;    has laws against. 

This is highly misleading; I assume it was taken from either Declan's
article or Lemire's press release, as it shows a lack of understanding of
the political and legal situation in Canada.

I don't suppose the WSJ will admit that they were trolled? Frank has, but I
know that Declan won't. In fact, if it weren't for this sentence and the
fact that I'm Bcc'ing it to Vivian, I doubt Declan would allow this message
to hit fight-censorship at all.

&gt;    One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
&gt;    virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.)
&gt;    pushed his proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the

...and thanks to Biden, that recipe is now available through thomas.loc.gov.
What a moron.

&gt;    subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
&gt;    Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
&gt;    of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
&gt;    the Web.

No, Cyberwatch does no such thing. It just moans about it, giving no
specific examples. They don't even acknowledge the existence of other
organizations with policies that are both more effective and more respective
of freedom of speech, such as the Anti-Defamation League (which is larger
and older than the Wiesenthal Center, but strangely absent from press
reports of "jewish reaction to hate on the net") and Nizkor (which has far
more experience than either, but isn't jewish).

    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED Aug. 7, 1996
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Reading our mail

    Only in a nation already enormously out of touch with its founding
principle - that individual citizens and businesses have the right to do
just about any peaceful thing, while it's the powers of (start
ital)government(end ital) that are sharply restricted - could Congress find
itself debating whether to "allow" American computer firms to maintain
their lead in the multi-million-dollar overseas market for software
encryption.

  In plainer language, outfits like Netscape Communications and Tandem
Computers want "permission" to sell overseas programs like Pretty Good
Privacy - to which savvy American netsters now have free access - programs
which allow private e-mail messages and files to be encoded so government
snoops can't read them.

  The Clinton administration proposes that such exports be allowed only if
a decoding "key" is entrusted to a third party - such as a bank or
insurance company - which would then be subject to a court order or
subpoena should law enforcement personnel wish to break the code and
secretly read this electronic "mail."

  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in favor of such restrictions July 25,
arguing that "Uncontrolled export of U.S. computer codes may help
international criminals and terrorists hide their activities from law
enforcement."

  Well, yes, they probably do. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in New York on
charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners, used a laptop computer
containing files the FBI still hasn't been able to decode.
  But note the past tense. Terrorists have already got this stuff. Anything
in the possession of an American teenager can be (likely has been) uploaded
onto the Internet, and then downloaded without anyone being the wiser in
Baghdad, Tripoli, or Tangiers.

  The real goal here is to control the ability of American citizens to
communicate with one another without government snoops reading over their
shoulders. When Director Freeh warns that "Encryption products used
unchecked by criminals and terrorists for their illegal activities pose an
extremely serious threat," it's worth remembering that federal agencies
have, in recent years, used the terms "criminal" and "terrorist" to
describe peaceful worshippers and their children at the Branch Davidian
Church in Waco, MOVE activists in Philadelphia, an unarmed Idaho mother
with a nursing baby in her arms, and any number of perhaps misguided but
far-from-violent tax protesters, home schoolers, barter exchange operators,
and practitioners of alternative medicine, to name just a few.

  Once the possessor of such stuff can be arrested and jailed for years on
charges of "exporting a munition" for the mere act of posting the
mathematical formula on the Internet, does it make sense to pretend
Americans will still be free to use such encryption domestically?
  Those who favor an authoritarian, hierarchical society have grown
accustomed to the fact that the political opinions available to most
American government-school graduates have long been "filtered" through the
news desks of a few television networks and major wire services. The
unregulated, spontaneous nature of Internet communications frightens such
souls with dark nightmares of anarchy, the same way King George hated the
colonial "Committees of Correspondence."

  As Stephen Chapman of the Chicago Tribune pointed out in his nationally
syndicated column June 19, "We can be grateful that ink and paper didn't
make their first appearance the day before yesterday . Otherwise, Congress
and the president would be scrambling frantically to make sure that these
communication tools would not be used for purposes unapproved by the
government."

  If the idea of a government service delivering letters between private
citizens were being introduced today, wouldn't Director Freeh similarly
argue against the "extremely serious threat" that criminals and terrorists
might use this new "mail" system to keep their secrets, should the
government allow the use of glue-flapped "envelopes"?
  But wait, you say: The secret "keys" would only be available upon
issuance of a "court order."

  And this guarantee would be enforced, I presume, by the same courts that
today regularly excuse the short-circuiting of any and all such existing
safeguards so long as the federals assert a "compelling government
interest" in hunting drug dealers, nabbing  "money-launderers," or whatever
dastardly new crime of the week they care to allege?

  It's understandable that repressive regimes like China are pulling out
every stop to register and track private users of the Internet. When
legislators show similar instincts in what was once the "Land of the Free,"
it's their own premises which they ... and we ... should re-examine.

U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the
proposed action as ineffective:  "This is not a solution, it is just hiding
the problem."  (Financial Times 10 Aug 96)

        It was hard to wake up, that morning. The pillow to the right
of her was bewildered at its own unaccustomed chill. She had gathered
all the blankets around herself and no one had been there to pull them
back; this more than anything reminded her of her aloneness and she
very nearly turned back onto her side to weep herself to sleep.

I'm not sure this is the most effective or noticeable action, but what 
the heck.  Personally, I'd advocate doing whatever you think is most 
useful, just do it on the 31st, and let local media know with a short fax 
soon that Aug. 31 is Internet Censorship Protest Day.  If you've been of 
a mind to organize a rally, make it snappy. No better time.  I don't 
think this short alert has gone out very far yet.

Got a note this morning from a U.K. journalist who spoke with PSInet:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversation this am with a leading light at a large ISP here (subsidiary
of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and
essentially said, either you do something about it, or we'll do something
about it.  The guy said they'd pulled the groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups were "pedophile" areas. But the
FT report talks about Scotland Yard pressuring Internet providers to block
"hard-core pornography."

&gt; &gt;CYBERGANGS
&gt; &gt;The head of the gang task force for the Arizona Department of Public Safety
&gt; &gt;reports that a Web site established in Detroit offers a how-to guide for
&gt; &gt;gangster wannabes and is urging gang members everywhere to unite under its
&gt; &gt;umbrella to form the first cyberspace gang.  The official says:  "Now it's

&gt; &gt;talk about anything they want and there's nothing law enforcement can do
&gt; &gt;about it."  (Atlanta Journal-Constitution 8 Aug 96 F3)

A meme on the rise: like cyberporn, "cybergangs" can reach into your living
room and corrupt Junior. Perhaps grandstanding politicans may use
"cybergangs" as a pretext for a crackdown -- not a war on drugs, but a War
on the Net?

&gt; who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;
&gt; Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups are "pedophile" areas. But the
&gt; FT report paints the situation much more broadly -- Internet providers are
&gt; blocking "pornography."

Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child
pornographic newsgroups. I have side accounts at 3 major ISPs that all
have as close to a full newsfeed as is physically possible, I think.
They all have almost an identical roster of available newsgroups (other
than local ones of course, very few of which anywhere are pornographic in
nature.)  Out of those, only the following newsgroups would appear to
qualify at first blush:

alt.sex.pedophilia
alt.sex.pedophilia.boys
alt.sex.pedophilia.girls
alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.sex.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.d
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.sex.pre-teens
alt.sex.teens
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

[I admit the possibility of missing a keyword. I did a search for
"child", "kid", "teen", "lolita", "young", "youth" and "pedo". There
might be, say, a "nambla" match, now that I think about it, but obscure
keywords like that are unlikely to find enough newsgroups to strongly
affect the outcome of this quick examination.]

Of these, many can be immediately eliminated, as they are discussion
groups, not binaries group, or are typos ("binaires") and ergo not carried
by 99% or so of usenet (though available on a few sites like the WELL where
the admins allow the automatic availability of every newsgroup known to
the system, even ones created just to create a stupid-named newsgroup
with no intention that it will ever be used.)

This leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

Now, of these all the "young" and "teen" groups have to be eliminated,
since "young" is to vague to mean anything more specific that "younger
than middle aged", and teen can refer to 18 or 19 (or even younger legal
ages, if the UK is like Australia and sets age of consent at 16 instead
of US & Canada's 18).  If you actually look in these groups there appears
to be nothing but flames, blather, and BBS ads, almost none, if any, of
which will be childporn, since that would be a major cop magnet.
Lolita.misc and pedophilia.swaps also have be dropped, as too vague to
clearly indicate child pornographic visual content.  The de. newsgroup is
also probably not carried by many sites outside of Germany. (WELL had it,
but my other ISPs didn't. Probably WELL is trading news with a site in
Germany for some reason - maybe the .de site can't get a decent news
feed? I dunno).

That leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking


Six likely suspect newsgroups for genuine illegal content in the form of
child pornography.  It's highly questionable whether real child porn
shows up on any such newsgroup with any regularity, if at all. Again, the
content seems to consist of flames and blatant BBS ads (though I'm not
dumb enough to actually download the material, since that could count as
"possession" if some of it is really child porn.)  I even recall the
creation of a few of these - they were newgrouped simply to piss people
off with no intention of actually using the newsgroups. They were
instantly rmgrouped, and are unavailable on all sites that honor
"official" alt.config rmgroups, which is probably the vast majority of
news servers.

Much ado about nothing.

Also, none of this even touches the question of whether liability adheres
to providing access to something that happens to contain child porn
simply becuase is *sounds* child pornographic. By this logic, even if is
eventually established that an ISP could not be held liable for child
porn content in general, absent guilty knowledge, an ISP could be held
liable for it if someone posted a message with "child porn" in the
subject line, and it actually did contain child porn, regardless of the
fact that any message by that name is more likely to be a discussion
thread about child porn and the problems it causes, that to be actual
child porn.

The UK cops are making the mistake of assuming that every label is.
first, always accurate, and second, non-ambigious.  That's a very stupid
set of assumptions.

Either way you look at it, this is ridiculous.

Either:

a) the UK police bureucrats have taken all newsgroup names at face
value and have targetted most of the initial long list near the top of this
message, even though most are obviously intended to be discussion areas
and don't carry child porn itself, or

b) they are going after 5 or so newsgroups that are, at least in name,
definitely child pornographic, PLUS a buch of others (the rest of the 20)
like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.male, or whatever, that have nothing at
all, even in name, to do with child porn, as the article Declan quotes
seems to suggest (I think this quite possible, since it's unlikely that
many if any UK hosts have this many pedophillic-sounding newsgroups. Only
the biggest and most bandwidth rich US ISPs carry them all, so the UK
cops probably don't even know about the majority of the newsgroups in the
top, large, list.)

A and B are *both* stupid and indefensible.

The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the
contents of the newgroups in question and worked to locate those posting
any genuine child porn, and prosecute them (with an eye to the fact that
its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

Singapore 119963

Dear Mr. Yeo,

     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the recent
decision by the Singapore government to establish strict controls on Internet
use. The implementation of the Class License Scheme, which, according to a
July 11 government news release, "will focus on content which may undermine
public morals, political stability and religious harmony,"ensures a leading
role for Singapore among international promoters of online censorship. This is
a particularly unfortunate role for Singapore, which has been a leader in the
development and promotion of Internet use in Asia. It places Singapore in the
same category as countries like China, where Internet users must endure
onerous restrictions.

     One of the most unique and valuable characteristics of the Internet is
its ability to establish easy, inexpensive and practically instantaneous
communication between the farthest points of the earth. By prohibiting
connections between its citizens and various Web sites outside its borders,
Singapore is in essence removing itself from the global Internet. If, as will
surely happen, its example is followed in other countries, the Internet, which
held such promise as the world's first truly global medium, will be nothing
more than a set of country-specific networks where local prejudices and fears
are reinforced by technology.

     Our specific objections concern Singapore's decision to regulate the
Internet as if it were a broadcast medium. Unlike broadcast media, the
Internet is the first truly mass medium. Through e-mail, it allows individuals
with nothing more than a computer and a modem to express their views to an
international audience. Even the World Wide Web differs significantly from a
broadcast medium in that individuals are not confronted with a particular site
upon connecting to the Web--they may choose whichever sites they choose to
visit. As with other forms of Internet communication, anyone may put up his or
her own site on the Web. The Singapore government's own use of Web pages
demonstrates how the Internet can be used to propound a particular point of
view. Its citizens, so long as they are not using their site to incite to
violence, should have the same opportunity to express views as their
government. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights:

     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
     to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
     media and regardless of frontiers.

     We are particularly concerned that restrictions have been placed on
Singaporeans who wish to discuss religious and political ideas online. It is
only through unrestricted discussions of such serious topics by all members of
society, no matter how unpopular their views, that these subjects become less
explosive. Forbidding discussion--in effect, treating its citizens like
children--will, on the other hand, ensure that dangerous topics remain just
that.

     We are also concerned that the extraordinarily broad categories of
forbidden content, as outlined by the SBA, will encourage arbitrary
restrictions on communication. According to the Internet Content Guidelines,
the following topics are banned.

     Public Security and National Defense

          a.   Contents which jeopardize public security or national
               defense.
          b.   Contents which undermine the public confidence in the
               administration of justice.
          c.   Contents which present information or events in such a
               way that alarms or misleads all or any of the public.
          d.   Contents which tend to bring the Government into
               hatred or contempt, or which excite disaffection
               against the Government.

     Racial and Religious Harmony

          a.   Contents which denigrate or satirize any racial or
               religious group.
          b.   Contents which bring any race or religion into hatred
               or resentment.
          c.   Contents which promote religious deviations or occult
               practices such as Satanism.

          Public Morals

          a.        Contents which are pornographic or otherwise obscene.
          b.        Contents which propagate permissiveness or
                    promiscuity.
          c.        Contents which depict or propagate gross exploitation
                    of violence, nudity, sex or horror.
          d.   Contents which depict or propagate sexual perversions
               such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia.

By banning such subjects a chill will be sent through the online community in
Singapore, and will render the Internet essentially useless in allowing any
kind of serious discussion.

     In addition to forbidding particular content, the government has also
announced that some sites will be banned. Internet service providers were
given the deadline of September 14, 1996,  to begin using proxy
servers--devices that can prohibit connections to specified sites--to
connect all their
subscribers.

     Although the government has promised to use a light hand in regulating
the Internet, its activities even at this early stage indicate otherwise. A
July 12 posting in the Usenet newsgroup "soc.culture.singapore" was reportedly
removed at the request of the SBA, who asked local Internet service providers
for its removal because it alleged that lawyers at a local law firm were
incompetent. The request came, according to the Straits Times, after the law
firm complained to the government. Despite the removal from the newsgroup, the
message is still widely available to Singaporeans through other Internet
sources, indicating that content control will be difficult unless Internet
access is restricted even further.

     We hope that the Singapore government will retract these repressive new
regulations, and support the development of an unfettered Internet. Instead of
using its power to restrict Internet use, the government could play a truly
useful role by devising ways to expand its use to even the most disaffected
members of its population.

                                   Sincerely,
                                   Sidney Jones
                                   Executive Director

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

&gt;Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child

&gt;The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the

&gt;its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
&gt;That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
&gt;anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

You're forgetting the tortuous British obscenity laws.  For example, it's
illegal to show an erect penis in Britain.  The police are just trying
enforce the censorious powers the government has always given them.

News Release   August 15, 1996 
---------------------------------------------------- 
 
Free Speech 101: ACLU Gives Princeton University an "F"  
for Barring Political Speech on its Network 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             
Wednesday, August 15, 1996 
 
Contact: Ann Beeson, ACLU National (212) 944-9800, x788 
David Rocah, ACLU of New Jersey (201) 642-2084 
 
NEW YORK--In a letter sent today to Princeton University officials,  the
American Civil Liberties Union urged them to reconsider a policy barring
students and staff from using the computer network for "political
purposes."  
   
The letter was sparked by complaints the ACLU national office received over
a recent memo from Princeton officials advising faculty, staff and
students, "especially in this year of a presidential election," that the
school's not-for-profit status barred it from allowing use of the computer
network "for political purposes." 
 
The ACLU called this conclusion mistaken, pointing out in its letter that
the Internal Revenue Code specifies that only the University itself is
barred from political activity -- not faculty, staff, or students acting
independently.  In fact, the ACLU said, the IRS has previously held that
statements in support of political candidates appearing on the editorial
page of a student newspaper would not be considered violations of a
university's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. 
 
"Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network," the ACLU letter
stated, "it is an unjustified content-based restriction on the free
expression rights of students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is
not only unworthy of a great university like Princeton, it is in violation
of the New Jersey State Constitution."  The letter was signed by ACLU
national staff attorney Ann Beeson and David Rocah, staff attorney of the
ACLU of New Jersey. 
   
"We understand the university's concerns regarding it's tax-exempt status,"
Rocah said.  "But this is free speech 101.  Sadly, Princeton is not making
the grade."    
 
Rocah said the ACLU would consider legal action if the university refuses
to drop its censorship policy. 
 
"Traditionally, college campuses are the center of political discussion and
debate," said Beeson.  "The fact that the debate is taking place on the
Internet does not mean that the speech is any less deserving of
protection."  
 
Beeson added that the policy could bar students and staff from a wide range
of protected expression, including downloading position papers from the
Dole or Clinton website; sending e-mail to their parents urging them to
vote for Ralph Nader; and organizing online discussion groups for  student
chapters of politically active groups such as Greenpeace.   In short, Rocah
said, "Everything that would be acceptable, even welcome, off-line, becomes
off-limits on the Internet."  
   
In its letter, the ACLU called on the school to take a leadership role in
the academic community:  "As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a
leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to
promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its
community, to the very limits of the law," the letter said. 
 
Beeson added that the ACLU  is working to develop model guidelines for 
colleges and universities to help sort out the confusion in academia
regarding free expression on the Internet.  Many schools have already put
in place "Appropriate Use Policies" to police student and faculty computer 
use, some of which violate rights of free expression, Beeson said.

Mr. Harold Shapiro 
President                 BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, & REGULAR MAIL 
1 Nassau Hall 
Princeton University 
Princeton NJ 85044 
 
RE: Computer Use Policy 
 
Dear President Shapiro: 
 
In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton
University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ)
to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University
from using the Princeton's computer network for "political purposes."  We
believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding
the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic
freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.

 
Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students
widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet
greatly expanded the resources available for academic research.  It also
provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas.  In
contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for
"political purposes" unjustifiably interferes with the right of the
University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.

 
Princeton's current computer use policy holds that "the Computing and
network resources of the University may not be used by members of the
University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial
gain . . . ."  Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter "Rights," attached
as Appendix A).  On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent
an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use
of the Internet or computer network for "any participation in, or
intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
public office" would result in disciplinary action.  See Office of the
General Counsel, "Internet use and Politics," E-mail of July 19, 1996,
attached as Appendix B. 
 
We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a
concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to
use the computer network for political purposes.  We believe that this
concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal
Revenue Service. 
 
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization
will be tax-exempt as long as it "does not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office."  The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to
constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the
political activity must be that of the University itself and not the
individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students.  See Internal
Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for
1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C.  Thus, any personal
communication by University members over the computer network cannot
threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the
communication takes place does not change this conclusion.  The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether
the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political
activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the
university under Internal Revenue Code  501(c)(3), is whether the
facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for
non-political reasons.  Id. at 427.  Princeton provides fair and equal
access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access,
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes.  See Rights at 11.  Thus, political speech over the
network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with
a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status.  The
Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that
required its students in a certain political science course to participate
in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during
the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the
meaning of Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  See Revenue Ruling 75-512,
1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D. 
 
In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on
the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not
participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political
candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper.  This was
true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities
to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were
clearly those of the students and not of the university itself.  See
Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E. 
 
Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by
allowing University members to use its computer network for political
purposes.  We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for
official positions of the University.  At most, the only permissible
regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the
University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a
reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official
position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the
opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone.
 Compare Rights, "Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the
University and Political Activities," at Section 3. 
 
Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an
unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of
students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of
a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of
the New Jersey Constitution. 
 
Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey
Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been
sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to
honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression.  See State v.
Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against
the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994)
(holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive
use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet).  Princeton's
computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton "campus" as are the
lawns and buildings.  Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its
students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the
Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech
in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus. 
 
Political expression has always received the highest degree of
constitutional protection.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). 
The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship
those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for
political candidates.  Indeed, "where political speech is involved, our
tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion,
the narrowest range for restriction.'"  State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412
(1980).  As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in
American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and
defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to
the very limits of the law. 
 
The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free
speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive
information.  Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (right
to receive information precludes government from labeling certain
publications "propaganda") (Brennan, J., concurring); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) ("right of freedom of speech . . .
includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . .
receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of
thought, and freedom to teach . . . .  Without these peripheral rights the
specific rights would be less secure."); Kreimer v. Bur. of Police for Town
of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1350-55 (3d Cir. 1992) (listing cases).  This
is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the
Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community.  See
ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996).  They
provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access
information on virtually any topic, including politics. 
 
Finally, the computer use policy is in conflict with other University
policies and practices.  Princeton recognizes that 
 
     "the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the
discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching
and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and
learning to society at large.  Free inquiry and free expression within the
academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. 
The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate
conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in
classrooms and lecture halls." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 
With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it
has a fundamental responsibility to ensure 
 
    "the opportunity for all members of the University community to
exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . .  Encouragement of an
interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social
responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal
education.  The University continues to consider self-chosen participation
in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable
part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage.  Such activities
on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to,
imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or
point of view." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Guidelines Relating to Tax Exempt Status." 
 
For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal the existing
ban on use of the computer network for political purposes, and we look
forward to your early reply.

Bomb info OK in books but G-7 wants it off Net

By COLMAN JONES

While the fury over child porn on the net appears to be losing steam
after the defeat of the Communications Decency Act in June, there's a a
growing new cyber-backlash against terrorists.  

At a meeting in Paris last month, just before the downing of TWA flight
800 and the bombing in Atlanta, Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers
and security ministers struck an agreement to target terrorists using
the internet.  

The pact calls for international controls on the net to cut off access
to sites containing "dangerous" information, restrict electronic speech
by unpopular political organizations and allow governments to decode
privately encrypted communications.

The Paris meeting ended with a commitment to have reports ready by the

Bomb info

Many press accounts fume about bomb-making information available
online, without mentioning that the "offensive'' material being
targeted is no different from identical material easily obtained in
public libraries, college libraries and bookstores. A case in point is
the World's Biggest Bookstore, which stocks the Anarchist Cookbook, a
virtual how-to guide to subversive activity, also available online.  

Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who helped to draw
up the Paris agreement, cited the fact that his his 11-year-old son
showed him how to access extremist literature from the World Wide Web.
Axworthy's spokesperson, Catherine Lappe, says the pact is "not an
issue of trying to censor people" .  

"If you look at the communique, it says very clearly that all this
would have to be in compliance with national laws, so the issues of
privacy would be of utmost importance.''

The University of Nebraska is threatening web pages that have the word
"Husker" in their title, according to the message attached below. Guess
they'll have to go after these sites too:

       Husker Power web site
       Asger Schnack: Jeg Husker Alt
       (AP) Husker QB Brook Berringer killed in plane crash near NU campus
       Husker Du
       Penstemon 'Husker Red' is 1996 Perennial Plant of the Year
       Husker midwestern home design
       Joel's Husker Page

I've set up a web page at http://www.well.com/~declan/huskers.html and
registered the URL with AltaVista and HotBot. It's called: "Husker web
pages, the University of Nebraska, and braindead policies."

I wonder what the university will do, if anything? This message is copied
to some University of Nebraska administrators and faculty members.

Husker Web Pages Must Cease

To: huskers@pumpkin.tssi.com
Subject: Husker Web Pages Must Cease
From: mfricke@serv01.net-link.net (Mark E. Fricke)
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:59:55 -0400

I hate to be the bearer of real bad news, but if you have a personal
web site on the internet that features any logos, graphics, audio or
even the page name of Cornhusker or Husker (like the Husker Press Box)
be prepared to get a Cease and desist letter from the University of
Nebraska's attorney's. The problem is simple. A lot of money has been
paid to license the name and logo's of the Huskers and there are many
business interests to protect. Pinnacle Broadcasting is the exclusive
rights holder for internet usage of the name and logos (and you thought
the live broadcasts were all good).

Now..there are a couple of things we can do. #1 remove all references
to Huskers, Big Red, Cornhuskers etc. from THE PAGES TITLE. You can
still talk about, mention, berate or praise the team within the page,
just not in the page title. The reason here is that the University
wants all search engines (yahoo, excite, infoseek etc.) to send
searches for the Huskers to their site (huskerwebcast)

#2 remove all licensed logo's, pictures of Herbie audio of the band
etc. from your site.

#3 There is one more solution. Huskerwebcast will allow pages to exist
as they are if they are housed within THEIR page. Wether that mean they
will have hyperlinks to these hidden pages or if you will actually have
to set up an account and an FTP site to their server I'm not clear on.
I'm awaiting confirmation on this.

Okay, now my personal views. Yeah it's a bummer...a great big bummer. I
really don't see how private personal pages could possibly infringe on
the marketing dollars of the University (except for logos, you got me
there) But PAGE NAMES?!?!. They seem a little greedy fo rthe traffic.
I'm no lawyer (maybe some of you out there are and know something about
public domain)so I will do what I must with the Husker Press Box.  I
will still provide the page in some manner, either changing the name or
joining the University page. Luckily I have already been extended an
offer to do that. I will wait and see. My advise to other Husker wep
page masters. Be ready for a letter and be ready to reacte. this is a
big University with lots of money and lots of attorney's

Recently the London police sent a letter to U.K. Internet providers saying
that 133 Usenet newsgroups must be banned.

&gt;From observations at &lt;http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship&gt;, it's clear that:

       the Police regard ISPs as publishers
       the publication of obscene materials is an offence
       the Police expect ISPs to continuously monitor newsgroups and
           to remove those which contain illegal materials

More ominously, the letter says "Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive
and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups identifying and taking
necessary action against those others found to contain such material...
This list is only the starting point..." Also, the police have said they
have the power to arrest Internet providers and seize their equipment.

This move by the Brits is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising. I have
background about many more international net-censorship attempts at:

To all subscribers:

Our upstream provider, VBCNet, has informed us that today, they, and
other ISPs in the UK have received a notification from the Metropolitan
Police to remove 134 news groups from their news servers. Therefore, we
are no longer being fed these groups. As many of you will have seen,
recently, in a thread in the waverider.support newsgroup, Wave Rider
Internet Plc are
opposed to such censorship as a matter of principle - as I know many
of you are.

The letter from the Met makes it clear that this is only the
beginning - they plan to ban whatever newsgroups they see fit over the
coming months.

We urge you all to protest this action - use the media, contact your
MPs, generate whatever protest you see fit - or the UK Internet is going
to be operated by the whim of the Clubs & Vice unit of the Metropolitan
Police.

At present, Wave Rider Internet Plc have received no such notification from
the police, and will therefore not be removing any groups. However, as
we're not being fed them anymore, that's academic - there will shortly be
nothing in them.

I am enclosing the copy of the letter from the Met, that we have been
sent by VBCNet.

Like other UK ISPs, VBCnet today received a demand from the Metropolitan
Police that some 134 news groups be deleted from our news machines.
The letter makes it clear that this is only the beginning, that they
will be banning more groups and requiring ISPs to enforce their
dictats.  We have with great reluctance complied with their demand.

While we do not disagree that the articles in some of these groups are
often objectionable, we disagree in principle with this form of censorship.

We urge all of you to make it clear to your customers why these news
groups have been withdrawn and we urge you to contact your MPs and
the media about this arbitrary action by the police.  If there is no
protest, if a precedent is established, the UK Internet is going to
fall under the control of the Clubs and Vice Unit at Charing Cross
Police Station.

VBCnet is setting up a Web page to protest this action.  It should be
available at
        http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship
by the end of the day.  We will add pointers to other protesting Web
pages -- well, the ones that are calm and reasonable.  ;-)

Dear Sir / Madam

Pornographic Material on the Internet

Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.

We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.

This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.

We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.

Yours Faithfully


Stephen French
Chief Inspector

                    Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother


     August 8, 1996                             by Phyllis Schlafly

     We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
     recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all
     Americans who care about civil liberties should vigorously resist
     President Clinton's attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an
     excuse to carry on his all-out war against the personal privacy of
     law-abiding Americans.

     This mind-set was first revealed in the Clinton health care bill,
     which would have given the government computer access to the
     medical records of all Americans. Fortunately, that totalitarian
     takeover of the health care industry was rejected.

     The Clinton Administration's education legislation now pending in
     Congress would put personal information about all schoolchildren
     -- academic, medical, attitudinal, behavioral, and family -- into
     an expanded Labor Market Information database available to the
     government, as well as to prospective employers.

     Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for
     individual Americans to have private conversations with one
     another. That's the real meaning of its effort to control
     encryption technology, and it's a direct assault on the First
     Amendment.

     It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First
     Amendment guarantees our right to speak in public but not in
     private. It would be just as ridiculous to say that we have
     freedom to speak in words that the government can understand, but
     not in words the government can't decipher.

     Americans have the right to speak to one another in private,
     behind closed doors, and we should likewise have the right to
     speak to one another in code and to put our coded messages on
     computer in a process called encryption. Americans would not
     tolerate the government opening and reading the letters we send
     through the mails, and we should not tolerate the government
     opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
     computer.

     Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and
     Vice President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our
     encrypted messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of
     California, Reno bluntly stated her demand for "ensuring law
     enforcement access to encrypted data.''

     Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government
     should create a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly
     "neutral third party''), to which all Americans should be forced
     to "entrust'' the keys to their encrypted messages, and to which
     the government would have access. On the contrary, there is no
     such consensus.

     Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do
     you trust the FBI to keep your files confidential?

     The Clinton Administration is already doing 30 to 40 percent more
     federal telephone wiretaps and other electronic surveillance than
     the last year of the Bush Administration. Those figures don't even
     include national security wiretaps or the hundreds of extensions
     granting more time for wiretap orders already issued.

     FBI Director Freeh wrote the New York Times last November that
     "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the
     extent of wiretapping." Four months later, FBI documents revealed
     that the FBI does, in fact, plan to increase electronic
     surveillance 54 percent by 1998 and 130 percent by 2004.

     On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will
     continue to push for the adoption of a massive public key
     infrastructure to give the government access to all encrypted
     communications. In a blatant bid for a police-state surveillance
     society, Gore warned about "the dangers of unregulated encryption
     technology."

     A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to
     make policy recommendations about encryption. The panel called on
     the government to abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.

     The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would
     enhance our national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of
     its 16 members had security clearances with access to secret
     information, and they saw no national security reason to justify
     the Clinton policy.

     The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private
     encryption on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping.
     However, the NSC panel concluded that the ability of the private
     sector to transfer confidential financial and other data over the
     information highway without interception is far more important.

     New technologies have given government awesome power to spy on
     individuals. The Filegate investigation accidentally uncovered the
     shocking news that, as soon as Bill Clinton entered the White
     House in 1993, he secretly spent $400,000 on software to create a
     highly sophisticated computer database to track detailed
     political, financial, attitudinal, and personal biographical
     information on 200,000 people, including members of Congress and
     the media. Known as WHODB for White House Office Data Base, the
     system was nicknamed Big Brother.

     Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the
     Clinton Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would
     be the biggest expansion of federal power since the passage of the
     Income Tax Amendment in 1913.

Found this buried deep in the long version of an AP story about the
Atlanta pipe bomb suspect:

      Bomb-making instructions available through the global computer
      network have contributed to an increase in bombings in the United
      States, authorities say. 

Did I miss the news story where that contribution was identified?  Or is 
the AP mis-stating what their FBI "expert" said on Monday.

Incidentally, the source for the oft-repeated statement that the FBI was 
"trying to determine whether Jewell may have had access to the campus
Internet" [sic] is not in the FBI; it's someone on the campus who believes
that that's what the FBI is doing.

House approves anti-terrorism bill
By Rose Aguilar

August 2, 1996, 6:15 p.m. PST

          The United States House of Representatives tonight approved the
          Anti-Terrorism act of 1996 by a sweeping 389 to 22 vote, but to
          the relief of Net activists passed a version free of amendments
          that would have regulated Net content, restricted encryption
          technology, and expanded the use of wiretapping.

          The Democrats fought hard for the encryption, Internet, and
          wiretapping provisions, but lost to arguments from
          conservatives and libertarians that the provisions would be an
          infringement of citizens' First Amendments rights. The law that
          was approved by the house also did not include the amendment
          re-introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would have made
          it a felony to publish information about bombs and bomb-making
          on the Internet.

[...]

          The anti-terrorism section of the bill adds several
          terrorism-related crimes to the list of offenses included in
          the federal antiracketeering law. Under this section, the
          penalty for unlawful disclosure of information obtained from a
          wiretap doubles from 5 to 10 years.

          The bill went to the Senate today. Supporters would like the
          bill to be approved without changes and then sent to the
          President. The Senate may vote as early as Saturday or may
          decide to make changes and wait to approve its own version
          until next month.

          "I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said online
          activist Declan McCullagh. "The Senate may or may not act
          tomorrow, but I think the Net has a reprieve from the Net
          crackdown in terms of bomb information until September," he
          said.

Louis Freeh beats his fear-mongering drum while singing his wiretap tune....


From: http://www.cnn.com

FBI chief: U.S. 'under attack' by terrorists
August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 6:05 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States may face "a very difficult time"
coping with terrorists, and new counter-terrorism weapons are needed,
FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.

On expanded wiretap powers being sought by the FBI as part of that
defense, he said: "We're simply trying to catch up with technology. And
that is critical."

[ ... ]

He referred to the two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 24
servicemen; the bombing that killed one woman at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta; and the still-unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800.

Although the combined incidents have "completely consumed" law
enforcement personnel, Freeh said the wiretap proposals would not give
the government "expansive powers" and would not lead to "an avalanche of
new electronic surveillance."

"The United States and its interests both here and around the world are
clearly under attack. And we may be in for a very difficult time with
respect to continuation of these types of things," Freeh said.

Anti-terrorism negotiations

Freeh spoke a day after the White House, after wrangling with key
Republican lawmakers, won tentative agreement on a package of
anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority.

[ ... ]

The negotiators, led by Craig and White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, hoped to have a package ready for a vote by the end of the
week.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders summoned
Attorney General Janet Reno, Panetta and Freeh to a private meeting
Thursday to explain why some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't
been spent.

"We have been somewhat behind in the hiring of people" for
anti-terrorism programs, because of the time needed to screen applicants
for such sensitive work, Freeh explained during his Senate testimony
Thursday.

NETCOM SETTLES SUIT WITH CHURCH

Out-of-court deal with Scientologists

BY MARK LEIBOVICH
Mercury News Staff Writer

A lawsuit that many in the online community feared would set a
precedent restricting freedom of expression on the internet was
resolved quitely Saturday in an out-of-court settlement in San
Jose.

Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc. announced it has
settled the intellectual property dispute initiated by
Religious Technology Center, the publishing wing of the Church
of Scientology.

RTC had brought a claim against Netcom, seeking to prohibited
what is viewed as illegal postings of sacred church writings,
some of which it claimed were protected under US copyright
laws.  Both parties agreed not to disclose specific details
of the settlement.

According to a statement, Netcom as set up a protocol on its
company home page for handling future intellectual property
disputes.

[...]

The full text of the protocol can be found on Netcom's home
page, at
http://www.netcom.com/about/protectcopy.html

[...]

"I would hate to see Netcom be put in the position of having
to police the material posted on its service," says Howard
Rheingold, a well-known digital community guru, and author of
the 1993 book Virtual Community, who is not familiar with the
details of the case.

AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into
the computers of the European parliament and
European commission as part of an international
espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and
political secrets, according to investigators, write
Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. 

The European parliament has called in British
communications experts to improve its security and
to block further attempts by American govern ment
agents to spy on its workings. 

Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg
offices say they have discovered several recent
instances in which its communications system was
compromised by American hacking. They have also
found evidence that the Americans used information
obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations
last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). 

Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the
European parliament, said he was shocked by the
disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the
American ambassador [to the European Union]," he
said. 

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese
and French governments of hacking into their
communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets. 

The European parliament's computer network links
more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and
other staff to each other, and to the European
commission headquarters in Brussels and the council
of ministers. 

Traffic across the network by telephone and
computers includes details of the private medical
and financial records of many MEPs and officials,
and discussion documents on confidential issues,
including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The
records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE
and fraud are also stored on the system. 

European parliament sources say the Americans
accessed the network by compromising the
information exchanges that link the parliament's
internal networks with the Internet and external
users. 

The devices, called "routers", filter entry to the
European parliament's network. It is understood the
Americans were able to obtain access to what is
called the simple network management protocol
(SNMP), the language that enables the networks to
talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact
that parts of the system were manufactured by two
American firms. 

The breach came to light when officials believed
that American negotiators had been given advance
warning of confidential European Union positions
in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established
that the system had been penetrated just days before
the talks," an EU source said. "Our principal
concern is not to establish what has already been
copied but to ensure that it does not happen again.
This is an on-going problem." 

A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of
data processing at the commission, confirmed that
allegations of hacking had been investigated.
However, she said she was unable to provide any
details.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of 
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.
                  
   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

Declan write:

&gt;   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
&gt;   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
&gt;   States.

This is the truly astonishing thing to me about terrorism in America. If,
at least for the sake of argument, the goal of terrorism in America is to
weaken the country through such attacks, it's phenomenally stupid to hand
terrorists a victory on a silver platter by gutting our Constitution as our
response.

Why bother to bring down the American government when the American
government can do a pretty good job of peeling way the nation's alleged
principles all on it own in the name of political brownie points?

           O'REILLY ANNOUNCES "NETACTIVISM" GUIDE TO
           USING THE INTERNET IN GRASSROOTS POLITICS
  Veteran Grassroots Activist Shares the Secrets of Online Success

SEBASTOPOL, CA--It's no secret that the American citizen is fed up with
politics as usual. Fewer people are voting in every election, and those
who do vote aren't sure it matters. During this presidential primary
season, noted Internet publisher O'Reilly & Associates is releasing in
"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet," a book that will show
ordinary people who want to reclaim politics--from the neighborhood to
the national level--how to use the power of the Internet to make a
difference.

Written by veteran political activist and former Philadelphia city
councilman Ed Schwartz, "NetActivism" is a no-hype guide that shows
readers how to use the Internet to find out what the government really
does, as well as how to organize around a cause or a community with
online tools like electronic mailing lists, online debates, and Web
sites.

A leader in citizen movements for more than 30 years, author Schwartz
embraced the Internet not because it's cool, but because it gets the
job done. He has an extensive online presence: a Web site
(http://libertynet.org/community/phila/natl.html) that serves community
activists across the country, a mailing list that discusses civic
values, and ties to a community network that organizes citizens across
the city of Philadelphia. "NetActivism" features real-world examples
from Schwartz's Institute for Civic Values and a host of other citizen
groups, including the Downtown Minneapolis Residents Association and
Project VoteSmart.

Community activists, politicians--and any concerned citizens who care
about their community--will find "NetActivism" packed with advice on
conducting online research, getting the right equipment and software,
using online networks in local communities, and crafting political
campaigns on the Net.

"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet" will be released on
September 24. Produced by O'Reilly affiliate Songlione Studios for
O'Reilly's Songline Guide imprint, "NetActivism" includes a CD-ROM with
Internet software and limited free online time.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ed Schwartz, founder and president of the Institute for the Study of
Civic Values, has been a national leader in movements to revitalize
neighborhoods and expand citizen participation in government for more
than 25 years.  In the 1970s, he built a city-wide coalition of
community organizations that led to his upset election to the
Philadelphia City Council as a councilman-at-large in 1984. Between
1987 and 1992, he served as director of Philadelphia's Office of
Housing and Community Development, overseeing the rehabilitation of
more than 4,000 houses and apartments for low-income residents of the
City. In 1992, he returned to the Institute for the Study of Civic
Values full-time to develop new models for community planning and
citizen empowerment for the 1990's.

Dr. Schwartz, who received his Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers
University, has written widely on problems related to civic
participation, neighborhood development, and America's democratic
heritage. His first book, "Will the Revolution Succeed?" has been
followed by articles and reviews in The New York Times Book Review, The
Nation, The American Prospect, Shelterforce, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
and The Philadelphia Daily News. The work of the Institute for the
Study of Civic Values itself is profiled extensively in Robert Bellah's
award-winning book, "Habits of the Heart."

Bryan,

I've taken the liberty of forwarding your note, along with my prepended
comments, to the fight-censorship mailing list.

I confess I'm not sure what recourse you have now that GeoCities has killed
your web site's graphics. Their current policy says that "nudity or
pornographic material of any kind" is verboten. Do you have the URLs to
other nude sites that remain on GeoCities?

At http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homeguide.html, I found:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a summary of things that are not permitted as part of
the GeoCities free Personal Home Page Program:

1.Material that is grossly offensive to the Web community including
blatant expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity

2.Pages that promote or provide instructional information about illegal
activities

3.Pages that promote physical harm or injury against any group or
individual

4.The use of free Personal Home Pages for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the following:

Soliciting for advertisers or sponsors

Displaying a sponsorship banner of any kind, including those that are
generated by "banner exchange" services

Displaying banners for services that provide cash or cash-equivalent
prizes to users in exchange for hyperlinks to their web site.

Conducting raffles or contests that require any type of entry fee

5.Pages that contain nudity or pornographic material of any kind

6.Pages that exploit images of children under 18 years of age

7.Restricted or Password-only access pages

8.Hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible
page)

9.Use of the page (or directory) as storage for remote loading

10.Use of the page as a door or signpost to another server

11.Use of copyrighted material without the prior permission from the
author
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.

Does anyone else have any insights?

Subject: censorship at www.geocities.com

Over a month ago I responded to a soliciation for a free personal home page
from www.geocities.com (which is advertised on their home page). They are
promoting theme-based neighborhoods for the home pages. The only content
guidelines were that nothing injurious to any person or group is permitted.
Based on those guidlelines, I felt the server a safe place to display my art
work and I placed my drawings of male nudes on an available address in
GeoCities' WestHollywood neighborhood. I have noticed other sites on
GeoCities with an equal amount of nudity. The only difference was my site
displayed the blue ribbon online freedom icon with a link to the EFF site.

Well, 30 days  and 10,000 hits to my site later (I heavily promoted my site
with listings in many art related directories), I awakened one morning to a
barage of e-mail from people informing me my site had been stripped of all
its graphics--everything from the blue ribbon icon to my nude art work, only
part of which contained male frontal nudity, to the photo of myself
fully-clothed. Later I was to receive an impersonal e-mail notification from
 GeoCities informing me that I was violating their content guidelines which
they now claim prohibit nudity (which I did not find in their posted
guidelines all the while other nude sites remain on GeoCities).

I am very distressed that after all my work and sincere efforts to produce a
tasteful site (which I received many e-mail compliments on wordwide),  I
would have it stripped bare in Nazi style of all the graphics, the essence of
my artistic energy.

Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
of expression in art and lifestyles.

Usually, tracking international net-censorship efforts is depressing.
However, this UPI report on the pissing match between N. Korea and S. Korea
made me laugh aloud. The North Koreans are posturing brilliantly -- truly
trying to force Seoul's hand, and using the Net to do it.

        TOKYO, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea's official news agency blasted
South Korea Tuesday for allegedly blocking its citizens' access to a new
Internet page sponsored by Pyongyang, a report monitored in Tokyo said.
        ``What they (Seoul) should block is not the North Korean Page but the
U.S. channel dealing with methods of murder and robbery and pornographic
scenes too shameful to watch,'' the Korean Central News Agency dispatch
said.
        The KCNA report quoted researcher Kim Hyong-sok of the Information
and Culture Center of North Korea as saying the history of the Internet
has seen no example of people being punished for monitoring certain
sites.
        ``Such punishment would cause bitter condemnation from the
international community,'' said Kim.
        Bristling with slogans about the ``great leader comrade Kim Il-sung,''
the Internet page has upset South Korean leaders, said KCNA, to the
point of having access to the site banned.
        ``The puppet Agency for National Security Planning and Prosecution
officially asked the Internet service organ in South Korea to block the
channel,'' said the KCNA report.
        The North Korean mouthpiece said the officials in Seoul should not
``trouble themselves'' because they do not have the equipment to block
the Internet page anyway.

[So Malaysia will censor only material that some government bureaucrat
finds "offensive?" What a commitment to free speech! Cynically, Declan]


         KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Reuter) - Malaysia on Thursday
unveils plans for a ``multimedia super corridor'' (MSC), which it
hopes will attract a new breed of foreign investors and propel
the country into the 21st century.

[...]

         [Proj director] Azzman said Malaysia would guarantee the
free flow of information. Sceptics have questioned that commitment in
a country where newspapers are licensed and the Printing and
Publications Act has been used to muzzle dissent.
         ``We have not censored the Internet, so the free flow of
information is very much the order of the day,'' said Azzman who
is director general of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronic Systems, a government agency that provides sole
access to the Internet in the country.
         ``We won't police what they do as long as it is within the
confines of the company,'' he said, adding companies in the MSC
can receive information from abroad, process it and then
transmit it out of the country without interference.
         The government would act only if illegal or offensive
materials like pornography were distributed within Malaysia.
         Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had agreed to set up a
regional office after meeting Mahathir last month. A ``couple of
dozen'' others have expressed ``keen interest'', Azzman said.
         The corridor would link the new airport and the futuristic
Putrajaya federal capital with the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a
mammoth office highrise project featuring the Petronas Towers,
the world's tallest buildings.

   BEIJING -- When it comes to controlling the Internet, China is
trying to learn from a little neighbor.
   In June, Beijing sent Zeng Jianhui, a top official, to Singapore to
pick up tips on expanding the use of the Internet within strict
limits. Singapore, a critic of unfettered dissent and Western culture,
is trying to become the network's model censor.
   ``China has a lot to learn from Singapore's experience,'' says a
Chinese government official studying Internet restrictions.

[...]

   Worried that the new electronic communications medium is spinning
out of its control and could undermine Communist propaganda, the
Chinese leadership decided in February to put teeth into Internet
regulations and prevent computer-disseminated pornography and
antigovernment material.
   The government is uneasy about cyberspace connections between
overseas democracy activists and Chinese dissidents, which blossomed
during political protests on the streets of Beijing and other major
cities during the spring of 1989. The few Chinese activists who are
not imprisoned or under detention are closely watched amid a
government crackdown on crime and political unrest.

[...]

   ``This is not having any negative effect on the Internet's
development in China,'' says Wang Jun, an official in the
telecommunications ministry's data communication bureau. ``It's just a
precautionary procedure.''

[...]

   In May, China launched a nationwide computer network that allows
only limited access to the Internet. The venture aims to avoid
breaking China's censorship laws by creating its own content and
making available only information useful for businesses.
   The new edited network, which is 60 percent owned by the official
New China News Agency and was launched in conjunction with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, does not face a censorship
problem because ``there is nothing illegal on the network,'' says
Joyce Wong, an executive with the Hong Kong-based China Internet Corp.

CSIS Calls Itself Canadas Political Police & States ARA Torched
Zundels House

Since the outrageously biased Heritage Front Affair Report published by
the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), a group of appointed
political has-beens and bagmen, we have had serious concerns that
Canadas security apparatus is utterly out of control and is spying
wholesale and contrary to the CSIS Act on legitimatre, non-violent
dissent. Some very disturbing confirmation of our fears has recently
come our way.

In February of this year, Kitchener, Ontario electronics businessman
Michael Rothe  was interviewed by two CSIS agents, who identified
themselves to him as such and showed ID. They were identified as Peter
and Angela. Rothe had organized several meetings in Kitchener for
British historian David Irving, who has since, under pressure from the
censorship lobby been banned from Canada, while planeloads of Tamil
terrorists and Jamican drug pushers and gunsels seem to have open access
to this country. The interview was taped. The revelations on thios tape
are staggering.

ANGELA: Have you heard of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
PETER: You can bet its real!.... Ill explain what we are. First, the
Canadian Security Intelligence service is like the BFK in Germany.
These are the dreaded so-called Federal  Constitution Protection  Police
(Bundesverfassungsschutz), which spy on the German right and are
blatantly a political police force. Just in case the frightened German
immigrant didnt get the point, Peter added: Were the political
police. Angela and I are from the counter-terrorism branch. ... We are
interested in the Heritage Front. He was then asked a number of
questions as to how he got involved in politics, how hed been contacted
by the Hereitage Front andf what he thought of this group, which CSIS,
through its agent Grant Bristow had helped fund and lead!
PETER: Did you ever meet Paul Fromm. Hes C-FAR and CAFE. The school
teacher from Mississauga. He would have been at the this David Irving
[meeting]. False!!!. Fromm was actually in Vancouver that day.
PETER: In Toronto, Wolfgang [Droege of the Heritage Front] has beren
much troubled by a group that calls itself Anti-Racist Action, ARA. This
is a collection of anarchists, Trotskyists, Stalinists.
ANGELA: The ARA that Peter described firebombed Ernst Zundel. Im sure
youve heard about the problem various leaders of the so-called right
wing have received firebombs. Shes apparently referring to the May 7,
1995 arson attack on Ernst Zundels Toronto residence/office, and
firebombings of Don Andrews and Nicola Polinuk.
PETER: So, were interested to know, ... were there ever  threats made
to you? That ought to put the fear of the Lord into him,

So, here we have CSISs descriptin of themselves as a political
police. Frightening! Then. theres the clear assertion that the
perpetratrors of the fire at Zundels and the firebombings in spring,
1995, were the ARA. If so, why havent they been arrested? Are they
being protected by the Canadian security establishment? Readers should
contact Solicitor-General Herb Gray and ask these questions. Ontario
readers should contact Solicitor-General Bob Runciman and ask why, in
light of this information, no charges have been laid by the Metropolitan
Toronto Police in these clearly political acts of terrorism. Had such an
attack been perpetrated on the offices of one the currently privileged
minoiorities, is there any doubt that every rightwinger to the starboard
of Joe Clark would have been hauled in for questioning?

SUMMARY

On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.

This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.

* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.

* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.

* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.

______________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND

This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.

Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.

In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.

Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.

Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export.
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography.
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.

What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.

2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this
   release for contact information for several such organisations.

3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:

&gt; What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
&gt; to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else have any insights?

I have a friend whose site containing nudity was treated in a very
similar way:  Wendy.

	http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4750

She had some beautifully tasteful partial nudes of herself on her
page; I would consider them erotic, not pornographic.  Unlike 
thie site in question here, I'd say that the main intent was to
show viewers a good time; there was essentially no content other
than the pictures.

When the hit counter went through the roof, they found her site and
apparently warned her a couple of times about its content not being
acceptable.  But she also played a mean trick on another Internet
user, which probably also contributed to her deletion.  It was apparently
some sort of revenge thing; I'm not sure who's right and who's wrong.
In my communications with her, I considered her a rather sweet lady
but not too frightfully verbal.  She certainly talked quite clearly
with her pictures, which revealed a stunningly perfect body.

I helped organize a brief protest campaign to Geocities which apparently
resulted in the reinstatement of her page, sans a few of the "best"
pictures.  And there, as far as I know, it remains.

The lesson from this would seem to be that you can probably get
Geocities to bend if you have enough friends.  (I probably don't
need to tell any of you here that being a gorgeous 25 year old girl
who loves to show off her body is one great way of acquiring
instant friends &lt;grin&gt;).

I hope this helps!

Best

&gt;Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
&gt;space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
&gt;sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
&gt;"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom

As a free service, Geocities has the right to determine which pages it
decides to sponsor.  This is not a good incident to espouse free speech

Two prime examples of site with PHOTOS  containng male frontal nudity on
GeoCities are:

Rob's Bound & Gagged
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3100

contains graphic photos of sadomaochism showing male genetalia

Nude Celebrities
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3102

My site only contained abstract pencil drawings with no sexual activity
portrayed.

There are dozens of sites containing nudity on GeoCities and obviously
something else is going on here.

Certainly, GeoCities has the right to determine which pages it decides to
sponsor. It may even have the right to offer the pages on on basis and then
pull them off under a new set of rules, after the page creator has invested
time in making them and publicizing their location. (I have the impression
from the initial message that this is what happened - can someone who knows
clarify this point?)

However, that does not mean they're not slimy for causing this kind of
unnecessary inconvenience, and it doesn't mean they shouldn't be called on
their acts and others who might be considering dealing with them alerted to
the possibility of a problem.

I personally would like to hear from GeoCities on why they chose to pull
the pages off. Did their policy change at any point, and if so, why did
they change it?

Yes, but it's not necessarily something sinister.  From the evidence
I've seen GeoCities is just responding to the "squeaky wheels."  When
a page gets a pile of hits they check it out.  I'm not especially
impressed with the actions they're taking, but I doubt there's any
plot to stifle free thinking on the net.

Get this one.  I just heard it on the afternoon news.  Two young boys were
seriously burned after a failed attempt at making napalm on their kitchen
stove.  Sounds like the normal fun activities of bored youth on summer break
right?  But hey - where did they get the recipe?  From the Anarchists
Cookbook in the library?  No - they got it from -- GASP -- the Anarchists
Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
-- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
sort of convention) are deciding whether or not to press charges.  See -
just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

Law Professor Sues Federal Government
Over Computer Privacy Issues

Federal Civil Rights Action Seeks Injunction Against 
State Department And National Security Agency

Cleveland Scholar Attacks Prohibition On Discussing 
Cryptographic Software With Foreign Students And Colleagues

     A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
     federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict
     his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a
     twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a
     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

     The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military
     technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which
     encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet,
     is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control.
     The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by
     defining "export" to include discussing technical information about
     non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students
     registered for Professor Junger's course.

     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

     Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on
     the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans
     to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this
     fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach,
     and to whom.

     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Folks, I apologize for the mail problems. I still haven't quite figured 
out exactly what happened -- I'm not at home, but in NYC on business, so 
I wasn't able to log on this evening until now.

Seems as though the problem happened when I forwarded a fight-censorship
message to cypherpunks, which has among its subscribers a nonexistent
address at axcess.net.in. For some reason, a poorly-configured machine at
axcess.net.in started repeatedly resending the forwarded message back to
fight-censorship. Odd. I think I've blocked it from doing it again. 

I blame the problem on AOL, of course.

On a topic more germane to the list, I was in Times Square with Glenn and
some NYC webperns this evening, having dinner in a delightful greasy
burger joint. For no apparent reason, a woman sitting next to me started
to describe, in painstaking detail, how to kill someone with a hatpin. (A
jab to the nerve center in the solar plexus, if you must know.)

I started to think to myself, especially after Dara's note earlier, that 
this kind of material should be banned! Censor biology texts on the Net!

Yours in protecting children from dangerous knowledge,

Declan

        Sure, I'll get flamed....


        But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?), and
therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
weapon every year...

        ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the

extrapolation) dangerous?

     Sen. Burns' letter to The Washington Post today contained something of 
     an error, in case you couldn't tell.
     
     A line from the original letter was deleted.
     
     The line that read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights" 
     should instead read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of current wiretapping authority, it is a drastic expansion. 
     it lays the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights."
     
     Fortunately, the overall meaning of the letter is left largely intact.

                      `SPEAKING IN CODE ON THE INTERNET'
   
   Friday, August 9 1996; Page A16
   The Washington Post
   
   
   The Post's editorial July 27 on my Pro-CODE bill to ease restrictions
   on encoded, or "encrypted," computer messages ["Speaking in Code on
   the Internet"] was generally balanced but deleted a couple of key
   points.
   
   First, my bill would not "lift" restrictions on the export of strong
   encryption technology, which is designed to allow people to protect
   their computer files and messages. Instead, it would allow the
   Commerce Department merely to ease export restrictions to a level of
   computer security that it deems is "generally available" in the
   nations we trade with.
   
   This bill does not open the floodgates. Instead, it is an
   acknowledgment of the real world and that high-tech U.S. companies
   must be allowed to compete in an increasingly vital sector of the
   world economy. One trade group stated the United States stands to lose
   $60 billion in market share and 216,000 jobs under the current
   restrictions.
   
   Second, the administration's proposal to seek a copy of decoder "keys"
   for our electronic information is not simply an extension of the
   groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights. Imagine a Craig
   Livingstone or an Aldrich Ames being designated the "trusted third
   party" who holds the keys.
   
   Supporters of my bill have never maintained that some criminals will
   not attempt to use encryption to evade law enforcement. But the bill
   is an attempt to address the encryption status quo, not some long-ago
   world to which the FBI would like to return. (FBI Director Louis Freeh
   stated in the hearing July 25 that he would even like to restrict
   encryption imports.)
   
   While the White House indicates it might be willing to give people
   stronger encryption, it insists that the trade-off must be a copy of
   our decoder keys. It's a deal Americans will never accept and a plan
   that has yet to be proven feasible.
   
   Denying millions of law-abiding people the use of a legitimate and
   increasingly necessary security product for "law enforcement" reasons
   is like banning deadbolt locks because they make it a little harder to
   kick down the doors of a few drug dealers.

&gt; &gt; Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
&gt; &gt; -- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
&gt; &gt; sort of convention)
Excuse me?  Last I heard, Feinstein (who wouldn't be caught dead in SD this
week&gt;, was sponsoring the worst censorship bill currently in Congress.  
And, lest we forget, Sen. Exon was (and is) a Democrat.  Sure, there are 
censors in the Republican Party (can you say Christian Coalition?), but 
that's a rather wide brush you're painting the Republicans with.  On the 
net, party lines don't quite fit.  As I think we've discussed here and 
elsewhere, it's net.experience that is the divider.

&gt; &gt; just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
&gt; &gt; morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.
No truer words were ever spoken &lt;g&gt;, speaking as one of the corrupted 
myself... :)

&gt;         But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
&gt; you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?)
Uhhhh... no.  The last time I went to Computer City, I didn't have to 
have a criminal background check or wait five days.  Actually, in VA, we 
don't have to wait 5 days, but that doesn't matter.  Back-of-the-truck 
sales, like you must be referring to, are illegal anyway, and if the 
police would enforce current laws, we might not have to worry about that.

&gt; therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
&gt; weapon every year...
More like &lt;maximum&gt; a few thousand over several years.  Remember, there 
are a hell of a lot more accidental car deaths than accidental gun 
deaths, though.  There's your few dozen thousand.

&gt;         ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
&gt; Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
&gt; extrapolation) dangerous?
Good point.  Guns, though, in a way like computers, require a 
mis-intentioned person to become dangerous.  Computers aren't designed to 
put holes in people or things (as Kurt Vonnegut would say).  In both 
cases, though, an unreasonable person has to make an irrational decision 
in order to cause harm.

&lt;/rant&gt;
&gt;         Just wondering....

Purchasing an AK47 is illegal in several states, and in those which do
allow machine gun ownership by citizens, you must receive an OK from
local law enforcement and obtain a BATF special permit.  

Modems do not require local law enforcement sign offs...yet.

             CLINTON: GOP LISTENING TO 'GUN LOBBY OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'
                                          
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) -- President Clinton on Saturday
   accused the Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts to fight terrorism
   by kowtowing to the gun lobby.
   
   In his weekly radio address from Jackson, where the president and his family
   are vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had stripped his anti-terrorism
   bill of valuable tools "that law enforcement needs to help them find out,
   track down and shut down terrorists."
   
   The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
   anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and marking
   explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to the dealer who
   sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill and the assault weapons
   ban.

[...]
   
   Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti- terrorism
   legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and explosive taggant
   issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism bill of its own that
   excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not vote on the measure before
   adjourning for its August recess.
   
   The Republicans, the president said, were listening to "the gun lobby over
   law enforcement."
   
   "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
   country and the safety of our people," he said.

August 9, 1996
  
After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?

   By VIVIENNE WALT 
   THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
   
   At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
   Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.
   
   Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship from
   his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a white
   supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service provider, the
   teenager posted the site's entire contents in a compressed "mirror" file...
   
   Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a task
   force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech -- something the
   Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe, has laws against.

[...]
   
   One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
   virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) pushed his
   proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony,
   punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
   
   "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
   of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
   the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
   how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
   can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

[...]
   
   In a last-minute maneuver on Aug. 2, House members dropped the Internet
   controls and wiretapping provisions from their Anti-Terrorism Act, approved
   it by 389-22, and went home for the rest of the summer, leaving the Senate
   in a quandary about what to do after Labor Day. "We just couldn't come up
   with a bipartisan bill," says Sen. Feinstein's press secretary Susan
   Kennedy.
   
   Like Washington, Paris empties out in August for la vacance. But on Sept.
   26, the fight picks up in the French capital at a top-level meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   
   Justice Department officials, and 'Net activists, are set to travel to Paris
   to argue about key escrow...

   "This is an example of the Justice Department trying to dictate foreign
   policy," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center in Washington, who sits on the OECD's advisory panel on encryption.

[...]
   
   "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
   subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
   Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
   of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
   the Web.
   
   Rabbi Cooper and others have lobbied Internet providers to expel the
   extremist sites. "Will they eventually find somewhere else? Probably. But
   that still makes it a worthwhile thing to do," he says.

The face of net-activism is changing. I'm writing this from a science
fiction writers' and editors' party in upstate New York, where we've been
talking about net-politics and online communities.

The fronts we face now are three: national, state, and international. 
We've fought the national fight in the CDA, Clipper, and recent crypto and
terrorist debates. It's been where most of our efforts have focused. 

State politics lags behind that of Capitol Hill. State legislators are
starting to try to ram through bills similar to the CDA -- and, worse yet,
ones that are substantially different. We've discussed some on
fight-censorship.

The ACLU is the only cyber-liberties group tracking them. Yesterday I
stopped by Ann Beeson's office in Manhattan to talk about the Georgia bill
and other laws the group is planning to challenge. 

(Congratulations are in order. No longer a temporary ACLU fellow, Ann is
now a full-time staff attorney in the national office. It's a
well-deserved promotion!)

Then I walked across Bryant Park to the headquarters of Human Rights
Watch, an international civil rights group. They don't have a substantial
online presence now, but they did publish a fabulous global
net-restrictions report ("Silencing the Net") this spring -- and they have
what the Net needs right now: expertise in dealing with international
groups like G-7 and an extensive network of affiliates around the world. 
They seemed interested in doing more online work, which is wonderful. 

Afterwards Charles Platt and Ann, Glenn and their SOs and I went to dinner
at Sam's Noodle Shop on 29th and chatted about our CDA lawsuit and the
human genome project. 

The two aren't necessarily related, unless you count discerning what
congenital defects DoJ attorney Jason "The Weasel" Baron has. Yes, I'm
hardly unbiased. Anyone who threatens to have me arrested for interviewing
government witnesses is a splendid example of a censorhappy Fed
bureaucrat. As a side note, the weasel has been showing up to more and
more DC cyber-regulation events, like the Freedom Forum's panel on crypto
and censorship, and the FTC's panel on net-regulation and privacy. (Wonder
what he's up to?)

So the growing net-involvement of ACLU and HRW is just in time. They have
the well-established state and international affiliates, respectively,
that other groups lack. Hopefully, the affiliates can forward reports
uphill to the parent groups and help in fighting laws and policies locally. 

We need all the help and international expertise we can get -- as we've
seen recently at the Paris summit, governments have this annoying,
persistent habit of working backroom deals. The G-7 resolution (also
endorsed by Russia) said: 

  We call on all States to:

  6. note the risk of terrorist using electronic or wire communications
       systems and networks to carry out criminal acts and the need to
       find means, consistent with national law, to prevent such
       criminality.

  11. accelerate consultation, in appropriate bilateral or multilateral fora,
       on the use of encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
       government access to data and communications in order, inter alia,
       to prevent or investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the
       privacy of legitimate communications.

I've been putting whatever international information I come across at
&lt;http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/&gt;. Check it out for more background.

Congress may be in recess, but Bill Clinton is still dreaming of expanded
FBI wiretap authority.  In this week's radio address, Clinton sought to
paint the GOP into a corner by depicting the opponents of his
"anti-terrorism" plan as "gun nuts."

Expect the White House to continue beating this drum throughout September.

      Clinton: GOP Listening To 'Gun
      Lobby Over Law Enforcement'

      JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) --
      President Clinton on Saturday accused the
      Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts
      to fight terrorism by kowtowing to the gun
      lobby.

      In his weekly radio address from Jackson,
      where the president and his family are
      vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had
      stripped his anti-terrorism bill of valuable tools "that law
      enforcement needs to help them find out, track down and shut down
      terrorists."

      The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
      anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and
      marking explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to
      the dealer who sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill
      and the assault weapons ban.

      [ ... ]

      Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti-
      terrorism legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and
      explosive taggant issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism
      bill of its own that excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not
      vote on the measure before adjourning for its August recess.

      [ ... ]

      "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
      country and the safety of our people," he said.

      The United States, he said, is not immune to terrorism, citing the
      Oklahoma City bombing and last month's bombing in Centennial

Um, well, except that
- there are serious safety questions concerning adding taggants to black
and smokeless powder
- a taggant provision is of dubious utility in catching terrorist bombers,
since black powder is not difficult to make (and presumably anyone serious
about planting pipe bombs and not getting caught would take this small
additional step for self-protection)
- it's hard to see how taggants would help LE track powder anyway, since
powder from a given manufacturing lot can be and commonly is shipped to
dealers all over the country.

I do think the issues are separable, and the wiretapping provisions are
obviously of considerably greater relevance to this list (and to
free-speech activism) than the taggant nonsense is. But I wanted to correct
the misapprehension; as we know from bitter experience with the CDA,
getting non-facts accepted as conventional wisdom is one of the first steps
in promulgating bad laws and in demonizing those who oppose them.

&gt; After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?
&gt; 
&gt;    By VIVIENNE WALT 
&gt;    THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
&gt;    
&gt;    At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
&gt;    Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.

I believe this is false. As far as I know, no one has objected, other than
by calling him naive. Frank is on vacation and off the net until early
September, so I imagine the WSJ was unable to reach him for this story. 
People reacted to his action the same way they did to our Zundelsite mirrors
- -- despite the fact that Zundel is just a harmless neo-Nazi propagandist,
while Lemire is a bit more... activist. For *his* side of the story, see
http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html

&gt;    Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship
&gt;    from his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a
&gt;    white supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service
&gt;    provider,

This is false. He heard that they were being protested. Lemire has not been
kicked off. His site remains at http://www.ftcnet.com/~freedom, and the site
that the SWC-Canada was far more concerned about, www.ftcnet.com/~skinhds,
is still online, too. Oddly, none of the stores in the US press even mention
the skinheads site. The initial reports in the Canadian press didn't even
mention Lemire, because it really wasn't about him.

Funny... the Skinheads site admits that they won and will not be censored. 
Take a look at http://alpha.ftcnet.com/~skinhds/ -- "Well my site has
weathered the storm of controversy and is still afloat.  Despite the best
efforts of some of the enemies of free speech my service provider did not
capitulate."

I wonder how long Lemire plans to milk the publicity. Maybe trolling the
Wall Street Journal was enough.

&gt;    the teenager posted the site's entire contents in a
&gt;    compressed "mirror" file... 

This is false. Lemire created and posted the archive, soliciting mirror
sites. The first one online was www.alpha.org, but they've been having
technical problems, so Frank's was announced first. Frank's web page simply
links to Lemire's archive on ftcnet.com. Frank did not compile and is not
distributing the site's entire contents. 

&gt;    Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a
&gt;    task force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech --
&gt;    something the Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe,
&gt;    has laws against. 

This is highly misleading; I assume it was taken from either Declan's
article or Lemire's press release, as it shows a lack of understanding of
the political and legal situation in Canada.

I don't suppose the WSJ will admit that they were trolled? Frank has, but I
know that Declan won't. In fact, if it weren't for this sentence and the
fact that I'm Bcc'ing it to Vivian, I doubt Declan would allow this message
to hit fight-censorship at all.

&gt;    One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
&gt;    virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.)
&gt;    pushed his proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the
&gt;    Internet a felony, punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
&gt;    
&gt;    "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
&gt;    of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
&gt;    the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
&gt;    how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
&gt;    can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

...and thanks to Biden, that recipe is now available through thomas.loc.gov.
What a moron.

&gt;    "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
&gt;    subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
&gt;    Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
&gt;    of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
&gt;    the Web.

No, Cyberwatch does no such thing. It just moans about it, giving no
specific examples. They don't even acknowledge the existence of other
organizations with policies that are both more effective and more respective
of freedom of speech, such as the Anti-Defamation League (which is larger
and older than the Wiesenthal Center, but strangely absent from press
reports of "jewish reaction to hate on the net") and Nizkor (which has far
more experience than either, but isn't jewish).

Subject: Column, Aug. 7


    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED Aug. 7, 1996
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Reading our mail

    Only in a nation already enormously out of touch with its founding
principle - that individual citizens and businesses have the right to do
just about any peaceful thing, while it's the powers of (start
ital)government(end ital) that are sharply restricted - could Congress find
itself debating whether to "allow" American computer firms to maintain
their lead in the multi-million-dollar overseas market for software
encryption.

  In plainer language, outfits like Netscape Communications and Tandem
Computers want "permission" to sell overseas programs like Pretty Good
Privacy - to which savvy American netsters now have free access - programs
which allow private e-mail messages and files to be encoded so government
snoops can't read them.

  The Clinton administration proposes that such exports be allowed only if
a decoding "key" is entrusted to a third party - such as a bank or
insurance company - which would then be subject to a court order or
subpoena should law enforcement personnel wish to break the code and
secretly read this electronic "mail."

  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in favor of such restrictions July 25,
arguing that "Uncontrolled export of U.S. computer codes may help
international criminals and terrorists hide their activities from law
enforcement."

  Well, yes, they probably do. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in New York on
charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners, used a laptop computer
containing files the FBI still hasn't been able to decode.
  But note the past tense. Terrorists have already got this stuff. Anything
in the possession of an American teenager can be (likely has been) uploaded
onto the Internet, and then downloaded without anyone being the wiser in
Baghdad, Tripoli, or Tangiers.

  The real goal here is to control the ability of American citizens to
communicate with one another without government snoops reading over their
shoulders. When Director Freeh warns that "Encryption products used
unchecked by criminals and terrorists for their illegal activities pose an
extremely serious threat," it's worth remembering that federal agencies
have, in recent years, used the terms "criminal" and "terrorist" to
describe peaceful worshippers and their children at the Branch Davidian
Church in Waco, MOVE activists in Philadelphia, an unarmed Idaho mother
with a nursing baby in her arms, and any number of perhaps misguided but
far-from-violent tax protesters, home schoolers, barter exchange operators,
and practitioners of alternative medicine, to name just a few.

  Once the possessor of such stuff can be arrested and jailed for years on
charges of "exporting a munition" for the mere act of posting the
mathematical formula on the Internet, does it make sense to pretend
Americans will still be free to use such encryption domestically?
  Those who favor an authoritarian, hierarchical society have grown
accustomed to the fact that the political opinions available to most
American government-school graduates have long been "filtered" through the
news desks of a few television networks and major wire services. The
unregulated, spontaneous nature of Internet communications frightens such
souls with dark nightmares of anarchy, the same way King George hated the
colonial "Committees of Correspondence."

  As Stephen Chapman of the Chicago Tribune pointed out in his nationally
syndicated column June 19, "We can be grateful that ink and paper didn't
make their first appearance the day before yesterday . Otherwise, Congress
and the president would be scrambling frantically to make sure that these
communication tools would not be used for purposes unapproved by the
government."

  If the idea of a government service delivering letters between private
citizens were being introduced today, wouldn't Director Freeh similarly
argue against the "extremely serious threat" that criminals and terrorists
might use this new "mail" system to keep their secrets, should the
government allow the use of glue-flapped "envelopes"?
  But wait, you say: The secret "keys" would only be available upon
issuance of a "court order."

  And this guarantee would be enforced, I presume, by the same courts that
today regularly excuse the short-circuiting of any and all such existing
safeguards so long as the federals assert a "compelling government
interest" in hunting drug dealers, nabbing  "money-launderers," or whatever
dastardly new crime of the week they care to allege?

  It's understandable that repressive regimes like China are pulling out
every stop to register and track private users of the Internet. When
legislators show similar instincts in what was once the "Land of the Free,"
it's their own premises which they ... and we ... should re-examine.

U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the
proposed action as ineffective:  "This is not a solution, it is just hiding
the problem."  (Financial Times 10 Aug 96)

        It was hard to wake up, that morning. The pillow to the right
of her was bewildered at its own unaccustomed chill. She had gathered
all the blankets around herself and no one had been there to pull them
back; this more than anything reminded her of her aloneness and she
very nearly turned back onto her side to weep herself to sleep.

I'm not sure this is the most effective or noticeable action, but what 
the heck.  Personally, I'd advocate doing whatever you think is most 
useful, just do it on the 31st, and let local media know with a short fax 
soon that Aug. 31 is Internet Censorship Protest Day.  If you've been of 
a mind to organize a rally, make it snappy. No better time.  I don't

Got a note this morning from a U.K. journalist who spoke with PSInet:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversation this am with a leading light at a large ISP here (subsidiary
of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and
essentially said, either you do something about it, or we'll do something
about it.  The guy said they'd pulled the groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups were "pedophile" areas. But the
FT report talks about Scotland Yard pressuring Internet providers to block
"hard-core pornography."

A meme on the rise: like cyberporn, "cybergangs" can reach into your living

"cybergangs" as a pretext for a crackdown -- not a war on drugs, but a War
on the Net?

&gt;
&gt; Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups are "pedophile" areas. But the

Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child
pornographic newsgroups. I have side accounts at 3 major ISPs that all
have as close to a full newsfeed as is physically possible, I think.
They all have almost an identical roster of available newsgroups (other
than local ones of course, very few of which anywhere are pornographic in
nature.)  Out of those, only the following newsgroups would appear to
qualify at first blush:

alt.sex.pedophilia
alt.sex.pedophilia.boys
alt.sex.pedophilia.girls

[I admit the possibility of missing a keyword. I did a search for
"child", "kid", "teen", "lolita", "young", "youth" and "pedo". There
might be, say, a "nambla" match, now that I think about it, but obscure
keywords like that are unlikely to find enough newsgroups to strongly
affect the outcome of this quick examination.]

Of these, many can be immediately eliminated, as they are discussion
groups, not binaries group, or are typos ("binaires") and ergo not carried
by 99% or so of usenet (though available on a few sites like the WELL where
the admins allow the automatic availability of every newsgroup known to
the system, even ones created just to create a stupid-named newsgroup
with no intention that it will ever be used.)

This leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male

alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

Now, of these all the "young" and "teen" groups have to be eliminated,
since "young" is to vague to mean anything more specific that "younger
than middle aged", and teen can refer to 18 or 19 (or even younger legal
ages, if the UK is like Australia and sets age of consent at 16 instead
of US & Canada's 18).  If you actually look in these groups there appears
to be nothing but flames, blather, and BBS ads, almost none, if any, of
which will be childporn, since that would be a major cop magnet.
Lolita.misc and pedophilia.swaps also have be dropped, as too vague to
clearly indicate child pornographic visual content.  The de. newsgroup is
also probably not carried by many sites outside of Germany. (WELL had it,
but my other ISPs didn't. Probably WELL is trading news with a site in
Germany for some reason - maybe the .de site can't get a decent news
feed? I dunno).

That leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking


Six likely suspect newsgroups for genuine illegal content in the form of
child pornography.  It's highly questionable whether real child porn
shows up on any such newsgroup with any regularity, if at all. Again, the
content seems to consist of flames and blatant BBS ads (though I'm not
dumb enough to actually download the material, since that could count as
"possession" if some of it is really child porn.)  I even recall the
creation of a few of these - they were newgrouped simply to piss people
off with no intention of actually using the newsgroups. They were
instantly rmgrouped, and are unavailable on all sites that honor
"official" alt.config rmgroups, which is probably the vast majority of
news servers.

Much ado about nothing.

Also, none of this even touches the question of whether liability adheres
to providing access to something that happens to contain child porn
simply becuase is *sounds* child pornographic. By this logic, even if is
eventually established that an ISP could not be held liable for child
porn content in general, absent guilty knowledge, an ISP could be held
liable for it if someone posted a message with "child porn" in the
subject line, and it actually did contain child porn, regardless of the
fact that any message by that name is more likely to be a discussion
thread about child porn and the problems it causes, that to be actual
child porn.

The UK cops are making the mistake of assuming that every label is.
first, always accurate, and second, non-ambigious.  That's a very stupid
set of assumptions.

Either way you look at it, this is ridiculous.

Either:

a) the UK police bureucrats have taken all newsgroup names at face
value and have targetted most of the initial long list near the top of this
message, even though most are obviously intended to be discussion areas
and don't carry child porn itself, or

b) they are going after 5 or so newsgroups that are, at least in name,
definitely child pornographic, PLUS a buch of others (the rest of the 20)
like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.male, or whatever, that have nothing at
all, even in name, to do with child porn, as the article Declan quotes
seems to suggest (I think this quite possible, since it's unlikely that
many if any UK hosts have this many pedophillic-sounding newsgroups. Only
the biggest and most bandwidth rich US ISPs carry them all, so the UK
cops probably don't even know about the majority of the newsgroups in the
top, large, list.)

A and B are *both* stupid and indefensible.

The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the
contents of the newgroups in question and worked to locate those posting
any genuine child porn, and prosecute them (with an eye to the fact that
its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

August 13, 1996

BY FAX: +65-375-7765

Mr. George Yeo
Minister for Information and the Arts
460 Alexandra Road, 37th Story
PSA Building
Singapore 119963

Dear Mr. Yeo,

     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the recent
decision by the Singapore government to establish strict controls on Internet
use. The implementation of the Class License Scheme, which, according to a
July 11 government news release, "will focus on content which may undermine
public morals, political stability and religious harmony,"ensures a leading
role for Singapore among international promoters of online censorship. This is
a particularly unfortunate role for Singapore, which has been a leader in the
development and promotion of Internet use in Asia. It places Singapore in the
same category as countries like China, where Internet users must endure
onerous restrictions.

     One of the most unique and valuable characteristics of the Internet is
its ability to establish easy, inexpensive and practically instantaneous
communication between the farthest points of the earth. By prohibiting
connections between its citizens and various Web sites outside its borders,
Singapore is in essence removing itself from the global Internet. If, as will
surely happen, its example is followed in other countries, the Internet, which
held such promise as the world's first truly global medium, will be nothing
more than a set of country-specific networks where local prejudices and fears
are reinforced by technology.

     Our specific objections concern Singapore's decision to regulate the
Internet as if it were a broadcast medium. Unlike broadcast media, the
Internet is the first truly mass medium. Through e-mail, it allows individuals
with nothing more than a computer and a modem to express their views to an
international audience. Even the World Wide Web differs significantly from a
broadcast medium in that individuals are not confronted with a particular site
upon connecting to the Web--they may choose whichever sites they choose to
visit. As with other forms of Internet communication, anyone may put up his or
her own site on the Web. The Singapore government's own use of Web pages
demonstrates how the Internet can be used to propound a particular point of
view. Its citizens, so long as they are not using their site to incite to
violence, should have the same opportunity to express views as their
government. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights:

     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
     to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
     media and regardless of frontiers.

     We are particularly concerned that restrictions have been placed on
Singaporeans who wish to discuss religious and political ideas online. It is
only through unrestricted discussions of such serious topics by all members of
society, no matter how unpopular their views, that these subjects become less
explosive. Forbidding discussion--in effect, treating its citizens like
children--will, on the other hand, ensure that dangerous topics remain just
that.

     We are also concerned that the extraordinarily broad categories of
forbidden content, as outlined by the SBA, will encourage arbitrary
restrictions on communication. According to the Internet Content Guidelines,
the following topics are banned.

     Public Security and National Defense

          a.   Contents which jeopardize public security or national
               defense.
          b.   Contents which undermine the public confidence in the
               administration of justice.
          c.   Contents which present information or events in such a
               way that alarms or misleads all or any of the public.
          d.   Contents which tend to bring the Government into
               hatred or contempt, or which excite disaffection
               against the Government.

     Racial and Religious Harmony

          a.   Contents which denigrate or satirize any racial or
               religious group.
          b.   Contents which bring any race or religion into hatred
               or resentment.
          c.   Contents which promote religious deviations or occult
               practices such as Satanism.

          Public Morals

          a.        Contents which are pornographic or otherwise obscene.
          b.        Contents which propagate permissiveness or
                    promiscuity.
          c.        Contents which depict or propagate gross exploitation
                    of violence, nudity, sex or horror.
          d.   Contents which depict or propagate sexual perversions
               such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia.

By banning such subjects a chill will be sent through the online community in
Singapore, and will render the Internet essentially useless in allowing any
kind of serious discussion.

     In addition to forbidding particular content, the government has also
announced that some sites will be banned. Internet service providers were
given the deadline of September 14, 1996,  to begin using proxy
servers--devices that can prohibit connections to specified sites--to
connect all their
subscribers.

     Although the government has promised to use a light hand in regulating
the Internet, its activities even at this early stage indicate otherwise. A
July 12 posting in the Usenet newsgroup "soc.culture.singapore" was reportedly
removed at the request of the SBA, who asked local Internet service providers
for its removal because it alleged that lawyers at a local law firm were
incompetent. The request came, according to the Straits Times, after the law
firm complained to the government. Despite the removal from the newsgroup, the
message is still widely available to Singaporeans through other Internet
sources, indicating that content control will be difficult unless Internet
access is restricted even further.

     We hope that the Singapore government will retract these repressive new
regulations, and support the development of an unfettered Internet. Instead of
using its power to restrict Internet use, the government could play a truly
useful role by devising ways to expand its use to even the most disaffected
members of its population.

                                   Sincerely,
                                   Sidney Jones
                                   Executive Director

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

You're forgetting the tortuous British obscenity laws.  For example, it's
illegal to show an erect penis in Britain.  The police are just trying
enforce the censorious powers the government has always given them.

Free Speech 101: ACLU Gives Princeton University an "F"  
for Barring Political Speech on its Network 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             
Wednesday, August 15, 1996 
 
Contact: Ann Beeson, ACLU National (212) 944-9800, x788 
David Rocah, ACLU of New Jersey (201) 642-2084 
 
NEW YORK--In a letter sent today to Princeton University officials,  the
American Civil Liberties Union urged them to reconsider a policy barring
students and staff from using the computer network for "political
purposes."  
   
The letter was sparked by complaints the ACLU national office received over
a recent memo from Princeton officials advising faculty, staff and
students, "especially in this year of a presidential election," that the
school's not-for-profit status barred it from allowing use of the computer
network "for political purposes." 
 
The ACLU called this conclusion mistaken, pointing out in its letter that
the Internal Revenue Code specifies that only the University itself is
barred from political activity -- not faculty, staff, or students acting
independently.  In fact, the ACLU said, the IRS has previously held that
statements in support of political candidates appearing on the editorial
page of a student newspaper would not be considered violations of a
university's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. 
 
"Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network," the ACLU letter
stated, "it is an unjustified content-based restriction on the free
expression rights of students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is
not only unworthy of a great university like Princeton, it is in violation
of the New Jersey State Constitution."  The letter was signed by ACLU
national staff attorney Ann Beeson and David Rocah, staff attorney of the
ACLU of New Jersey. 
   
"We understand the university's concerns regarding it's tax-exempt status,"
Rocah said.  "But this is free speech 101.  Sadly, Princeton is not making
the grade."    
 
Rocah said the ACLU would consider legal action if the university refuses
to drop its censorship policy. 
 
"Traditionally, college campuses are the center of political discussion and
debate," said Beeson.  "The fact that the debate is taking place on the
Internet does not mean that the speech is any less deserving of
protection."  
 
Beeson added that the policy could bar students and staff from a wide range
of protected expression, including downloading position papers from the
Dole or Clinton website; sending e-mail to their parents urging them to
vote for Ralph Nader; and organizing online discussion groups for  student
chapters of politically active groups such as Greenpeace.   In short, Rocah
said, "Everything that would be acceptable, even welcome, off-line, becomes
off-limits on the Internet."  
   
In its letter, the ACLU called on the school to take a leadership role in
the academic community:  "As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a
leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to
promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its
community, to the very limits of the law," the letter said. 
 
Beeson added that the ACLU  is working to develop model guidelines for 
colleges and universities to help sort out the confusion in academia
regarding free expression on the Internet.  Many schools have already put
in place "Appropriate Use Policies" to police student and faculty computer 
use, some of which violate rights of free expression, Beeson said.

Mr. Harold Shapiro 
President                 BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, & REGULAR MAIL 
1 Nassau Hall 
Princeton University 
Princeton NJ 85044 
 
RE: Computer Use Policy 
 
Dear President Shapiro: 
 
In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton
University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ)
to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University
from using the Princeton's computer network for "political purposes."  We
believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding
the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic
freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.

 
Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students
widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet
greatly expanded the resources available for academic research.  It also
provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas.  In
contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for
"political purposes" unjustifiably interferes with the right of the
University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.

 
Princeton's current computer use policy holds that "the Computing and
network resources of the University may not be used by members of the
University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial
gain . . . ."  Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter "Rights," attached
as Appendix A).  On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent
an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use
of the Internet or computer network for "any participation in, or
intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
public office" would result in disciplinary action.  See Office of the
General Counsel, "Internet use and Politics," E-mail of July 19, 1996,
attached as Appendix B. 
 
We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a
concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to
use the computer network for political purposes.  We believe that this
concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal
Revenue Service. 
 
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization
will be tax-exempt as long as it "does not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office."  The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to
constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the
political activity must be that of the University itself and not the
individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students.  See Internal
Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for
1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C.  Thus, any personal
communication by University members over the computer network cannot
threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the
communication takes place does not change this conclusion.  The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether
the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political
activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the
university under Internal Revenue Code  501(c)(3), is whether the
facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for
non-political reasons.  Id. at 427.  Princeton provides fair and equal
access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access,
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes.  See Rights at 11.  Thus, political speech over the
network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with
a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status.  The
Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that
required its students in a certain political science course to participate
in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during
the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the
meaning of Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  See Revenue Ruling 75-512,
1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D. 
 
In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on
the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not
participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political
candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper.  This was
true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities
to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were
clearly those of the students and not of the university itself.  See
Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E. 
 
Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by
allowing University members to use its computer network for political
purposes.  We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for
official positions of the University.  At most, the only permissible
regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the
University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a
reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official
position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the
opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone.
 Compare Rights, "Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the
University and Political Activities," at Section 3. 
 
Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an
unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of
students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of
a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of
the New Jersey Constitution. 
 
Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey
Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been
sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to
honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression.  See State v.
Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against
the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994)
(holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive
use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet).  Princeton's
computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton "campus" as are the
lawns and buildings.  Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its
students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the
Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech
in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus. 
 
Political expression has always received the highest degree of
constitutional protection.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). 
The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship
those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for
political candidates.  Indeed, "where political speech is involved, our
tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion,
the narrowest range for restriction.'"  State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412
(1980).  As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in
American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and
defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to
the very limits of the law. 
 
The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free
speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive
information.  Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (right
to receive information precludes government from labeling certain
publications "propaganda") (Brennan, J., concurring); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) ("right of freedom of speech . . .
includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . .
receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of
thought, and freedom to teach . . . .  Without these peripheral rights the
specific rights would be less secure."); Kreimer v. Bur. of Police for Town
of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1350-55 (3d Cir. 1992) (listing cases).  This
is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the
Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community.  See
ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996).  They
provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access
information on virtually any topic, including politics. 
 
Finally, the computer use policy is in conflict with other University
policies and practices.  Princeton recognizes that 
 
     "the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the
discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching
and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and
learning to society at large.  Free inquiry and free expression within the
academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. 
The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate
conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in
classrooms and lecture halls." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 
With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it
has a fundamental responsibility to ensure 
 
    "the opportunity for all members of the University community to
exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . .  Encouragement of an
interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social
responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal
education.  The University continues to consider self-chosen participation
in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable
part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage.  Such activities
on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to,
imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or
point of view." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Guidelines Relating to Tax Exempt Status." 
 
For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal the existing
ban on use of the computer network for political purposes, and we look
forward to your early reply.

Bomb info OK in books but G-7 wants it off Net

By COLMAN JONES

While the fury over child porn on the net appears to be losing steam
after the defeat of the Communications Decency Act in June, there's a a
growing new cyber-backlash against terrorists.  

At a meeting in Paris last month, just before the downing of TWA flight
800 and the bombing in Atlanta, Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers
and security ministers struck an agreement to target terrorists using
the internet.  

The pact calls for international controls on the net to cut off access
to sites containing "dangerous" information, restrict electronic speech
by unpopular political organizations and allow governments to decode
privately encrypted communications.

The Paris meeting ended with a commitment to have reports ready by the
end of the year on ways of instituting such restrictions.

[...]

Bomb info

Many press accounts fume about bomb-making information available
online, without mentioning that the "offensive'' material being
targeted is no different from identical material easily obtained in
public libraries, college libraries and bookstores. A case in point is
the World's Biggest Bookstore, which stocks the Anarchist Cookbook, a
virtual how-to guide to subversive activity, also available online.  

Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who helped to draw
up the Paris agreement, cited the fact that his his 11-year-old son
showed him how to access extremist literature from the World Wide Web.
Axworthy's spokesperson, Catherine Lappe, says the pact is "not an
issue of trying to censor people" .  

"If you look at the communique, it says very clearly that all this
would have to be in compliance with national laws, so the issues of
privacy would be of utmost importance.''

they'll have to go after these sites too:

I wonder what the university will do, if anything? This message is copied

Husker Web Pages Must Cease

Subject: Husker Web Pages Must Cease
From: mfricke@serv01.net-link.net (Mark E. Fricke)
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:59:55 -0400

I hate to be the bearer of real bad news, but if you have a personal
web site on the internet that features any logos, graphics, audio or
even the page name of Cornhusker or Husker (like the Husker Press Box)
be prepared to get a Cease and desist letter from the University of
Nebraska's attorney's. The problem is simple. A lot of money has been
paid to license the name and logo's of the Huskers and there are many
business interests to protect. Pinnacle Broadcasting is the exclusive
rights holder for internet usage of the name and logos (and you thought
the live broadcasts were all good).

Now..there are a couple of things we can do. #1 remove all references
to Huskers, Big Red, Cornhuskers etc. from THE PAGES TITLE. You can
still talk about, mention, berate or praise the team within the page,
just not in the page title. The reason here is that the University
wants all search engines (yahoo, excite, infoseek etc.) to send
searches for the Huskers to their site (huskerwebcast)

#2 remove all licensed logo's, pictures of Herbie audio of the band
etc. from your site.

#3 There is one more solution. Huskerwebcast will allow pages to exist
as they are if they are housed within THEIR page. Wether that mean they
will have hyperlinks to these hidden pages or if you will actually have
to set up an account and an FTP site to their server I'm not clear on.
I'm awaiting confirmation on this.

Okay, now my personal views. Yeah it's a bummer...a great big bummer. I
really don't see how private personal pages could possibly infringe on
the marketing dollars of the University (except for logos, you got me
there) But PAGE NAMES?!?!. They seem a little greedy fo rthe traffic.
I'm no lawyer (maybe some of you out there are and know something about
public domain)so I will do what I must with the Husker Press Box.  I
will still provide the page in some manner, either changing the name or
joining the University page. Luckily I have already been extended an
offer to do that. I will wait and see. My advise to other Husker wep
page masters. Be ready for a letter and be ready to reacte. this is a
big University with lots of money and lots of attorney's

Recently the London police sent a letter to U.K. Internet providers saying
that 133 Usenet newsgroups must be banned.

&gt;From observations at &lt;http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship&gt;, it's clear that:

       the Police regard ISPs as publishers
       the publication of obscene materials is an offence
       the Police expect ISPs to continuously monitor newsgroups and
           to remove those which contain illegal materials

More ominously, the letter says "Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive
and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups identifying and taking
necessary action against those others found to contain such material...
This list is only the starting point..." Also, the police have said they
have the power to arrest Internet providers and seize their equipment.

This move by the Brits is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising. I have
background about many more international net-censorship attempts at:

The letter from the Met makes it clear that this is only the

We urge you all to protest this action - use the media, contact your

At present, Wave Rider Internet Plc have received no such notification from
the police, and will therefore not be removing any groups. However, as

nothing in them.

Like other UK ISPs, VBCnet today received a demand from the Metropolitan
Police that some 134 news groups be deleted from our news machines.
The letter makes it clear that this is only the beginning, that they
will be banning more groups and requiring ISPs to enforce their
dictats.  We have with great reluctance complied with their demand.

While we do not disagree that the articles in some of these groups are
often objectionable, we disagree in principle with this form of censorship.

We urge all of you to make it clear to your customers why these news
groups have been withdrawn and we urge you to contact your MPs and
the media about this arbitrary action by the police.  If there is no
protest, if a precedent is established, the UK Internet is going to
fall under the control of the Clubs and Vice Unit at Charing Cross
Police Station.

VBCnet is setting up a Web page to protest this action.  It should be
available at

Dear Sir / Madam

Pornographic Material on the Internet

Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.

We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.

This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.

We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.

Yours Faithfully

A longtime anti-porn crusader, Phyllis Schlafly generally is no friend of
free speech -- but I welcome her insightful and timely comments, attached
below. Privacy does cut through ideological lines. I seem to recall that
the Christian Coalition, a fiery supporter of the CDA, opposed the Clipper

                    Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother


     August 8, 1996                             by Phyllis Schlafly

     We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
     recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all
     Americans who care about civil liberties should vigorously resist
     President Clinton's attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an
     excuse to carry on his all-out war against the personal privacy of
     law-abiding Americans.

     This mind-set was first revealed in the Clinton health care bill,
     which would have given the government computer access to the
     medical records of all Americans. Fortunately, that totalitarian
     takeover of the health care industry was rejected.

     The Clinton Administration's education legislation now pending in
     Congress would put personal information about all schoolchildren
     -- academic, medical, attitudinal, behavioral, and family -- into
     an expanded Labor Market Information database available to the
     government, as well as to prospective employers.

     Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for
     individual Americans to have private conversations with one
     another. That's the real meaning of its effort to control
     encryption technology, and it's a direct assault on the First
     Amendment.

     It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First
     Amendment guarantees our right to speak in public but not in
     private. It would be just as ridiculous to say that we have
     freedom to speak in words that the government can understand, but
     not in words the government can't decipher.

     Americans have the right to speak to one another in private,
     behind closed doors, and we should likewise have the right to
     speak to one another in code and to put our coded messages on
     computer in a process called encryption. Americans would not
     tolerate the government opening and reading the letters we send
     through the mails, and we should not tolerate the government
     opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
     computer.

     Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and
     Vice President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our
     encrypted messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of
     California, Reno bluntly stated her demand for "ensuring law
     enforcement access to encrypted data.''

     Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government
     should create a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly
     "neutral third party''), to which all Americans should be forced
     to "entrust'' the keys to their encrypted messages, and to which
     the government would have access. On the contrary, there is no
     such consensus.

     Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do
     you trust the FBI to keep your files confidential?

     The Clinton Administration is already doing 30 to 40 percent more
     federal telephone wiretaps and other electronic surveillance than
     the last year of the Bush Administration. Those figures don't even
     include national security wiretaps or the hundreds of extensions
     granting more time for wiretap orders already issued.

     FBI Director Freeh wrote the New York Times last November that
     "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the
     extent of wiretapping." Four months later, FBI documents revealed
     that the FBI does, in fact, plan to increase electronic
     surveillance 54 percent by 1998 and 130 percent by 2004.

     On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will
     continue to push for the adoption of a massive public key
     infrastructure to give the government access to all encrypted
     communications. In a blatant bid for a police-state surveillance
     society, Gore warned about "the dangers of unregulated encryption
     technology."

     A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to
     make policy recommendations about encryption. The panel called on
     the government to abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.

     The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would
     enhance our national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of
     its 16 members had security clearances with access to secret
     information, and they saw no national security reason to justify
     the Clinton policy.

     The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private
     encryption on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping.
     However, the NSC panel concluded that the ability of the private
     sector to transfer confidential financial and other data over the
     information highway without interception is far more important.

     New technologies have given government awesome power to spy on
     individuals. The Filegate investigation accidentally uncovered the
     shocking news that, as soon as Bill Clinton entered the White
     House in 1993, he secretly spent $400,000 on software to create a
     highly sophisticated computer database to track detailed
     political, financial, attitudinal, and personal biographical
     information on 200,000 people, including members of Congress and
     the media. Known as WHODB for White House Office Data Base, the
     system was nicknamed Big Brother.

     Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the
     Clinton Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would
     be the biggest expansion of federal power since the passage of the
     Income Tax Amendment in 1913.

I talked to Trueman today.

He told me Shea's victory was "not unexpected."

"The ACLU did some forum shopping. If I were going to file a suit like they
did, I'd go to Manhattan," he said, adding that NYC is much more permissive
than most parts of the country.

When I told him that Shea rather strongly dislikes the ACLU and refused to
join the ACLU lawsuit, Trueman was incredulous. Said that Shea must have
received some help from the ACLU in preparing briefs or whatnot.

Not quite.

The address you now should use for submitting posts to the fight-censorship
list is:

    fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

This isn't a big change since the old address at CMU has been forwarded to
the above address for months. You should notice no changes in the list --
except some improvements in performance. The old address will be forwarded
to the MIT address for the forseeable future.

If you want to subscribe or unsubscribe, check out the instructions at:

     http://www.eff.org/~declan/fight-censorship/

The above URL will exist until John and I recreate the fight-censorship
archive this weekend. (This means the international section will be back
online, which is now at http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/)

I'd also like to thank Jered for hosting the fight-censorship mailing list
at MIT.

&gt;Let's keep this list about government censorship, please.

I like the way Tom Edwards, an avowed Libertarian, described it:

Institutional restrictions on speech also are often wrong, but the response
to them is different. Such muzzling attempts are not illegal, just
misguided.

However, we should keep in mind the very fuzzy difference distinction
between editing and censorship. Should, for instance, Jim Thomas be forced
to include off-topic rants in CuD? Should the National Coalition Against
Censorship be forced to publish similar materials in their quarterly
newsletter? Editing != censorship. The ALA has a definition of censorship
that may be useful here.

But perhaps we can agree that the most vile form of censorship remains that
done by governments, which buttress their laws with the power of guns,
tanks, and gallows.

	For the record, we didn't forum-shop.  Also, I don't strongly
dislike the ACLU, and I certainly agree with them on the CDA.  Finally,
our case landed in NY because the correspondent firm that was going to
handle the case here backed out at the last moment -- on Feb. 7, the night
before we filed.  Our judges were relatively conservative.  We were not
assoisted by the ACLU, with whom we had a short-lived feud.

ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace;
New Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Wednesday, July 31, 1996

    NEW YORK, NY--Despite a second federal court decision affirming
that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today
warned of  persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and
internationally, to censor electronic communications and regulate
privacy technology.   

    At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known
as "G-7," government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate
the Internet and other electronic communications in an effort to
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing
incident at the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight
800, which is being investigated as a possible terrorist bombing.
Participants included France, Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany,
Canada, Russia and the United States. 

    Although not all details were made public, proposed measures
apparently include investigations of charities and political
organizations with radical political points of view -- threatening
their rights to free speech -- and using the Internet to "monitor"
terrorist communications.  There was also agreement to adopt a U.S.
plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed encryption, which would mean that
individuals and companies would be barred from using encryption
technology to electronically lock up their most private and
sensitive information unless they make the keys available to their
government.  

    In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and
electronic privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed
last month at a meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal.    The
group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition
with organizations from around the world to share information and
protect free speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the
global Internet.  GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the Internet
Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and human
rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding member of the group.

    "GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and
that decisions made by international bodies like the G-7 nations
affect all Internet users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate
director of the ACLU.  "The U.S. government may not accomplish
through an international end-run what the U.S. Congress and the
U.S. Courts have rejected."
    
    Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges
in New York declaring that censorship in cyberspace is
unconstitutional.  The decision marked another win in the ongoing
battle for free speech in cyberspace, which saw its first major
victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a Philadelphia court
granted a motion for preliminary injunction on "indecency"
provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed its
challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed
into law.

    "We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their
Philadelphia colleagues in protecting the Internet from
governmental intrusion," said Steinhardt, who testified in the
Philadelphia case.  "But we remain concerned about the government's
continuing efforts to censor electronic speech, not only in the
United States but internationally."

    In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal
that would make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-
making in print, radio, television or in cyberspace.   Violations
would be punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine,
or both. 

    "This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last
year, would criminalize everything from a high school chemistry
teacher explaining basic scientific principles, to a newspaper
carrying an illustration of a bomb's construction, to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture manual describing how to make fertilizer
bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's Steinhardt said. 

    In addition, President Clinton this week announced an
initiative to increase the powers of federal investigators,
including an expanded wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has
commended the Clinton Administration and law enforcement
authorities for their investigation into recent tragic incidents,
it urged President Clinton and Congress in a letter sent to the
White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit" by
safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss
continuing civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
generalized libertarian baiting. I for one would appreciate it if you'd
knock it off in this forum; distortions, insults, and amateur
psychoanalysis are not only not helpful, they're actively harmful in
sidetracking discussion and creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one
another.

If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please
do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list. Thank
you.

If someone refuses to do business with another person based on disagreement

but I can't see a single such incident as a problem. An inconvenience for
the artist who in this case has to find another, more reliable developer,
but no more than that. And I don't agree that it's wrong to refuse to do
business with someone, assuming you're not deceptive about it.

If we see a situation develop in which it's impossible to find developers
or printers to do certain work, or if there is an indication that this
developer refused this work because of intimidation or fear of legal
consequences, then it starts to become a censorship issue. But I didn't see
any such indications in the original message.

Yesterday in Paris government ministers from the G-7 countries met and
approved a 25-point plan calling for close cooperation in moving to
"intensify exchange of operational information," particularly "the use
of communications technologies by terrorist groups."

In a HotWired column, Kenneth Cukier writes: "In case there is any
question about the United States's position, Attorney General Janet
Reno said: 'We obtained the agreement of the eight (countries at the
conference) to develop means of lawful government access to and
decoding of scrambled or coded communication transmitted by
terrorists.'" German delegates also blasted the Internet.

The ACLU reports that: "Proposed measures apparently include
investigations of charities and political organizations with radical
political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech."

I've attached part of a cover story I have in the latest _Internet

"PLAGUE OF FREEDOM"
The Internet's being disinfected for your protection
(pages 28-33)

By Declan McCullagh
declan@well.com


Call it an unlikely parable for today's Internet.

Daniel Defoe's "A Journal of the Plague Years" isn't about cyberspace.
Written in 1665, the book sketches a ghastly picture of a London under
seige.

Defoe tells how rats from foreign ships have invaded the city, carrying
with them the bubonic plague. Authorities resort to desperate measures,
barricading families inside their homes in a desperate attempt to halt
the onslaught.

It doesn't work. "Setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was,
first of all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by
force or by strategm, even almost as often as they pleased," Defoe
wrote.

So it is with the sprawling expanse of cyberspace in 1996. Governments
around the globe are rushing to barricade their borders, dam the flow
of foreign data, and create a new world information order. For good
reason: an uncensored 'net connection can be as deadly to a 20th
century government as the plague was three centuries ago.

And it may be just as infectious.

[...]

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The most influential international body involved in cyberrulemaking is
the G-7 group of industrialized nations. Truth be told, it's obscure
outside financial circles and is seen even inside them as becoming
irrelevant in a global financial system dominated by multinational
corporations, not by governments.

Yet the seven member nations have already started using the G-7
umbrella to engage in a sort of joint head-scratching about what to do
with cyberspace.

It started in February 1995 in Brussels, at a meeting called the "G-7
Ministerial Conference on the Information Society." There the telecom
honchos from G-7 nations and several smaller countries gathered to chat
about online copyright, cultural pollution, universal access, free
speech, and encryption policies.

At least the principles were lofty. "While the rhetoric of the
conference was progressive, there was no serious discussion of free
expression or other human rights concerns," wrote one American who
attended the conference.

Instead, the G-7 nations said they were considering how to deal with
inappropriate material on the 'net. Canada reminded the other countries
that it wasn't as permissive as the U.S. in dealing with
"hate-mongering materials," saying that when such publications appear
online "they are much easier to obtain but are more difficult to
monitor and take action against." The European Union decried copyright
pirates: "Some form of international cooperation is necessary to
supplement the existing legal systems governing intellectual property
rights." Saying the 'net is "not without risks," France stressed that
cyberspace "must not result in a standardization in content, or a
leveling of cultures."

Only Vice President Al Gore tossed a bone to cyber-rights advocates.
"[Cyberspace] is about protecting and enlarging freedom of expression
for all our citizens... Ideas should not be checked at the border,"
said Gore.

Gore didn't do this in a vacuum. "Our big victory at Brussels was that
we pressured them enough so that Al Gore in his keynote address made a
big point of stressing the importance of free speech on the Internet,"
says Ann Beeson of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Beeson should know -- she's been one of the few cybersavvy activists
who has been fighting globally for an unshackled Internet. Now a
principal attorney on the ACLU's legal team challenging the
Communications Decency Act, Beeson previously worked at Human Rights
Watch and crafted a letter the group sent to Gore before the Brussels
conference. Citing Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, it said: "Everyone has the right... to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Unfortunately, the only G-7 voices supporting this today are a silent
chorus.

The G-7 information ministers met again in South Africa in May 1996 and
plan to meet in Egypt later this year, but no international
'net-advocacy group has been tracking the proposals discussed at the
meetings. U.S. cyberliberty groups have been preoccupied with the CDA
battle, and they have no international counterparts.

That's finally about to change. Two global 'net-alliances are emerging
and have held their initial planning meetings at Internet conferences
this summer in Canada.

The ACLU co-founded one group, called the Global Internet Liberty
Campaign. "We have to face the fact that while ultimately it's
extraordinarily difficult for governments to control the 'net, they're
going to try," says Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.
"The best thing that governments can do is to stay out if it."

Not so, says Bruce Taylor, the chief architect of the CDA and a
professional cyber-scaremonger. The former Federal porn-prosecutor
believes that "not all censorship is bad."

"Foreign countries have an obligation to restrict obscenity and child
pornography on the Internet by the treaty of 1911," says Taylor. "It's
an agreement between the states to cooperate and to use international
laws to prosecute obscenity." And to Taylor, books and copies of
Penthouse magazine can be obscene.

FUTURE REGULATIONS

David Post is a likeable, bearded fellow who once studied yellow
babboons in Kenya and wears tennis shoes with his suits. Now the
co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute, Post is one of the
few lawyers who's made a serious study of the international
evolution of the 'net.

To Post, the 'net is at a fork in its development: the two paths are
self-regulation or an international government crackdown.

"It's the central problem the 'net faces today," says Post. "How does
it relieve itself of the conflicting claims of soverigns whose power is
based on geographical boundaries -- something the 'net doesn't
recognize?"

Eric Freedman, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra Law School, is
anything but optimistic. Freedman remembers how governments already
have crafted a complex constellation of little-known treaties and
agreements governing everything from satellite placement to the world
banking system and postal services.

"I'm worried that the governments are ahead of us," says Freedman.
"There's a humongous potential to get absolutely screwed here... If 100
countries agreed on this, they could get this done in a week. It's
easier for them to coordinate, agree, and implement than it is for us
to stop them from doing so."

That's why the ACLU/American Library Association lawsuit challenging
the CDA is vital. If the Supreme Court upholds the law, Congress and
the White House can craft international "decency" agreements for
cyberspace. But if the high court slams the law as unconstitutional,
Clinton would be barred from signing a CDA-type treaty. "It's a
principle of constitutional law that any treaty has to conform to the
Constitution," says Freedman.

A victory in the CDA case would, in a sense, turn the U.S. into a safe
haven for controversial content from all over the world.

Freedman urges 'netizens in every country to launch similar fights
against government 'net-censorship. "Win as many national victories as
possible to get ahead of the governments of the world," he says. "If
the German or Australian supreme courts were to rule that freedom of
speech principles apply to the 'net as they do to a newspaper, that
would be very helpful."

In the near future, that's the best way to forestall the world
information order. The first time a country proposes such a formal
treaty, it has to die from lack of support.

But pressure to regulate the 'net will always exist, and a new way of
looking at cyberspace may have to emerge. Some precedents exist.
Maritime law, for example, says that no single nation has jurisdiction
over the oceans. Medieval Europe recognized a separate law for
merchants that had its own judicial system. Antarctica is not governed
by any single country's laws. The Catholic Church is a multinational
institution that largely rules itself.

The Cyberspace Law Institute's Post argues for this model. "We should
treat cyberspace as a distinct location and allow our own distinct
legal and moral systems to evolve," he says.

He's right. As the 'net matures, no other solution will work.

Daniel Defoe described governments locking citizen inside their homes,
to no avail: "It was impossible for one man so to guard all the
passages as to prevent the escape of people made desperate... And that
which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the
infection farther."

The infection cyberspace spreads today is far more virulent than the
bubonic plague. Anathema to government, the 'net carries the virus of
freedom.

Look Rich, I have listened to your lies and rhetoric for long enough.

Please point to a single URL on my website where there is "anti-semetic

While your at it, please point to some URLs that you consider "obvious

BTW, are you still claiming on your website that Ernst Zundel has complete
control over my "cd making" operations and my now censored Pathway

If you believe that, you need look no further than the mirror to find a

In fairness to Marc, I should explain that the Grant Bristow he was talking
about was a government informant. The point of his affidavit was to say he
was set up. You really need to read the whole SIRC report, and all of the
rebuttals on Zundel's web page, the counter-rebuttals on Nizkor, and all of
the press reports if you want to have the foggiest idea what is going on. It
wouldn't bother me one bit if you didn't care to do that, but it would bug
me if you presumed to pass judgement without doing that.

Since we're obviously not going to do that on this list, forget the larger
issues. They do not concern fight-censorship.

&gt; Rich's point is well put, to me.  It's wrong to censor Lemire, and the
&gt; attempts tro censor him should be exposed.  But people should also be aware
&gt; of who he is and what he represents.  I'm guessing that the SWC Canada is
&gt; well aware of Lemire's extracurricular activities, and that those activities
&gt; are at least part of the reason they have tried to silence him.  Whether
&gt; that's right or not (I think not), it's important to understand, IMHO.

Actually, I disagree. Unless you happen to live in Toronto, or to be Jewish,
I see no particular reason to be interested in the larger issues. You can't
expect us as free-speech activists to investigate the background of every
censorship victim.

My point was that absent a THOROUGH investigation, which one usually cannot
do, it is improper to comment on the merits of a particular site, or even to
characterize it in any but the most general terms. 

Wiesenthal Center-Canada (not sure of the position of the US org) wants to
shut down the web site of a political opponent. Wearing our free-speech
activist hat, we can say that that is wrong. But that's all we should say
without donning another hat. 

I apologize to Marc and Declan for bringing in other issues. Backlashes
breed more backlashes. If you're interested in my opinion of and experiences
with Marc, I'd be more than happy to talk to you off the list, but my point
is precisely that such extraneous discussions, for or against any viewpoint,
do not concern fight-censorship.

Some conflicts that hit the internet censorship scene verge on actual
warfare. The Zambia newspaper case, the Basque separatist web site, and this
case are viewed by their participants as real battles. The Wiesenthal Center
probably sees its battle with neo-Nazis as a covert war, and vice versa --
and rightfully so. I know people on both sides who have "gone underground," 
at considerable risk to life and limb. The role of a free-speech/peace
activist in such a situation is to enforce the "rules of war," and try to
foster real discussion. I don't think the Nazis should be excluded from the
political system; I see no reason to wage war on them. Obviously, the
Wiesenthal Center (and a few other groups, but not the ADL or Nizkor)
disagrees. 

[An extreme case to ponder: When the UN coalition bombed and jammed the
Iraqi communications infrastructure, was that censorship? That's how Lemire 
and certain people in the Wiesenthal Center view this "battle."]

&gt;From: jaed@best.com (Jeanne A. E. DeVoto)
&gt;Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
&gt;generalized libertarian baiting. 

	Is it the place for trolls and generalized Libertarian ranting?

&gt; I for one would appreciate it if you'd knock it off in this forum; 

	Similarly, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to hear the
"Libertarian" view of the proper use of the word censorship over and over
again. But given that it's inevitable that that happens, and I think
it's distracting and politically annoying, what do you suggest I do?
Keep silent about it?

&gt; distortions, insults, and amateur psychoanalysis are not only not
&gt; helpful, they're actively harmful in sidetracking discussion and
&gt; creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one another.

	I think the rifts and ugly feelings are created initially by the
harsh criticism of the person holding a non-Libertarian view. I think if
you'll examine the record of this thread, you'll see that's the history.

&gt;If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
&gt;something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
&gt;after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please

	??? I cannot imagine how you can say this. Let's take it to e-mail.

&gt;do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list.
&gt;Thank you.

	To be frank, I think very little of Libertarianism as a
political philosophy.  But more importantly, and somewhat relevant to
this list, I've come to believe that the habits of thought it engenders
are downright harmful, that they tend to keep people from thinking
effectively about the real world - which is a very complicated mix of
government, business, social customs, and so on, all interacting with
each other. In fact, I just wrote a long article where these very points
took up much of the space. Check out, at the Ethical Spectacle webzine,
(http://www.spectacle.org/)
   Linkname: Internet Blocking Programs and Privatized Censorship
        URL: http://www.spectacle.org/896/finkel.html

	Thus, I very much want to argue against such a worldview. I
don't view this as "flamebaiting", but as "political argument" (although
I am rough at times, but this is somewhat in anticipation of stock stuff
like being called a thief and a Stalinist). Given this background, what
are your suggestions as to what should be done?

 [None of the below is really on-topic for fight-censorship, but because
 Lemire posed specific questions here, I'll answer them here. 

 As far as the topic of fight-censorship goes, Marc Lemire strongly
 disagrees with Sol Littman's campaign to shut down his web site, and so do
 the Nizkor folks and I. Obviously, we disagree concerning the value and
 importance of the content of Mr. Lemire's web pages, but that's a matter of
 free speech -- in other, more appropriate forums.

 forte, and I'm too busy with other things.]

I don't believe I ever claimed either of those. I did say "Zundel's

I apologize for getting the chronology backwards. Your friend Wolfgang

     The rather extended arugument over this mailing list concerning
     the Liberarian view of free speech has been extremely informative
     for me. I never felt that there was flaming involved, just heated
     discussion, which is often the best way to learn for the
     observer of an argument, because the participants are throwing
     thier best shots.
     From being a nominal supporter of Libertarian views, I have grown
     increasingly aware of the dangers involved in that position. It
     is entirely possible that another subcscriber to this list has
     been pulled in exactly the opposite direction, but hey, that's

Perhaps I should add - a great, pithy response that, like all pithy
statements, needs a great number of auxiliary premises and background in
order to work.  The vast majority of newsgroups are not moderated - they
are a form of expression open to all.  The question is: are citizens
subject to prior restraint or chilling effect censorship when they try to
post to these newsgroups?  If so, they're not being "moderated" - they're
being censored!

But I acknowledge - the difference between content selection and
censorship *can* get a little hazy.  Fortunately, current government
censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Yes, things can get hazy even with selection of articles for academic
journals get a bit hazy.  Complaints that journals are favouring
certain kinds of approaches over others, or some people (or countries)
over others are not uncommon.  Of course whoever owns a journal is
entitled to print what they like (?), but the problem is that some
journals have a status due to external forces (ie they are included in
citation listings, or libraries subscribe to them).  Censorship is
definitely a possibility when this is the case.  (It's all very well
being able to publish on the Internet, but if your job prospects depend
on publication in certain journals it doesn't help much.)

&gt;Fortunately, current government
&gt;censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Indeed.

Danny.

(1) CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS PROPOSE SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORISM
    INITIATIVES

In the wake of the recent bombing at the Olympics and the suspected
terrorist involvement in the TWA crash, the Clinton Administration and
members of Congress are proposing a set of sweeping counter-terrorism
initiatives. If enacted into law, these proposals will dramatically
increase law enforcement surveillance authority over the Internet and other
advanced communications technologies. An outline of the Administration's
proposal was circulated on Capitol Hill on Monday July 29.

President Clinton has urged Congress to pass new counter-terrorism
legislation before the Congressional recess at the end of this week.  While
several prominent Republican members of Congress, including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), have said publicly that Congress should not rush into
any new counter-terrorism legislation, most observers believe there is a
strong possibility that some or all of the Administration's proposal will
be enacted before the August recess.

The draft proposal contains several measures which were rejected by
Congress as part of the previous counter-terrorism initiative proposed
last year after the Oklahoma City bombing, as well as several new measures
including as-yet unspecified changes to U.S. encryption policy and funding
for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a.
Digital Telephony).

CDT is concerned that the latest counter-terrorism efforts on Capitol Hill
are occurring without appropriate deliberation.  Major policy decisions
expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement should not be made
without careful consideration of the necessity of such proposals and the
relative benefit to society. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work
with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to
ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet
are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
________________________________________________________________________

MAJOR POINTS OF THE COUNTER-TERRORISM PROPOSALS CIRCULATING ON THE HILL

The administration's new counter-terrorism initiative and other amendments
circulating this week in Congress contain numerous provisions, but four
are of particular concern to the net.community:

* New Threats to Encryption, Opposition to the Pro-CODE Bill
* Funding for Digital Telephony Without Public Accountability
* Amendment to Criminalize 'Bomb-Making' Information on the Internet
* Expanded Authority for Multi-Point, "Roving" Wiretaps

The full text of the Administration's proposal and background information
are available at CDT's counter-terrorism Web Page:

    http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/

       --------------------------------------------------------

I. NEW THREATS TO ENCRYPTION, OPPOSITION TO THE PRO-CODE BILL

The Administration's outline contains the following statement on encryption:

 "* Encryption -- We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement.  We oppose legislation that would eliminate
    current export barriers and encouraging the proliferation of encryption
    which blocks appropriate access to protect public safety and the
    national security."

While no specific legislative language has yet been proposed, this
represents the first statement by the Administration that they will seek
legislation to further restrict encryption.  Even more troubling, the
Administration is clearly attempting to use the recent suspected terrorist
incidents to push for a new and more restrictive encryption policy.

This new proposal comes as Congress is finally beginning to seriously
consider major changes in U.S. encryption policy. Bipartisan legislation
in both the House and Senate to relax encryption export controls is gaining
momentum.  The Senate Commerce Committee has held 3 hearings in the last 6
weeks, and is preparing to vote to send the Burns/Leahy "Pro-CODE" bill (S.
1726) to the floor of the Senate.  The Administration's attempt to leverage
the public's concern about terrorism to block passage of the Pro-CODE bill
is disturbing, and poses a significant threat to privacy and security on the
Internet.

CDT is working with members of Congress, privacy advocates, and the
communications and computer industries to oppose any attempt by the
Administration to impose new restrictions on encryption, and we continue to
work to move the bipartisan export relief legislation through Congress.

       --------------------------------------------------------

II. FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

The Administration is also seeking to override the public accountability
provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA
- a.k.a. 'Digital Telephony') by providing a funding for the law in a way
that prevents public oversight of the FBI's surveillance ability.

Enacted in October of 1994, granted law enforcement new authority to
influence the design of telecommunications networks (the Internet,
Commercial online services, and BBS's were exempted) in order to preserve
their ability to conduct court authorized electronic surveillance.

Congress balanced this new authority with a number of mechanisms to ensure
public accountability over law enforcement surveillance ability.
While complicated, the public accountability mechanisms are designed to
work as follows:

* Law enforcement provides telecommunications carriers, the Congress,
  and the public with notice of its surveillance capacity needs (i.e.,
  the number of simultaneous wiretaps in a given geographic location)
  with an opportunity for public comment.

* Based on an assessment of the reasonableness of the law enforcement
  surveillance capacity request, Congress appropriates money to cover
  the cost of modifications.  If Congress does not believe law
  enforcement has adequately justified its request, money will not be
  appropriated.

* Telecommunications carriers are not obligated to comply with the
  statute or make any capacity modifications without government
  reimbursement.

In October 1995, the FBI published its first notice of surveillance
capacity (see CDT Policy Post Vol. 1, No. 26).  The telecommunications
industry and privacy advocates used the public accountability provisions of
CALEA to respond to the FBI's request and argued that the FBI had not
adequately justified the extensive surveillance capability contained in the
request.  As a result, Congress has not yet appropriated funds and no
modifications have been made.

The FBI clearly believes that the public accountability provisions of CALEA
are working **too well**, and appears to be using the recent focus on
terrorism to push for a new funding mechanism which does not contain public
oversight.

CDT is fighting hard to ensure that the public accountability provisions of
CALEA, which have until now prevented the FBI from acquiring unnecessary
surveillance capacity, remain a part of the law, and will vigorously oppose
any effort by the FBI and the Clinton Administration to remove the last
opportunity for public oversight over law enforcement power.

       --------------------------------------------------------

III. THE AVAILABILITY OF 'BOMB-MAKING' INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has reintroduced an amendment to make it
illegal to disseminate information on how to construct explosives knowing
that the information will be used in furtherance of a federal crime.  The
amendment was adopted by the Senate earlier this month as part of a
Department of Defense Appropriations bill.  CDT believes that the vague
provisions of the Feinstein amendment could have a chilling effect on online
speech, needlessly duplicate existing criminal statutes, and should be
removed.

Feinstein first proposed the amendment as part of the 1995
counter-terrorism bill. The initial Feinstein amendment was extremely broad
and would have resulted in a flat ban on certain constitutionally protected
speech online.  After civil liberties advocates objected, Feinstein
narrowed her amendment substantially, although it was ultimately dropped
from the final terrorism bill signed in April 1996.

       --------------------------------------------------------

IV.  EXPANDED WIRETAP AUTHORITY

The Administration's proposal would also significantly expand current
wiretapping authority to allow multi-point (or "roving") wiretaps. This
would dramatically change surveillance authority to include wiretaps of
INDIVIDUALS instead of LOCATIONS.

This proposal would do away with the delicate balance between privacy and
law enforcement that Congress has struck over 30 years of wiretapping
legislation. Federal law has always required that wiretaps issue for a
specific location, to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. In 1986 Congress
introduced a narrow exception to this rule, only for cases where it could
be shown that the target was intentionally evading wiretaps by changing
facilities. The Administration proposal would completely remove this
standard, allowing so-called "roving taps" for any persons whose behavior
makes wiretapping difficult for law enforcement.

The administration proposed similar provisions in the spring of 1995 in the
wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. These provisions proved controversial in
Congress and were dropped from the final bill.

&gt;&gt; *require* the operators of web servers to post any materials submitted ...
&gt;
&gt;	There's a whole range of actions that could take place that don't
&gt;*require* anything. The fact that this is an immediate, knee-jerk
&gt;reaction along the same lines, now yet another person, says something
&gt;very significant. As I said, it's a real mental tick. Anytime something
&gt;negative is said about private action, bang, are-you-proposing-to-compel...

But Seth, I think the line must be drawn clearly between public and private.
I don't know that it's 'kneejerk' to make that distinction.

&gt;	We could begin by not having this immediate flaming at the
&gt;critic whenever a business is criticized. Bad publicity can have a very
&gt;potent effect on private conduct, but actions are less likely to be
&gt;changed if any complainant seeking assistance has to pass through a gauntlet
&gt;of "business is holy, how dare you question it".

You certainly won't get that from me. However, when you're discussing an
issue of possible non-government censorship, I think the strategies for
handling differ (as you imply below). Again, the line between public and
private is important, because when you're in the public context of
government & court enforcement, you have force rather than volition, as you
would have in a private context. I'm not behind a libertarian critique of
government enforcement as an inherent evil, but I would certainly agree that
force should be used judiciously, minimally, and would not apply to a
process of selection in a private context that one might construe as censorship.

&gt;	The typical tactics of influencing business are publicity
&gt;campaigns and boycotts. Boycotts are sometimes criticized themselves,
&gt;but for the scope of this discussion, I'll just point out that they are
&gt;a type of private action that doesn't require any government
&gt;intervention, We've got to get past the idea that business conduct can't
&gt;be opposed, and the immediate leap into absurdity at the very thought is
&gt;a symptom of how deeply this blindness is rooted.

Agreed. If, for instance, you think that AOL is committing egregious acts of
censorship and exclusion, drop your AOL account, fuss at/about AOL, but
don't seek government involvement or court resolution.

thx
Jon

And it would be useful to get a good working definition of censorship that

For the sake of brevity, I will not quote Jon's reply to Seth's post.

Jon makes the valid point, which I'm sure Seth agrees with, that different
responses are appropriate for state and private censorship.  Most
importantly, when dealing with private censorship, one must not run to the
government for help.  If NBC suppresses a story critical of GE (its
owner), than the public has been denied access to important information.
But if we ask the government to dictate to NBC what they can and cannot
broadcast, then we trample upon the First Amendment.  The First Amendment
_protects_ private censorship (providing no other laws are broken).  Thus
when we respond to private censorship, we must respect the First Amendment
rights of the censors.  We can publicize the censorship incident, write
letters of protest, boycott, etc.  But  we must not involve the state in
regulating speech.

Cheers,
Bob

You're right, of course.  These are muddy waters, to say the least, and I
should have dome more research before passing any judgement.

I will look at the sources you have recommended.

Thanks :)

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

	         CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
	              NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

	SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

	Dear _________,

	Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
	I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
	considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

	Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use
the tragic events in Atlanta and New York to erode the basic rights of
citizens.

The Global Internet Liberty Coalition (GILC) said that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the
Internet.  GLIC urged users of the Internet to oppose legislative
measures that could restrict the free flow of information or limit the
ability of citizens to engage in private communication.

Members of GILC include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Human Rights Watch
(HRW), the Internet Society (ISOC), Privacy International (PI), and
other organizations.

The GILC was formed in June at the annual meeting of the Internet
Society in Montreal. A temporary web page for the Global Internet
Liberty Campaign has been established at:

   http://www.aclu.org/gilc/index1.html.

A permanent home for GILC will soon be established at

=======================================================================
[2] #005#New Domestic Surveillance Provisions Proposed
=======================================================================

In the wake of the recent tragedies in Atlanta and New York, the White
House and the FBI are again calling for new federal powers to expand
wiretapping authority, even in the absence of any evidence that
inability to wiretap led to the two tragedies.  The provisions were
originally introduced as part of the counterterrorism bill but were
struck out after objection from a coalition of liberal and
conservative groups.

The White House is trying to rush the proposal through Congress this
week before the August recess.

The new measure would allow prosecutors to use of "roving wiretaps."
The Administration proposal would allow prosecutors to tap multiple
telephones in an area if they suspect that the target in switching
phones. Other recommendations include allowing for 48 hour warrantless
"emergency" wiretaps, easier access to consumer records including
phone and travel records, and restrictions on the use of encryption.

Several members of Congress were critical of the proposal. Rep. Bob
Barr (R-GA) told CNN that the proposals created "vast powers" and that
there was "no case for emergency wiretaps and roving wiretaps." Rep.
Ike Skelton (D-MO) called for greater human intelligence noting that
law enforcement and intelligence agencies "seem to rely too much on
technology". Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and others met with
President Clinton on July 29, after which Gingrich expressed tentative
support for the proposals.

The American public also remains divided on the desirability of giving
federal law enforcement new wiretapping authority. In a USA
Today/CNN/Gallop poll taken July 29, 50 percent of those polled said
that "[i]ncreasing surveillance of U.S. citizens by the government"
was "going too far." According to the poll, 45 percent supported the
measures and five percent were undecided. The New York times
editorialized on June 30 that "the proposal to expand the Government's
wiretapping authority is excessive."

A House/Senate conference committee meeting on the Defense
Appropriations bill is also reviewing a provision introduced by
Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) that would ban the dissemination of
bomb-related information on the Internet. This provision had also been
rejected in the counterterrorism bill on First Amendment grounds.

More information on wiretapping is available from:

    http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/

=======================================================================
[3]  Digital Telephony Funding Approved by House
=======================================================================

The House of Representatives approved on July 25 funding for the
Justice Department that includes a provision to fund the "digital
telephony" bill.

The bill would establish a permanent "Telecommunications Carrier
Compliance Fund" with contributions from "any agency of the United
States with law enforcement or intelligence responsibilities". Thus
agencies such as the CIA and NSA, with their secret "black budgets"
will be able to fund the wiretap program without public oversight. A
previous draft of the bill had also allowed agencies with "national
security" roles to contribute.

Funding for the proposal was rejected in two earlier attempts: the FY
1996 appropriations bill and the 1996 counter-terrorism bill. It now
goes to the Senate where advocates will attempt to remove the funding
provision.

A copy of the House bill and more information on wiretapping is
available from:

=======================================================================
[4] Another Court Enjoins CDA
=======================================================================

Another federal court has ruled that the Communications Decency Act is
unconstitutional and has prohibited its enforcement.  This follows the
decision earlier this month by a federal court in Pennsylvania
striking down two provisions in a case brought by the ACLU, EPIC, ALA
and others.

In this case, Joe Shea, editor of the American Reporter an online
newspaper, challenged the CDA in US District in New York city. Shea
published an "indecent" article by Judge Steve Matthews, a Texas state
judge and law professor, and then challenged the CDA.

The court ruled that the section prohibiting the dissemination of
"indecent" speech was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and
affected protected speech between adults. The court also found that
presently there was no practical way to block the material using
currently available blocking software and thus the affirmative defense
were not adequate to save the law: "there is no persuasive evidence
that a substantial proportion of Internet content providers can make
available material potentially within the scope of the CDA without
fear of prosecution and criminal liability."

Unlike the ACLU case, however, the court rejected the challenge to the
CDA as being overly vague. It ruled that there was substantial case
law available on what was "indecent" that has been upheld by the
courts. It also rejected the assertion that because of the global
nature of the Internet, online providers could not be expected to know
what was indecent everywhere:

   "We have no basis for concluding that Internet content providers are
   any less capable than those subject to obscenity laws or other
   indecency restrictions to acquire a general familiarity with the
   relevant standards; indeed, one might conclude that a content
   provider's contact with others around the country and around the world
   through interactive computer services would cultivate a heightened
   awareness of regional and cultural differences."

The US Justice Department has twenty days to appeal this decision to the
US Supreme Court. DOJ has already filed a petition for appealing the
Pennsylvania case to the Court, which will hear it in its fall session.

In a case raising similar issues brought before a French court, the French
Conseil Constitutionnel on July 24 struck down a recently enacted French
law Internet censorship law known as the "Fillon amendment". The court
ruled that placing Internet regulations under the control of the Conseil
Superieur de l'Audiovisuel and requiring Internet service providers to
take the advice of the CSA was a violation of free speech rights.

[5] Congressional Hearing Critical of US Crypto Policy
=======================================================================

Senators at the July 25 hearing of the Commerce Committee on S. 1726, the
PRO-Code legislation were openly critical of current US policy on
cryptography.  Senators Burns, Pressler, Ashcroft openly questioned the
viability of key escrow and the effects of export controls on American
business.

The first panel of the hearing included FBI Director Louis Freeh, William
Reinch, Undersectrary of the Bureau of Export Administration for the US
Department of Commerce, and William Crowell, Deputy Director of the
National Security Agency. The panelists opposed S. 1726 and supported the
implementation of an international key escrow system. Freeh claimed that
five percent of all cases show evidence of cryptography.

Many of the Senators were openly critical of the current export controls
and the viability of creating a comprehensive international key escrow
system. Senator Pressler held up a copy of Applied Cryptography and a disk
and described the restrictions on the disk as "somewhat absurd." Sen. Ron
Wyden noted "The terrorists and drug merchants of the 21st century are not
going to be encryption simpletons."  Senator Burns described the
international key escrow system as a "pipe dream." When Undersecretary
Reinsch claimed that "there's a very clear commercial interest in having
hardware and/or software with a back door" to prevent a "electronic tower
of Babel", Senator Ashcroft forced him to admit that the only real use
would be for government access and then questioned the Constitutionality of
the proposal and invoked the Filegate incident as an example of the
potential abuses.

Under questioning by Senator Burns, FBI Director Louis Freeh acknowledged
that if the current "voluntary" policy failed, he would seek mandatory
domestic controls on cryptography. Freeh told the Committee:

  I don't think I'm at that point yet.  I believe that the policy
  that is enunciated here is a doable policy, but there could come a
  point where that policy, the voluntary policy, is not a viable
  one.  And then I would certainly look at more mandatory controls.
  Not that that might work, but backing up my position that's where
  ultimately I would be.

A second panel was made up of industry representatives who supported S.
1726. James Barkesdale of Netscape Communications testified that his
company has lost 30 percent of its business to foreign competitors who have
stronger security systems. He described the Clipper III proposal as "most
massive computer infrastructure on the planet . . . beyond belief." Ron
Pieper of Tandem Computers described the key escrow system as "an absolute
show stopper" for electronic commerce.

The bill may now be considered by the Commerce Committee this week and then
sent to the full Senate for a vote in September after the Congressional
recess. More information, including Freeh's written testimony, is available

ELECTRONIC FRONTIER CANADA (EFC) --- PRESS RELEASE
(For immediate release --- Thursday, August 1, 1996
---------------------------------------------------


   BC teenager takes on BC government in bold free speech battle


A 15-year-old boy in Smithers, BC, says he will be "mirroring" the
controversial web pages that had prompted the BC Attorney General
to call for controls on the flow of "hate" through the Internet.

Frank Sayre, who acts as webmaster for the `Canuck Soup' web pages says,
"I decided to mirror the `Freedom Site' because of B.C.'s misguided
attempt to censor the Internet".

"I do not agree with the Freedom Site's content," he continues,
"but I do agree that they have a fundamental right to express
their political opinions, both on and off the Internet."

"The B.C. government has no experience or understanding of cyberspace,
... nor does it have any right to censor or suppress legal expression,
even if it's on a web site," says the young cyber-activist.

Sayre says he's encouraging other like-minded individuals to help him
make his point by setting up their own "mirror sites" -- something he's
facilitated by packaging up the information into a downloadable
"ZIP file" that his web pages boasts will enable anyone to
"Set up your own Freedom-Site in 5 minutes or less!"

"It's a controversial approach," admits David Jones, president of
Electronic Frontier Canada, who recalls that a similar tactic was
successful earlier this year in getting Germany's Deutsche Telekom
to back down when it started blocking access to Ernst Zundel's web
pages based in southern California.

Although Electronic Frontier Canada is a staunch defender of free speech
in cyberspace, the organization won't be setting up a mirror site of
its own.  "I want to be clear that we don't endorse the views expressed
in any of these so-called `hate' web pages," says Jeffrey Shallit,
EFC vice-president, acknowledging that many Canadians find them
offensive and distasteful.

"We do agree, however, that attempts to censor web pages are pointless
and misguided.  First, attempts at censorship just give more media
attention to these people, who desperately crave attention, and second,
the end result tends to be that the information gets copied around
the Internet to these mirror sites -- which can hardly be considered
an improvement."

Both Shallit and Sayre make reference to the approach advocated by
US Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas: "The way to combat noxious
ideas is with other ideas.  The way to combat falsehood is with truth."
(from 1958 interview with Mike Wallace)

The Nizkor Project, run by B.C.'s own Ken McVay, is a notable example
of this approach.

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

                 CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
                      NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use

Free speech isn't only for those with dangerous ideas; privacy isn't just
for suspected criminals.

As Internet users, we all have a stake in standing up for free speech *and*
privacy.

With your indulgence, I'm passing along an important alert regarding
several telecommunications surveillance proposals that Congress may
adopt... perhaps as soon as FRIDAY.

If you can, please call Congress on Friday to insist that our legislators
carefully consider the privacy implivations of any proposal to expland the
FBI's wiretap authority.  Your call can make a very big difference.

Full details follow below.

Work the network!

You mean like taking Princeton to New Jersey State court for its efforts

Thank you for calling attention to the need for clarification.  By running to
the government to help I meant asking the government to intervene in a way
contrary to the First Amendment--e.g. by forcing a newspaper to print something
it does not want to print.  Using the courts is a  perfectly valid way of asking the 
government for help in cases where private institutions are trampling on the First 
Amendment rights of others.  If I didn't believe in the appropriateness of using
the courts, I never would have involved the National Writers Union as a plaintiff
in the suit to invalidate the CDA.  (Granted, this is a case of state censorship.)

Anyway, my original message certainly left me open to misinterpretation.  Forgive
my sloppiness and thank you for calling this to my attention.

Cheers,
Bob

*  CYBER-LIBERTIES ALERT: Anti-Terrorism Measure Threatens Net Liberty 
 
The latest understanding from ACLU's legislative representatives is that
the "Anti Terrorism" bill that is expected to be acted on today and
tomorrow will include government controls on encryption -- a scheme for key
escrow of private keys for encryption. It is also likely to include
expanded use of wiretapping without a Court order. 
 
There is absolutely no evidence at this time to show that either the TWA
tragedy or the Olympic Park bombing could have been prevented or any crimes
solved by increased government power to control the use of encryption or to
wiretap.  
 
Please call your Congress member and Senators immediately and ask them to
oppose these measures.

* Congress Attacks Our Medical Privacy 
 
The House-Senate Conference Committee has reported out H.R. 3103, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill. The U.S. House conferees pushed
for and achieved the inclusion of their deceptively-labeled "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments (which were not in the Senate's
version). The bill is scheduled to go to the House floor for a vote today,
and to the Senate floor for a vote tomorrow.  It then would still require
the President's signature. 
 
With "Administrative Simplification" and its related amendments included,
this bill is profoundly destructive to the Medical Privacy Rights of each
and every person in the United States. 
 
Specifically: 
 
1.)  Medical Records will be computerized in vast databases run by the
government and/or large corporations, including consumer credit reporting
companies whose problems with both privacy and accuracy are
well-documented. 
 
This will create, without any consent or control by patients (all of us), a
COMPUTERIZED "LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OF OUR MEDICAL RECORDS. Just as the
Social Security Administration and the U.S. military can't protect their
computers from unauthorized access, so too the new Medical Records "Lending
Library" will not be secure. 
 
2.)  Each of us will have a "UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFIER" NUMBER assigned to
us by the government, and the government will force this number to be used
in connection with any and all health care. 
 
3.) Although the bill does not formally preempt state laws protecting our
medical privacy, it establishes a structure and creates conditions that
will make it unlikely for such state laws to survive. 
 
IF YOU VALUE YOUR MEDICAL PRIVACY, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. 
 
Call your own U.S. Senators (202-224-3121) and U.S. Representative
(202-225-3121) and tell them to "KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY MEDICAL RECORDS". 
 
Urge your Representative and Senators to oppose passing any Health Care
bill that violates our medical privacy by having "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments.  Tell them to SEND IT BACK TO THE
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, and to JUST SAY NO TO "ADMINISTRATIVE
SIMPLIFICATION." 
 
You can also reach the Capital Switchboard at 1-800-962-3524. 
 
----- 
 
For your convenience, we supply the following talking points: 
 
H.R. 3103 (the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill) should be opposed
because it includes the deceptively labeled "administrative simplification"
section and its related provisions. 
 
For example: 
 
1. The bill would give government and corporations access to confidential
medical information about individuals without their consent.  Violating the
privacy of medical patients is very unpopular.  The Time/CNN Poll found
that 87% of Americans "believe patients should be asked for permission
every time any information about them is used." (Time, May 6, 1996, p. 61) 
 
2. The bill creates the framework for a national medical data collection
and data transfer system, beginning with claims and billing data and
proceeding to the entire medical record.  The system will include data
processing clearinghouses, which may also serve as repositories for data. 
This would create, without any consent or control by the patient, a
"COMPUTERIZED LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OUR MEDICAL RECORDS, vulnerable to
being accessed by unauthorized unsuitable parties. 
 
3. The bill has THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING A UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFICATION
NUMBER UPON EVERY PATIENT, health provider, health plan, and employer,
thereby establishing a vast, bureaucracy-dictated, national ID regime, with
the new government numbers being the key to everyone's private Medical
Records. 
 
4. The bill gives new powers and duties to the National Committee on Vital
and Health Statistics, authorizing extensive new statistical studies,
including "health status" studies.  These studies no doubt will make use of
the large stores of individually identified medical information which will
now be easily obtainable (especially by this committee; see what follows). 
 
5. The bill has the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
advising the Secretary of HHS on privacy regulations, a responsibility in
conflict with its duties of data collection and analysis.  The committee,
which will be composed largely of statisticians, epidemiologists, health
services researchers and experts on computerized medical information
systems, is ill suited for protecting the patient's right to privacy and
medical record confidentiality. 
 
6. The bill will undercut state laws that protect medical privacy. 
 
HR 3103 should be rejected so long as it includes any "administrative
simplification" or related provisions. Such provisions cannot be fixed;
they must be deleted from the bill.

* ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace; New
Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats 
 
NEW YORK:  Despite a second federal court decision affirming that
censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today warned of
persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and internationally, to censor
electronic communications and regulate privacy technology. 
 
At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known as "G-7,"
government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate the Internet and
other electronic communications in an effort to 
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing incident at
the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight 800, which is being
investigated as a possible terrorist bombing. Participants included France,
Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany, Canada, Russia and the United States.  
 
Although not all details were made public, proposed measures apparently
include investigations of charities and political organizations with
radical political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech
-- and using the Internet to "monitor" terrorist communications.  There was
also agreement to adopt a U.S. plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed
encryption, which would mean that individuals and companies would be barred
from using encryption technology to electronically lock up their most
private and sensitive information unless they make the keys available to
their government.   
 
In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and electronic
privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed last month at a
meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal. [See the GILC release below.] 
The group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition with
organizations from around the world to share information and protect free
speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the global Internet. 
GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
Human Rights Watch, the Internet Society, Privacy International, and other
civil liberties and human rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding
member of the group. 
 
"GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and that decisions
made by international bodies like the G-7 nations affect all Internet
users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.  "The U.S.
government may not accomplish through an international end-run what the
U.S. Congress and the U.S. Courts have rejected." 
 
Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges in New York
declaring that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional.  The decision
marked another win in the ongoing battle for free speech in cyberspace,
which saw its first major victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a
Philadelphia court granted a motion for preliminary injunction on
"indecency" provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed
its challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed into
law. 
 
"We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their Philadelphia
colleagues in protecting the Internet from governmental intrusion," said
Steinhardt, who testified in the Philadelphia case.  "But we remain
concerned about the government's continuing efforts to censor electronic
speech, not only in the United States but internationally." 
 
In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal that would
make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-making in print, radio,
television or in cyberspace.   Violations would be punishable by up to 20
years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. 
 
"This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last year, would
criminalize everything from a high school chemistry teacher explaining
basic scientific principles, to a newspaper carrying an illustration of a
bomb's construction, to a U.S. Department of Agriculture manual describing
how to make fertilizer bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's
Steinhardt said. 
 
In addition, President Clinton this week announced an initiative to
increase the powers of federal investigators, including an expanded
wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has commended the Clinton
Administration and law enforcement authorities for their investigation into
recent tragic incidents, it urged President Clinton and Congress in a
letter sent to the White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit"
by safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss continuing
civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

Campaign has been established at &lt;http://www.aclu.org/gilc/index1.html&gt;.

*  GILC Opposes Efforts to Regulate Internet; Group Calls G-7 Efforts
Anti-Democratic 
 
The Global Internet Liberty Coalition said today that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the Internet. 
The announcement follows a meeting of G-7 leaders in Paris where plans were
announced to regulate the Internet in ways that threaten the Free Speech
and Privacy rights of it users. 
 
The G-7 countries include the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also participates in the meetings of the
G-7. 
 
The G-7 proposal, while couched in careful diplomatic terms, appears to
endorse a U.S. Government initiated plan to require key escrowed encryption
on the Internet -- a scheme where the keys for decryption would be
accessible to governments.  There is also language which suggests plans to
restrict the electronic publication of information by unpopular political
organizations. 
 
Earlier attempts by officials in the US Administration to pass similar
measures through Congress have failed. 
 
Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director of the ACLU, said "The US government
may not accomplish through an international end-run what the US Congress
and the US Courts have rejected." 
 
The ACLU was lead plaintiff in the successful challenge to the
Communications Decency Act.  In that case, a US federal court held that the
government may not regulate speech on the Internet. 
 
Simon Davies, director general of Privacy International, said that the
human rights community must not permit national governments to seize
control of privacy enhancing technologies.  "National governments will use
the horrendous incidents in the States to build a international web of
surveillance to the detriment of their citizens." 
 
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, said that the proposals would meet with fierce opposition from
the Internet community.  "Net users will simply not allow governments to
trample on the rights of citizens.  Our rights to privacy and free speech
are clearly protected by international law." 
 
EPIC organized the Internet petition against the Clipper encryption scheme.

 
Cynthia Brown, program director of Human Rights Watch, said, "Free speech
on the Internet is already under attack from states like Saudi Arabia,
China and Singapore, and with this agreement, the G7 countries are only
reinforcing that negative trend." 
 
Human Rights Watch has produced a report on threats to Liberty on the
Internet. 
 
The GILC was formed at the annual meeting of the Internet Society in
Montreal.  Members of the coalition include the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the
Internet Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and
human rights organizations.

(please forward where appropriate)

It's not over yet....

The House has scheduled a vote on "suspension" for a 'counter-terrorism'
bill TODAY (Friday).

Despite media reports that the negotiations had stalled out, house
Republicans have apparently worked out their differences and are set to
vote on the bill today.  The Senate may or may not vote on the measure on
Saturday.

No one I've talked to knows for sure what's in the bill, though I have
heard that there are no encryption provisions and that some of the wiretap
proposals have been scaled back.

I will post details as I get them. In the mean time, keep those calls
coming into Congress.

The outline below is from a document produced by the House Republican
Conference.  It is ONLY A SUMMARY of the proposed bill and is NOT actual
legislation.  No one I have spoken with has seen any specific legislative
language yet.

The outline is confusing on several points, particularly the "FBI DIGITAL
TELEPHONY" Section, which says:

 "The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to
  investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding for equipment purchase was
  provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier this
  year."

The first sentence above is not at all clear, and probably won't be until
we can get our hands on the actual text of the bill. It could be additional
wiretap authority (ie, roving wiretaps), or it could be nothing.  As far as
the funding goes, the "1996 omnibus appropriations measure" DID NOT contain
funding for implementation of the law - but it did appropriate $37 million
to cover new equipment for the FBI.

The rest looks like it is a scaled back version of a measure the
Administration and members of Congress were pushing earlier this week, but
the scope of the new bill depends a lot on what the actual text says.

I will post additional information as soon as I get it.

                Bipartisan Antiterrorism Initiative
                                HR__

                     Committee on the Judiciary
                          No Report Filed
                         To Be Introduced

Floor Situation:

The House is scheduled to consider HR__ on Friday August 2, 1996. On
Thursday August 1, the Rules Committee granted a rule to allow the bill to
be considered under suspension of the rules. It is debatable for 40
minutes, may not be amended, and requires a two-thirds vote for passage.

Summary:

HR__ includes several bipartisan initiatives intended to bolster federal
efforts to combat domestic terrorism in addition to those already enacted
earlier this year as part of the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132).  The bill contains the following
counter-terrorism provisions:

Aviation SECURITY MEASURES: The bill enables domestic airports to
aggressively search for and prevent explosives from causing destruction and
harm to individuals or property through enhanced explosive detection
procedures, baggage and passenger screening, and FBI authority to improve
airport security training and standards to ensure that provisions of the
1990 Aviation Security Act (P.L 101-604) are implemented expeditiously.
Specifically, the bill (1) requires the FAA to implement increased
explosives section methods immediately, (2) strengthen the level of
training and expertise possessed by security personnel who are assigned to
domestic airports, (3) allows airports to use available funding to
reinforce such training for security personnel, and (4) extends criminal
background requirements to include a greater number of airport employees.

IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS: The bill urges
implementation of provisions enacted in the 1996 Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132), such as designating and
freezing the assets of foreign terrorist organizations and implementing
expedited removal procedures for aliens convicted of a crime.

BIPARTISAN "BLUE RIBBON" COMMISSION: The bill establishes a special
commission to review all aspects of U.S. anti-terrorism policy and make
legislative recommendations about methods to most effectively establish a
long-term defense against terrorist threats, including enhancing the
nation's human intelligence capabilities.

PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENTS: The bill includes provisions which grant a cause of
action against the U.S. if in the course of a wiretap investigation
damaging information is willfully disclosed to the detriment of an innocent
party by the federal government.  The cause of action includes monetary
damages to the plaintiff if a favorable decision is rendered in federal
court.

EXPLOSIVES STUDY: The bill authorizes a study on black and smokeless powder
by an independent agency selected by the National Institute of Justice.

FEDERAL RACKETEERING STATUTE CRIMES: The bill permits federal prosecutors
to deem those acts determined to be terrorist in nature as substantial
enough to invoke criminal prosecution under existing criminal racketeering
(RICO) statutes.

FBI DIGITAL TELEPHONY: The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced
telephone technology to investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding
for equipment purchase was provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations
measure enacted earlier this year.

Check out this quote by Rep. Charles Schumer I found in an article by CNN:

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

The article also reports:

"Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

"They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties."

U.S. anti-terrorism talks collapse
But proposals could resurface

August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 9:30 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) --
Congressional efforts to draft new anti-terrorism legislation before the
August recess a the end of the week collapsed Thursday night in a partisan
stalemate. But lawmakers said
there is hope for agreement after the monthlong break.

Key members of the Senate blamed House conservatives for the failure,
saying they had insisted on linking proposed new wiretapping authority
for the FBI to an expansion of privacy laws.

"There's no possibility of anything to be signed before the recess," Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Delaware, said after the last series of meetings on the
issue broke up.

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

Although Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
and Biden, the panel's top Democrat, said there no longer seemed to be a
possibility of passing a bill before the recess, they thought it could be
done before Congress adjourns for the year.

Hatch said negotiators had agreed on a dozen issues, but key requests by
the administration for new wiretap authority and for a broader study of
using chemicals in gunpowder to help trace it were not among them.

Worries about privacy

Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties.

"The White House is not free of blame here. They want it immediately;
we can give it to them in early September," said Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, who heads the bipartisan task force that has been negotiating
with administration officials.

Craig, who had hoped for House and Senate votes on a new
anti-terrorism package before the recess, declined to declare defeat
Thursday evening. Asked whether passage was still possible, he said, "I
hope so."

President Clinton has urged Congress to take quick action, because of the
Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta and the crash of TWA
=46light 800, suspected to have been caused by a bomb.

The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

The House passed a revised counter-terrorism bill this afternoon by a
substantial majority.  The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate
on Saturday 8/3, and is likely to pass.

The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening
provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from
the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI
objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap
authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed
bill.

In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. Earlier
in the week, the Administration had circulated an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. It's nice to finally have a number of powerful
allies joining the usual defenders of net.freedom on Capitol Hill.

The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a controvertial provisions expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.

The bill also contains a small but not insigificant privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.

This is not over yet -- many of these issues, particularly encryption and
Digital Telephony funding, are likely to be back before the Congress in
September, so stay tunned...

Thanks to everyone who called Congress today to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
mave had really made a difference in this debate.

More as it comes...

Stop the presses -- the other shoe didn't drop. Despite a flurry of
last-minute hyperbole, the House passed an anti-terrorism bill this
afternoon without the ominous encryption or wiretap provisions. Now
the bill lies in the lap of the Senate, which probably will approve it
later today or tomorrow before they leave town for the August recess.

In the wake of the dual bombings, Congress wanted to be seen as taking
*some* action before they adjourned, and last weekend Clinton and the
Dems started lobbying hard for the heinous measures they wanted in an
anti-terrorism bill. Vastly expanded state-snooping capabilities:
multipoint wiretaps, warrantless short-term wiretaps, dialed-phone
number recorders, and black and smokeless powder taggants. Even
possible of anti-crypto language that Jamie Gorelick, deputy attorney
general, has been shopping around for months.

The Net owes its thanks to the House Republicans for stopping these
fool Dems in a fine backroom political maneuver late last night.

They did it through the House Rules Committee, which in the wee hours
of the morning reported a rule allowing the GOP leadership to introduce
the terrorism bill on the floor today -- without letting Democrats see
it, amend it, or even send it back to committee. It was a good plan --
coordinated by Rep. Chris Cox -- keeping the legislation away from the
hands of the Big Brother Dems.

The Democrats waxed pissy. Rep. David Bonior, the party's whip, called
the majority's maneuvering "extrordinary." John Conyers, the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, blasted Gingrich and the
Republican leadership for "bringing a meaningless bill to the House
floor."

Conyers said to reporters at 1 pm: "It's a hoax on the American
people. It is all bark and no bite... This bill is missing the
important wiretapping provisions that would allow law enforcement to
find and stop terrorists before they kill. The House Republicans and
the NRA say we should not have emergency authority for surveillance
even if we know terrorists are about to blow a plane out of the sky.
They also say that we should not have wiretap authority for terrorists who
use more than one telephone to make their deadly plans."

Of course, this is political grandstanding at its finest -- or worst.
Conyers conveniently neglected to add that law enforcement officers
already have the right to use roving wiretaps with court approval.

Also, there was a mixup over Digital Telephony funding, compounded by
the text of the legislation's being kept secret until the last minute.
Summaries distributed to reporters early this afternoon said: "The bill
authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to investigate
suspected terrorist activity. Funding for equipment purchase was
provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier
this year." But the DT provisions weren't in the final draft of the bill.

Silly Congressperns. The House had *already* approved the DT slushfund
on July 24 as part of the 1997 Commerce, Justice, State departments
appropriations bill.

Now the 1997 CJS appropriations bill goes to the Senate, which will
decide how much cash to give Digital Telephony when they return in early
September.

What's going to happen? Well, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), a former
prosecutor and longtime proponent of Digital Telephony, said yesterday
at the Intelligence Committee hearing on terrorism: "I was proud to
have worked with the FBI director to ensure passage of the
Communications Assisatance for Law Enforcement Act, sometimes called
the digital telephony law."

With Republicans like the ones in the House, who needs so-called "civil
libertarian" Democrats?

Joe, I was a staffer on Jerry Brown's 1992 presidental campaign in Santa 
Monica and NYC. I'm hardly an uncritical supporter of the Republicans.

However, I believe in giving credit where it is due, and they deserve our 
thanks this week. Next week the opposite may be true when the Republicans 
conspire to trample on our free expression rights.

But the undercurrent of political posturing worked in our favor for a
change and we should welcome the reprive. Why are the Dems being
anti-civil-lib suddenly? My first thought is because one of their own is
in the White House, overseeing the DoJ, running for re-election, so Dems
are closing ranks. They also seem truly to enjoy being the "law-and-order"
party for a change.

This was picked up by the local Fox affiliate, Channel 5, and headlined 
on the 10 pm news yesterday.

I was sitting in my living room with a friend -- we had just finished
watching a rather poor episode of X-Files -- and we looked at each other
and sighed as Fox detailed how the investigation had shifted to a small
Georgia college where Jewell was a security guard. "Investigators are
trying to determine whether he downloaded bomb-making information from the
Internet while working at the college." 

This is a very virulent meme.

The Senate left without voting on the anti-terrorism bill. This is not

and then fight the House Repubs over it in conference committee.

  County Accuses Four of Using the Internet to Access Child Porn
  --------------------------------------------------------------

By Ronald K. Fitten
Seattle Times Staff Reporter

Four men, including two former Microsoft employees, have been charged
with allegedly using computers to access child pornography on the
Internet, said King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.

"Traditional law-enforcement efforts against child pornography have
focused on magazines, movies, and tangible materials," Maleng said
yesterday.  "But law enforcement faces new challenges with the
emergence of new technology.  The Internet, with its millions of
international web sites, has become the new underground highway for
illegal child pornography."

The two former Microsoft engineers, Michael Seaman, 37, of Kirkland,
and Ronald Rosul Jr., 31, of Seattle, allegedly used Microsoft
computers to access and copy child pornography from the Internet,
according to prosecutors.

[...]

Both Seaman and Rosul will be arraigned next week in King County
Superior Court.  If convicted, both could receive up to one year in
jail.

Maleng, who said police and prosecutors worked cooperatively with
Microsoft throughout the investigation, said law-enforcement officers
had confiscated computer hard drives, CD-ROMs, and printed materials
as evidence.

Found this buried deep in the long version of an AP story about the
Atlanta pipe bomb suspect:

      Bomb-making instructions available through the global computer
      network have contributed to an increase in bombings in the United
      States, authorities say. 

Did I miss the news story where that contribution was identified?  Or is 
the AP mis-stating what their FBI "expert" said on Monday.

Incidentally, the source for the oft-repeated statement that the FBI was 
"trying to determine whether Jewell may have had access to the campus
Internet" [sic] is not in the FBI; it's someone on the campus who believes
that that's what the FBI is doing.

Eric Adler of the Kansas City Star caught some less-covered moments from
the Olympics.  Including this one:

	Foreign journalists getting pepper spray in the face as they
	tried to enter their offices after the Olympic Park bombing.
	Police wanted to secure the building. Reporters wanted to file

House approves anti-terrorism bill
By Rose Aguilar

August 2, 1996, 6:15 p.m. PST

          The United States House of Representatives tonight approved the
          Anti-Terrorism act of 1996 by a sweeping 389 to 22 vote, but to
          the relief of Net activists passed a version free of amendments
          that would have regulated Net content, restricted encryption
          technology, and expanded the use of wiretapping.

          The Democrats fought hard for the encryption, Internet, and
          wiretapping provisions, but lost to arguments from
          conservatives and libertarians that the provisions would be an
          infringement of citizens' First Amendments rights. The law that
          was approved by the house also did not include the amendment
          re-introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would have made
          it a felony to publish information about bombs and bomb-making
          on the Internet.

[...]

          The anti-terrorism section of the bill adds several
          terrorism-related crimes to the list of offenses included in
          the federal antiracketeering law. Under this section, the
          penalty for unlawful disclosure of information obtained from a
          wiretap doubles from 5 to 10 years.

          The bill went to the Senate today. Supporters would like the
          bill to be approved without changes and then sent to the
          President. The Senate may vote as early as Saturday or may
          decide to make changes and wait to approve its own version
          until next month.

          "I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said online
          activist Declan McCullagh. "The Senate may or may not act
          tomorrow, but I think the Net has a reprieve from the Net
          crackdown in terms of bomb information until September," he
          said.

Louis Freeh beats his fear-mongering drum while singing his wiretap tune....


From: http://www.cnn.com

FBI chief: U.S. 'under attack' by terrorists
August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 6:05 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States may face "a very difficult time"
coping with terrorists, and new counter-terrorism weapons are needed,
FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.

On expanded wiretap powers being sought by the FBI as part of that
defense, he said: "We're simply trying to catch up with technology. And
that is critical."

[ ... ]

He referred to the two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 24
servicemen; the bombing that killed one woman at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta; and the still-unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800.

Although the combined incidents have "completely consumed" law
enforcement personnel, Freeh said the wiretap proposals would not give
the government "expansive powers" and would not lead to "an avalanche of
new electronic surveillance."

"The United States and its interests both here and around the world are
clearly under attack. And we may be in for a very difficult time with
respect to continuation of these types of things," Freeh said.

Anti-terrorism negotiations

Freeh spoke a day after the White House, after wrangling with key
Republican lawmakers, won tentative agreement on a package of
anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority.

[ ... ]

The negotiators, led by Craig and White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, hoped to have a package ready for a vote by the end of the
week.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders summoned
Attorney General Janet Reno, Panetta and Freeh to a private meeting
Thursday to explain why some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't
been spent.

"We have been somewhat behind in the hiring of people" for
anti-terrorism programs, because of the time needed to screen applicants
for such sensitive work, Freeh explained during his Senate testimony
Thursday.

   Scientology. On Flag, I trained to be an auditor (a Scientology

NETCOM SETTLES SUIT WITH CHURCH

Out-of-court deal with Scientologists

BY MARK LEIBOVICH
Mercury News Staff Writer

A lawsuit that many in the online community feared would set a
precedent restricting freedom of expression on the internet was
resolved quitely Saturday in an out-of-court settlement in San
Jose.

Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc. announced it has
settled the intellectual property dispute initiated by
Religious Technology Center, the publishing wing of the Church
of Scientology.

RTC had brought a claim against Netcom, seeking to prohibited
what is viewed as illegal postings of sacred church writings,
some of which it claimed were protected under US copyright
laws.  Both parties agreed not to disclose specific details
of the settlement.

According to a statement, Netcom as set up a protocol on its
company home page for handling future intellectual property
disputes.

[...]

The full text of the protocol can be found on Netcom's home
page, at
http://www.netcom.com/about/protectcopy.html

[...]

"I would hate to see Netcom be put in the position of having
to police the material posted on its service," says Howard
Rheingold, a well-known digital community guru, and author of
the 1993 book Virtual Community, who is not familiar with the
details of the case.

&gt;From the Sunday times:-

AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into
the computers of the European parliament and
European commission as part of an international
espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and
political secrets, according to investigators, write
Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. 

The European parliament has called in British
communications experts to improve its security and
to block further attempts by American govern ment
agents to spy on its workings. 

Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg
offices say they have discovered several recent
instances in which its communications system was
compromised by American hacking. They have also
found evidence that the Americans used information
obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations
last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). 

Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the
European parliament, said he was shocked by the
disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the
American ambassador [to the European Union]," he
said. 

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese
and French governments of hacking into their
communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets. 

The European parliament's computer network links
more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and
other staff to each other, and to the European
commission headquarters in Brussels and the council
of ministers. 

Traffic across the network by telephone and
computers includes details of the private medical
and financial records of many MEPs and officials,
and discussion documents on confidential issues,
including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The
records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE
and fraud are also stored on the system. 

European parliament sources say the Americans
accessed the network by compromising the
information exchanges that link the parliament's
internal networks with the Internet and external
users. 

The devices, called "routers", filter entry to the
European parliament's network. It is understood the
Americans were able to obtain access to what is
called the simple network management protocol
(SNMP), the language that enables the networks to
talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact
that parts of the system were manufactured by two
American firms. 

The breach came to light when officials believed
that American negotiators had been given advance
warning of confidential European Union positions
in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established
that the system had been penetrated just days before
the talks," an EU source said. "Our principal
concern is not to establish what has already been
copied but to ensure that it does not happen again.
This is an on-going problem." 

A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of
data processing at the commission, confirmed that
allegations of hacking had been investigated.
However, she said she was unable to provide any
details.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense authorization appropriations bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of 
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.
                  
   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

This is the truly astonishing thing to me about terrorism in America. If,
at least for the sake of argument, the goal of terrorism in America is to
weaken the country through such attacks, it's phenomenally stupid to hand
terrorists a victory on a silver platter by gutting our Constitution as our
response.

Why bother to bring down the American government when the American
government can do a pretty good job of peeling way the nation's alleged
principles all on it own in the name of political brownie points?

           O'REILLY ANNOUNCES "NETACTIVISM" GUIDE TO
           USING THE INTERNET IN GRASSROOTS POLITICS
  Veteran Grassroots Activist Shares the Secrets of Online Success

SEBASTOPOL, CA--It's no secret that the American citizen is fed up with
politics as usual. Fewer people are voting in every election, and those
who do vote aren't sure it matters. During this presidential primary
season, noted Internet publisher O'Reilly & Associates is releasing in
"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet," a book that will show
ordinary people who want to reclaim politics--from the neighborhood to
the national level--how to use the power of the Internet to make a
difference.

Written by veteran political activist and former Philadelphia city
councilman Ed Schwartz, "NetActivism" is a no-hype guide that shows
readers how to use the Internet to find out what the government really
does, as well as how to organize around a cause or a community with
online tools like electronic mailing lists, online debates, and Web
sites.

A leader in citizen movements for more than 30 years, author Schwartz
embraced the Internet not because it's cool, but because it gets the
job done. He has an extensive online presence: a Web site
(http://libertynet.org/community/phila/natl.html) that serves community
activists across the country, a mailing list that discusses civic
values, and ties to a community network that organizes citizens across
the city of Philadelphia. "NetActivism" features real-world examples
from Schwartz's Institute for Civic Values and a host of other citizen
groups, including the Downtown Minneapolis Residents Association and
Project VoteSmart.

Community activists, politicians--and any concerned citizens who care
about their community--will find "NetActivism" packed with advice on
conducting online research, getting the right equipment and software,
using online networks in local communities, and crafting political
campaigns on the Net.

"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet" will be released on
September 24. Produced by O'Reilly affiliate Songlione Studios for
O'Reilly's Songline Guide imprint, "NetActivism" includes a CD-ROM with
Internet software and limited free online time.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ed Schwartz, founder and president of the Institute for the Study of
Civic Values, has been a national leader in movements to revitalize
neighborhoods and expand citizen participation in government for more
than 25 years.  In the 1970s, he built a city-wide coalition of
community organizations that led to his upset election to the
Philadelphia City Council as a councilman-at-large in 1984. Between
1987 and 1992, he served as director of Philadelphia's Office of
Housing and Community Development, overseeing the rehabilitation of
more than 4,000 houses and apartments for low-income residents of the
City. In 1992, he returned to the Institute for the Study of Civic
Values full-time to develop new models for community planning and
citizen empowerment for the 1990's.

Dr. Schwartz, who received his Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers
University, has written widely on problems related to civic
participation, neighborhood development, and America's democratic
heritage. His first book, "Will the Revolution Succeed?" has been
followed by articles and reviews in The New York Times Book Review, The
Nation, The American Prospect, Shelterforce, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
and The Philadelphia Daily News. The work of the Institute for the
Study of Civic Values itself is profiled extensively in Robert Bellah's
award-winning book, "Habits of the Heart."

Bryan,

I've taken the liberty of forwarding your note, along with my prepended
comments, to the fight-censorship mailing list.

I confess I'm not sure what recourse you have now that GeoCities has killed
your web site's graphics. Their current policy says that "nudity or
pornographic material of any kind" is verboten. Do you have the URLs to
other nude sites that remain on GeoCities?

At http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homeguide.html, I found:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a summary of things that are not permitted as part of
the GeoCities free Personal Home Page Program:

1.Material that is grossly offensive to the Web community including
blatant expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity

2.Pages that promote or provide instructional information about illegal
activities

3.Pages that promote physical harm or injury against any group or
individual

4.The use of free Personal Home Pages for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the following:

Soliciting for advertisers or sponsors

Displaying a sponsorship banner of any kind, including those that are
generated by "banner exchange" services

Displaying banners for services that provide cash or cash-equivalent
prizes to users in exchange for hyperlinks to their web site.

Conducting raffles or contests that require any type of entry fee

5.Pages that contain nudity or pornographic material of any kind

6.Pages that exploit images of children under 18 years of age

7.Restricted or Password-only access pages

8.Hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible
page)

9.Use of the page (or directory) as storage for remote loading

10.Use of the page as a door or signpost to another server

11.Use of copyrighted material without the prior permission from the
author
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.

Does anyone else have any insights?

Subject: censorship at www.geocities.com

Over a month ago I responded to a soliciation for a free personal home page
from www.geocities.com (which is advertised on their home page). They are
promoting theme-based neighborhoods for the home pages. The only content
guidelines were that nothing injurious to any person or group is permitted.
Based on those guidlelines, I felt the server a safe place to display my art
work and I placed my drawings of male nudes on an available address in
GeoCities' WestHollywood neighborhood. I have noticed other sites on
GeoCities with an equal amount of nudity. The only difference was my site
displayed the blue ribbon online freedom icon with a link to the EFF site.

Well, 30 days  and 10,000 hits to my site later (I heavily promoted my site
with listings in many art related directories), I awakened one morning to a
barage of e-mail from people informing me my site had been stripped of all
its graphics--everything from the blue ribbon icon to my nude art work, only
part of which contained male frontal nudity, to the photo of myself
fully-clothed. Later I was to receive an impersonal e-mail notification from
 GeoCities informing me that I was violating their content guidelines which
they now claim prohibit nudity (which I did not find in their posted
guidelines all the while other nude sites remain on GeoCities).

I am very distressed that after all my work and sincere efforts to produce a
tasteful site (which I received many e-mail compliments on wordwide),  I
would have it stripped bare in Nazi style of all the graphics, the essence of
my artistic energy.

Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
of expression in art and lifestyles.

Usually, tracking international net-censorship efforts is depressing.
However, this UPI report on the pissing match between N. Korea and S. Korea
made me laugh aloud. The North Koreans are posturing brilliantly -- truly
trying to force Seoul's hand, and using the Net to do it.

        TOKYO, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea's official news agency blasted
South Korea Tuesday for allegedly blocking its citizens' access to a new
Internet page sponsored by Pyongyang, a report monitored in Tokyo said.
        ``What they (Seoul) should block is not the North Korean Page but the
U.S. channel dealing with methods of murder and robbery and pornographic
scenes too shameful to watch,'' the Korean Central News Agency dispatch
said.
        The KCNA report quoted researcher Kim Hyong-sok of the Information
and Culture Center of North Korea as saying the history of the Internet
has seen no example of people being punished for monitoring certain
sites.
        ``Such punishment would cause bitter condemnation from the
international community,'' said Kim.
        Bristling with slogans about the ``great leader comrade Kim Il-sung,''
the Internet page has upset South Korean leaders, said KCNA, to the
point of having access to the site banned.
        ``The puppet Agency for National Security Planning and Prosecution
officially asked the Internet service organ in South Korea to block the
channel,'' said the KCNA report.
        The North Korean mouthpiece said the officials in Seoul should not
``trouble themselves'' because they do not have the equipment to block
the Internet page anyway.

[So Malaysia will censor only material that some government bureaucrat
finds "offensive?" What a commitment to free speech! Cynically, Declan]


         KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Reuter) - Malaysia on Thursday
unveils plans for a ``multimedia super corridor'' (MSC), which it
hopes will attract a new breed of foreign investors and propel
the country into the 21st century.

[...]

         [Proj director] Azzman said Malaysia would guarantee the
free flow of information. Sceptics have questioned that commitment in
a country where newspapers are licensed and the Printing and
Publications Act has been used to muzzle dissent.
         ``We have not censored the Internet, so the free flow of
information is very much the order of the day,'' said Azzman who
is director general of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronic Systems, a government agency that provides sole
access to the Internet in the country.
         ``We won't police what they do as long as it is within the
confines of the company,'' he said, adding companies in the MSC
can receive information from abroad, process it and then
transmit it out of the country without interference.
         The government would act only if illegal or offensive
materials like pornography were distributed within Malaysia.
         Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had agreed to set up a
regional office after meeting Mahathir last month. A ``couple of
dozen'' others have expressed ``keen interest'', Azzman said.
         The corridor would link the new airport and the futuristic
Putrajaya federal capital with the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a
mammoth office highrise project featuring the Petronas Towers,
the world's tallest buildings.

   BEIJING -- When it comes to controlling the Internet, China is
trying to learn from a little neighbor.
   In June, Beijing sent Zeng Jianhui, a top official, to Singapore to
pick up tips on expanding the use of the Internet within strict
limits. Singapore, a critic of unfettered dissent and Western culture,
is trying to become the network's model censor.
   ``China has a lot to learn from Singapore's experience,'' says a
Chinese government official studying Internet restrictions.

[...]

   Worried that the new electronic communications medium is spinning
out of its control and could undermine Communist propaganda, the
Chinese leadership decided in February to put teeth into Internet
regulations and prevent computer-disseminated pornography and
antigovernment material.
   The government is uneasy about cyberspace connections between
overseas democracy activists and Chinese dissidents, which blossomed
during political protests on the streets of Beijing and other major
cities during the spring of 1989. The few Chinese activists who are
not imprisoned or under detention are closely watched amid a
government crackdown on crime and political unrest.

[...]

   ``This is not having any negative effect on the Internet's
development in China,'' says Wang Jun, an official in the
telecommunications ministry's data communication bureau. ``It's just a
precautionary procedure.''

[...]

   In May, China launched a nationwide computer network that allows
only limited access to the Internet. The venture aims to avoid
breaking China's censorship laws by creating its own content and
making available only information useful for businesses.
   The new edited network, which is 60 percent owned by the official
New China News Agency and was launched in conjunction with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, does not face a censorship
problem because ``there is nothing illegal on the network,'' says
Joyce Wong, an executive with the Hong Kong-based China Internet Corp.

If even one of the North Koreans' claims were true, I'd agree. This falls

GeoCities is a completely free service. They have no contractual obligation

CSIS Calls Itself Canadas Political Police & States ARA Torched
Zundels House

Since the outrageously biased Heritage Front Affair Report published by
the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), a group of appointed
political has-beens and bagmen, we have had serious concerns that
Canadas security apparatus is utterly out of control and is spying
wholesale and contrary to the CSIS Act on legitimatre, non-violent
dissent. Some very disturbing confirmation of our fears has recently
come our way.

In February of this year, Kitchener, Ontario electronics businessman
Michael Rothe  was interviewed by two CSIS agents, who identified
themselves to him as such and showed ID. They were identified as Peter
and Angela. Rothe had organized several meetings in Kitchener for
British historian David Irving, who has since, under pressure from the
censorship lobby been banned from Canada, while planeloads of Tamil
terrorists and Jamican drug pushers and gunsels seem to have open access
to this country. The interview was taped. The revelations on thios tape
are staggering.

ANGELA: Have you heard of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
PETER: You can bet its real!.... Ill explain what we are. First, the
Canadian Security Intelligence service is like the BFK in Germany.
These are the dreaded so-called Federal  Constitution Protection  Police
(Bundesverfassungsschutz), which spy on the German right and are
blatantly a political police force. Just in case the frightened German
immigrant didnt get the point, Peter added: Were the political
police. Angela and I are from the counter-terrorism branch. ... We are
interested in the Heritage Front. He was then asked a number of
questions as to how he got involved in politics, how hed been contacted
by the Hereitage Front andf what he thought of this group, which CSIS,
through its agent Grant Bristow had helped fund and lead!
PETER: Did you ever meet Paul Fromm. Hes C-FAR and CAFE. The school
teacher from Mississauga. He would have been at the this David Irving
[meeting]. False!!!. Fromm was actually in Vancouver that day.
PETER: In Toronto, Wolfgang [Droege of the Heritage Front] has beren
much troubled by a group that calls itself Anti-Racist Action, ARA. This
is a collection of anarchists, Trotskyists, Stalinists.
ANGELA: The ARA that Peter described firebombed Ernst Zundel. Im sure
youve heard about the problem various leaders of the so-called right
wing have received firebombs. Shes apparently referring to the May 7,
1995 arson attack on Ernst Zundels Toronto residence/office, and
firebombings of Don Andrews and Nicola Polinuk.
PETER: So, were interested to know, ... were there ever  threats made
to you? That ought to put the fear of the Lord into him,

So, here we have CSISs descriptin of themselves as a political
police. Frightening! Then. theres the clear assertion that the
perpetratrors of the fire at Zundels and the firebombings in spring,
1995, were the ARA. If so, why havent they been arrested? Are they
being protected by the Canadian security establishment? Readers should
contact Solicitor-General Herb Gray and ask these questions. Ontario
readers should contact Solicitor-General Bob Runciman and ask why, in
light of this information, no charges have been laid by the Metropolitan
Toronto Police in these clearly political acts of terrorism. Had such an
attack been perpetrated on the offices of one the currently privileged
minoiorities, is there any doubt that every rightwinger to the starboard
of Joe Clark would have been hauled in for questioning?

______________________________________________________________________
SUMMARY

On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.

This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.

* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.

* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.

* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.

______________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND

This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.

Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.

In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.

Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.

Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export.
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography.
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.

What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.

2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this
   release for contact information for several such organisations.

3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:

&gt; What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
&gt; to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else have any insights?

I have a friend whose site containing nudity was treated in a very
similar way:  Wendy.

	http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4750

She had some beautifully tasteful partial nudes of herself on her
page; I would consider them erotic, not pornographic.  Unlike 
thie site in question here, I'd say that the main intent was to
show viewers a good time; there was essentially no content other
than the pictures.

When the hit counter went through the roof, they found her site and
apparently warned her a couple of times about its content not being
acceptable.  But she also played a mean trick on another Internet
user, which probably also contributed to her deletion.  It was apparently
some sort of revenge thing; I'm not sure who's right and who's wrong.
In my communications with her, I considered her a rather sweet lady
but not too frightfully verbal.  She certainly talked quite clearly
with her pictures, which revealed a stunningly perfect body.

I helped organize a brief protest campaign to Geocities which apparently
resulted in the reinstatement of her page, sans a few of the "best"
pictures.  And there, as far as I know, it remains.

The lesson from this would seem to be that you can probably get
Geocities to bend if you have enough friends.  (I probably don't
need to tell any of you here that being a gorgeous 25 year old girl
who loves to show off her body is one great way of acquiring
instant friends &lt;grin&gt;).

I hope this helps!

Best
D

&gt;Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
&gt;space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
&gt;sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
&gt;"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom

As a free service, Geocities has the right to determine which pages it
decides to sponsor.  This is not a good incident to espouse free speech

Subject: Re: GeoCities kills web site with drawings of male nudes

Two prime examples of site with PHOTOS  containng male frontal nudity on
GeoCities are:

Rob's Bound & Gagged
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3100

contains graphic photos of sadomaochism showing male genetalia

Nude Celebrities
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3102

My site only contained abstract pencil drawings with no sexual activity
portrayed.

There are dozens of sites containing nudity on GeoCities and obviously
something else is going on here.

Certainly, GeoCities has the right to determine which pages it decides to
sponsor. It may even have the right to offer the pages on on basis and then
pull them off under a new set of rules, after the page creator has invested
time in making them and publicizing their location. (I have the impression
from the initial message that this is what happened - can someone who knows
clarify this point?)

However, that does not mean they're not slimy for causing this kind of
unnecessary inconvenience, and it doesn't mean they shouldn't be called on
their acts and others who might be considering dealing with them alerted to
the possibility of a problem.

I personally would like to hear from GeoCities on why they chose to pull
the pages off. Did their policy change at any point, and if so, why did
they change it?

Um... and what would that be? Please go on. Obviously there is some
conspiracy forcing you to pay $7.50/month or so for unrestricted web
service, rather than getting it for free, but which conspiracy?

Yes, but it's not necessarily something sinister.  From the evidence
I've seen GeoCities is just responding to the "squeaky wheels."  When
a page gets a pile of hits they check it out.  I'm not especially
impressed with the actions they're taking, but I doubt there's any
plot to stifle free thinking on the net.

Get this one.  I just heard it on the afternoon news.  Two young boys were
seriously burned after a failed attempt at making napalm on their kitchen
stove.  Sounds like the normal fun activities of bored youth on summer break
right?  But hey - where did they get the recipe?  From the Anarchists
Cookbook in the library?  No - they got it from -- GASP -- the Anarchists
Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
-- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
sort of convention) are deciding whether or not to press charges.  See -
just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Law Professor Sues Federal Government
Over Computer Privacy Issues

Federal Civil Rights Action Seeks Injunction Against 
State Department And National Security Agency

Cleveland Scholar Attacks Prohibition On Discussing 
Cryptographic Software With Foreign Students And Colleagues


For Immediate Release

     A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
     federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict
     his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a
     twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a
     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

     The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military
     technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which
     encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet,
     is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control.
     The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by
     defining "export" to include discussing technical information about
     non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students
     registered for Professor Junger's course.

     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

     Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on
     the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans
     to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this
     fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach,
     and to whom.

     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Folks, I apologize for the mail problems. I still haven't quite figured 
out exactly what happened -- I'm not at home, but in NYC on business, so 
I wasn't able to log on this evening until now.

Seems as though the problem happened when I forwarded a fight-censorship
message to cypherpunks, which has among its subscribers a nonexistent
address at axcess.net.in. For some reason, a poorly-configured machine at
axcess.net.in started repeatedly resending the forwarded message back to
fight-censorship. Odd. I think I've blocked it from doing it again. 

I blame the problem on AOL, of course.

On a topic more germane to the list, I was in Times Square with Glenn and
some NYC webperns this evening, having dinner in a delightful greasy
burger joint. For no apparent reason, a woman sitting next to me started
to describe, in painstaking detail, how to kill someone with a hatpin. (A
jab to the nerve center in the solar plexus, if you must know.)

I started to think to myself, especially after Dara's note earlier, that 
this kind of material should be banned! Censor biology texts on the Net!

Yours in protecting children from dangerous knowledge,

Declan

Subject: Washington Post letter by Sen. Burns

     Sen. Burns' letter to The Washington Post today contained something of 
     an error, in case you couldn't tell.
     
     A line from the original letter was deleted.
     
     The line that read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights" 
     should instead read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of current wiretapping authority, it is a drastic expansion. 
     it lays the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights."
     
     Fortunately, the overall meaning of the letter is left largely intact.


[Attached is Burns' letter. --Declan]
   


                      `SPEAKING IN CODE ON THE INTERNET'
   
   Friday, August 9 1996; Page A16
   The Washington Post
   
   
   The Post's editorial July 27 on my Pro-CODE bill to ease restrictions
   on encoded, or "encrypted," computer messages ["Speaking in Code on
   the Internet"] was generally balanced but deleted a couple of key
   points.
   
   First, my bill would not "lift" restrictions on the export of strong
   encryption technology, which is designed to allow people to protect
   their computer files and messages. Instead, it would allow the
   Commerce Department merely to ease export restrictions to a level of
   computer security that it deems is "generally available" in the
   nations we trade with.
   
   This bill does not open the floodgates. Instead, it is an
   acknowledgment of the real world and that high-tech U.S. companies
   must be allowed to compete in an increasingly vital sector of the
   world economy. One trade group stated the United States stands to lose
   $60 billion in market share and 216,000 jobs under the current
   restrictions.
   
   Second, the administration's proposal to seek a copy of decoder "keys"
   for our electronic information is not simply an extension of the
   groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights. Imagine a Craig
   Livingstone or an Aldrich Ames being designated the "trusted third
   party" who holds the keys.
   
   Supporters of my bill have never maintained that some criminals will
   not attempt to use encryption to evade law enforcement. But the bill
   is an attempt to address the encryption status quo, not some long-ago
   world to which the FBI would like to return. (FBI Director Louis Freeh
   stated in the hearing July 25 that he would even like to restrict
   encryption imports.)
   
   While the White House indicates it might be willing to give people
   stronger encryption, it insists that the trade-off must be a copy of
   our decoder keys. It's a deal Americans will never accept and a plan
   that has yet to be proven feasible.
   
   Denying millions of law-abiding people the use of a legitimate and
   increasingly necessary security product for "law enforcement" reasons
   is like banning deadbolt locks because they make it a little harder to
   kick down the doors of a few drug dealers.

Excuse me?  Last I heard, Feinstein (who wouldn't be caught dead in SD this
week&gt;, was sponsoring the worst censorship bill currently in Congress.  
And, lest we forget, Sen. Exon was (and is) a Democrat.  Sure, there are 
censors in the Republican Party (can you say Christian Coalition?), but 
that's a rather wide brush you're painting the Republicans with.  On the 
net, party lines don't quite fit.  As I think we've discussed here and 
elsewhere, it's net.experience that is the divider.

&gt; &gt; just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
&gt; &gt; morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.
No truer words were ever spoken &lt;g&gt;, speaking as one of the corrupted 
myself... :)

&gt;         But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
&gt; you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?)
Uhhhh... no.  The last time I went to Computer City, I didn't have to 
have a criminal background check or wait five days.  Actually, in VA, we 
don't have to wait 5 days, but that doesn't matter.  Back-of-the-truck 
sales, like you must be referring to, are illegal anyway, and if the 
police would enforce current laws, we might not have to worry about that.

&gt; therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
&gt; weapon every year...
More like &lt;maximum&gt; a few thousand over several years.  Remember, there 
are a hell of a lot more accidental car deaths than accidental gun 
deaths, though.  There's your few dozen thousand.

&gt;         ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
&gt; Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
&gt; extrapolation) dangerous?
Good point.  Guns, though, in a way like computers, require a 
mis-intentioned person to become dangerous.  Computers aren't designed to 
put holes in people or things (as Kurt Vonnegut would say).  In both 
cases, though, an unreasonable person has to make an irrational decision 
in order to cause harm.

&lt;/rant&gt;

&gt;in a country where you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem

Purchasing an AK47 is illegal in several states, and in those which do
allow machine gun ownership by citizens, you must receive an OK from
local law enforcement and obtain a BATF special permit.  

Modems do not require local law enforcement sign offs...yet.

             CLINTON: GOP LISTENING TO 'GUN LOBBY OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'
                                          
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) -- President Clinton on Saturday
   accused the Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts to fight terrorism
   by kowtowing to the gun lobby.
   
   In his weekly radio address from Jackson, where the president and his family
   are vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had stripped his anti-terrorism
   bill of valuable tools "that law enforcement needs to help them find out,
   track down and shut down terrorists."
   
   The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
   anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and marking
   explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to the dealer who
   sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill and the assault weapons
   ban.

[...]
   
   Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti- terrorism
   legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and explosive taggant
   issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism bill of its own that
   excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not vote on the measure before
   adjourning for its August recess.
   
   The Republicans, the president said, were listening to "the gun lobby over
   law enforcement."
   
   "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
   country and the safety of our people," he said.

After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?

   By VIVIENNE WALT 
   THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
   
   At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
   Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.
   
   Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship from
   his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a white
   supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service provider, the
   teenager posted the site's entire contents in a compressed "mirror" file...
   
   Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a task
   force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech -- something the
   Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe, has laws against.

[...]
   
   One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
   virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) pushed his
   proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony,
   punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
   
   "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
   of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
   the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
   how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
   can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

[...]
   
   In a last-minute maneuver on Aug. 2, House members dropped the Internet
   controls and wiretapping provisions from their Anti-Terrorism Act, approved
   it by 389-22, and went home for the rest of the summer, leaving the Senate
   in a quandary about what to do after Labor Day. "We just couldn't come up
   with a bipartisan bill," says Sen. Feinstein's press secretary Susan
   Kennedy.
   
   Like Washington, Paris empties out in August for la vacance. But on Sept.
   26, the fight picks up in the French capital at a top-level meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   
   Justice Department officials, and 'Net activists, are set to travel to Paris
   to argue about key escrow...

   "This is an example of the Justice Department trying to dictate foreign
   policy," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center in Washington, who sits on the OECD's advisory panel on encryption.

[...]
   
   "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
   subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
   Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
   of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
   the Web.
   
   Rabbi Cooper and others have lobbied Internet providers to expel the
   extremist sites. "Will they eventually find somewhere else? Probably. But
   that still makes it a worthwhile thing to do," he says.

The face of net-activism is changing. I'm writing this from a science
fiction writers' and editors' party in upstate New York, where we've been
talking about net-politics and online communities.

The fronts we face now are three: national, state, and international. 
We've fought the national fight in the CDA, Clipper, and recent crypto and
terrorist debates. It's been where most of our efforts have focused. 

State politics lags behind that of Capitol Hill. State legislators are
starting to try to ram through bills similar to the CDA -- and, worse yet,
ones that are substantially different. We've discussed some on
fight-censorship.

The ACLU is the only cyber-liberties group tracking them. Yesterday I
stopped by Ann Beeson's office in Manhattan to talk about the Georgia bill
and other laws the group is planning to challenge. 

(Congratulations are in order. No longer a temporary ACLU fellow, Ann is
now a full-time staff attorney in the national office. It's a
well-deserved promotion!)

Then I walked across Bryant Park to the headquarters of Human Rights
Watch, an international civil rights group. They don't have a substantial
online presence now, but they did publish a fabulous global
net-restrictions report ("Silencing the Net") this spring -- and they have
what the Net needs right now: expertise in dealing with international
groups like G-7 and an extensive network of affiliates around the world. 
They seemed interested in doing more online work, which is wonderful. 

Afterwards Charles Platt and Ann, Glenn and their SOs and I went to dinner
at Sam's Noodle Shop on 29th and chatted about our CDA lawsuit and the
human genome project. 

The two aren't necessarily related, unless you count discerning what
congenital defects DoJ attorney Jason "The Weasel" Baron has. Yes, I'm
hardly unbiased. Anyone who threatens to have me arrested for interviewing
government witnesses is a splendid example of a censorhappy Fed
bureaucrat. As a side note, the weasel has been showing up to more and
more DC cyber-regulation events, like the Freedom Forum's panel on crypto
and censorship, and the FTC's panel on net-regulation and privacy. (Wonder
what he's up to?)

So the growing net-involvement of ACLU and HRW is just in time. They have
the well-established state and international affiliates, respectively,
that other groups lack. Hopefully, the affiliates can forward reports
uphill to the parent groups and help in fighting laws and policies locally. 

We need all the help and international expertise we can get -- as we've
seen recently at the Paris summit, governments have this annoying,
persistent habit of working backroom deals. The G-7 resolution (also
endorsed by Russia) said: 

  We call on all States to:

  6. note the risk of terrorist using electronic or wire communications
       systems and networks to carry out criminal acts and the need to
       find means, consistent with national law, to prevent such
       criminality.

  11. accelerate consultation, in appropriate bilateral or multilateral fora,
       on the use of encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
       government access to data and communications in order, inter alia,
       to prevent or investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the
       privacy of legitimate communications.

I've been putting whatever international information I come across at

Congress may be in recess, but Bill Clinton is still dreaming of expanded
FBI wiretap authority.  In this week's radio address, Clinton sought to
paint the GOP into a corner by depicting the opponents of his
"anti-terrorism" plan as "gun nuts."

Expect the White House to continue beating this drum throughout September.

      Clinton: GOP Listening To 'Gun
      Lobby Over Law Enforcement'

      JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) --
      President Clinton on Saturday accused the
      Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts
      to fight terrorism by kowtowing to the gun
      lobby.

      In his weekly radio address from Jackson,
      where the president and his family are
      vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had
      stripped his anti-terrorism bill of valuable tools "that law
      enforcement needs to help them find out, track down and shut down
      terrorists."

      The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
      anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and
      marking explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to
      the dealer who sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill
      and the assault weapons ban.

      [ ... ]

      Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti-
      terrorism legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and
      explosive taggant issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism
      bill of its own that excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not
      vote on the measure before adjourning for its August recess.

      [ ... ]

      "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
      country and the safety of our people," he said.

      The United States, he said, is not immune to terrorism, citing the
      Oklahoma City bombing and last month's bombing in Centennial
      Olympic Park in Atlanta as "brutal evidence."

Um, well, except that
- there are serious safety questions concerning adding taggants to black
and smokeless powder
- a taggant provision is of dubious utility in catching terrorist bombers,
since black powder is not difficult to make (and presumably anyone serious
about planting pipe bombs and not getting caught would take this small
additional step for self-protection)
- it's hard to see how taggants would help LE track powder anyway, since
powder from a given manufacturing lot can be and commonly is shipped to
dealers all over the country.

I do think the issues are separable, and the wiretapping provisions are
obviously of considerably greater relevance to this list (and to
free-speech activism) than the taggant nonsense is. But I wanted to correct
the misapprehension; as we know from bitter experience with the CDA,
getting non-facts accepted as conventional wisdom is one of the first steps
in promulgating bad laws and in demonizing those who oppose them.

&gt;    
&gt;    At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
&gt;    Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.

I believe this is false. As far as I know, no one has objected, other than
by calling him naive. Frank is on vacation and off the net until early
September, so I imagine the WSJ was unable to reach him for this story. 
People reacted to his action the same way they did to our Zundelsite mirrors
- -- despite the fact that Zundel is just a harmless neo-Nazi propagandist,
while Lemire is a bit more... activist. For *his* side of the story, see
http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html

&gt;    Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship
&gt;    from his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a
&gt;    white supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service
&gt;    provider,

This is false. He heard that they were being protested. Lemire has not been
kicked off. His site remains at http://www.ftcnet.com/~freedom, and the site
that the SWC-Canada was far more concerned about, www.ftcnet.com/~skinhds,
is still online, too. Oddly, none of the stores in the US press even mention
the skinheads site. The initial reports in the Canadian press didn't even
mention Lemire, because it really wasn't about him.

Funny... the Skinheads site admits that they won and will not be censored. 
Take a look at http://alpha.ftcnet.com/~skinhds/ -- "Well my site has
weathered the storm of controversy and is still afloat.  Despite the best
efforts of some of the enemies of free speech my service provider did not
capitulate."

I wonder how long Lemire plans to milk the publicity. Maybe trolling the
Wall Street Journal was enough.

&gt;    the teenager posted the site's entire contents in a
&gt;    compressed "mirror" file... 

This is false. Lemire created and posted the archive, soliciting mirror
sites. The first one online was www.alpha.org, but they've been having
technical problems, so Frank's was announced first. Frank's web page simply
links to Lemire's archive on ftcnet.com. Frank did not compile and is not
distributing the site's entire contents. 

&gt;    Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a
&gt;    task force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech --
&gt;    something the Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe,
&gt;    has laws against. 

This is highly misleading; I assume it was taken from either Declan's
article or Lemire's press release, as it shows a lack of understanding of
the political and legal situation in Canada.

I don't suppose the WSJ will admit that they were trolled? Frank has, but I
know that Declan won't. In fact, if it weren't for this sentence and the
fact that I'm Bcc'ing it to Vivian, I doubt Declan would allow this message
to hit fight-censorship at all.

&gt;    One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
&gt;    virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.)
&gt;    pushed his proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the

...and thanks to Biden, that recipe is now available through thomas.loc.gov.
What a moron.

&gt;    "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
&gt;    subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
&gt;    Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
&gt;    of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
&gt;    the Web.

No, Cyberwatch does no such thing. It just moans about it, giving no
specific examples. They don't even acknowledge the existence of other
organizations with policies that are both more effective and more respective
of freedom of speech, such as the Anti-Defamation League (which is larger
and older than the Wiesenthal Center, but strangely absent from press
reports of "jewish reaction to hate on the net") and Nizkor (which has far
more experience than either, but isn't jewish).

Subject: Column, Aug. 7


    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED Aug. 7, 1996
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Reading our mail

    Only in a nation already enormously out of touch with its founding
principle - that individual citizens and businesses have the right to do
just about any peaceful thing, while it's the powers of (start
ital)government(end ital) that are sharply restricted - could Congress find
itself debating whether to "allow" American computer firms to maintain
their lead in the multi-million-dollar overseas market for software
encryption.

  In plainer language, outfits like Netscape Communications and Tandem
Computers want "permission" to sell overseas programs like Pretty Good
Privacy - to which savvy American netsters now have free access - programs
which allow private e-mail messages and files to be encoded so government
snoops can't read them.

  The Clinton administration proposes that such exports be allowed only if
a decoding "key" is entrusted to a third party - such as a bank or
insurance company - which would then be subject to a court order or
subpoena should law enforcement personnel wish to break the code and
secretly read this electronic "mail."

  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in favor of such restrictions July 25,
arguing that "Uncontrolled export of U.S. computer codes may help
international criminals and terrorists hide their activities from law
enforcement."

  Well, yes, they probably do. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in New York on
charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners, used a laptop computer
containing files the FBI still hasn't been able to decode.
  But note the past tense. Terrorists have already got this stuff. Anything
in the possession of an American teenager can be (likely has been) uploaded
onto the Internet, and then downloaded without anyone being the wiser in
Baghdad, Tripoli, or Tangiers.

  The real goal here is to control the ability of American citizens to
communicate with one another without government snoops reading over their
shoulders. When Director Freeh warns that "Encryption products used
unchecked by criminals and terrorists for their illegal activities pose an
extremely serious threat," it's worth remembering that federal agencies
have, in recent years, used the terms "criminal" and "terrorist" to
describe peaceful worshippers and their children at the Branch Davidian
Church in Waco, MOVE activists in Philadelphia, an unarmed Idaho mother
with a nursing baby in her arms, and any number of perhaps misguided but
far-from-violent tax protesters, home schoolers, barter exchange operators,
and practitioners of alternative medicine, to name just a few.

  Once the possessor of such stuff can be arrested and jailed for years on
charges of "exporting a munition" for the mere act of posting the
mathematical formula on the Internet, does it make sense to pretend
Americans will still be free to use such encryption domestically?
  Those who favor an authoritarian, hierarchical society have grown
accustomed to the fact that the political opinions available to most
American government-school graduates have long been "filtered" through the
news desks of a few television networks and major wire services. The
unregulated, spontaneous nature of Internet communications frightens such
souls with dark nightmares of anarchy, the same way King George hated the
colonial "Committees of Correspondence."

  As Stephen Chapman of the Chicago Tribune pointed out in his nationally
syndicated column June 19, "We can be grateful that ink and paper didn't
make their first appearance the day before yesterday . Otherwise, Congress
and the president would be scrambling frantically to make sure that these
communication tools would not be used for purposes unapproved by the
government."

  If the idea of a government service delivering letters between private
citizens were being introduced today, wouldn't Director Freeh similarly
argue against the "extremely serious threat" that criminals and terrorists
might use this new "mail" system to keep their secrets, should the
government allow the use of glue-flapped "envelopes"?
  But wait, you say: The secret "keys" would only be available upon
issuance of a "court order."

  And this guarantee would be enforced, I presume, by the same courts that
today regularly excuse the short-circuiting of any and all such existing
safeguards so long as the federals assert a "compelling government
interest" in hunting drug dealers, nabbing  "money-launderers," or whatever
dastardly new crime of the week they care to allege?

  It's understandable that repressive regimes like China are pulling out
every stop to register and track private users of the Internet. When
legislators show similar instincts in what was once the "Land of the Free,"
it's their own premises which they ... and we ... should re-examine.

U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the
proposed action as ineffective:  "This is not a solution, it is just hiding
the problem."  (Financial Times 10 Aug 96)

        It was hard to wake up, that morning. The pillow to the right
of her was bewildered at its own unaccustomed chill. She had gathered
all the blankets around herself and no one had been there to pull them
back; this more than anything reminded her of her aloneness and she
very nearly turned back onto her side to weep herself to sleep.

I'm not sure this is the most effective or noticeable action, but what 
the heck.  Personally, I'd advocate doing whatever you think is most 
useful, just do it on the 31st, and let local media know with a short fax 
soon that Aug. 31 is Internet Censorship Protest Day.  If you've been of 
a mind to organize a rally, make it snappy. No better time.  I don't 
think this short alert has gone out very far yet.

Got a note this morning from a U.K. journalist who spoke with PSInet:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversation this am with a leading light at a large ISP here (subsidiary
of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and
essentially said, either you do something about it, or we'll do something
about it.  The guy said they'd pulled the groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups were "pedophile" areas. But the
FT report talks about Scotland Yard pressuring Internet providers to block
"hard-core pornography."

&gt; &gt;CYBERGANGS
&gt; &gt;The head of the gang task force for the Arizona Department of Public Safety
&gt; &gt;reports that a Web site established in Detroit offers a how-to guide for
&gt; &gt;gangster wannabes and is urging gang members everywhere to unite under its
&gt; &gt;umbrella to form the first cyberspace gang.  The official says:  "Now it's

&gt; &gt;about it."  (Atlanta Journal-Constitution 8 Aug 96 F3)

A meme on the rise: like cyberporn, "cybergangs" can reach into your living
room and corrupt Junior. Perhaps grandstanding politicans may use
"cybergangs" as a pretext for a crackdown -- not a war on drugs, but a War
on the Net?

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;
&gt; Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups are "pedophile" areas. But the
&gt; FT report paints the situation much more broadly -- Internet providers are
&gt; blocking "pornography."

Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child
pornographic newsgroups. I have side accounts at 3 major ISPs that all
have as close to a full newsfeed as is physically possible, I think.
They all have almost an identical roster of available newsgroups (other
than local ones of course, very few of which anywhere are pornographic in
nature.)  Out of those, only the following newsgroups would appear to
qualify at first blush:

alt.sex.pedophilia
alt.sex.pedophilia.boys
alt.sex.pedophilia.girls
alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.sex.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.d
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.sex.pre-teens
alt.sex.teens
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

[I admit the possibility of missing a keyword. I did a search for
"child", "kid", "teen", "lolita", "young", "youth" and "pedo". There
might be, say, a "nambla" match, now that I think about it, but obscure
keywords like that are unlikely to find enough newsgroups to strongly
affect the outcome of this quick examination.]

Of these, many can be immediately eliminated, as they are discussion
groups, not binaries group, or are typos ("binaires") and ergo not carried
by 99% or so of usenet (though available on a few sites like the WELL where
the admins allow the automatic availability of every newsgroup known to
the system, even ones created just to create a stupid-named newsgroup
with no intention that it will ever be used.)

This leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

Now, of these all the "young" and "teen" groups have to be eliminated,
since "young" is to vague to mean anything more specific that "younger
than middle aged", and teen can refer to 18 or 19 (or even younger legal
ages, if the UK is like Australia and sets age of consent at 16 instead
of US & Canada's 18).  If you actually look in these groups there appears
to be nothing but flames, blather, and BBS ads, almost none, if any, of
which will be childporn, since that would be a major cop magnet.
Lolita.misc and pedophilia.swaps also have be dropped, as too vague to
clearly indicate child pornographic visual content.  The de. newsgroup is
also probably not carried by many sites outside of Germany. (WELL had it,
but my other ISPs didn't. Probably WELL is trading news with a site in
Germany for some reason - maybe the .de site can't get a decent news
feed? I dunno).

That leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking


Six likely suspect newsgroups for genuine illegal content in the form of
child pornography.  It's highly questionable whether real child porn
shows up on any such newsgroup with any regularity, if at all. Again, the
content seems to consist of flames and blatant BBS ads (though I'm not
dumb enough to actually download the material, since that could count as
"possession" if some of it is really child porn.)  I even recall the
creation of a few of these - they were newgrouped simply to piss people
off with no intention of actually using the newsgroups. They were
instantly rmgrouped, and are unavailable on all sites that honor
"official" alt.config rmgroups, which is probably the vast majority of
news servers.

Much ado about nothing.

Also, none of this even touches the question of whether liability adheres
to providing access to something that happens to contain child porn
simply becuase is *sounds* child pornographic. By this logic, even if is
eventually established that an ISP could not be held liable for child
porn content in general, absent guilty knowledge, an ISP could be held
liable for it if someone posted a message with "child porn" in the
subject line, and it actually did contain child porn, regardless of the
fact that any message by that name is more likely to be a discussion
thread about child porn and the problems it causes, that to be actual
child porn.

The UK cops are making the mistake of assuming that every label is.
first, always accurate, and second, non-ambigious.  That's a very stupid
set of assumptions.

Either way you look at it, this is ridiculous.

Either:

a) the UK police bureucrats have taken all newsgroup names at face
value and have targetted most of the initial long list near the top of this
message, even though most are obviously intended to be discussion areas
and don't carry child porn itself, or

b) they are going after 5 or so newsgroups that are, at least in name,
definitely child pornographic, PLUS a buch of others (the rest of the 20)
like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.male, or whatever, that have nothing at
all, even in name, to do with child porn, as the article Declan quotes
seems to suggest (I think this quite possible, since it's unlikely that
many if any UK hosts have this many pedophillic-sounding newsgroups. Only
the biggest and most bandwidth rich US ISPs carry them all, so the UK
cops probably don't even know about the majority of the newsgroups in the
top, large, list.)

A and B are *both* stupid and indefensible.

The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the
contents of the newgroups in question and worked to locate those posting
any genuine child porn, and prosecute them (with an eye to the fact that
its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

BY FAX: +65-375-7765

Mr. George Yeo
Minister for Information and the Arts
460 Alexandra Road, 37th Story
PSA Building
Singapore 119963

Dear Mr. Yeo,

     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the recent
decision by the Singapore government to establish strict controls on Internet
use. The implementation of the Class License Scheme, which, according to a
July 11 government news release, "will focus on content which may undermine
public morals, political stability and religious harmony,"ensures a leading
role for Singapore among international promoters of online censorship. This is
a particularly unfortunate role for Singapore, which has been a leader in the
development and promotion of Internet use in Asia. It places Singapore in the
same category as countries like China, where Internet users must endure
onerous restrictions.

     One of the most unique and valuable characteristics of the Internet is
its ability to establish easy, inexpensive and practically instantaneous
communication between the farthest points of the earth. By prohibiting
connections between its citizens and various Web sites outside its borders,
Singapore is in essence removing itself from the global Internet. If, as will
surely happen, its example is followed in other countries, the Internet, which
held such promise as the world's first truly global medium, will be nothing
more than a set of country-specific networks where local prejudices and fears
are reinforced by technology.

     Our specific objections concern Singapore's decision to regulate the
Internet as if it were a broadcast medium. Unlike broadcast media, the
Internet is the first truly mass medium. Through e-mail, it allows individuals
with nothing more than a computer and a modem to express their views to an
international audience. Even the World Wide Web differs significantly from a
broadcast medium in that individuals are not confronted with a particular site
upon connecting to the Web--they may choose whichever sites they choose to
visit. As with other forms of Internet communication, anyone may put up his or
her own site on the Web. The Singapore government's own use of Web pages
demonstrates how the Internet can be used to propound a particular point of
view. Its citizens, so long as they are not using their site to incite to
violence, should have the same opportunity to express views as their
government. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights:

     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
     to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
     media and regardless of frontiers.

     We are particularly concerned that restrictions have been placed on
Singaporeans who wish to discuss religious and political ideas online. It is
only through unrestricted discussions of such serious topics by all members of
society, no matter how unpopular their views, that these subjects become less
explosive. Forbidding discussion--in effect, treating its citizens like
children--will, on the other hand, ensure that dangerous topics remain just
that.

     We are also concerned that the extraordinarily broad categories of
forbidden content, as outlined by the SBA, will encourage arbitrary
restrictions on communication. According to the Internet Content Guidelines,
the following topics are banned.

     Public Security and National Defense

          a.   Contents which jeopardize public security or national
               defense.
          b.   Contents which undermine the public confidence in the
               administration of justice.
          c.   Contents which present information or events in such a
               way that alarms or misleads all or any of the public.
          d.   Contents which tend to bring the Government into
               hatred or contempt, or which excite disaffection
               against the Government.

     Racial and Religious Harmony

          a.   Contents which denigrate or satirize any racial or
               religious group.
          b.   Contents which bring any race or religion into hatred
               or resentment.
          c.   Contents which promote religious deviations or occult
               practices such as Satanism.

          Public Morals

          a.        Contents which are pornographic or otherwise obscene.
          b.        Contents which propagate permissiveness or
                    promiscuity.
          c.        Contents which depict or propagate gross exploitation
                    of violence, nudity, sex or horror.
          d.   Contents which depict or propagate sexual perversions
               such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia.

By banning such subjects a chill will be sent through the online community in
Singapore, and will render the Internet essentially useless in allowing any
kind of serious discussion.

     In addition to forbidding particular content, the government has also
announced that some sites will be banned. Internet service providers were
given the deadline of September 14, 1996,  to begin using proxy
servers--devices that can prohibit connections to specified sites--to
connect all their
subscribers.

     Although the government has promised to use a light hand in regulating
the Internet, its activities even at this early stage indicate otherwise. A
July 12 posting in the Usenet newsgroup "soc.culture.singapore" was reportedly
removed at the request of the SBA, who asked local Internet service providers
for its removal because it alleged that lawyers at a local law firm were
incompetent. The request came, according to the Straits Times, after the law
firm complained to the government. Despite the removal from the newsgroup, the
message is still widely available to Singaporeans through other Internet
sources, indicating that content control will be difficult unless Internet
access is restricted even further.

     We hope that the Singapore government will retract these repressive new
regulations, and support the development of an unfettered Internet. Instead of
using its power to restrict Internet use, the government could play a truly
useful role by devising ways to expand its use to even the most disaffected
members of its population.

                                   Sincerely,
                                   Sidney Jones
                                   Executive Director

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

You're forgetting the tortuous British obscenity laws.  For example, it's
illegal to show an erect penis in Britain.  The police are just trying
enforce the censorious powers the government has always given them.

News Release   August 15, 1996 
---------------------------------------------------- 
 
Free Speech 101: ACLU Gives Princeton University an "F"  
for Barring Political Speech on its Network 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             
Wednesday, August 15, 1996 
 
Contact: Ann Beeson, ACLU National (212) 944-9800, x788 
David Rocah, ACLU of New Jersey (201) 642-2084 
 
NEW YORK--In a letter sent today to Princeton University officials,  the
American Civil Liberties Union urged them to reconsider a policy barring
students and staff from using the computer network for "political
purposes."  
   
The letter was sparked by complaints the ACLU national office received over
a recent memo from Princeton officials advising faculty, staff and
students, "especially in this year of a presidential election," that the
school's not-for-profit status barred it from allowing use of the computer
network "for political purposes." 
 
The ACLU called this conclusion mistaken, pointing out in its letter that
the Internal Revenue Code specifies that only the University itself is
barred from political activity -- not faculty, staff, or students acting
independently.  In fact, the ACLU said, the IRS has previously held that
statements in support of political candidates appearing on the editorial
page of a student newspaper would not be considered violations of a
university's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. 
 
"Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network," the ACLU letter
stated, "it is an unjustified content-based restriction on the free
expression rights of students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is
not only unworthy of a great university like Princeton, it is in violation
of the New Jersey State Constitution."  The letter was signed by ACLU
national staff attorney Ann Beeson and David Rocah, staff attorney of the
ACLU of New Jersey. 
   
"We understand the university's concerns regarding it's tax-exempt status,"
Rocah said.  "But this is free speech 101.  Sadly, Princeton is not making
the grade."    
 
Rocah said the ACLU would consider legal action if the university refuses
to drop its censorship policy. 
 
"Traditionally, college campuses are the center of political discussion and
debate," said Beeson.  "The fact that the debate is taking place on the
Internet does not mean that the speech is any less deserving of
protection."  
 
Beeson added that the policy could bar students and staff from a wide range
of protected expression, including downloading position papers from the
Dole or Clinton website; sending e-mail to their parents urging them to
vote for Ralph Nader; and organizing online discussion groups for  student
chapters of politically active groups such as Greenpeace.   In short, Rocah
said, "Everything that would be acceptable, even welcome, off-line, becomes
off-limits on the Internet."  
   
In its letter, the ACLU called on the school to take a leadership role in
the academic community:  "As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a
leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to
promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its
community, to the very limits of the law," the letter said. 
 
Beeson added that the ACLU  is working to develop model guidelines for 
colleges and universities to help sort out the confusion in academia
regarding free expression on the Internet.  Many schools have already put
in place "Appropriate Use Policies" to police student and faculty computer 
use, some of which violate rights of free expression, Beeson said.

Mr. Harold Shapiro 
President                 BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, & REGULAR MAIL 
1 Nassau Hall 
Princeton University 
Princeton NJ 85044 
 
RE: Computer Use Policy 
 
Dear President Shapiro: 
 
In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton
University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ)
to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University
from using the Princeton's computer network for "political purposes."  We
believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding
the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic
freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.

 
Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students
widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet
greatly expanded the resources available for academic research.  It also
provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas.  In
contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for
"political purposes" unjustifiably interferes with the right of the
University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.

 
Princeton's current computer use policy holds that "the Computing and
network resources of the University may not be used by members of the
University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial
gain . . . ."  Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter "Rights," attached
as Appendix A).  On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent
an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use
of the Internet or computer network for "any participation in, or
intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
public office" would result in disciplinary action.  See Office of the
General Counsel, "Internet use and Politics," E-mail of July 19, 1996,
attached as Appendix B. 
 
We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a
concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to
use the computer network for political purposes.  We believe that this
concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal
Revenue Service. 
 
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization
will be tax-exempt as long as it "does not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office."  The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to
constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the
political activity must be that of the University itself and not the
individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students.  See Internal
Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for
1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C.  Thus, any personal
communication by University members over the computer network cannot
threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the
communication takes place does not change this conclusion.  The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether
the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political
activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the
university under Internal Revenue Code  501(c)(3), is whether the
facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for
non-political reasons.  Id. at 427.  Princeton provides fair and equal
access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access,
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes.  See Rights at 11.  Thus, political speech over the
network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with
a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status.  The
Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that
required its students in a certain political science course to participate
in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during
the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the
meaning of Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  See Revenue Ruling 75-512,
1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D. 
 
In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on
the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not
participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political
candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper.  This was
true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities
to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were
clearly those of the students and not of the university itself.  See
Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E. 
 
Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by
allowing University members to use its computer network for political
purposes.  We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for
official positions of the University.  At most, the only permissible
regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the
University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a
reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official
position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the
opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone.
 Compare Rights, "Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the
University and Political Activities," at Section 3. 
 
Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an
unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of
students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of
a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of
the New Jersey Constitution. 
 
Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey
Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been
sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to
honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression.  See State v.
Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against
the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994)
(holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive
use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet).  Princeton's
computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton "campus" as are the
lawns and buildings.  Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its
students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the
Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech
in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus. 
 
Political expression has always received the highest degree of
constitutional protection.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). 
The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship
those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for
political candidates.  Indeed, "where political speech is involved, our
tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion,
the narrowest range for restriction.'"  State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412
(1980).  As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in
American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and
defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to
the very limits of the law. 
 
The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free
speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive
information.  Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (right
to receive information precludes government from labeling certain
publications "propaganda") (Brennan, J., concurring); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) ("right of freedom of speech . . .
includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . .
receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of
thought, and freedom to teach . . . .  Without these peripheral rights the
specific rights would be less secure."); Kreimer v. Bur. of Police for Town
of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1350-55 (3d Cir. 1992) (listing cases).  This
is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the
Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community.  See
ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996).  They
provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access
information on virtually any topic, including politics. 
 
Finally, the computer use policy is in conflict with other University
policies and practices.  Princeton recognizes that 
 
     "the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the
discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching
and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and
learning to society at large.  Free inquiry and free expression within the
academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. 
The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate
conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in
classrooms and lecture halls." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 
With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it
has a fundamental responsibility to ensure 
 
    "the opportunity for all members of the University community to
exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . .  Encouragement of an
interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social
responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal
education.  The University continues to consider self-chosen participation
in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable
part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage.  Such activities
on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to,
imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or
point of view." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Guidelines Relating to Tax Exempt Status." 
 
For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal the existing
ban on use of the computer network for political purposes, and we look
forward to your early reply.

Bomb info OK in books but G-7 wants it off Net

By COLMAN JONES

While the fury over child porn on the net appears to be losing steam
after the defeat of the Communications Decency Act in June, there's a a
growing new cyber-backlash against terrorists.  

At a meeting in Paris last month, just before the downing of TWA flight
800 and the bombing in Atlanta, Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers
and security ministers struck an agreement to target terrorists using
the internet.  

The pact calls for international controls on the net to cut off access
to sites containing "dangerous" information, restrict electronic speech
by unpopular political organizations and allow governments to decode
privately encrypted communications.

The Paris meeting ended with a commitment to have reports ready by the
end of the year on ways of instituting such restrictions.

[...]

Bomb info

Many press accounts fume about bomb-making information available
online, without mentioning that the "offensive'' material being
targeted is no different from identical material easily obtained in
public libraries, college libraries and bookstores. A case in point is
the World's Biggest Bookstore, which stocks the Anarchist Cookbook, a
virtual how-to guide to subversive activity, also available online.  

Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who helped to draw
up the Paris agreement, cited the fact that his his 11-year-old son
showed him how to access extremist literature from the World Wide Web.
Axworthy's spokesperson, Catherine Lappe, says the pact is "not an
issue of trying to censor people" .  

"If you look at the communique, it says very clearly that all this
would have to be in compliance with national laws, so the issues of
privacy would be of utmost importance.''

The University of Nebraska is threatening web pages that have the word
"Husker" in their title, according to the message attached below. Guess
they'll have to go after these sites too:

       Husker Power web site
       Asger Schnack: Jeg Husker Alt
       (AP) Husker QB Brook Berringer killed in plane crash near NU campus
       Husker Du
       Penstemon 'Husker Red' is 1996 Perennial Plant of the Year
       Husker midwestern home design
       Joel's Husker Page

I've set up a web page at http://www.well.com/~declan/huskers.html and
registered the URL with AltaVista and HotBot. It's called: "Husker web
pages, the University of Nebraska, and braindead policies."

I wonder what the university will do, if anything? This message is copied
to some University of Nebraska administrators and faculty members.

Husker Web Pages Must Cease

To: huskers@pumpkin.tssi.com
Subject: Husker Web Pages Must Cease
From: mfricke@serv01.net-link.net (Mark E. Fricke)
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:59:55 -0400

I hate to be the bearer of real bad news, but if you have a personal
web site on the internet that features any logos, graphics, audio or
even the page name of Cornhusker or Husker (like the Husker Press Box)
be prepared to get a Cease and desist letter from the University of
Nebraska's attorney's. The problem is simple. A lot of money has been
paid to license the name and logo's of the Huskers and there are many
business interests to protect. Pinnacle Broadcasting is the exclusive
rights holder for internet usage of the name and logos (and you thought
the live broadcasts were all good).

Now..there are a couple of things we can do. #1 remove all references
to Huskers, Big Red, Cornhuskers etc. from THE PAGES TITLE. You can
still talk about, mention, berate or praise the team within the page,
just not in the page title. The reason here is that the University
wants all search engines (yahoo, excite, infoseek etc.) to send
searches for the Huskers to their site (huskerwebcast)

#2 remove all licensed logo's, pictures of Herbie audio of the band
etc. from your site.

#3 There is one more solution. Huskerwebcast will allow pages to exist
as they are if they are housed within THEIR page. Wether that mean they
will have hyperlinks to these hidden pages or if you will actually have
to set up an account and an FTP site to their server I'm not clear on.
I'm awaiting confirmation on this.

Okay, now my personal views. Yeah it's a bummer...a great big bummer. I
really don't see how private personal pages could possibly infringe on
the marketing dollars of the University (except for logos, you got me
there) But PAGE NAMES?!?!. They seem a little greedy fo rthe traffic.
I'm no lawyer (maybe some of you out there are and know something about
public domain)so I will do what I must with the Husker Press Box.  I
will still provide the page in some manner, either changing the name or
joining the University page. Luckily I have already been extended an
offer to do that. I will wait and see. My advise to other Husker wep
page masters. Be ready for a letter and be ready to reacte. this is a
big University with lots of money and lots of attorney's

Recently the London police sent a letter to U.K. Internet providers saying
that 133 Usenet newsgroups must be banned.

&gt;From observations at &lt;http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship&gt;, it's clear that:

       the Police regard ISPs as publishers
       the publication of obscene materials is an offence
       the Police expect ISPs to continuously monitor newsgroups and
           to remove those which contain illegal materials

More ominously, the letter says "Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive
and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups identifying and taking
necessary action against those others found to contain such material...
This list is only the starting point..." Also, the police have said they
have the power to arrest Internet providers and seize their equipment.

This move by the Brits is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising. I have
background about many more international net-censorship attempts at:

To all subscribers:

Our upstream provider, VBCNet, has informed us that today, they, and
other ISPs in the UK have received a notification from the Metropolitan
Police to remove 134 news groups from their news servers. Therefore, we
are no longer being fed these groups. As many of you will have seen,
recently, in a thread in the waverider.support newsgroup, Wave Rider
Internet Plc are
opposed to such censorship as a matter of principle - as I know many
of you are.

The letter from the Met makes it clear that this is only the
beginning - they plan to ban whatever newsgroups they see fit over the
coming months.

We urge you all to protest this action - use the media, contact your
MPs, generate whatever protest you see fit - or the UK Internet is going
to be operated by the whim of the Clubs & Vice unit of the Metropolitan
Police.

At present, Wave Rider Internet Plc have received no such notification from
the police, and will therefore not be removing any groups. However, as
we're not being fed them anymore, that's academic - there will shortly be
nothing in them.

I am enclosing the copy of the letter from the Met, that we have been
sent by VBCNet.

Like other UK ISPs, VBCnet today received a demand from the Metropolitan
Police that some 134 news groups be deleted from our news machines.
The letter makes it clear that this is only the beginning, that they
will be banning more groups and requiring ISPs to enforce their
dictats.  We have with great reluctance complied with their demand.

While we do not disagree that the articles in some of these groups are
often objectionable, we disagree in principle with this form of censorship.

We urge all of you to make it clear to your customers why these news
groups have been withdrawn and we urge you to contact your MPs and
the media about this arbitrary action by the police.  If there is no
protest, if a precedent is established, the UK Internet is going to
fall under the control of the Clubs and Vice Unit at Charing Cross
Police Station.

VBCnet is setting up a Web page to protest this action.  It should be
available at
        http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship
by the end of the day.  We will add pointers to other protesting Web
pages -- well, the ones that are calm and reasonable.  ;-)

Dear Sir / Madam

Pornographic Material on the Internet

Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.

We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.

This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.

We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.

Yours Faithfully


Stephen French
Chief Inspector

A longtime anti-porn crusader, Phyllis Schlafly generally is no friend of

                    Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother


     August 8, 1996                             by Phyllis Schlafly

     We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
     recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all
     Americans who care about civil liberties should vigorously resist
     President Clinton's attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an
     excuse to carry on his all-out war against the personal privacy of
     law-abiding Americans.

     This mind-set was first revealed in the Clinton health care bill,
     which would have given the government computer access to the
     medical records of all Americans. Fortunately, that totalitarian
     takeover of the health care industry was rejected.

     The Clinton Administration's education legislation now pending in
     Congress would put personal information about all schoolchildren
     -- academic, medical, attitudinal, behavioral, and family -- into
     an expanded Labor Market Information database available to the
     government, as well as to prospective employers.

     Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for
     individual Americans to have private conversations with one
     another. That's the real meaning of its effort to control
     encryption technology, and it's a direct assault on the First
     Amendment.

     It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First
     Amendment guarantees our right to speak in public but not in
     private. It would be just as ridiculous to say that we have
     freedom to speak in words that the government can understand, but
     not in words the government can't decipher.

     Americans have the right to speak to one another in private,
     behind closed doors, and we should likewise have the right to
     speak to one another in code and to put our coded messages on
     computer in a process called encryption. Americans would not
     tolerate the government opening and reading the letters we send
     through the mails, and we should not tolerate the government
     opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
     computer.

     Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and
     Vice President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our
     encrypted messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of
     California, Reno bluntly stated her demand for "ensuring law
     enforcement access to encrypted data.''

     Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government
     should create a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly
     "neutral third party''), to which all Americans should be forced
     to "entrust'' the keys to their encrypted messages, and to which
     the government would have access. On the contrary, there is no
     such consensus.

     Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do
     you trust the FBI to keep your files confidential?

     The Clinton Administration is already doing 30 to 40 percent more
     federal telephone wiretaps and other electronic surveillance than
     the last year of the Bush Administration. Those figures don't even
     include national security wiretaps or the hundreds of extensions
     granting more time for wiretap orders already issued.

     FBI Director Freeh wrote the New York Times last November that
     "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the
     extent of wiretapping." Four months later, FBI documents revealed
     that the FBI does, in fact, plan to increase electronic
     surveillance 54 percent by 1998 and 130 percent by 2004.

     On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will
     continue to push for the adoption of a massive public key
     infrastructure to give the government access to all encrypted
     communications. In a blatant bid for a police-state surveillance
     society, Gore warned about "the dangers of unregulated encryption
     technology."

     A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to
     make policy recommendations about encryption. The panel called on
     the government to abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.

     The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would
     enhance our national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of
     its 16 members had security clearances with access to secret
     information, and they saw no national security reason to justify
     the Clinton policy.

     The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private
     encryption on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping.
     However, the NSC panel concluded that the ability of the private
     sector to transfer confidential financial and other data over the
     information highway without interception is far more important.

     New technologies have given government awesome power to spy on
     individuals. The Filegate investigation accidentally uncovered the
     shocking news that, as soon as Bill Clinton entered the White
     House in 1993, he secretly spent $400,000 on software to create a
     highly sophisticated computer database to track detailed
     political, financial, attitudinal, and personal biographical
     information on 200,000 people, including members of Congress and
     the media. Known as WHODB for White House Office Data Base, the
     system was nicknamed Big Brother.

     Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the
     Clinton Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would
     be the biggest expansion of federal power since the passage of the
     Income Tax Amendment in 1913.
