<BODY>
<H2>Report on the Uniform Adoption Act</H2>
<P><BR></P>
<HR>
<P>Part of the mandate of the Commission is to study and make recommendations
to the Legislature on legislative proposals advanced by the National Conference
of Commissioners an Uniform State Laws.  One of the most significant recent
proposals to come from that body is the Uniform Adoption Act (1994), 9 Uniform
Laws Ann. 5 et seq. (1995 Supp.).  The Act supersedes the revised Uniform
Adoption Act of 1969.</P>
<P>The Uniform Adoption Act is a sweeping new state adoption code, which is
intended to be comprehensive.  The Uniform Act examines and revises virtually
every aspect of adoption practice.  Its provisions would revise many existing
state laws in response to federal constitutional and statutory law, delineate
the legal consequences of several different kinds of adoptions, regulate and
enforce choices of parties with respect to privacy or openness in adoptions, and
promote the welfare of children by facilitating the placement of minor children
who cannot be raised by their original parents.  The Act is largely the work
product of Professor Joan Heifetz Hollinger, who is also the principal author
and editor of <B>Adoption Law and Practice</B> (1988).  The Act has not yet
been adopted in any state, although it is reported to be under consideration in
several state legislatures.</P>
<P>Michigan's adoption laws, which are found in the Michigan Adoption Code, the
Paternity Act, the juvenile chapter of the Probate Code, the Child Custody Act
of 1970, and Michigan Court Rules, have never been modelled on any version of
the Uniform Adoption Act, although they address many of the concerns raised by
that legislation in ways made unique by the structure of Michigan law and
courts.  After a great deal of process and consideration, the Michigan
Legislature made extensive revisions to the Michigan adoption laws and
procedures in 1994.  Many of these revisions were responsive to the same changes
in decisional law that prompted the drafting of the Uniform Adoption Act in
1994.  The changes were carefully crafted to reflect adoption practice in
Michigan.</P>
<P>Because the Legislature has so recently and carefully addressed these
issues, and because the Uniform Adoption Act has yet to be tested in the
legislative process or in practice in any state, the Commission recommends that
the Legislature defer consideration of the Uniform Adoption Act (1994) at this
time.  Once Michigan has more experience with its own revisions, and other
states have experience with the new Uniform Act, the Commission and the
Legislature may have better information on which to revisit these important
issues.</P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="ATTENDANCE">ATTENDANCE</A></H4>
<P>Experience has demonstrated that students who are absent excessively usually
are not able to achieve the minimum scholastic average required for continuance
in the College.  In addition, accreditation requirements demand that each
approved law school adopt and enforce policies relating to class attendance. 
Every student, accordingly, is required to attend class.  Excessive absences may
result in a reduction in grade or a denial of permission to take the final
examination in the course(s) in which the absences occur. Denial of permission
to take a final examination will result in a grade of &quot;W&quot; in the
course.</P>
<H4><A NAME="EMPLOYMENT">EMPLOYMENT</A></H4>
<P>Although part-time employment in law-related fields can assist law students
substantially both financially and professionally, such employment also can
impose time pressures which detract significantly from legal studies.  Students
attending school on a full-time basis may not engage in outside employment in
excess of 20 hours per week.  Students who must work more than 20 hours per week
should enroll in the evening division.</P>
<H4><A NAME="EXAMINATIONS">EXAMINATIONS</A></H4>
<P>Final written examinations are required in most courses at the close of each
semester. In addition, other examinations may be required from time to time
during a course.  The student's final grade will be based principally upon
his/her achievement as reflected in such examinations.</P>
<P>If a student is unable to take a final examination for reasons beyond
his/her control, such as illness or other emergency, a grade of &quot;I&quot;
(incomplete) may be entered in the student's records for that course.  In such a
case, the student may complete the course and earn credit therein by taking the
examination no later than the next regularly scheduled examination in the same
course.  Written application for the entry of a grade of &quot;I&quot;
(incomplete) must be made promptly to the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs.</P>
<P>To assure uniform grading, whenever both the day and evening courses in a
particular subject are taught in the same semester by the same professor, only
one examination is given.  Day students are required to attend the evening
examination session for such examinations. </P>
<P>All exam time conflicts must be reported to the Registrar's Office no later
than two weeks before the examination period.  There will be a $10 proctor fee
for any person who has a time conflict in examinations.</P>
<P>The maintenance of the integrity of law school examination procedures and
other writing requirements is a matter of the utmost importance not only to the
reputation of Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University, but to the
reputation of the legal profession.  Any student found guilty of an examination
irregularity, whether before, during or after an examination, will be subject to
discipline.  Similarly, any student found guilty of plagiarism in the submission
of a written assignment will be subject to discipline.  Such a finding may be
based upon any probative evidence of, but not limited to, the following:</P>
<P>(a) Any conversation with another student during an examination,
irrespective of the subject matter of that conversation.</P>
<P>(b) The possession in the examination  area of any prohibited material,
irrespective of its use.</P>
<P>(c) Any perusal of another student's examination answer, irrespective of any
use of such perusal.</P>
<P>(d) Use of another person's writings without attribution.</P>
<P>Copies of the Code of Student Discipline and the DCL/MSU Policy Statement on
Plagiarism  are available in the Registrar's Office.</P>
<H4><A NAME="GRADING">GRADING SYSTEM</A></H4>
<P>Once a student is enrolled in a course, he or she will receive one of the
following grades:</P>
<P><B>A</B> Signifies that the student's work in the course has been
excellent.</P>
<P><B>B</B> Signifies that the student's work in the course has been good.</P>
<P><B>C</B> Signifies that the student's work in the course has been
satisfactory.</P>
<P><B>D</B> Signifies that the student's work in the course has been
inadequate, but passing.</P>
<P><B>F</B> Signifies that the student's work in the course has been failing. 
No credit hours are awarded for work undertaken and completed with this grade. 
Any student receiving a grade of <B>F</B> in any course required for graduation
must repeat, and successfully complete with a passing grade, any such course
failed within two (2) semesters from that semester in which the failing grade
was received.  All grades are counted in the student's cumulative grade point
average except as varied by the Reexamination Policy.</P>
<P><B>W</B> Signifies that the student has withdrawn from the course.  A
student may withdraw, without permission, at any time prior to entering the
examination room.  Once the student enters the examination room he/she is
committed to receiving a grade. Withdrawal from any course during a semester
will affect eligibility for Faculty, Trustee or Honors scholarships and
eligibility for <I>Law Review</I>, and may affect residency requirements and
eligibility for financial aid.  Excessive withdrawal from courses may result in
the inability to complete the curriculum within the required number of years.</P>
<P><B>I</B> Signifies that the student was unable to take the final
examination for reasons beyond his/her control. </P>
<P>An application for the entry of the grade of <B>I</B> must be made promptly
by the student.  The granting or denial thereof is within the discretion of the
Assistant Dean for Student Affairs, whose determination is final.  If granted,
the student must complete the course and earn credit therein by taking the
examination no later than the next regularly scheduled examination in the same
course.  A failure to complete the course will result in the grade being changed
to a <B>W</B>.</P>
<P>The grades of <B>B, C</B> and <B>D</B> may be supplemented by the
designation of a <B>PLUS</B>. The effect of such supplementation is to add
one-half honor point for each hour of this grade.</P>
<P>Some elective courses are offered only on a Pass/Fail basis.  This fact is
noted in the general course descriptions.</P>
<P>A student's grade point average each semester and his/her cumulative grade
point average are computed by dividing the honor points earned by the number of
hours of work attempted.</P>
<P>Honor points are awarded:</P>
<P><B>A</B>  = 4.0 honor points <BR><B>B+</B> = 3.5 honor points <BR><B>B</B>
 = 3.0 honor points <BR><B>C+</B> = 2.5 honor points <BR><B>C</B>  = 2.0
honor points <BR><B>D+</B> = 1.5 honor points <BR><B>D</B>  = 1.0 honor
points <BR><B>F</B>  = 0.0 honor points</P>
<P>It is the policy of Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University to
post student grades 30 days after the last exam is scheduled and to mail a grade
report to students within 60 days after the date of the last exam.</P>
<H4><A NAME="PASS/FAIL">PASS/FAIL OPTION</A></H4>
<P>Students may elect to register for no more than two (2) elective offerings
with a maximum of five (5) total credit hours to be graded on a Pass/Fail rather
than a letter grade basis.  The election must be made at the time of
registration for the class, is not available for required courses and is limited
to a maximum of five (5) credit hours toward total credit hours required for
graduation.  An election to take or not to take a course on a Pass/Fail basis is
irrevocable after the conclusion of the Drop/Add period.  For this Pass/Fail
election, the <B>minimum passing</B> grade is a D+.  Accordingly, students who
elect to take a course on a Pass/Fail basis and earn a <B>grade of &quot;D&quot;
or lower will be deemed to have failed the course</B>.  A Fail is computed in
the GPA as an &quot;F&quot; grade would be in a graded course.  Courses offered
only on a Pass/Fail basis (such as Moot Court and certain externships) are
outside the scope of this rule.</P>
<H4>WITHDRAWAL</H4>
<P>Except as otherwise specifically provided, a student may withdraw from the
College at any time.  A student also may withdraw from a course so long as the
withdrawal occurs by a specified time.  In courses in which a final examination
is given, whether or not a paper also is required, a student who wishes to
withdraw from the course must do so prior to commencement of the examination. 
Failure to appear for the examination constitutes a withdrawal.  In the case of
a take-home examination, the student may withdraw from the course anytime prior
to acquiring a copy of the examination.  In courses in which a paper is required
in lieu of a final examination, the failure to turn in a written work product on
or before the due date constitutes a withdrawal.  A grade of <B>W</B> is
entered for each course from which the student withdraws.  A <B>W</B> grade
carries no credit and is not included in computing the student's grade point
average.  The grade of <B>W</B> is final.  It cannot be changed or removed by
taking a subsequent examination.</P>
<P>Any student who makes excessive use of the withdrawal policy by regularly
withdrawing from one or more courses for which he/she registered, either
officially or by not taking the examination therein, may be requested to explain
the reason for such withdrawals. If the Faculty considers the offered
explanation to be inadequate, permission to re-enroll for the following year may
be denied.</P>
<P>Further, withdrawal from any course during a semester will affect
eligibility for Scholarships and for Honors Awards, may affect qualification for
Financial Aid and may result in failure to achieve full residency for the
semester.</P>
<P>A student who withdraws from all his/her courses during a semester is
considered as having been absent for that semester and may thereafter re-enroll
only as stated in the section titled &quot;Readmission After Absence.&quot;</P>
<H4><A NAME="SCHOLASTIC">SCHOLASTIC DISMISSAL</A></H4>
<P>Students are required to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at
least a <B>C</B> (2.00). Any student failing to maintain a <B>C</B> (2.00)
cumulative grade point average at the conclusion of his or her fourth or sixth
semester in the full-time program, or fourth, sixth or eighth semester in the
part-time program, will be dismissed from the College.</P>
<H4>REEXAMINATION - PROBATION</H4>
<P><B>Reexamination Procedure</B></P>
<P><B>1. First-year students - Reexamination  Status</B></P>
<P>  At the conclusion of his or her first two regular semesters* at the
College, any student, except one described in (2) hereof, who achieves an
overall grade-point below 2.00 shall be placed on probation.</P>
<P>Any student on probation shall have, over the next three regular semesters,
the right to reexamine once in each course in which the student received a grade
less than &quot;C&quot;.  No new course work may be undertaken.  Reexamination
shall include the taking or submission of all examinations, papers and projects
that count toward determination of the final grade.  Students are subject to the
same attendance requirements imposed upon regularly enrolled students.</P>
<P>If the student receives a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better upon
reexamination, the student's average shall be recalculated as if a &quot;Pass&quot;
had been achieved.  If the student receives a grade below &quot;C&quot; upon
reexamination, the two grades shall be averaged in calculating the student's
average.  (In both circumstances, the transcript shall note both the original
and the reexamination grades.)  If and when the student achieves a grade-point
of 2.00 or better, the student shall be permitted to continue with new course
work.</P>
<P>The right of reexamination ends when the student has re-taken all classes in
which a grade less than &quot;C&quot; was earned and still has failed to achieve
a grade point average of 2.00 or better, or when it becomes mathematically
impossible to achieve an average of 2.00 or better, whichever is earlier.**</P>
<P>If a student continuing under this provision does not achieve a grade-point
of 2.00 in each of the two regular semesters following the student's successful
reexamination and an overall law school average of 2.00 or better at the end of
those two terms, the student will be dismissed from the College.  Except as
provided in Section (3), such student shall not be entitled to again seek
admission or readmission to the College until at least 5 years have elapsed
since the student's initial admission.  If a student is dismissed more than
once, the five-year period runs from the date of the most recent admission.  At
the end of the five-year period, a new application may be filed with the
Admissions Office.  The right to apply for admission as a new student carries
with it no guarantee of admission.</P>
<P>*A &quot;regular semester&quot; is a fall or spring semester.  </P>
<P>* *In the event that a student fails to obtain any grades of &quot;C&quot;
or better at the conclusion of his or her first two regular semesters (thus
making it mathematically impossible to achieve an average of 2.00 or better), he
or she must re-take all such classes and may continue if, and only if, a grade
of &quot;C&quot; or better is earned in each class.  Reexamination will end when
any grade below &quot;C&quot; is earned.</P>
<P><B>2. First-year Students -  Probation</B></P>
<P>At the conclusion of his or her first two regular semesters at the College,
any first-year student who fails to achieve a 2.00 average, but who satisfies
the following condition, shall be placed on probation but permitted to continue
to the second-year class (unless the student elects to reexamine under section
(1) hereof):</P>
<P>The student has achieved an overall average of 1.90 or greater and has
received no more than 1 grade below &quot;C&quot;.</P>
<P>If a student continuing under this section does not achieve a grade-point of
2.00 in the next regular semester following probation, the student will be
dismissed from the College.  Likewise if a student readmitted under this section
does not achieve an overall law school average of 2.00 by the conclusion of the
second regular semester following probation, such student will be dismissed from
the College.  Except as provided in Section (3), a dismissed student shall not
be entitled to seek admission or readmission to the College until at least five
years have elapsed since the student's initial admission.  If a student is
dismissed more than once, the five-year period runs from the date of the most
recent admission.  At the end of the five-year period, a new application may be
filed with the Admissions Office.  The right to apply for admission as a new
student carries with it no guarantee of admission.</P>
<P><B>3. Right of Petition</B></P>
<P>All students dismissed from the College for academic insufficiency may
petition the Readmissions Committee for permission to continue at the College. 
After submission of a written petition, a student has the right to a brief
personal appearance before the Readmissions Committee to present his or her case
under such regulations as the Committee may provide.  The Committee may grant
the petition subject to any conditions deemed appropriate or may deny the
petition.</P>
<P>The Readmissions Committee shall periodically submit to the faculty a report
of its activity.</P>
<P><B>4. Appeal to the Faculty</B></P>
<P>Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Readmissions Committee may appeal
to the full faculty.  Such an appeal shall be in writing; no personal appearance
shall be permitted.  A decision of the Readmissions Committee shall not be
overturned except by a 2/3 vote of the faculty.</P>
<P><B>5. Counseling: Approval of Course of  Study</B></P>
<P>All students reexamining under section (1), those having probationary status
as second-year students under section (2), those required by sections (1) and
(2) to maintain a 2.00 average in one or more regular semesters and those
readmitted under sections (3) and (4) must have their plans of course work
approved by the Assistant Dean in advance of each term, may drop or add courses
only with the approval of the Assistant Dean, and must periodically obtain the
assistance and counsel of the Assistant Dean, as the College prescribes.</P>
<P><B>6. Currently Enrolled Students:  Retroactivity of Dismissal</B></P>
<P>Students who are determined to be academically ineligible to continue at the
College when enrolled in a subsequent semester or in the summer session will be
administratively and retroactively withdrawn and must not attend any further
classes or take any further examinations; full tuition for that semester or
summer session will be refunded.</P>
<H4><A NAME="REPEATED">REPEATED COURSES</A></H4>
<P>A repeated course may be counted only once toward credit for graduation. 
However, both grades will appear on the student's transcript and, except as
varied by the Reexamination-Probation Policy, will be counted in his/her
cumulative grade point average.</P>
<H4><A NAME="RESIDENCY">RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS</A></H4>
<P>In addition to earning adequate credits to graduate, law students must spend
a prescribed amount of <B>TIME</B> studying law.  This time is called <B>RESIDENCY</B>
and is calculated as it is earned.</P>
<P>Two policies exist with regard to residency and the requirements of each
<B>must</B> be met by the student.  The first policy is an <B>&quot;HOURS&quot;
</B>requirement; the second is a <B>&quot;WEEKS&quot;</B> requirement. </P>
<P><B>  Weeks:</B> <BR>The College has a residency requirement of six (6)
semesters or 84 weeks of full-time study and eight (8) semesters or 112 weeks of
part-time study.</P>
<P><B>Hours:</B> <BR><B>  </B>16.67% is given for each full-time semester
completed in which the student is enrolled for a minimum of ten (10) semester
hours and earns credit for a minimum of nine (9).</P>
<P>12.5% is given for each part-time semester completed in which the student is
enrolled for a minimum of eight (8) semester hours and earns credit for a
minimum of eight (8).</P>
<P>If fewer than the number of hours mandated for any semester is taken,
residency is earned on a per credit basis.  Since no more than 16.67% or 12.5%
will be applied in any one semester, deficiencies in residency percentages
cannot be remedied by taking a credit overload.  Deficiencies must be corrected
by attendance at summer school or by attending classes for one or more
additional semesters.</P>
<P><B>Day Section</B> <BR>A maximum of five (5) semester hours (1.66% per
semester hour up to a maximum of 8.33%) per summer school session is allowed to
be computed toward the 100% requirement.</P>
<P><B>Evening Section</B> <BR>A maximum of four (4) semester hours (1.56% per
semester hour up to a maximum of 6.25%) per summer school session is allowed to
be computed toward the 100% requirement.</P>
<P>In order to insure that residence requirements are satisfied, students
planning an early graduation should consult, in a timely manner, with the
Assistant Dean for Student Affairs as well as with the Registrar.</P>
<P><B>Details of residency requirements are available in the Registrar's
Office.</B></P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="GRADUATION">GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AND DEGREES</A></H4>
<P>(1)85 semester hours of credit. In accordance with ABA policy, the maximum
time for completion of requirements for full-time students is five (5) years and
for part-time students is six (6) years. <BR>(2)Cumulative grade point average
of 2.00 or better. <BR>(3)Compliance with residency requirements. <BR>(4)Compliance
with mandatory course requirements. <BR>(5)Compliance with the upper level
writing requirement. <BR>(6)In the case of students transferring from another
law school, a minimum of thirty (30) credit hours and two (2) semesters of
full-time or three (3) semesters of part-time resident study must be completed
at DCL/MSU.</P>
<P>The degree of Juris Doctor will be conferred upon students admitted to the
College as regular students who meet the requirements above for graduation. 
Those candidates whose cumulative grade point average is 3.00 to 3.39 will be
graduated Cum Laude, 3.40 to 3.69 will be graduated Magna Cum Laude and 3.70 to
4.00 will be graduated Summa Cum Laude.</P>
<H4><A NAME="COUNSELING">COUNSELING INFORMATION</A></H4>
<P>In compliance with Federal Regulations, the Board of Trustees has agreed to
have information concerning local substance abuse counseling centers made
available to all students, employees and officers.  Further information can be
obtained from the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs.</P>
<H4><A NAME="RELEASE">RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENTS</A></H4>
<P>DCL/MSU complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
as Amended, (20 USC 1232g) which prescribes the conditions under which
information about students can be released and the rights of students to inspect
and challenge their records.  A copy of the school's policy is available in the
Registrar's Office. </P>
<H4><A NAME="ADMISSION">ADMISSION TO THE BAR</A></H4>
<P>The rules and regulations relative to admission to the practice of law vary
from state to state.  For the specific requirements, reference should be made to
the statutes, rules of court and the Board of Bar Examiners in the particular
state in which the student intends to seek admission.  In general, a written
examination conducted by a state agency is a prerequisite to admission.  Foreign
students who plan to apply for admission to the Michigan Bar must satisfy M.C.L.
600.934, which requires that applicants be residents of one of the states,
territories or the District of Columbia.</P>
<P>Applicants for admission to the Bar of Michigan and other states are
required to disclose information about themselves concerning their character and
fitness to practice law, including prior criminal convictions, to the
appropriate Bar admitting authority.</P>
<P>In Michigan, applicants for admission to the Bar must pass satisfactorily a
written examination given by the State Board of Law Examiners, the Multi-State
Bar Examination and the Multi-State Professional Responsibility Examination. 
See Rule 2 (D) of the Rules for the Board of Law Examiners.  They also are
required to satisfy a committee of the State Bar of Michigan that they are
morally qualified to practice law.</P>
<P>The curriculum of Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University is
designed to provide its students with a thorough training for each of the
above-mentioned Examinations.</P>
<P>All applicants to Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University are
advised to acquaint themselves with the Bar examination rules governing their
respective states so far as legal subject matter is concerned.  For example,
Rule 3 of the Michigan Board of Law Examiners states as follows:</P>
<H4><A NAME="MICHIGAN">MICHIGAN BAR EXAMINATION</A></H4>
<H4>SUBJECTS AND GRADING</H4>
<P>The Michigan Bar examination consists of two sections:</P>
<P>(1) The Multistate Bar Examination is administered on dates and under
regulations set by the  National Conference of Bar Examiners. </P>
<P>(2) An essay examination prepared, under the supervision of the Board, by
law professors  selected by the Board, on these subjects: <I><BR>(a) Real and
Personal Property
<BR>(b) Wills and Trusts <BR>(c) Contracts <BR>(d) Constitutional Law <BR>(e)
Criminal Law and Procedure<BR>(f) Corporations, Partnerships and Agency <BR>(g)
Evidence <BR>(h) Creditor's Rights, including mortgages, garnishments and
attachments <BR>(i) Practice and Procedure, trial and appellate, state and
federal <BR>(j) Equity <BR>(k) Torts <BR>(l) The sales, negotiable
instruments, and secured transactions articles of the Uniform  Commercial Code
<BR>(m) Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct</I></P>
<P>The National Conference of Bar Examiners will grade the Multistate section.</P>
<P>The Board or its agents will grade the essay section, with the Board having
final responsibility. The Board will determine a method for combining the grades

<H2>Reproductive Technology:</H2>
<H2>A Study Report of the Michigan Law Revision Commission</H2>
<P><BR></P>
<HR> 
<P><I>Internet Editor's note:   Appendix A material (Uniform Status of
Children of Assisted Conception Act) and Appendix B material (Infertility
(Medical Procedures) Act of 1985),  which are published in the print edition of
this Report, are not available in the Internet text.</I></P>
<HR>
<P>This study report&lt;1&gt; furnishes background information and legislative
developments in the area of reproductive technology.  This report does not
purport to cover all areas of the law where legislative action may be needed,
but rather suggests to the Legislature the range of issues for consideration.
The Michigan Law Revision Commission makes no recommendations in connection with
this study report, but submits it to inform the Legislature and the citizens of
Michigan on Michigan law dealing with this highly dynamic and complex field.</P>
<P>Part I contains a brief description of the various techniques and procedures
encompassed by the phrase &quot;reproductive technology.&quot;  Part II lists
and briefly describes the current and proposed legislation in Michigan and other
states.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3>I.  TECHNOLOGIES</H3>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>Basic Terminology</I></P>
<P>The phrase &quot;reproductive technology&quot; commonly is used to cover all
practices that deal with artificial or &quot;assisted&quot; conception.&lt;2&gt;
 A helpful definition indicating the scope of these techniques is found in the
Uniform Status of Children of Assisted Conception Act (SCACA). The SCACA was
adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in
1988 and is reproduced in Appendix A to this report.  As stated in its prefatory
note, SCACA was drafted to &quot;augment and clarify the rights of children born
under the new [reproductive] technology as well as the rights of the parties to
these arrangements ... [and] is not a surrogacy regulatory act.&quot;  To date,
Alternative B&lt;3&gt; of the SCACA has only been adopted by North Dakota (see
N.D. Cent. Code &#167;&#167; 14-18-01--14-18-07), and Alternative A&lt;4&gt;
became effective in Virginia on July 1, 1993 (see Va. Code, art. 150, &#167;&#167;
20-156--20-165).  The SCACA, in &#167; 1(1), defines &quot;assisted conception&quot;
as:</P>
<P>[A] pregnancy resulting from any intervening medical technology, other than
the pregnancy of a woman resulting from the insemination of her ovum using her
husband's sperm, whether in vivo or in vitro, which completely or partially
replaces sexual intercourse as the means of conception.  Such intervening
medical technology includes, but is not limited to, conventional medical and
surgical treatment as well as non-coital reproductive technology such as
artificial insemination by donor, cryopreservation of gametes and embryos, in
vitro fertilization, uterine embryo lavage, embryo transfer, gamete
intrafallopian tube transfer, and low tubal ovum transfer.</P>
<P>This provision basically defines &quot;reproductive technology.&quot;&lt;5&gt;
 For</P>
<P>those not familiar with the various terms used, a brief introduction
follows.</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Gametes</I>&quot;<I> </I>are the male and female reproductive
cells, the sperm and the egg.  The egg has different stages prior to
fertilization, but for our purposes, the term &quot;egg&quot; can be used to
include all stages of the female gamete prior to fertilization.&lt;6&gt;</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Fallopian tubes</I>&quot;<I> </I>are the tubes that carry the egg
from the ovaries to the uterus.  The &quot;<I>uterus</I>&quot;<I> </I>is the
place where the egg, in a &quot;natural&quot; or coital reproductive process, is
fertilized by the sperm and where the embryo and fetus develops.</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Pre-embryo</I>&quot;<I> </I>is the term commonly used to describe
the fertilized egg until its implantation in the wall of the uterus, which
occurs within the first fourteen days after fertilization.  &quot;<I>Embryo</I>&quot;<I>
</I>is the common designation used from the time of implantation until
approximately eight weeks thereafter.  This report uses the &quot;embryo&quot;
designation for all stages up until 8 weeks after fertilization, except where
the laws of the individual states distinguish the pre-embryo stage.  After the
eight weeks pass, up until birth, &quot;<I>fetus</I>&quot; becomes the
appropriate terminology.  See generally John A. Robertson, Children of Choice,
<I>supra</I> note 1<I>.</I></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>A. Artificial Insemination</B></P>
<P>Artificial insemination is perhaps the most common and well-known of the
reproductive technologies.  It is defined in Ohio Code &#167; 3111.30(A) of the
Ohio Parentage Act&lt;7&gt; as &quot;the introduction of semen into the vagina,
cervical canal, or uterus through instruments or other artificial means.&quot;
This can be achieved by using sperm donated by a third-party donor (AID)&lt;8&gt;
or by the husband/mate of the mother (AIH).&lt;9&gt;</P>
<P>Artificial insemination might be used when the husband/mate's sperm count is
exceptionally low or there is a genetically transmittable disease on the male's
side of the family.  It can be combined with &quot;cryopreservation,&quot; a
process by which sperm donated for insemination can be frozen for later use. 
One advantage of cryopreservation is that it allows the artificial insemination
to be timed in accordance with the onset of ovulation.  Another advantage of
cryopreservation is that the donor can be retested at a later date to see if he
is infected by the AIDS virus since false positive tests for AIDS are common in
the first few months after infection.&lt;10&gt;</P> 
<P><B>B. In Vitro Fertilization</B></P>
<P>Unlike artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is a procedure
which occurs outside the woman's body.  IVF might  be used when both the female
and the male have infertility problems whereby a surplus embryo produced from
gametes from two donors may be used.  Or it may be used if the woman is unable
to become pregnant through normal coital reproduction due to damage in her
fallopian tubes.  The eggs of a donor might be used if the woman has a
genetically transmittable disease.  Here too, cryopreservation can be used on
the donated eggs so that a test for AIDS may be given to the donor after the
recommended period of time.</P>
<P>To begin the IVF process, the ovaries of the biological mother/donor are
stimulated artificially to release their eggs, which are then extracted from the
woman's body by a process called laparoscopy, and fertilized by the sperm in a
laboratory.  The resulting embryos&lt;11&gt; are then transferred to the uterus
of the &quot;mother&quot;&lt;12&gt; after a 2- or 3-day period.  IVF may result
in excess or &quot;surplus&quot; embryos being produced.  These surplus embryos
can be frozen by the cryopreservation process and thawed out at a later time if
a &quot;clinical pregnancy&quot; fails to occur on the first transfer.  The
benefits of cryopreservation include reducing any risks that may occur by
another laparoscopy.  In addition, a couple may decide to donate the surplus
embryos to another couple who is unable to produce the gametes necessary to
initiate the process.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>C. Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer</B></P>
<P>Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) is similar to IVF except that the eggs
are fertilized inside the woman's body, or &quot;in vivo.&quot; Following their
removal from the ovaries, and during the same procedure, the eggs are combined
with the sperm in a catheter and placed in the fallopian tubes for fertilization
to occur.&lt;13&gt;  This process is usually used by a couple when it is certain
that there are no problems with the woman's fallopian tubes.</P> 
<P><B>D. Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer</B></P>
<P>In zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) the egg is fertilized outside the
body and is transferred directly into the fallopian tubes.  This differs from
IVF, as there the embryo is transferred into the uterus.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>E. Uterine Lavage and Embryo Transfer</B></P>
<P>In this procedure the donated egg or the donated egg and sperm undergo
fertilization within the donor's body and then, after &quot;five or six days
following insemination ... uterine lavage is performed ... to obtain the embryo
for transfer into the body of the infertile woman.&lt;14&gt;</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>F. Surrogacy and Gestational Carriers</B></P>
<P>&quot;Gestational mother&quot; means the woman who gives birth to a child,
but has no genetic relationship to that child -- i.e., the eggs used are not
those of the woman.</P>
<P>&quot;Surrogate&quot; is defined by the SCACA in &#167; 1(4) as &quot;an
adult woman who enters into an agreement to bear a child conceived through
assisted conception for intended parents.&quot; A &quot;traditional&quot;
surrogacy situation usually involves an infertile wife whose husband's sperm is
artificially inseminated into a surrogate who has agreed to carry the fetus to
term.  The wife then adopts the child and the surrogate gives up all legal
rights to that child.&lt;15&gt; Occasionally, the husband is also incapable of
providing a gamete for fertilization and an anonymous sperm donor is used for
the artificial insemination process.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3>II.  LEGISLATION</H3>
<P>The range of legal issues that are raised by the different reproductive
technologies are constantly expanding as the scientific techniques and
technologies change and develop.  Part II provides an overview of the
legislation or proposed legislation currently in existence in the United States,
although Appendix B contains a reprint of the Victorian Infertility (Medical
Procedures) Act of 1984 and the Infertility (Medical Services) Amendment Act of
1987.  Considering the rapid changes occurring in the scientific field, these
laws could become obsolete in a very short time.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B><I>A. Artificial Insemination</I></B></P>
<P>Many states have legislation concerning the rights and duties of the
anonymous sperm donor and the paternity/maternity of the child born as a result
of artificial insemination.  Others have laws relating to testing of anonymous
sperm for HIV virus.  Both subjects are discussed here.  Issues relating to
health insurance coverage and to issues involving the Rules Against Perpetuities
(affected by children who were &quot;conceived-after-death&quot; by frozen sperm
or embryos) will be discussed in subsection B in connection with In Vitro
Fertilization.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>Paternity/Maternity Provisions</B></P>
<P><B><I> </I></B>MCL &#167; 333.2824(6), which addresses the issue of
paternity and is found under the chapter on the Public Health Code, provides:</P>
<P>A child born to a married woman as a result of artificial insemination, with
consent of her husband, is considered to be the legitimate child of the husband
and wife.</P>
<P>Similarly, MCL &#167; 700.111(2), which discusses legitimacy of children for
probate purposes, states:</P>
<P>If a child is born or conceived during a marriage, both spouses are presumed
to be the natural parents of the child for all purposes of intestate succession.
 A child conceived following artificial insemination of a married woman with the
consent of her husband shall be considered as their child for all purposes of
intestate succession.  Consent of the husband is presumed unless the contrary is
shown by clear and convincing evidence.  If a man and a woman participated in a
marriage ceremony in apparent compliance with the law before the birth of a
child, even though the attempted marriage is void, the child is considered to be
their child for all purposes of intestate succession.</P>
<P>The Michigan statutes are silent in three significant aspects: (1) they do
not insist upon written consent by the husband, but assume consent, requiring
clear and convincing evidence to override that presumption; (2) they make no
mention of the situation in which the woman being artificially inseminated is
not married; and (3) they make no mention of the rights or duties of the sperm
donor.  Other states have dealt with these issues in a somewhat different
manner.</P>
<P>Arkansas Code &#167; 9-10-201, under its chapter on paternity and subchapter
on artificial insemination, has a special provision on the unmarried woman,
which states:</P>
<P>(c)(1) A child born by means of artificial insemination to a woman who is
unmarried at the time of the birth of the child shall be, for all legal
purposes, the child of the woman giving birth, except in the case of a surrogate
mother, in which event the child shall be that of:</P>
<P>(A)  The biological father and the woman intended to be the mother if the
biological father is married; or</P>
<P>(B)  The biological father only if unmarried; or</P>
<P>(C)  The woman intended to be the mother in cases of a surrogate mother when
an anonymous donor's sperm was utilized for artificial insemination.</P>
<P>Unlike Michigan (see Part II.C. below), Arkansas accepts surrogacy as legal.
 Whether a provision as to the unmarried woman is needed in a state that
prohibits surrogacy is debatable.  The child born to a woman would be her child,
both by reference to genetics and the birth itself, even though conceived
through artificial insemination.  The Michigan provisions apparently deal only
with the married woman because only the status of paternity is deemed to be
questionable without a statute.</P>
<P>The Arkansas statute's provision on paternity in the marriage situation also
differs somewhat from the  Michigan provision.  It first provides that the
husband will be deemed the father if he consented<B><I> </I></B><I>in writing</I>.<B><I>
 </I></B>However, it then provides that the child shall be presumed to be the
child of the woman giving birth and her husband, except in the case of a
surrogate mother.  How these provisions are reconciled is unclear.  Arguably,
Arkansas prefers that the consent be in writing, but then creates a presumption
even if not in writing.</P>
<P>New Jersey Stat. Ann. &#167; 9:17-44, found under its chapter on &quot;bastardy
proceedings,&quot; also provides for consent in writing as a standard procedure,
but may be more rigorous in insisting on a writing:</P>
<P>(a)   If, under the supervision of a licensed physician and with the consent
of her husband, a wife is inseminated artificially with semen donated by a man
not her husband, the husband is treated in law as if he were the natural father
of a child thereby conceived.  The husband's consent shall be in writing and
signed by him and his wife.  The physician shall certify their signatures and
the date of the insemination, upon forms provided by the Department of Health,
and file the husband's consent with the State Department of Health, where it
shall be kept confidential and in a sealed file.  However, the physician's
failure to do so shall not affect the father and child relationship.  All papers
and records pertaining to the insemination, whether part of the permanent record
of a court or of a file held by the supervising physician or elsewhere, are
subject to inspection only upon an order of the court for compelling reasons,
clearly and convincingly shown.</P>
<P>New Jersey Stat. Ann. &#167; 9:17-44 also deals with the rights and duties
of the non-spousal sperm donor.  Subsection (b) provides:</P>
<P>(b) Unless the donor of semen and the woman have entered into a written
contract to the contrary, the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician
for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor's wife is
treated in law as if he were not the father of a child thereby conceived and
shall have no rights or duties stemming from the conception of a child.</P>
<P>New Hampshire Rev. Stat. &#167; 168-B:11, found in the chapter on surrogacy
and artificial insemination, is another provision that speaks to the non-spousal
sperm donor's duties.  It states:</P>
<P>A sperm donor may be liable for support only if he signs an agreement with
the other parties to that effect.</P>
<P>Texas Family Code &#167; 12.03, located under the chapter on the
parent-child relationship, also denies the paternity of the donor unless he is
the woman's husband.  It further requires that the husband give a written and
acknowledged consent in order to establish the paternity.  That section
provides:</P>
<P>(a)  If a husband consents to the artificial insemination of his wife, any
resulting child is the child of both of them.  The consent must be in writing
and must be acknowledged.</P>
<P>(b)  If a woman is artificially inseminated, the resulting child is not the
child of the donor unless he is the husband.</P>
<P>Ohio, in its revised code on parentage and non-spousal artificial
insemination,&lt;16&gt; also discusses both the paternity rights of the husband
and the non-spousal sperm donor in &#167; 3111.37. That section provides:</P>
<P>(A)   If a married woman is the subject of a non-spousal artificial
insemination and if her husband consented to the artificial insemination, the
husband shall be treated in law and regarded as the natural father of a child
conceived as a result of the artificial insemination, and a child so conceived
shall be treated in law and regarded as the natural child of the husband.  A
presumption that arises under division (A)(1) or (2) of &#167; 3111.03 of the
Revised Code is conclusive with respect to this father and child relationship,
and no action under &#167;&#167; 3111.01-3111.19 of the Revised Code shall
affect the relationship.</P>
<P>(B) If a woman is the subject of a non-spousal artificial insemination, the
donor shall not be treated in law or regarded as the natural father of a child
conceived as a result of the artificial insemination, and a child so conceived
shall not be treated in law or regarded as the natural child of the donor.  No
action under &#167;&#167; 3111.01-3111.19 of the Revised Code shall affect these
consequences.</P>
<P>Subsection (A) of the Ohio provision requires no particular form of consent
by the husband to establish parentage.  However, the provision on artificial
insemination requires that both the husband and the wife must consent, in
writing, to non-spousal artificial insemination.</P>
<P>Section 3111.34 states:</P>
<P>The non-spousal artificial insemination of a married woman may occur only if
both she and her husband sign a written consent to the artificial insemination
as described in &#167; 3111.35 of the Revised Code.</P>
<P>The above statutes suggest several possibilities for amendment of the
Michigan statutes.  These include some form of provision that encourages the
husband's consent to be in writing, and a provision on the duties and rights of
the non-spousal sperm donor.</P>
<P><B>Testing for HIV and Other Medical Condition</B></P>
<P>MCL &#167; 333.16273, found in the Public Health Code, addresses the problem
of testing for HIV when sperm is donated for artificial insemination purposes. 
That section provides, in part:</P>
<P>(1)  A licensee, except a veterinarian licensed under this article, who
provides artificial insemination services on an anonymous basis shall use only
frozen sperm, and shall test each potential sperm donor for the presence in the
donor of MV or an antibody to HIV.  The donated sperm shall be frozen, stored,
and quarantined for not less than 6 months.  Before frozen sperm is used for
artificial insemination, and not less than 6 months after the date of the
donation, the licensee shall take a second blood sample from the donor and have
that blood sample tested for HIV or an antibody to HIV.  If at any time the test
results are positive, the licensee shall not use the sperm of the donor for
artificial insemination purposes.</P>
<P>MCL &#167; 333.20179(l) similarly states, in part:</P>
<P>A health facility or agency licensed under this article that provides
artificial insemination services on an anonymous basis shall use only frozen
sperm, and shall test each potential sperm donor for the presence in the donor
of HIV or an antibody to HIV.</P>
<P>Various states have similar provisions.  However, they are not as extensive
as Michigan's in requiring a six-month waiting period and a second test.  See,
e.g., Maryland Code &#167; 18-334(e); Del. Code &#167; 2801(b).</P>
<P>In addition to testing for HIV, some states require that the frozen sperm of
a non-spousal donor can only be used if additional tests, including those for
genetically transmitted diseases, are performed on the donor.  Ohio Code &#167;
3111.33 is illustrative.  It provides:</P>
<P>(A)   In a non-spousal artificial insemination, fresh or frozen semen may be
used, provided that the requirements of division (B) of this section are
satisfied.</P>
<P>(B)(1) A physician or person under the supervision and control of a
physician may use fresh semen for purposes of a non-spousal artificial
insemination, only if within one year prior to the supplying of the semen, a
complete medical history of the donor, including, but not limited to, any
available genetic history of the donor, was obtained by a physician, the donor
had a physical examination by a physician, and the donor was tested for blood
type and RH [h] factor.</P>
<P>(2) A physician or person under the supervision and control of a physician
may use frozen semen for purposes  of a non-spousal artificial insemination only
if all the following apply:</P>
<P>(a)  The requirements set forth in division (B)(1) of this section are
satisfied;</P>
<P>(b)  In conjunction with the supplying of the semen, the semen or blood of
the donor was the subject of laboratory studies that the physician involved in
the nonspousal artificial insemination considers appropriate.  The laboratory
studies may include, but are not limited to, venereal disease research
laboratories, karotyping, GC culture, cytomegalo, hepatitis, kemzyme, Tay Sachs,
sickle-cell, ureaplasma, HLTV-III, and chlamydia.</P>
<P>(C)   The physician involved in the non-spousal artificial insemination
determines that the results of the laboratory studies are acceptable results.</P>
<P><B>Tort Liability</B></P>
<P>Caselaw developments in the area of tort liability for artificial
insemination have not been rapid.  One reported decision from the 6th Circuit,
<I>Striver v. Parker,<B> </B></I>975 F.2d 261 (1992), held that medical
personnel who performed an artificial insemination as part of a surrogacy
contract were liable for negligent donor screening.  In this connection, see
Megan D. McIntyre, <I>The Potential for Products Liability Actions When
Artificial Insemination by An Anonymous Donor Produces Children with Genetic
Defects</I>, 98 Dickinson L. Rev. 519<B><I> </I></B>(1994).</P>
<P><B>Property Claims</B></P>
<P>In 1993 the California court of appeals held that a decedent who had had his
sperm frozen could bequeath it to his girlfriend as part of his will, over the
objections of his children.  <I>Hecht v. Superior Court</I>, 20 Cal. Rptr. 275
(Cal. App. 1993).  See Jennifer L. Collins, Hecht v. Superior Court:  <I>Recognizing
a Property Right in Reproductive Material</I>, 33 Univ. Louisville J. Fam. L.
661 (1995).</P> 
<P><B><I>B. In Vitro Fertilization</I></B></P>
<P>Since IVF is a much more far-reaching procedure than artificial
insemination, it tends to present more issues.  In its second report on
Artificial Conception, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, LRC 58 (1988)
at 19 states:</P>
<P>It is not an established medical practice whose regulation is being updated.
 It is an entirely new treatment whose first success was recorded barely ten
years ago.  The law as it stands is barely equipped to deal with the issues it
raises.  IVF brings about human reproduction, and the  attitudes of many people
to it are influenced by strongly held moral, ethical and religious views
concerning sexual behavior, family formation and the bearing and raising of
children.</P>
<P><B>Insurance</B></P>
<P>One area of legislation concerning IVF is health insurance coverage for the
procedure itself.  There is no current legislation in Michigan involving health
insurance coverage for IVF or artificial insemination, but proposed House Bills
4708, 4709 and 4710, introduced in 1991 by Representative Bender, would require
HMOs, health insurance companies, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan to
provide coverage.</P>
<P>Some states have already enacted laws regulating insurance coverage for IVF
and other forms of infertility treatments.  Arkansas Code Ann. &#167;
23-85-137(a), found in the chapter on disability insurance regulations, provides
that &quot;[a]ll disability insurance companies doing business in this state
shall include, as a covered expense, in vitro fertilization.&quot;  Other states
have similar insurance coverage provisions requiring coverage for IVF (Conn.
Gen. Stat. Ann. &#167; 38a-536; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#167; 432:1-604; Ill. Ann.
Stat. ch. 73, para. 968m; Md. Ins. Code Ann. art. 48A, &#167; 47OW; and Tex.
Ins. Code Ann. art. 3.51-6).</P>
<P>The California Health and Safety Code, &#167; 1374.55, distinguishes IVF. 
It provides:</P>
<P>(a)  On and after January 1, 1990, every health care service plan contract
which is issued, amended, or renewed that covers hospital, medical, or surgical
expenses on a group basis, where the plan is not a health maintenance
organization as defined in &#167; 1373.10, shall offer coverage for the
treatment of infertility, <I>except in vitro fertilization</I>, under those
terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the group subscriber and the
plan.  Every plan shall communicate the availability of that coverage to all
group contract holders and to all prospective group contract holders with whom
they are negotiating.</P>
<P><B>(</B>b)  For purposes of this section, &quot;infertility&quot; means
either (1) the presence of a demonstrated condition recognized by a licensed
physician and surgeon as a cause of infertility, or (2) the inability to
conceive a pregnancy or to carry a pregnancy to a live birth after a year or
more of regular sexual relations without contraception.  &quot;Treatment for
infertility&quot; means procedures consistent with established medical practices
in the treatment of infertility by licensed physicians and surgeons including,
but not limited to, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, medication, surgery, and gamete
intrafallopian transfer.  &quot;In vitro fertilization&quot; means the
laboratory medical procedures involving the actual in vitro  fertilization
process.</P>
<P><B>Consumer Protection Regulation</B></P>
<P>Another area for potential regulation concerns misleading claims that IVF
clinics and doctors may make about their success rates with the procedure.  Jean
Eggen, in her article on reproductive technology (see footnote 13 <I>supra</I>),
argues that although &quot;the success of IVF worldwide could be characterized
optimistically as in the range of twenty percent,&quot; some clinics, who
themselves may have low success rates, &quot;have adopted the worldwide figure
in their promotional efforts.&quot; 25 Ga. L. Rev. at 649.  She adds that
patients who resort to IVF are those that are &quot;particularly vulnerable to
statistical manipulation&quot; and that the highly technical nature of the
procedure makes them more susceptible to being misled.  Id. at 650.</P>
<P>Some would apparently go so far as to ban the procedure, though no state has
done so.  The New South Wales Law Reform Commission, in part 2 of its Artificial
Conception Report, LRC 58 (July 1988) page 24, notes opponents who argue against
the process as &quot;built on the destruction of human life,&quot; &quot;threatening
the traditional family.&quot;  They also note others who &quot;criticize the
process as one which makes women objects of scientific curiosity and subjects of
scientific experimentation.&quot; Id. (citing M. O'Brien, &quot;The Politics of
Reproduction&quot; (1984); R. Koval, &quot;Women, Birth, and Power,&quot; 4
Australian Society 6 (1985)).  Constitutional rights of privacy and the right of
patients to have autonomy over their own medical care are issues that would
necessarily be raised by prohibition, but not by full disclosure requirements.</P>
<P><B>Cryopreservation and Disposition of Embryos</B></P>
<P>A major issue presented by cryopreservation as it relates to IVF is what
controls should be placed on the disposition of the unused frozen embryos that
are not going to be transferred into a recipient immediately, or perhaps not at
all.  Christi D. Ahnen, the author of <I>Disputes Over Frozen Embryos: Who
Wins, Who Loses, and How Do We Decide?</I>, 24 Creighton L. Rev. 1299, 1302
(1990), states:</P>
<P>Two divergent views exist regarding disposition of frozen embryos.  Persons
who believe that life begins at conception view the embryo as human, with the
rights of personhood, and &quot;believe that all viable embryos must be
transferred to a uterus and given the opportunity to gestate. . . .&quot;  The
more liberal view is that embryos should be transferred to a uterus whenever
reasonably possible, but the discard of embryos and embryo research should be
permitted in acceptable circumstances.</P>
<P>Some of the questions surrounding surplus embryos include:   How are they to
be disposed of?  Are they &quot;lives in being&quot; for purposes of the Rule
Against Perpetuities?  Can they be used for research purposes, and who gets &quot;control&quot;
of them in the event of a divorce or death of both gamete donors?  These and
other questions have been addressed by various laws in different states.</P> 
<P><B>Research and Frozen Embryos</B></P>
<P>There are no Michigan laws concerning frozen embryos.  However, Michigan
laws do not allow research on live human embryos if it would jeopardize the life
of the embryo.  MCL &#167; 333.2685(l), in the Public Health Code, provides:</P>
<P>A person shall not use a live human embryo, fetus, or neonate for
nontherapeutic research if, in the best judgment of the person conducting the
research, based upon the available knowledge or information at the approximate
time of the research, the research substantially jeopardizes the life or health
of the embryo, fetus, or neonate.  Nontherapeutic research shall not in any case
be performed on an embryo or fetus known by the person conducting the research
to be the subject of a planned abortion being performed for any purpose other
than to protect the life of the mother.</P>
<P>As noted by Gail D. Sillman, author of <I>In Vitro Fertilization and
Cryopreservation</I>, 67 Mich. B.J. 601 (1988), Michigan laws fail to &quot;specifically
define the term embryo or fetus&quot; and therefore this statute is &quot;inadequate
in its application to IVF.&quot; One question asked is whether a frozen embryo
would be deemed &quot;a live&quot; embryo or just one having the potential for
life, as many frozen embryos may not be viable and do not result in &quot;clinical&quot;
pregnancies upon transfer to the gestational carrier.  The critical provision on
this issue, MCL. &#167; 333.2687, states:</P>
<P>An embryo, fetus, or neonate is a live embryo, fetus, or neonate for
purposes of &#167;&#167; 2685 to 2691 if, in the best medical judgment of a
physician, it shows evidence of life as determined by the same medical standards
as are used in determining evidence of life in a spontaneously aborted embryo or
fetus at approximately the same stage of gestational development.</P>
<P>Another issue is what is meant by the term &quot;embryo&quot;?  The standard
applied here is beyond the expertise of the authors of this memo.  Sillman notes
that Dorland's Medical Dictionary defines an embryo as a &quot;developing
organism ... from about two weeks after fertilization to the end of the seventh
or eighth week, and a fetus as &quot;the unborn offspring ... from seven or
eight weeks after fertilization until birth.&quot;  Frozen embryos are
pre-embryos.  Thus, Sillman concludes:</P>
<P>A scientist could, therefore, conduct an experiment on any fertilized egg
(up to two weeks after fertilization) for any reason whatsoever -- which could
include genetic manipulation . . . and not technically violate the  Michigan
statute. . . .  A literal reading of the statute would also permit an IVF clinic
to sell, transfer, distribute and give away a living, developing organism that
has not yet reached the embryonic stage.  The embryo research statute was
clearly intended not only to preclude scientists from performing nontherapeutic
research on any living human organism, but also to eliminate IVF clinics,
practitioners or donors from selling, transferring, distributing or giving away
frozen fertilized eggs.  Accordingly, the statute needs to be revised to apply
to the IVF context.  It also needs to be further revised to differentiate
between IVF as a treatment for infertility and IVF as a tool for research.</P>
<P>Should the statute apply to the frozen embryos, Sillman also sees problems.
Initially, she notes that the statute does draw a worthwhile distinction:</P>
<P>The statute defines nontherapeutic research as &quot;scientific or
laboratory research, or other kind of experimentation or investigation not
designed to improve the health of the research subject.&quot; Diagnostic,
assessment, or treatment procedures which &quot;determine the life or status or
improve the health of the embryo, fetus, or neonate involved or the mother
involved&quot; are not prohibited by the statute.  According to the above
definitions an argument can be made that the clinical practice of IVF is not
excluded by the statute because it is aimed at improving the health of both the
infertile couple as well as the fertilized egg . . . .</P>
<P>However, she feels that the statute here does not go far enough:</P>
<P>While the statute may exempt IVF in a clinical context, certain research
performed on frozen fertilized eggs would appear to be prohibited by the
statute.  For example, if a researcher were seeking a cure for a hereditary
disease such as Huntington's or Tay Sachs, it would be permissible under the
statute for the scientist to manipulate genes to effect a cure only if he or she
thought it would not substantially jeopardize the life or health of the
fertilized egg.</P>
<P>She also sees difficulty in allowing the researcher to make the final
determination as to substantially jeopardizing the life or health of the
fertilized egg.  She suggests that there is need &quot;for impartial and
external restraints which are noticeably absent in the Michigan statute.&quot;
She recommends that:</P>
<P>The embryo research statute authorize the creation of a state or local
advisory research board, consisting of, for example, researchers, physicians,
lawyers, ethicists and lay persons, who would be charged with the responsibility
of reviewing and approving or rejecting all experiments involving research on
fertilized eggs produced by IVF.</P>
<P>Cryopreservation simply was not a focus of the Michigan legislature when
enacting the laws against research on live human embryos in 1978.  Its major
purpose apparently was to prevent abortions being done to harvest embryos for
research.  MCL &#167; 333.2689 provides:</P>
<P>A person shall not perform or offer to perform an abortion where part or all
of the consideration for the performance is that the embryo, or fetus, whether
alive or dead, may be used for research or study.</P>
<P>MCL &#167;333.2688(l) further states:</P>
<P>Research may not knowingly be performed upon a dead embryo, fetus, or
neonate unless the consent of the mother has first been obtained.</P>
<P>Whether or not one would desire to follow the approach suggested by Sillman,
she points to the need to focus on the special characteristics of the IVF
process.</P>
<P>Louisiana legislation does deal directly with frozen embryos.  It clearly
bars development for research and, perhaps, also bars testing for genetic
engineering purposes.  Initially, it deems the frozen embryo to be a &quot;human
life,&quot; as La. Civ. Code &#167; 123, found in the chapter on human embryos,
provides:</P>
<P>An in vitro fertilized human ovum exists as a juridical person until such
time as the in vitro fertilized ovum is implanted in the womb; or at any other
time when rights attach to an unborn child in accordance with law.</P>
<P>La. Civ. Code &#167; 122 includes the basic prohibition against research:</P>
<P>The use of a human ovum fertilized in vitro is solely for the support and
contribution of the complete development of human in utero implantation.  No in
vitro fertilized human ovum will be farmed or cultured solely for research
purposes or any other purposes.  The sale of a human ovum, fertilized human
ovum, or human embryo is expressly prohibited.</P>
<P>New Hampshire, on the other hand, clearly does allow research on frozen
embryos with consent.  N.H. Rev. Stat. &#167; 168-B:15, found in the chapter on
in vitro fertilization and pre-embryo transfer, provides:</P>
<P>I.   No pre-embryo shall be maintained ex utero in the noncryopreserved
state beyond 14 days post-fertilization development.</P>
<P>II.  No pre-embryo that has been donated for use in research shall be
transferred to a uterine cavity.</P>
<P>Other states have legislation restricting research on embryos and fetuses
but, like Michigan, these statutes are not specifically geared toward
cryopreserved embryos or else they are expressly enacted to prevent research on
intentionally aborted fetuses.  See, e.g., Mass. Ann.  Laws ch. 112 &#167; 12J;
Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 188.037; N.M. Stat. Ann. &#167; 24-9A-1; Ark. Code Ann. &#167;
20-17-802.</P>
<P>Federal regulations do not allow federal funding to be &quot;expended for
research involving human subjects,&quot; 45 C.F.R. &#167; 46.122, and this
includes &quot;viable fetuses.&quot;  A viable fetus is defined in that
regulation as a fetus &quot;being able, after either spontaneous or induced
delivery, to survive (given the benefit of available medical therapy) to the
point of independently maintaining heartbeat and respiration.&quot; 45 C.F.R. &#167;
46.203(d).  This would not include a frozen embryo.</P> 
<P><B>Death or Divorce of the Parents/Owners of Frozen Embryos</B></P>
<P><I>Davis v. Davis</I>, 1992 Tenn. Lexis 400 (Tenn. S. Ct. June 1, 1992), is
the only case to date in the United States which concerns the disposition of the
embryos upon a divorce of the two potential parents.  This case involved a
divorced woman who, along with her then ex-husband, had previously undergone IVF
which resulted in surplus frozen embryos.  She wanted control of the surplus
embryos to implant them in her uterus in an attempt to become pregnant.  The
ex-husband objected.  The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals
decision which stated that the embryos were not &quot;persons&quot; or &quot;property&quot;
under the law but fell somewhere in between.  Therefore, they do not enjoy
protection as persons under federal or state law, but were entitled to &quot;special
respect because of their potential for human life.&quot;  The court held that
the contract made before undergoing the IVF was enforceable and therefore gave
the decisionmaking authority as to the disposition of the embryos to both
parties.  Accordingly, a lower court decision, which had declared the embryos to
be human beings and had held the contract unenforceable due to a &quot;best
interests of the child&quot; determination, was reversed.</P>
<P>The Tennessee court noted that there was nothing in the contract before it
that specified what should be done with unused embryos following
cryopreservation, and that there was no current legislation in Tennessee
governing the situation.  Michigan also has no legislation on the subject. 
Thus, if it followed the <I>Davis</I> analysis, the contract would control
(assuming that, in light of <I>Davis</I>, an effort will be made to include a
disposition provision in future contracts relating to IVF).  Of course, if the
lower court position is followed, the &quot;best interests,&quot; as determined
by the court, would prevail.  Presumably those best interests would be the path
most likely to result in a successful implantation.</P>
<P>Louisiana does have legislation dealing with the disposition of
cryopreserved embryos as a result of IVF.  That state considers the frozen
embryos to be &quot;human beings,&quot;  prohibits their destruction while
frozen, and awards them the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; determination
in disputes over disposition.</P>
<P>La. Civ.  Code &#167; 129 initially states:</P>
<P>A viable in vitro fertilized human ovum is a juridical person which shall
not be intentionally destroyed by any natural or other juridical person or
through the actions of any other such person.  An in vitro fertilized human ovum
that fails to develop further over a thirty-six hour period <I>except when the
embryo is in a state of cryopreservation</I>, is considered non-viable and is
not considered a juridical person.</P>
<P>La. Civ.  Code &#167; 131 then adds:</P>
<P>In disputes arising between any parties regarding the in vitro fertilized
ovum, the judicial standard for resolving such disputes is to be in the best
interest of the in vitro fertilized ovum.</P>
<P>Taken to its logical extreme, the Louisiana provisions produce the following
results.  The prospective parents have no legal responsibility to arrange for
the implantation of the frozen embryo.  However, even if that is their decision,
the frozen embryo remains protected as long as it is viable, i.e., capable of
successful implantation.  Moreover, they must be made available for implanting
to any others who want them, as that would be in their best interest (as in the
case of an abandoned child).  See also <I>York v. Jones</I>, 717 F. Supp. 421
(E.D. Pa. 1989) (married couple had property interest in frozen embryo
sufficient to order its delivery from Virginia to California for in vitro
fertilization procedure).</P>
<P><B>Frozen Embryos and the Rule Against Perpetuities</B></P>
<P>Article IX, Part 1, &#167; 901 of the Uniform Act on Intestacy, Wills, and
Donative Transfers, covers the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities.  This Act
was adopted in Michigan in 1988.  See MCL. &#167; 554.71-77, subsection (d). 
MCL. &#167; 554.72(4) provides:</P>
<P>[Possibility of Post-death Child Disregarded.] In determining whether a
non-vested property interest or a power of appointment is valid under subsection
(1)(a), (2)(a), or (3)(a), the possibility that a child will be born to an
individual after the individual's death is disregarded.</P>
<P>The commentary to that section states that when, for example, a party leaves
sperm in a sperm bank and his wife, or another, uses it to become pregnant after
his death, &quot;[a]s to the legal status of conceived-after-death children,
that question has not yet been resolved.&quot;  The commentary goes on to note
that &quot;[w]ithout trying to predict how that question will be resolved in the
future, the best way to handle the problem from the perpetuity perspective is 
the rule in subsection (d) requiring the possibility of post-death children to
be disregarded.&quot; Although not explicitly stated, this would appear to apply
to frozen surplus embryos also.</P> 
<P><B>Frozen Embryos and Inheritance and Maternity/Paternity</B></P>
<P>As mentioned earlier in Part II(A) of this report, MCL &#167; 700.111(2)
states:</P>
<P>If a child is born or conceived during a marriage, both spouses are presumed
to be the natural parents of the child for all purposes of intestate succession.
 A child conceived following artificial insemination of a married woman with the
consent of her husband shall be considered as their child for all purposes of
intestate succession.</P>
<P>This provision raises a series of questions as to gestational mothers and
even a mother implanted with her own eggs fertilized through the IVF process. 
Under the first sentence, where the mother is married and the child is born
during the marriage, the child is that of the mother and her husband.  This
would present difficulties were surrogates allowed, but Michigan rejects the
surrogate contract, as discussed <I>infra</I>.  Where the mother is single and
the egg is hers, the situation should not differ from that of the artificially
inseminated single mother. See the discussion in Part II.A. above.  Where the
mother is a gestational mother only, the reference to &quot;birth&quot; in the
Michigan provision would suggest that this should be the controlling factor, not
genetic link.</P>
<P>The issue becomes more complicated as to paternity in the case where there
was a marriage, but the child was born after the marriage was terminated.  There
would be no &quot;conception&quot; by implanting, but arguably implanting would
be similar to artificial insemination, so that the husband's consent would be
sufficient.  What if the husband should be deceased before the implant takes
place?  Could the fertilization by the IVF process with the intent of a later
implantation be considered the parallel of artificial insemination so that
consent at that point would be enough?  Surely here consent should not be
presumed, as &#167; 700.111(2) also provides.  See Part II.A. above.&lt;17&gt;</P>
<P>Following its other regulations on cryopreservation, La. Civ. Code &#167;
133 seeks to deal with another issue not considered in Michigan:  the status of
persons who are the source of gametes.  The issue here is similar to that
discussed with respect to artificial insemination.  The Louisiana provision
states:</P>
<P>As a juridical person, the embryo or child born as a result of in vitro
fertilization and in vitro fertilized ovum donation to another couple does not
retain its  inheritance rights from the in vitro fertilization parents.</P>
<P><B><I>C. Surrogacy</I></B></P> 
<P><B>Contracts</B></P>
<P>MCL &#167; 722.853(i) of the Surrogate Parenting Act provides:</P>
<P>&quot;Surrogate parentage contract&quot; means a contract, agreement, or
arrangement in which a female agrees to conceive a child through natural or
artificial insemination, or in which a female agrees to surrogate gestation, and
to voluntarily relinquish her parental or custodial rights to the child.  It is
presumed that a contract, agreement, or arrangement in which a female agrees to
conceive a child through natural or artificial insemination by a person other
than her husband, or in which a female agrees to surrogate gestation, includes a
provision, whether or not express, that the female will relinquish her parental
or custodial rights to the child.</P>
<P>Such contracts for surrogacy are illegal in Michigan, as provided in MCL &#167;
722.855:  &quot;A surrogate parentage contract is void and unenforceable as
contrary to public policy.&quot;  In adopting this provision, the Michigan
legislature rejected the intermediate position of only disallowing contracts for
gain or profit.  See, e.g., Utah Code Ann. &#167; 76-7-204; Wash. Rev. Code Ann.
&#167; 26.26.240.  As previously noted in Part I, the SCACA Alternative B more
closely resembles the Michigan law.  It provides in &#167; 5 for the illegality
of the agreement.  It also states that the surrogate is the mother of the child.
 See Appendix A.</P> 
<P><B>Tort Liability</B></P>
<P>Another potential area for legislation is the possibility of a tort action
against a gestational surrogate mother for injuries to the fetus.  In her
article, <I>Adventures in Babysitting: Gestational Surrogate Mother Tort
Liability</I>, 41 Duke L.J. 661, Karen A. Bussel discusses some of the liability
situations that could arise whether or not surrogate contracts are legal.  To
illustrate, she discusses the possibility that a gestational surrogate mother
(who has no genetic relationship to the fetus) may take medication during the
pregnancy that causes harm to the child.  She also discusses a scenario where a
cesarean section is needed for the health of the child but it would put the
gestational surrogate mother's life at risk.</P>
<P>Although there is no case law on these particular situations yet, the author
cites a case which involved a natural mother who took doctor prescribed
tetracycline during her pregnancy.  This resulted in her child developing
discolored teeth.  <I>Grodin v. Grodin</I>, 301 N.W.2d 869 (Mich. Ct. App.
1980).  The court concluded that the child did have a cause of action for
damages against her mother and reversed a lower court's previous  dismissal.</P>
<P>&lt;1&gt;   This report was prepared by Andrea Crowe, and revised by
Professor Jerry Israel, of the University of Michigan Law School.</P>

the New Reproductive Technologies (1994); Janet L. Dolgin, <I>The Law Debates
the Family:  Reproductive Information</I>, 7 Yale J. L. &amp; Feminism 37
(1995).</P>
<P>&lt;3&gt;Alternative B of the SCACA is designed for those jurisdictions that
wish to provide that &quot;[a]n agreement in which a woman agrees to become a
surrogate or to relinquish her rights and duties as parent of a child conceived
through assisted conception is void.&quot;  See Appendix A infra.</P>
<P>&lt;4&gt;Alternative A allows for surrogacy contracts which meet conditions
outlined in the Act.</P>
<P>&lt;5&gt;Although some of the literature distinguishes the terms &quot;reproductive
technology&quot; and &quot;advanced reproductive technology,&quot; this report
will use the former as a general designation.  See Jean Macciaroli Eggen, <I>The
&quot;Orwellian Nightmare&quot; Reconsidered:  A Proposed Regulatory Framework
For The Advanced Reproductive Technologies,</I> 25 Ga. L. Rev. 625, 629 n. 6
(1991) (where the author adopts the term &quot;advanced reproductive technology&quot;
as defined by the American Fertility Society, encompassing those treatments
which include the laboratory handling of human oocytes (eggs) and/or embryos. 
Treatments such as artificial insemination would not be deemed &quot;advanced&quot;
under this definition, as there is no laboratory handling of eggs or embryos.).</P>
<P>&lt;6&gt;Terms used for the various stages of the egg prior to fertilization
such as oocyte (an egg that has not yet undergone maturation) and ovum (a mature
egg) will not be used.</P>
<P>&lt;7&gt;The Ohio Parentage Act is adopted from the Uniform Parentage Act,
which has so far been adopted by 18 states, but not in Michigan.  See 9B ULA
287.</P>
<P>&lt;8&gt;AID is the acronym for artificial insemination by donor.</P>
<P>&lt;9&gt;Acronym for artificial insemination by husband.</P>
<P>&lt;10&gt;Legislation on cryopreservation of sperm will be discussed in Part
II.</P>
<P>&lt;11&gt;More than one embryo is transferred into the uterus to increase
the chances of a &quot;clinical pregnancy.&quot;  A clinical pregnancy is &quot;[a]
pregnancy confirmed by an increasing level of HCGT and the presence of a
gestational sac detected by ultrasound.&quot;  American Fertility Society, IVF &amp;
GIFT: A Patient's Guide To Assisted Reproductive Technology 15.</P>
<P>&lt;12&gt;&quot;Mother&quot; is used in this report to denote the expected &quot;legal&quot;
mother after birth, either biological or adopted.  &quot;Gestational carrier&quot;
will be used to denote the female, not necessarily the biological mother,
carrying the embryo/fetus up to birth.  This will be discussed further in the
next subsection.</P>
<P> &lt;13&gt;One important issue which will not be covered in this report is
the controversy surrounding the question of just when fertilization or
conception actually occurs.</P>

Techniques, </I>38 DePaul L. Rev. 1013, 1036 (1989).</P>
<P>&lt;16&gt;This chapter clearly states, in &#167; 3111.31, that it only &quot;deal[s]
with non-spousal artificial insemination for the purpose of impregnating a woman
so that she can bear a child that she intends to raise as her child.  These
sections do not deal with the artificial insemination of a wife with the semen
of her husband or with surrogate motherhood.&quot;</P>

<P>The faculty of the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University is
composed of 28 resident professors who are devoted, on a full-time basis, to the
teaching of law.  There are five legal research and writing instructors and a
cadre of adjunct faculty members, practicing attorneys who are specialists with
extensive experience in the fields of law in which they teach. By utilizing the
talents of both the professional teacher and the practicing attorney, the
academic viewpoint of the former is blended with the practical approach of the
latter into a sound, well-balanced education in both theory and practice of the
legal system.</P>

<P></P>
<P>The goal of legal education at the College has been to prepare students for
the general practice of law in any jurisdiction of the United States. Lawyers,
however, increasingly experience the need to limit their practices to specific
areas of law, either by virtue of the needs of their particular practice or by
virtue of the skills required by newly developing areas of the law. The College
has met this dual need by requiring that a substantial proportion of courses
prepare students for the general practice of law while allowing students to
concentrate their efforts in a particular field of law if they choose to do so.
Thus, the faculty has created groups of coordinated courses in International and
Comparative Law and in Taxation.</P>

students with an opportunity to earn six academic credit during the six-week
period from May 16 through June 27, 1997.  The Program consists of two
integrated components.  The first is the internship during which the student
will earn four academic credits while working for a six-week period under the
supervision of Canadian public lawyers and members of Parliament.  The second is
a two-credit classroom component which consists of an introductory course on the
Canadian legal system, a series of weekly seminars on topical Canadian legal
issues, and a speakers program featuring prominent Canadians visiting with
students over lunch at the House of Commons.</P>

<P>Selection criteria will vary in some respects from placement to placement. 
However, in general, academic standing, legal research and writing skills,
course concentration or emphasis, law school activities, prior law and non-law
related work experience, qualities which demonstrate student interest in Canada,
motivation and diversity are all factors which will be considered in evaluating
students for selection.</P>
<P>Since we place a maximum of twenty students in responsible positions in
government offices, we select only those students with the highest credentials
and whose application materials indicate that they have the maturity and
responsibility to work successfully in the placements.  The students in the
Program come from law school throughout the United States.  Last year we had
twelve students in the Program, five (5) of whom came from the Detroit College
of Law at Michigan State University.</P>
<P><I>3. Selection Process</I></P>
<P>Applicants will be screened initially by the Program Director.  Resumes and
writing samples of potential students will be mailed to placement sponsors and
students will subsequently be selected by the sponsor in cooperation with the
Program Director in accordance with the selection criteria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Placement">The Placement Program in Action</A></B></P>
<P>The introductory Canadian legal system course will be taught at the
University of Ottawa, Faculty of Law before placements begin.  The weekly
seminars and the Director's office will also be located at the Faculty of Law.</P>
<P>During the placements students will be required to perform relevant legal
tasks such as legal or legislative research, analysis investigation, legal
writing and legal or legislative drafting under the direct supervision of public
lawyers or members of Parliament.  In addition, the students work will be
monitored by the Program Director.</P>
<P>Seminars and lectures will be conducted during the six week period. 
Students will also be required to complete legal research and writing
assignments which are relevant to or derived from their internship placement. 
Time will be provided for opportunities to observe the Supreme Court and other
courts, Parliament and other institutional decision-making bodies.</P>
<P>Both the Program Director and the supervising lawyer will evaluate the
students work, and the Program Director will grade each student's performance. 
Upon successful completion of the program, six hours graded credit will be
awarded by the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University as part of
its fully accredited curriculum.  Detroit College of Law at Michigan State
University is approved by the American Bar Association and is a member of the
Association of American Law Schools.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that the credit earned in the Program can be used to
accelerate graduation.  Acceptance of credit is at the discretion of the
applicant's law school.  If there are any questions concerning acceptance of
credit, or if more information is required by the applicant's Dean, please
contact the Program Director at 313-226-0100 or at 517-432-4300.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Internship">The Internship Placements</A></B></P>
<P>Internships will be available in some of the following areas:  with members
of Parliament dealing with legal and international affairs; sections of the
Federal Ministry of Justice, including Civil Litigation, Constitutional and
International Law, Human Rights, Administrative Law, Criminal Law Policy and
Legislative Drafting; the Federal Court of Canada; Environment Canada; the Law
Reform Commission; the Human Rights Commission and the National Transportation
Agency.  About one-half of the placements will be with Members of Parliament.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Program">Program Faculty</A></B></P>
<P>Teaching faculty for the introductory course and the weekly seminars will be
drawn from cooperating Canadian law faculties, Center faculty, outstanding
Canadian lawyers and other experts on Canadian law.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Tuition">Program Tuition and Fees</A></B></P>
<P>The tuition fee for each student enrolled in the program is $2,850.00 which
covers the costs of the internship, seminars, lecturers, speakers luncheons,
cultural events and materials.  In addition, students are expected to pay a <B>non-refundable</B>
program fee of $50.  Tuition is due by May 1, 1997.  Tuition may be refunded if
notice of withdrawal from the program is received ten days prior to the
beginning of the program.</P>
<P>The cost of living in Ottawa is similar to that in most major U.S. cites. 
Although living costs depend upon your life style, it would not be unusual to
spend $100 per week on living costs beyond the room charges.  Since the dorms
provide a kitchen and refrigerator on each floor, it is possible to economize by
cooking your own meals.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Housing">Housing Facilities and Fees</A></B></P>
<P>Housing will be available for students at the student dormitories at the
University of Ottawa.  At the current exchange rate, housing charges will be
approximately $600.00 (US) for the full program period.  Students are encouraged
to reside in University housing, however, those wishing to make other
arrangements should indicate this on their application form.  All facilities at
the University of Ottawa and at the government offices hosting the placements
are totally accessible to individuals with disabilities.  Housing charges are
due by May 1, 1997.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Cancellation">Cancellation Policy</A></B></P>
<P>Although the Program has never been cancelled, the Detroit College of Law at
Michigan State University reserves the right to cancel the Program for
insufficient enrollment.  Applicants will be notified of cancellation as soon as
possible, but in no case later than May 2, 1997.  In the case of such
cancellation, there will be a full refund of tuition and housing fees.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Travel">Travel</A></B></P>
<P>Students will be expected to arrange their own travel.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Deadlines">Application and Deadlines</A></B></P>
<P>To apply, send a completed application form, letter of good standing from
your law school, a resume <B>and</B> a short writing sample with the $50 <B>non-refundable</B>
program fee to:</P>

<A HREF="#interview">on-campus interviewing </A>and year-long postings for
<A HREF="#JUDICIAL">law clerk</A> and attorney positions.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="interview">ON CAMPUS INTERVIEWS</A></B> <BR>Detroit College
of Law at Michigan State University conducts its on-campus interview program
throughout the academic year, concentrating on the September-November and
February-April periods.  During those months, representatives from law firms,
corporations, government agencies, public accounting firms and other employers
schedule interviews with second-year students for summer positions and with
third-year students for permanent positions.  The interviews are held in
comfortable facilities provided by the College.</P>
<P>Employers unable to take advantage of the DCL/MSU on-campus program
encourage students either to send resumes directly to them or request that
students submit resumes to the Office of Career Services for forwarding as a
group.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="JUDICIAL">JUDICIAL CLERKSHIP PROGRAM</A></B> <BR>Annually,
the Office of Career Services offers its Judicial Clerkship Program, bringing
together judges from federal and state benches and DCL/MSU graduates who are
serving as clerks for those courts.  Day and evening students who are in the
beginning or middle of their second or third years of law school respectively
are encouraged to apply for these rewarding and challenging positions which
commence upon graduation.  The competition for these clerkships is intense, and
students are encouraged to prepare themselves academically from the beginning of
their law school education in order to compete.</P>
<P><B>LUNCH WITH A LAWYER</B> <BR>Every month, the Career Services Office, in
conjunction with the Alumni Relations Office, invites a local practitioner to
discuss his/her area of expertise with a small group of students.  In this
informal lunch setting, students learn about different specializations and how
they can apply their law school studies and activities to future employment
opportunities.</P>
<P><B>JOB POSTINGS</B> <BR>The DCL/MSU job posting service is used
extensively  by employers who seek to fill both full and part-time law clerk and
attorney positions.  Non-traditional opportunities for those with the Juris
Doctor degree also are available.</P>
<P><B>OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATES</B> <BR>Career opportunities for recent and
experienced Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University graduates also
are listed in our <I>Alumni Placement Newsletter</I>.  This service is free of
charge to both employers and DCL/MSU graduates.</P>
<P><B>PLACEMENT PROFILE</B> <BR>During the last five years, Detroit College
of Law at Michigan State University graduates have fared well in the employment
market, with classes reporting over 90 percent employed within six months of
graduation. DCL/MSU graduates have obtained positions with many of Michigan's
and the country's prestigious law firms and corporations.  Many federal, state
and local government agencies throughout the country also employ DCL/MSU alumni.</P>
<P>A profile of the last five classes indicates that a majority of the
graduates took employment with private law firms.  Ranging from boutique firms
of 15 or fewer lawyers to large national and international firms, over 200
different firms hired these DCL/MSU graduates.</P>
<P>Most firms are Michigan-based; however, an increasing number of DCL/MSU
graduates have obtained positions in such places as New York, Washington, D.C.,
Florida, California, Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and
Massachusetts.  Graduates work in a broad range of legal fields including health
care law, environmental law, intellectual property, bankruptcy, corporate and
tax.</P>
<P>Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University graduates also are
employed by several of the international tax and consulting firms such as
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young and Price
Waterhouse.</P>
<P>Graduates also serve as judicial clerks at the federal and state levels. 
Still others have positions with U.S. Attorney's Offices, State Attorney General
Offices and Prosecuting Attorney and Public Defender offices as well as with
other state or local agencies and departments.</P>
<P>A number of recent graduates have assumed positions with national
governmental agencies, such as:  </P>
<P><I>Federal Bureau of Investigation <BR>Immigration &amp; Naturalization
Service <BR>Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service National Labor
Relations Board <BR>Securities and Exchange Commission
<BR>United States Department of Labor</I></P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Purpose">The Purpose of the Center</A></H4>
<P>The organized study of Canadian-U.S. legal relations is particularly
important because Canada and the U.S. are one another's single largest trading
partners.  Of that trade, approximately one-third passes through Michigan and
the Detroit Customs Authority.  Michigan's location as a border state, with
major trade, commercial and cultural associations with Canada, makes it an ideal
location for the creation of this organization.</P>
<P>The purpose of the Center is to provide a vehicle through which law students
and faculty and members of the legal and business communities gain insights into
the legal framework within which Canada and the United States conduct their
legal and economic relations.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Program">The Center's Program</A></H4>
<P>Sponsored by grants from the United States and Canadian governments and
supported by other private sector entities, the Center offers specific courses
on Canadian law and Canadian-American legal relations within the already
extensive international law program at the College.  The Center also sponsors
the Canadian Summer Law Internship Program described in the next section.</P>
<P>Members of the Center faculty have been instrumental in the organization of
several bar and professional organization programs dealing with Canadian-U.S.
legal topics.  The Center offers the practicing bar programs on special
Canadian-United States legal issues and sponsors transnational conferences about
the business, economic and legal relations between both nations.  </P>
<P>The Center also provides research and publication opportunities for
students, faculty and private lawyers.  The Executive Director of the Center is
Professor John W. Reifenberg.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Internship">Canadian Summer Law Internship Program</A></H4>
<P>The Center sponsors the Canadian Summer Law Internship Program in Ottawa. 
Law students are provided a unique hands-on opportunity to witness, and
participate in, the Canadian legal/political system at work.  The program
consists of a six week law internship placement with Canadian lawyers, including
placements at the Ministry of Justice, the House of Commons, the Federal Court
of Canada and other federal agencies.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Joint">Joint Practice Opportunities</A></H4>
<P>Canadian nationals who have earned law degrees at U.S. law schools or who
are qualified to practice in the United States may be considered for advanced
standing by the Canadian Joint Committee on Foreign Accreditation and,
therefore, may be entitled to sit for the bar exam in Canada. The Center program
is designed to aid such joint practice opportunities.</P>

<BODY><H3>MICHIGAN LAW REVISION COMMISSION</H3>
<H4>Thirtieth Annual Report to the <BR>Legislature for Calendar Year 1995</H4>
<P><BR></P>
<HR>
<H4>To the Members of the Michigan Legislature:</H4>
<P></P>
<P>The Michigan Law Revision Commission hereby presents its thirtieth annual
report pursuant to section 403 of Act No. 268 of the Public Acts of 1986, MCL &#167;
4.1403.</P>
<P>The Commission, created by section 401 of Act No. 268 of the Public Acts of
1986, MCL &#167; 4.1401, consists of two members of the Senate, with one from
the majority and one from the minority party, appointed by the Majority Leader
of the Senate; two members of the House of Representatives, with one from the
majority and one from the minority party, appointed by the Speaker of the House;
the Director of the Legislative Service Bureau or his or her designee, who
serves as an ex-officio member; and four members appointed by the Legislative
Council. The terms of the members appointed by the Legislative Council are
staggered. The Legislative Council designates the Chairman of the Commission.
The Vice Chairman is elected by the Commission.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H4>Membership</H4>
<P></P>
<P>The legislative members of the Commission during 1995 were Senator Dave
Honigman of West Bloomfield; Senator Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township;
Representative Michael Nye of Litchfield; and Representative Ted Wallace of
Detroit. As Director of the Legislative Service Bureau, Elliott Smith was the
ex-officio Commission member. The appointed members of the Commission were
Richard McLellan, Anthony Derezinski, Maura Corrigan, and George Ward. Mr.
McLellan served as Chairman. Mr. Derezinski served as Vice Chairman. Professor
Kevin Kennedy of the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University served
as Executive Secretary. Gary Gulliver served as the liaison between the
Legislative Service Bureau and the Commission. Brief biographies of the 1995
Commission members and staff are located at the end of this report.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H4>The Commission's Work in 1995</H4>
<P></P>
<P>The Commission is charged by statute with the following duties:</P>
<OL>
<LI> To examine the common law and statutes of the state and current judicial
decisions for the purpose of discovering  defects and anachronisms in the law
and to recommend needed reform.
</LI>
<LI> To receive and consider proposed changes in law recommended by the
American Law Institute, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
State Laws, any bar association, and other learned bodies.
</LI>
<LI> To receive and consider suggestions from justices, judges, legislators and
other public officials, lawyers, and the public generally as to defects and
anachronisms in the law.
</LI>
<LI> To recommend such changes in the law as it deems necessary in order to
modify or eliminate antiquated and inequitable rules of law, and to bring the
civil and criminal law of this state into harmony with modern conditions.
</LI>
<LI> To encourage the faculty and students of the law schools of this state to
participate in the work of the Commission.
</LI>
<LI> To cooperate with the law revision commissions of other states and
Canadian provinces.
</LI>
<LI> To issue an annual report.
</LI>
</OL>
<P><BR></P>
<P>The problems to which the Commission directs its studies are largely
identified through an examination by the Commission members and the Executive
Secretary of the statutes and case law of Michigan, the reports of learned
bodies and commissions from other jurisdictions, and legal literature. Other
subjects are brought to the attention of the Commission by various organizations
and individuals, including members of the Legislature.</P>
<P>The Commission's efforts during the past year have been devoted primarily to
three areas. First, Commission members provided information to legislative
committees related to various proposals previously recommended by the
Commission. Second, the Commission examined suggested legislation proposed by
various groups involved in law revision activity. These proposals included
legislation advanced by the Council of State Governments, the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the law revision
commissions of various jurisdictions within and without the United States (e.g.,
California, New York, and Ontario). Finally, the Commission considered various
problems relating to special aspects of current Michigan law suggested by its
own review of Michigan decisions and the recommendations of others.</P>
<P>As in previous years, the Commission studied various proposals that did not
lead to legislative recommendations. In the case of certain uniform or model
acts, the Commission sometimes found that the subjects treated had been
considered by the Michigan Legislature in recent legislation and, therefore, 
did not recommend further action. In other instances, uniform or model acts were
not pursued because similar legislation was currently pending before the
Legislature upon the initiation of legislators having a special interest in the
particular subject.</P>
<P>In 1995, the Commission studied the three topics listed below.  The
Commission recommends immediate legislative action on the first of the topics
studied. On the second topic, the Commission recommends that no legislative
action be taken.  On the third topic, the Commission presents a study report.</P>
<P>The three topics are:</P>
<P>(1) Revisions to the Michigan &quot;Lemon&quot; Law.</P>
<P>(2) The Uniform Adoption Act.</P>
<P>(3) Reproductive Technologies (study report).</P>
<P><BR><BR></P>
<H4>Proposals for Legislative Consideration in 1996</H4>
<P></P>
<P>In addition to its new recommendations, the Commission recommends favorable
consideration of the following recommendations of past years upon which no final
action was taken in 1995:</P>
<P>(1)  Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, 1988 Annual Report, page 13.</P>
<P>(2)  Consolidated Receivership Statute, 1988 Annual Report, page 72.</P>
<P>(3)  Condemnation Provisions Inconsistent with the Uniform Condemnation
Procedures Act, 1989 Annual Report, page 15.</P>
<P>(4)  Proposed Administrative Procedures Act, 1989 Annual Report, page 27.</P>
<P>(5)  Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 1990 Annual Report, page 19.</P>
<P>(6)  Amendment of Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, 1990 Annual
Report, page 141.</P>
<P>(7)  Amendment of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, 1991
Annual Report, page 19.</P>
<P>(8)  International Commercial Arbitration, 1991 Annual Report, page 31.</P>
<P>(9)  Tortfeasor Contribution Under Michigan Compiled Laws  &#167;600.2925a(5),
1992 Annual Report, page 21.</P>
<P>(10)  Amendments to Michigan's Estate Tax Apportionment Act, 1992 Annual
Report, page 29.</P>
<P>(11)  Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 1993 Annual Report, page 7.</P>
<P>(12)  Amendments to Michigan's Anatomical Gift Act, 1993 Annual Report, page
53.</P>
<P>(13)  Ownership of a Motorcycle for Purposes of Receiving No-Fault Insurance
Benefits, 1993 Annual Report, page 131.</P>
<P>(14)  Repeal of UCC Article 6: Bulk Transfers, 1994 Annual Report, page 111.</P>
<P>(15)  The Uniform Putative and Unknown Fathers Act and Revisions to Michigan
Laws Concerning Parental Rights of Unwed Fathers, 1994 Annual Report, page 117.</P>
<P>(16)  Arson as a Predicate Felony of the Michigan Felony Murder Statute,
1994 Annual Report, page 179.</P>
<P><BR><BR></P>
<H4>Current Study Agenda</H4>
<P></P>
<P>Topics on the current study agenda of the Commission are: </P>
<P>(1) Declaratory Judgment in Libel Law/Uniform Correction or Clarification of

<P>The Commission continues to operate with its sole staff member, the
part-time Executive Secretary, whose offices are in the Detroit College of Law
at Michigan State University, Detroit,  Michigan  48201. The Executive Secretary
of the Commission is Professor Kevin Kennedy, who was responsible for the
publication of this report. By using faculty members at the several Michigan law
schools as consultants and law students as researchers, the Commission has been
able to operate at a budget substantially lower than that of similar commissions
in other jurisdictions. At the end of this report, the Commission provides a
list of more than 70 Michigan statutes passed since 1967 upon the recommendation
of the Commission.     </P>
<P>The Legislative Service Bureau, through Mr. Gary Gulliver, its Director of

the Legislative Council. </P>
<P>The Commission continues to welcome suggestions for improvement of its
program and proposals.            </P>

<P>The Summer Law Program in Romania provides U.S. law students with the unique
opportunity to earn up to six academic credits during the five week period from
May 26, 1997 through June 30, 1997 in the setting of a historic
<A HREF="#Babes/Bolyai">Central European
</A>university in a <A HREF="#Romania">country</A> that is currently in
transition to a capitalist economy.  <A HREF="#Course">Courses</A> in Public
International Law, European Community Law. White Collar Crime, and Transnational
Securities Regulation will be offered by <A HREF="#Faculty">faculty</A> members
of both Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University and Babes/Bolyai
University in <A HREF="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~ilies/webcluj/cluj.html">Cluj-Napoca,
Romania</A>, providing students with the opportunity to experience legal
instruction from faculty schooled in both the civil and common law traditions. 
An <A HREF="#Enrichment">enrichment</A> component will include visits to
various legal institutions of the host county; participation in small discussion
groups with other members of the Faculty of Law of the host institution, and
social interaction with law students of the host institution.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Romania">About the Region:</A></B><BR><A
HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~tour/office/">Romania</A></P>
<P>Romania is a country at the very center of eastern Europe.  It is surrounded
by the Ukraine, the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Austria.  During its
history, it has been a part of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the
Ottoman Empire, and the Austrian Empire, all of which have left lingering
imprints upon modern-day Romanian cities and society.  Having escaped the
devastation and destruction of the Second World War, Romania's cities, like
Prague in the Czech Republic, retain many examples of these past influences. 
Bucharest, the capital of Romania, is often described as the &quot;little Paris&quot;,
due to its broad boulevards and architecture, which is also reminiscent of the
DuPont Circle area of Washington, D.C.   Because of its riches in agriculture,
oil and other natural resources, however, Romania has a modern side to it.  All
of this bodes well for Romania to be one of the early candidates of the
eastern-bloc countries for admission to the European Community once its has made
the full transition to a capitalist economy.  The language spoken is Romanian, a
romance language most analogous to Italian.</P>
<P>Transylvania</P>
<P>Transylvania is the westernmost of the three provinces of Romania, the other
two being Wallachia and Moldavia.  At various times throughout its history it
has been a part of Hungary, and the Hungarian influence is widely felt in the
foods and customs of its people throughout most of the province .  Budapest lies
only three hours by train from its border.  Although some ethnic strains
continue in Transylvania between the ethnic Hungarians and the Romanians, a
recent treaty concluded between Hungary and Romania should go far to reduce
these tensions in the future.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~ilies/webcluj/cluj.html">Cluj-Napoca</A></P>
<P>Cluj-Napoca is the capital of Transylvania, and is a modern city with a
population of some 300,000 persons.  For most of its history, it has been a
university community, the first university  having been established during the
Holy Roman Empire in medieval times.  The historic city center contains the
University, the Ministry of Justice, including the courts of appeal, the Opera
House, the Hungarian National Theater, the Orthodox Cathedral and St. Michael's
Church which dates to the 13th Century.  Still standing is the house in which
one of the Holy Roman Emperors was born, although most of the other buildings in
the city center date to the 19th and 20th Centuries, with the architecture
reflecting the various styles of those periods.  Surrounding the city center are
more modern communities of high-rise apartment buildings in which most of the
residents live.  Cluj-Napoca hosts a resident professional theater company, a
resident professional opera company, and the Transylvania Symphony Orchestra.</P>
<P><A NAME="Babes/Bolyai">Babes/Bolyai University</A></P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.ubbcluj.ro/">Babes/Bolyai University</A> is an
archetypical European city university.  It occupies most of the buildings
located in the historic center of Cluj, and is surrounded by the cultural, legal
and administrative public buildings of the city.  It currently offers degrees in
a number of disciplines, including law, economics, medicine, music, chemistry
and engineering, to approximately 12,000 students, a number of whom come from
Greece, Palestine, Moldova and other neighboring countries.  The University
Library contains some 500,000 volumes, with a number of volumes on U.S. law in
English provided by the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University
through the CEELI Sister Law School Program.  There are a number of spacious
reading rooms throughout the main University Library building, as well as in
other departments of the University.  The University also houses the Center for
European Studies, which fosters an exchange of students and lecturers between
the University and member states of the European Union.  </P>
<P><B><A NAME="law">The Faculty of Law</A></B></P>
<P>The Faculty of Law of Babes/Bolyai University is one of the two preeminent
law faculties in Romania.  It is comprised of a distinguished group of legal
educators, among whom is<A HREF="#Enrichment"> Todor Draganu,</A> former
Romanian ambassador to the United Nations and expert in international law, and
<A HREF="#Enrichment">Ion Turcu</A>, an expert in banking and commercial law
who has published extensively in those fields.  Most members of the Faculty of
Law have undertaken studies during their legal careers abroad, either in Europe,
the United States or the Soviet Union.  As a result, a number of them are
conversant in English, as well as French or Russian.  </P>
<P><B><A NAME="Educational">Educational Objectives</A></B></P>
<P>The Summer Program in Romania is intended to provide students with an
opportunity to experience the changes being wrought in the legal institutions
and the laws of a country which is in the process of shedding 50 years of a
communist social order for a return to the commerce- driven free enterprise
system, all while earning academic credit in an ABA-approved <A HREF="#Program">program</A>
of study abroad.  As a means of achieving these objectives, students will:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Obtain insights into the legal methodology of <A HREF="#Faculty">faculty
member</A>s schooled in the civil and common law traditions;</LI>
<LI>Gain exposure to the <A HREF="#Enrichment">legal institutions</A> of the
host country;
</LI>
<LI>Witness the effect of the transition to a market economy on those legal
institutions as they are occurring;</LI>
<LI> Establish<A HREF="#Enrichment"> personal contacts</A> with judges,
attorneys, and law students of the host country which may facilitate potential
future collaborative efforts in business or legal matters;</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI> Experience <A HREF="#Enrichment">student life</A> at a typical European
university still in session for its regular students.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P><B><A NAME="Program">The Summer Program</A></B></P>
<P>Students will be eligible to register for up to six credits out of the eight
credits being offered, or for three of the four 2-credit hour courses.  The

<P></P>
<P><B><A NAME="Course">Course Descriptions</A></B></P>
<P><I><A NAME="Public">Public International Law.</A></I>  The course is an
introductory, survey course in pulic international law, covering such topics as
the sources of international law and the law of treaties; the relationship of
international law to municipal law; personality; territory; state jurisdiction,
responsibility, and the use of force; human rights; the law of the sea; and
arbitration and judicial settlement of suits.  Professor Micu.</P>
<P><I><A NAME="European">European Community Law.</A></I>  This course will

principles of Community law; the nature and sources of Community law; the role
of the European Court of Justice; an analysis of fundamental treaties of the
European Community, and its institutions, including the European Council and
Parliament, and the institutions of economic and monetary union.  Professor
Leicu.</P>
<P><I><A NAME="White">White Collar Crime.  </A></I>This course has two
components: (1) the criminalization of certain business practices by the U.S.
government, which focuses on the distinctions between individual and corporate
guilt and penalties, and upon the application of such laws to foreign nationals;
and (2)  the unique U.S. procedural and ethical problems faced by counsel in
handling white collar crime cases.  The offences covered will include
conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, RICO, money laundering and international
financial crimes.  Professor Mell,</P>
<P><I><A NAME="Transnational">Transnational Securities Regulation.</A></I> 
This course will deal with the extraterritorial application of U.S. Securities
law, primarily the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.  Included will be discussions of both subject matter jurisdiction and
personal jurisdiction of cases involving sales of securities by foreign issuers;
problems of discovery and investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and private litigants, and the enforcement of judgments, penalties,
and decrees in foreign states, and the developing cooperative efforts between
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and foreign enforcement agencies. 
Of necessity, some comparisons will be made of the U.S. securities laws with
those of other countries having developed securities markets.  Professor

<P>It is contemplated that, during the course of the Summer Program, students
will be exposed to the various financial and legal institutions of Romania. To
that end, visits to the Ministry of Justice, the Courts of Appeal, the
Magistrates Courts, and the Public Prosecutor's office in Cluj will be arranged
during the term of the Program.  Visits to the Chambers of the practicing bar,
as well as the Cluj stock exchange may be arranged, as well.  No additional
academic credit will be awarded for participation in the enrichment program. 
</P>
<P>It is expected that the regular law program of study at Babes/Bolyai
University will still be in session during the initial period of the Program,
although those students may be involved in oral examinations at the time.  This
should provide an opportunity for students enrolled in the Program to meet and
interrelate with those students, many of whom are conversant in English. 
Moreover, to the extent that they are available, other members of the Faculty of
Law, such as Professor Draganu or Professor Turcu will be asked to meet with
participants in the Summer Program to discuss current topics of mutual interest
or the legal problems being encountered in the transition of the Romanian
economy to a free enterprise system.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Classrooms">Classrooms and Administrative Offices</A></B></P>
<P>All classes will be held in the building housing the Faculty of Law of
<A HREF="#Babes/Bolyai">Babes/Bolyai University</A>.  The Program
administrative offices will also be located there, and the Program Director will
be available in those offices during most of every day of classes, with the
exception of the time spent in class teaching.  The Faculty of Law building
houses classrooms, faculty offices, and administrative offices only.  While the
law library and student study areas are located elsewhere on campus,
computerized research facilities on CD-Rom on both Romanian and U.S. law in
their respective languages are located in the Faculty of Law building for use by
the faculty and students, including those enrolled in the Program.  A small
computer lab is also available for student use.  The classroom building is a 10
minute tram ride and 10 minute walk from the location for <A HREF="#Housing">student
housing</A>.  It takes approximately 35 to 40 minutes to walk the entire
distance.  The classroom building is about a 10-minute walk to the
<A HREF="#Babes/Bolyai">University Library</A>, which is available for use by
students enrolled in the Program and provides ample study space in several
reading rooms.  </P>
<P><B><A NAME="Tuition">Program Tuition and Fees.</A></B></P>
<P>Tuition, room and board for students in the Summer Program is $2,500.00.  
This includes all costs of the program, course materials, <A HREF="#Housing">room
charges</A>, and the costs of three <A HREF="#Meals">meals</A> per day for the
five-week period of operation of the Program in Romania.  In addition, students
are expected to pay a nonrefundable application fee of $50.  Tuition is due by
April 15, 1997.  Because of advance planning commitments which must be made for
the Program, tuition may be refunded only if notice of withdrawal is provided in
early May and only for exigent reasons.  </P>
<P><B><A NAME="Housing">Housing Facilities and Fees</A></B></P>
<P>All<A HREF="#Tuition"> fees </A>for housing are included in the $2,500.00
fees for the Program.  Students will be housed in foreign student housing
located in the University Park.  Each student suite consists of a living-study
area, a bedroom with two beds, and an attached bath, containing a toilet, sink
and tub with handheld shower.  Hot water is available about 18 hours per day. 
Two students will be assigned to each suite.  The University Park contains most
of the athletic facilities of the University, which includes several soccer
fields, a jogging track, clay tennis courts, an indoor gymnasium and health spa.
 These facilities will be available for use by students enrolled in the Program.
 Tram service to the city center is available for less than a penny every 5 or
10 minutes at the entrance to the University Park.  The Program Director and U.S
faculty will be housed in a building immediately adjacent to the student housing
facility.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Meals">Meals</A></B></P>
<P>Meals will be provided daily at the Faculty Dining Club located across from

participants, and should approximate $1,600.00, return. 
<A HREF="http://www.delta-air.com/index.html">Delta Airlines</A> provides
service to Bucharest via Frankfort and Vienna from many airports throughout the
U.S.  Tarom, the national airline of Romania, also has flights from New York to
Cluj.  The Program Director will be making arrangements for air travel from
Detroit to Cluj, with a 10-day stopover in Athens, Greece planned for the return
leg.  For those Program participants interested in traveling with the Program
Director, this should be so indicated at the time of application on the
<A HREF="http://www.dcl.edu/romapp.htm">Application Form</A>.  If there are
sufficient numbers, travel cost may be less than the above estimate.</P>
<P>Travel Documents</P>
<P>A valid <A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/passport_easy.html">U.S. passport</A>
and visa issued by the Romanian embassy are required for entry into Romania.  In
order to participate in the Summer Program, a valid U.S. Passport must be
obtained sufficiently in advance of departure for Romania, in order to obtain
the necessary visa.  Moreover, if participants intend to travel to some of the
neighboring countries, visas may be required for entry, and the student is
advised to investigate those requirements well in advance of departure.</P>
<P>Travel Advisories</P>
<P>All applicants are advised to consult the latest State Department Travel
Advisory for Romania, prior to application, for information on the political,
social and health conditions in Romania.  These Advisories are updated
periodically or as conditions warrant and may be obtained at the following
internet address: <A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/romania.html">http://travel.state.gov/romania.html</A>.
 The Program Director will send to all persons registered for the Summer Program
the latest Travel Advisory prior to departure for Cluj.</P>
<P>Health Insurance</P>
<P>In light of the great disparity between medical care in the United States
and Romania, students registered in the Program are advised to obtain insurance
that will cover costs involved in airlifting a participant in the Program to the
nearest U. S. equivalent medical facility, in the event of serious injury or
illness.  Such insurance may be obtained for approximately $150 from various
providers, including Worldwide Assistance in Washington, (800) 821-2828,
International SOS in Trevost, PA (800) 523-8930,  and USAssist in Bethesda, MD 
(800) 756-5900, all of which accept credit card charges.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Living">Living Expenses in Romania</A></B></P>
<P>Due to the extremely favorable exchange rate between the Romanian leu and
the U.S. dollar, incidental costs of living while at Cluj should be minimal. 
Tram fare is less than a penny, <A HREF="#Meals">meals</A> in a restaurant
about $2, and round-trip airfare from Cluj to the Black Sea resort of Costanza
about $100 round trip..  Western products, such as soft drinks, chocolate, and
cigarettes, however, more closely approximate their equivalent in U.S. dollars. 
Travel  to Budapest or other parts of Romania can be undertaken by train at
additional expense to the participants.</P>
<P><A NAME="Facilities"><B>Facilities for the Physically Challenged</B></A></P>
<P>The public buildings of Cluj and the University buildings, including the
<A HREF="#Housing">housing</A> and <A HREF="#Classrooms">classroom</A>
facilities for the Program, make no accommodation for the physically challenged
by means of elevators or the like.  The classrooms and administrative office of
the Program can be reached only by at least one long flight of stairs of some 30
steps.  Student housing is located on four levels, and can be reached only by
stairs.  </P>
<P><B><A NAME="Cancellation">Cancellation Policy</A></B></P>
<P>While every effort will be made to have the Program in operation, the
Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University reserves the right to cancel
the Program for insufficient enrollment, or for health and safety considerations
of the participants.  Applicants will be notified as soon as possible of such
cancellation, and all tuition and fees, including the application fee of $50
will be fully refunded within twenty (20) days of the notice.  In the
eventuality that the Program is canceled for any of these reasons, the Program
Director will make every effort to assist applicants to find another summer
program placement.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</A></B></P>
<P>While the American Bar Association has approved the initial operation of the
Program in Romania in 1997, the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State
University makes no warranty regarding the transferability of credit taken in
the Program to any other law school.  Moreover, it makes no warranty regarding
the use of such credits to accelerate graduation at any law school.  Applicants
are urged to check with the law school in which they are currently enrolled to
determine these questions, as such determination is at the exclusive discretion
of the applicant's home law school.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Admissions">Admissions Process</A></B></P>
<P><I>1. Student Eligibility.</I></P>
<P>Minimum eligibility requirements are that the applicant be a student in good
standing at an ABA-approved law school, and have completed at least one full
year of law study.  </P>
<P><I>2. Selection Criteria.</I></P>
<P>Applications will be reviewed by the Program Director, once all required
documentation for application have been received.  Because the program is
limited to a maximum of 30 students, those applicants with a first year law
school GPA of over 2.5 will be given preference in admissions.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Application">Application and Deadlines</A></B></P>
<P>To apply send a completed Application Form, a letter  of good standing from

<P>The students of the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University
represent a wide diversity of educational backgrounds, experiences and national
origin.  The 700 current students come to the law school from over 145 various
undergraduate institutions, having earned undergraduate degrees in the entire
spectrum of academic disciplines.</P>
<P>In addition, many students have earned masters, doctoral and medical
degrees.  Women make up approximately 40 percent of the enrollment of the
College, and 13 percent of the student body classify themselves as minorities. 
The students have studied, worked or are working in a variety of fields
correlative to their study of law and future practice.  The College has, within
its student body, an exceptional reservoir of specialized talents, associated
professional education and experience.</P>
<P>DCL/MSU students are undergoing an education in the theory and purpose of
the law, along with its practical application, thus equipping them to fulfill
unique and complicated demands in and outside of the legal profession.  They are
training and gaining expertise in trial litigation and other adversarial
proceedings, as well as developing other lawyering skills.  Opportunities to
concentrate in chosen areas while in law school are also offered. DCL/MSU
graduates bring to the profession as well as to the job market unique skills and
an understanding of their future positions.</P>

<H4><A NAME="review">DETROIT COLLEGE OF LAW AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY LAW
REVIEW</A></H4>
<P>The <B>Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University Law Review</B>
is a quarterly legal periodical with numerous subscribers and a total
circulation of over 1,100 copies printed per issue.  The <B>Review</B>
publishes works by recognized legal scholars who contribute book reviews and
articles of keen interest to the legal community. Staff members provide the <B>Review</B>
with topical casenotes and thought-provoking comments on changing areas of the
law.</P>
<P><B>Law Review</B> is an autonomous student organization whose members are
recruited from among third semester day and fifth semester evening students who
have achieved an outstanding GPA.  Withdrawal from a class will prevent a
student's consideration for <B>Law Review</B>.  Any student who fails to take
the first three semesters of required courses or who fails a class will lose the
opportunity to participate on <B>Law Review</B>. No student may become a member
of the <B>Law Review </B>staff without participating in a writing competition.
No student may participate in a writing competition with a grade point average
below 2.80. </P>
<P><B> </B>Staff members earn four semester hours of ungraded credit upon
successful completion of writing and production requirements established by the
Editorial Board.  <B>Law Review</B> sets its own policies and production
schedules and is entirely responsible for the quarterly publication of the <B>Law
Review.</B> Staff members who have demonstrated editorial ability and management
skills are elected to the Editorial Board, currently consisting of the
Editor-in-Chief, six Managing Editors, a Research Editor and several Note &amp;
Comment Editors.</P>
<P>Illustrative of the <B>Law Review</B>'s ongoing commitment to provide the
profession with a current and valuable research tool is the Annual Survey of
Sixth Circuit Law, authored by experts in such fields as Bankruptcy, Civil
Rights, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law &amp; Procedure and Taxation. In
conjunction with the Annual Survey on Sixth Circuit Law, the <B>Law Review</B>
staff members write a monthly column on noteworthy Sixth Circuit decisions for
the <I>Michigan Bar Journal</I>.</P>
<P>Attuned to issues and trends in the law of national significance, the <B>Law
Review</B> undertook, in 1983, to sponsor an annual National Labor Law
Competition in conjunction with various groups in the legal community.  With the
transition to Michigan State University, the <B>Law Review</B> has elected to
suspend the competition and corresponding issue for one year.  Upon the <B>Law
Review</B>'s arrival on the campus at Michigan State University, it will
determine if the labor topic meets the best needs of the legal community or if
the <B>Review</B> can meet those needs with a different focus.  The fourth
issue of the <B>Review</B> is dedicated to issues of legal reform.  Each year,
a new topic is selected to reflect the changing role of the legal community.</P>
<P>Participation on the <B>Law Review</B> has many rewards. Employers seek out
<B>Law Review</B> members who have demonstrated capacity for analytical and
critical thought and for legal research and writing.  The experience acquired in
managing both time and personnel, in meeting critical deadlines and in producing
a quality product is an incalculable asset in confronting the challenges of the
legal profession.</P>

<H4><A NAME="JOURNAL">JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE</A></H4>
<P>The <B>Journal of International Law and Practice</B> gives DCL/MSU students
a unique opportunity to become directly involved in the international legal and
business communities.  Subscribers include over 300 law libraries throughout the
Americas, the European Community and Africa.  The <B>Journal </B>also is
available on Lexis/Nexis, reaching hundreds of law students and attorneys daily.</P>
<P>The <B>Journal</B> keeps practitioners and businesses abreast of
developments in the international marketplace and provides scholars with
articles which stimulate intellectual debate.  Each issue of the <B>Journal</B>
contains articles written by internationally recognized legal, business,
academic and government figures.  A &quot;Regional Reports&quot; section
includes articles on developments in the world's major market regions, usually
written by <B>Journal</B> members.  The <B>Journal</B> also reprints many
treaties, international agreements, foreign legislation and speeches of
prominent international figures.</P>
<P>Membership on the <B>Journal</B> is achieved through a writing competition,
which is conducted every semester.  The articles submitted may be published in
the <B>Journal</B>. Each member is required to author two articles for possible
publication during their tenure.  All members receive significant editorial
experience.  There are seven leadership positions which are filled by election
and which carry full or partial tuition scholarships.</P>
<P>One of the most significant aspects of the <B>Journal of International Law
and Practice</B> is the close ties with members of the international community. 
Forty-five well-respected attorneys, scholars, business people and government
officials sit on the Honorary Advisory Committee to offer support and advice. 
At the annual Advisory Committee meeting, the <B>Journal</B>'s editorial board,
the DCL/MSU administration and the Honorary Advisory Committee join to discuss
the future of the <B>Journal</B>.</P>
<P>The <B>Journal</B> also sponsors an International Law Symposium for
promoting international academics at DCL/MSU and throughout Michigan.</P>

<H4><A NAME="MOOT">MOOT COURT</A></H4>
<P><B>Moot Court</B> at Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University is
an extensive program of advocacy training in a competitive framework, permitting
students to develop skills beyond those acquired in the first year Research,
Writing and Advocacy courses.</P>
<P>The <B>Moot Court</B> program is administered by the <B>Moot Court</B>
Board, a student organization, with the assistance of a faculty advisor. 
Students are invited to join the program based on grade point average and
performance in the second year <B>Moot Court</B> class.  This is an elective
course and provides the pool from which staff members and inter-school
competitors are selected.  In addition, the All-School (Oralist) Competition is
open to any DCL/MSU student, with adjudication by the Moot Court Board.  At
least 12 full or partial scholarships are given to members of the Moot Court
Board.</P>
<P>The <B>Moot Court</B> program participates in several national competitions
with teams researching a complex legal problem, writing and submitting a brief
and then orally arguing before benches selected from judges and practitioners
expert in the field.  The Fall competitions include the National Moot Court
Competition sponsored by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York; the
William F. Starr Insurance Law Competition; the Chicago Bar Association (CBA)
Moot Court Competition; and the  John Marshall National Moot Court Competition
in Information and Privacy Law.  The Spring competitions include the Benjamin
Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Competition; the Irving R. Kaufman Securities Law
Competition at Fordham; the ABA Appellate Advocacy Competition; the Robert
Wagner Labor Law Competition; and the University of Minnesota Civil Rights
Competition.</P>
<P>In 1993, <B>Moot Court</B> teams from the College swept the advocacy arena
by placing first in both the Cardozo and Fordham competitions while the ABA team
placed second in the regional rounds.  In 1994-95, the Starr Insurance Team was
honored for best brief and the Nationals II Team placed second in the regional
competition, also winning for best brief, and went on to the national round.  In
the Wagner competition DCL/MSU was named second best team, with one of the
oralists being named the best at the competition.  In 1995-96, the DCL/MSU
Nationals team accomplished the near-impossible &quot;clean sweep&quot; by
taking all of the highest honors as best team, best brief and best oralist.  In
addition, the Starr Insurance Law competitors from the College finished second
overall, with third best brief; the Cardozo Entertainment Law Team placed third
overall; and the Minnesota Civil Rights Team reached the quarter-finals.</P>

<H4><A NAME="SENATE">STUDENT SENATE</A></H4>
<P>The <B>Student Senate</B>, affiliated with the Law Student Division of the
American Bar Association, is a representative body of students who are elected
annually from each class, as well as on an &quot;at large&quot; basis. The
Student Senate is the major funding and activity support group for the College. 
In addition to mentor-mentee programs, faculty evaluations and sponsorship of
speakers and debates of interest, the Senate supports social, charitable and
sporting events, including a semi-annual Red Cross blood drive and an annual
Barristers Ball.  The Senate also acts as a liaison between the administration
and the student body.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Organizations">INTERNATIONAL LAW SOCIETY</A></H4>
<P><B>  The DCL/MSU Student International Law Society </B>was organized in
1980. It is a member of the International Law Students Association.  Founded in
1962, the Association is now composed of more than 120 schools from all areas of
the United States.   The Society provides a forum through which law students,
faculty and members of the community can gain an awareness of the strengths and
weaknesses of the present international legal system in solving the problems
which transcend national boundaries. Located on an international border, Detroit
is especially sensitive to such vital concerns. Among its many activities, the
Society organizes an entry in the Phillip C. Jessup International Moot Court
Competition, an entry in the Niagara International Law Competition and presents
speakers and sponsors public discussions on various aspects of international law
and relations. Membership is open to all interested law students.</P>
<H4>AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION/LAW STUDENT DIVISION</H4>
<P>The Law Student Division of the ABA provides a liaison to the parent
American Bar Association.  Specifically, the ABA/LSD creates opportunities for
drafting policy for the Association, advises students of trends in the law and
legal practice and offers benefits to students while attending law school.</P>
<H4>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY</H4>
<P>The Christian Legal Society is a non-denominational Christian fellowship
open to all students which offers fellowship, Bible study, prayer, support and
an opportunity to share faith.  The Christian Legal Society of DCL/MSU is
founded under the purpose of joining in mutual support and training with
colleagues who are committed to loving and serving Jesus Christ through the
legal profession, and nurturing and mobilizing a national network of lawyers and
law students advocating justice and religious freedom.  This local chapter is
associated with a nationwide professional membership organization of Christian
attorneys, judges, law students and law professors, as well as supportive lay
people.  </P>
<H4>DELTA THETA PHI FRATERNITY</H4>
<P>This fraternal organization builds contacts with students, alumni and the
law community through various social activities.  The students provide members
with academic assistance by holding review sessions, maintaining a class
outlines library and sponsoring a used book sale each semester.</P>

<H3><A NAME="policy">ADMISSIONS POLICY</A></H3>
<P>  Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University does not discriminate
on the basis of gender, handicap, race, color, religion, age or national or
ethnic origin in its educational programs, admissions policies, employment
policies or other school-administered programs. This policy is enforced by
federal law under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964; Section 623 of the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act; and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</P>
<P>Applicants for admission to the Bar of Michigan and other states are
required to disclose information about themselves concerning their character and
fitness to practice law, including prior criminal convictions, to the
appropriate Bar admitting authority. Individuals planning to practice law in
another jurisdiction may wish to consult its rules concerning these matters.</P>
<H3><A NAME="PRE-LEGAL">PRE-LEGAL EDUCATION</A></H3>
<P><B>  </B>Opinion concerning the subjects of pre-legal education which will
best equip the prospective student for his/her work in law school and as a
lawyer is far from unanimous.  It is agreed, however, that a broad cultural
background in English, American government and history, economics, logic,
philosophy and the scientific method is highly desirable. </P>
<P>Above all, the prospective law student should be well-trained in the use of
the English language.  Words are tools to a lawyer, who should be a master of
their use.  Undergraduate courses which will help the pre-legal student to
achieve such mastery are strongly recommended.</P>
<P>Not more than 10 percent of the credits presented by an applicant for
admission should be non-theory courses or courses without intellectual content
of substantial value.</P>
<P>No credit toward the law school curriculum will be granted by way of
advanced standing or required course satisfaction for any undergraduate or
graduate (non-law school) course work.</P>
<H3><A NAME="ADMISSIONS">ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS</A></H3>
<P>Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University has a selective
admissions process. The objective of the process is to select men and women who
have the highest potential for advancement in the study of law.</P>
<P>Applications will be entertained from those applicants who hold a bachelor's
degree from a college or university accredited by the North Central Association
of Colleges and Secondary Schools; the New England Association of Schools and
Colleges; the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools; the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; the Northwest Association of
Secondary and Higher Schools; the Western Association of Schools and Colleges;
or the Department of Education of the State of New York.  Only those applicants
with a high grade point average and a high score on the Law School Admissions
Test (LSAT) will be considered for admission to Detroit College of Law at
Michigan State University.</P>
<P>The LSAT score and undergraduate grades are the most reliable measures
available, in most cases, for predicting probable success or failure in the
study of law.  Thus, most students are admitted primarily on the basis of
undergraduate grades and LSAT scores in approximate equal measure.</P>
<P>An admissions decision, however, is more complex than a mere rank-ordering
of applicants on the basis of a numerical formula.  The College is committed to
a broad inquiry into the role and function of law in society and seeks a diverse
student body as an integral part of its educational program. Accordingly, some
students who have outstanding performance records and exceptional aptitude for
the study and practice of law, not reflected by their undergraduate grades and
LSAT scores, are admitted at the discretion of the Faculty Admissions Committee.
For purposes of discretionary admissions, the College will consider, in addition
to undergraduate grade point average and LSAT score, an applicant's:</P>
<P>~Minority group status: African-American, Hispanic, American Indian or any
other group significantly under-represented in the legal profession and in the
student body.  </P>
<P>~Ability to overcome unusual educational or economic disadvantage.</P>
<P>~Significant improvement of grades or unusually difficult pattern of courses
taken.  </P>
<P>~Distinguished graduate study in another discipline.</P>
<P>~Age and time elapsed since undergraduate grades were earned.</P>
<P>~Extensive employment experience. </P>
<P>~Any other factors which constitute a positive contribution to the
educational experience and diversity of the student body and of the legal
profession, such as leadership ability or potential demonstrated in college or
in the community.</P>
<P>Admission to the College is competitive.  All applicants admitted to the
College clearly must be within the range of predictable success in law school.</P>
<P>In order to be admitted to the practice of law, a person must be of good
moral character. Any conduct, such as that involving dishonesty, fraud or
violation of the criminal law, which reflects adversely on fitness to practice
law, may prevent admission to the bar.  In these instances, the successful
completion of a course of legal studies and receipt of a degree from an
accredited law school will in no way insure that a person will be permitted to
practice law.</P>
<P>In many states, the Board of Bar Examiners requires registration before
students begin the study of law.  Applicants are responsible for fulfilling
registration requirements of states in which they may wish to practice law.  The
State of Michigan <B>does not</B> require such registration.</P>
<H3><A NAME="proced">ADMISSION PROCEDURES</A></H3>
<P>~New Students are admitted to the College  at the beginning of the <B>fall</B>
semester.  New  students are not admitted to the spring or    summer sessions.</P>
<P>~Applications for the fall semester, which    commences in August, must be
on file with the College on or <B>before April 15.</B></P>
<P>~Early completion of the application file (application form and LSDAS
report) is recommended, as some admissions decisions are made well before the
deadline for application.</P>
<P>~LSAT scores more than three (3) years old will not be accepted.</P>
<P>~Registration with the Law School Data Assembly Services (LSDAS) is required
by DCL/MSU.</P>
<P>~Arrangements for taking the LSAT and registering for the LSDAS must be made
by the applicant.  LSDAS registration materials and information concerning the
time and place of the LSAT can be obtained by writing to the Law School
Admissions Services (LSAS), Box 2000, Newtown, PA, 18940, or by calling 215-
968-1001.  These materials also may be picked up at the DCL/MSU Admissions
Office located at<B> N-210 North Business Complex, East Lansing, MI 48824</B></P>
<P>~Letters of recommendation are not required but are recommended.</P>
<H3><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION AND STUDENT VISA</A></H3>
<P>Canadian students attending Detroit College of Law at Michigan State
University will need to obtain an I-20 Immigration Form in order to pass through
customs.  </P>
<P>All students seeking F-1 Immigration Forms should contact the Admissions
Office immediately upon acceptance.</P>
<H3><A NAME="APPLICANTS">APPLICANTS WITH DISABILITIES</A></H3>
<P>It is the policy and practice of the Detroit College of Law at Michigan
State University to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act and state and local requirements regarding students
and applicants with disabilities.  Under these laws, no qualified individual
with a disability shall be denied access to or participation in services,
programs and activities of the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State
University.</P>
<P>Students requesting accommodations should contact the Assistant Dean for
Student Affairs.</P>
<H3><A NAME="SECURITY">SECURITY INFORMATION</A></H3>
<P>On the Detroit campus,* a Security Guard is on duty in the main building 24
hours each day and in the main parking lot from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday.  Guards are provided by a private agency which has a good
working relationship with local police.  All students, faculty and staff are
issued identification cards which they must be prepared to present upon request.
Any person without valid identification will be asked to leave the campusunless
able to prove a proper purpose for remaining.</P>
<P>The following statistical data is provided in accordance with federal
requirements:  </P>
<P>Between the dates of August 1, 1995 and July 1, 1996, the following crimes
occurred on the Detroit campus. (Campus consists of the Law School buildings and
the parking lots.):</P>

<H3><A NAME="LEAVE">LEAVE OF ABSENCE/READMISSION AFTER ABSENCE</A></H3>
<P>A student who is in good standing may arrange a Leave of Absence by
obtaining permission from the Assistant Dean who will prescribe the conditions
of the Leave.  Any other student who has earned credit in at least one law
school course while attending DCL/MSU, and has been absent from the College
without obtaining a leave of absence, must apply for readmission to the Faculty
Readmissions Committee. </P>
<P>Readmission and the terms and conditions thereof, including the amount of
credit to be allowed for previously completed courses, are matters for the
discretion of the Committee. If the absence has been for an extended period, the
Committee usually is hesitant to allow full credit for previous courses.</P>
<P>All applications for readmission should be in the form of a letter addressed
to the Readmissions Committee and should be filed with the Committee at least 90
days prior to the first day of classes of the following semester.</P>
<P>Any person, formerly admitted to the College, who has not earned credit for
any course while attending DCL/MSU, must apply for admission through the
Admissions Office. </P>
<H3><A NAME="VISITING">VISITING STUDENTS</A></H3>
<P>With the permission of the College, a student may attend another ABA and
AALS approved law school as a visitor. The terms and conditions of such
attendance shall be discretionary with the College, and only elective courses
may be taken.  Passing grades will be given credit and treated the same as
grades earned at DCL/MSU.  Application should be made to the Assistant Dean for
Student Affairs.</P>
<H3><A NAME="TRANSFER">TRANSFER STUDENTS</A></H3>
<P>Transfer applications will be entertained from students who are in good
standing and eligible to continue at an ABA accredited law school. The
successful completion of one year of law school usually is required for
transfer, but a file may be considered if less than one year is completed under
special circumstances.  Application for transfer will not be entertained from a
student who is ineligible to continue at the home institution.</P>
<P>The terms and conditions of acceptance shall be at the discretion of the
Admissions Committee.  Law school grades, as well as the applicant's original
admissions criteria, are evaluated.</P>
<P>Should a transfer applicant be accepted, no credit will be granted for
courses in which a grade below &quot;C&quot; (2.00) was earned at another law
school.</P>
<P>Generally, credits, but not grades, earned by the transfer student at
his/her previous school will be recognized by the College. However, those grades
earned by the transfer student at his/her previous school will be calculated
with the grades earned at Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University to
determine whether a student qualifies for academic honors upon graduation from
the College and in determining the student's class standing.</P>
<P>Transfer students may enter in either the fall (August) or spring (January)
semester, and applications should be submitted at least two months prior to the
commencement of the semester for which admission is desired.</P>
<H3><A NAME="DEFERRED">DEFERRED ADMISSION</A></H3>
<P>An applicant who has been admitted to the College may, under extenuating
circumstances, petition to defer admission.  Applicants seeking a deferral must
submit to the Admissions Office a written petition, a deposit of $200.00 and a
signed affidavit of non-attendance at any other law school.  Decisions on
deferral will be made at the discretion of the Admissions Committee and will be
granted on a space available basis only.</P>
<H3><A NAME="ACCEPTANCE">ACCEPTANCE</A></H3>
<P>If, at the time of applying, the applicant for admission has not yet
completed a bachelor's degree, the applicant may be accepted tentatively on the
basis of work completed to that point.  As the LSDAS report includes an
unofficial transcript, <B>acceptance is subject to receipt of a final official
transcript evidencing award of the bachelor's degree, prior to commencement of
study at Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University</B>.  This
transcript must be mailed directly from the undergraduate institution to the
Admissions Office.</P>
<P>Upon acceptance, each applicant will be required to make a non-refundable
deposit of $200.00, which will be credited to the applicant's tuition account. 
If such deposit is not received by the due date indicated in the letter of
acceptance, the applicant's acceptance may be cancelled.</P>

<H1>Externships &amp; Colleges Represented</H1>
<P><BR></P><IMG SRC="http://www.dcl.edu/redshred.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="externship">LEGAL EXTERNSHIP PROGRAM </A></H2>
<H4>I.  In General   </H4>
<P>All Externship programs are three credits and are graded. Minimum
eligibility requirements are that the student has completed successfully the
Research, Writing and Advocacy I and II courses, be in good academic standing
and have completed at least one full year of legal study (three semesters in the
case of an evening student). Some externships may have additional requirements.</P>
<P>Typically, these programs require a commitment of 12 hours per week to be
scheduled at the mutual convenience of the student and the supervising attorney
or judge. Students are required to keep daily journals of their activities in
the externship, which are turned in to the Externship Programs Director on a
bi-weekly basis. There is a classroom component as part of the program and all
externs are required to attend a minimum of four meetings during the semester.
The subject of the meetings will be announced in advance and will focus on the
educational objectives of the externship experience. At the conclusion of the
term, students will be expected to prepare a written report of at least five
pages in length on their externship experience.</P>
<P>A student may receive graduation credit for no more than six hours in
externships. Any questions concerning the program should be directed to
Professor Robert Filiatrault, the program director.</P>
<H4>II. Externship Purpose and Educational Objectives</H4>
<P>In the immediate sense, the DCL/MSU Externship Programs provide law students
with a stimulating educational experience. </P>
<P>The various programs offer a hands-on opportunity to observe the legal and
judicial systems at work and to engage in relevant legal work under the
supervision of practicing lawyers or judges. Students also are provided with a
complementing classroom component which analyzes and internalizes the externship
experience.</P>
<P>In a more general sense, these programs provide DCL/MSU students with an
understanding of the practice of law &quot;in the trenches&quot; and give the
students an opportunity to better appreciate what it means to be a lawyer or
judge.</P>
<P><B>General Objectives</B></P>
<P>While the objective of the externship programs is to provide students with
practical legal experience and skills, the nature and breadth of those
experiences and skills are varied among the programs. The following objectives
are those which are common to every externship program. They are intended to
identify for both students and supervisors the educational experience to which
all students should be exposed during their externships:</P>
<P><I>A.  Legal Analysis</I></P>
<P>Students should further develop the ability to cull pertinent factual data
and analyze relevant legal principles in order to assess and justify the merits
of alternative legal positions.</P>
<P><I>B.  Problem Solving</I></P>
<P>Students should further develop their abilities to find a common ground
among competing points of view and work toward a solution acceptable to diverse
interests.</P>
<P><I>C.  Legal Research</I></P>
<P>Students should further develop the ability to expeditiously and effectively
use appropriate research materials within the context of specific legal
problems.</P>
<P><I>D.  Professional Responsibility</I></P>
<P>Students should develop the ability to recognize the ethical considerations
that come into play as practicing lawyer or judge. Students should appreciate
the sometime conflicting role of an attorney both as an advocate and as an
officer of the court.</P>
<P><I>E.  Self Awareness</I></P>
<P>Students should begin to see themselves as productive members of the legal
profession. Through their externship experience, students can more closely focus
upon those aspects of law practice in which they have an interest in order to
help determine career paths.</P>

<H4><A NAME="letter">A Letter from the Dean</A></H4>
<P>Dear Alumni and Friends of the Detroit College of Law at Michigan State
University:</P>
<P> It is a pleasure to be in Michigan, to be a member of the Detroit College
of Law family and to be a part of the future of DCL at Michigan State
University.  The Detroit College of Law has a distinguished history: over a
century of educating men and women who have taken their places among the best
lawyers in the state, the midwest and the nation.</P>
<P> The affiliation with Michigan State University is one of the most important
events in the life of this institution since its establishment over 100 years
ago.  This is a new century for the Detroit College of Law.  Opportunities are
multiplied and our vision enlarged by this alliance.  It is as exciting for us
as it must have been for those students who conceived and opened the Detroit
College of Law in the basement of the Detroit College of Medicine on St. Antoine
Street before the turn of the 20th century.</P>
<P> Now, as then, we need the support of community leaders, the Bar and, of
course, our graduates and friends to see us successfully into the 21st century.</P>
<P> In the next several weeks and months, I hope to meet as many of you as
possible.  We want you to send us new students, to help us with the placement of
our graduates and to assist us when you can in our training and educational
programs.  Above all, we ask you to help us financially.  We are a private
school and we need the sustained generosity of friends and alumni to continue
our mission of providing an excellent legal education for the sons and daughters
of Michigan, for students from sister states and for scholars from abroad.</P>
<P> The Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University has a future like
no other in the nation.  We are excited about the years ahead.  We want you to
be a part of our success.</P>
<P><I>- - - Jeremy T. Harrison, Dean</I></P><IMG

<H4><A NAME="Jeremy">Jeremy T. Harrison, New DCL/MSU Dean</A></H4>
<P> Jeremy Thomas Harrison, a former law dean and legal scholar with a wide
range of international experiences, was chosen unanimously by the DCL/MSU Board
of Trustees to serve as dean of DCL/MSU effective July 1, 1996.  He has spent
the last several weeks on both the East Lansing and Detroit campuses, learning
procedures and names, and acclimating himself to the unique DCL/MSU situation.</P>
<P> Dean Harrison served as dean of the William S. Richardson School of Law at
the University of Hawaii from 1985-1994.  He has wide-ranging international
credentials.  He spent 1995-1996 as ELIPS Distinguished Professor of Law at
Universitas Gadjah Mada, Bulaksumar, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  He has taught in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Western Nigeria.  He was a tenured professor of
law at the University of San Francisco (California) from 1966-1984.  He received
his B.S. in 1957 and his J.D. in 1960 from the University of San Francisco, and
in 1962 he earned an LL.M. at Harvard Law School.</P>
<P> In public and professional activities, Dean Harrison served as president of
the Board of Directors of the Pacific Health Research Institute in Honolulu.  He
was a member of the Hawaii State Bar Association Executive Committee and on its
standing committee on lawyer competence, specialization and continuing legal
education. He has been a member of the Hawaii Commission on Access to Justice, a
member of the Hawaii State Bar Foundation Board of Directors and a member of the
District of Hawaii Merit Screening Committee for the selection of the Hawaii
District Bankruptcy Judge.</P>
<P> &quot;The law school is delighted to have an individual of Jeremy
Harrison's stature as the first permanent dean of the College in its new
affiliation with Michigan State University,&quot; said George N. Bashara, Jr.,
president of the Board of Trustees of DCL/MSU.  &quot;Together with the faculty,
the staff and the trustees, we sincerely believe that he will guide the College
as it builds to a 21st-century stature of eminence in the legal and academic
communities.&quot;  Bashara said Harrison will complete relocation of DCL to
MSU's campus. </P>
<P> &quot;I congratulate DCL on this selection, one wholly endorsed by Provost
Lou Anna Simon and me,&quot; MSU president Peter McPherson said.  &quot;This is
a crucial appointment as DCL grows in stature in a new context.&quot;</P><IMG
SRC="http://www.dcl.edu/redshred.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<H4><A NAME="debate">THE GREAT DEBATE . . .DCL/MSU-STYLE </A></H4>
<P> Two alumni of the law school will slug it out toe-to-toe in the November
race for  Prosecuting Attorney in Oakland County.  And, with the support of the
DCL/MSU Alumni Association and its president, Charles E. Langton, '87, many
southeastern Michigan-area alumni from the College will have ringside seats to a
debate between the two candidates.</P>
<P> David Gorcyca, '88, the Republican candidate, and Steven Kaplan, '81, the
Democratic nominee, are expected to offer widely opposing views in answer to the
questions of the day regarding trials, politics and prosecution in Oakland
County.  Gorcyca formerly served as an assistant prosecutor in the county;
Kaplan, also a resident of Oakland County, presently is an assistant prosecutor
in Macomb County.</P>
<P> &quot;This is an excellent illustration of the process whereby the
University can serve the legal community in tandem with the law school,&quot;
notes Langton.  &quot;The alumni and public can be assured of the continued
commitment to the metropolitan community on the part of DCL/MSU.</P>
<P> The debate will be held at the Michigan State University Management Center
at 811 W. Square Lake Road in Troy.  Four politically and legally knowledgeable
individuals will pose questions to the candidates, with time offered for
rebuttal and general statements.</P>
<P> The debate will be open to the public, with seating in the auditorium
limited to 400 on a first-come, first-served basis.  There is no charge for
attendance.</P><IMG SRC="http://www.dcl.edu/redshred.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

Lansing community in the legislative, executive and judicial branches.  It will
be an excellent time to network and get to know the movers and shakers in town.</P>
<P> The Kresge Art Center is located on MSU's campus at Auditorium and Physics
Roads, within walking distance of the Eppley Center.  And, while you're on

<P>Members of the DCL/MSU Alumni Association are invited to the second annual

<P>Only a limited number of football tickets are available, and these will be
sold only to members of the Alumni Association, with only ONE GUEST PER MEMBER,
on a first-come, first-served basis.  Additional celebrants who have their own
previously-purchased game tickets also are invited to the &quot;tailgate&quot;,
but only in limited numbers with prior reservations. </P>
<P>The party, beginning at 10:00 a.m. (kick-off is at 1:00 p.m.), will be held
right across Shaw Lane from the construction of the new law school, at the
corner of Shaw Lane and Bogue, on the lawn of Eppley Center.  Cost for game and

entertainment!</P><IMG SRC="http://www.dcl.edu/redshred.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<H4><A NAME="RETIREMENT">Retirement?????</A></H4>
<P>The word &quot;retirement&quot; should be an oxymoron to the young at heart.
 This period in life should not be frittered away only on the beach or golf
course.  This is the time to help yourself by helping others.  Finish that law
article that has been gathering dust.  Start that advanced degree you have been
thinking abut for years; enroll in that extended legal seminar that you never
had time to attend.</P>
<P>New studies now confirm what we retirees have always known: Brain power is
not only for the young!  In a word, retirement affords time that was not
available while dealing with a busy law practice or a hearing trial docket. 
Also, retirement is a great time to help DCL/MSU move into the 21st century/ 
See you at school!</P>

<H4><A NAME="truth">IT'S THE TRUTH . . . </A></H4>
<P><B>Wherein we discuss our first class to begin studies in East Lansing . .
.</B></P>
<P>An interview with DCL/MSU Admissions Director  Andrea Heatley, 91,<BR>by
Gwenn Samuel, Director of External Publications, DCL/MSU</P>
<P><B>Q: How many students will make up the first class to enter DCL/MSU on
the East Lansing campus?</B></P>
<P>A: As of this date (August 8) we have 168 day students and 40 evening
students.  In addition, there are 57 outstanding accepts (students accepted who
have not made a final decision as yet).</P>
<P><B>Q: Is that below expectations?</B></P>
<P>A: In the day class, once we add some of those outstanding accepts, we will
have two sections which will be quite close to the 94 maximum we can fit into
the borrowed classroom we will be using.  The evening class, currently at 40, is
smaller than we would have liked.</P>
<P><B>Q: Does that mean that we will not have an evening session?</B></P>
<P>A: Quite the contrary.  We were cognizant of the fact that the evening
classes the first few years would be small.  It is just a question of building
awareness about the evening program in the Lansing area and in surrounding
counties.  This is something new for them.</P>
<P><B>Q: What is the quality of those who have applied?</B></P>
<P>A: The quality is quite good.  We have a great many Michigan State alumni
who wish to stay in East Lansing to complete their education - 79 members of the
new class are from MSU. The overlap schools also are a higher level.</P>
<P><B>Q: Overlap schools?</B></P>
<P>A: Overlap schools are those at which applicants who have paid deposits to
our school also have paid deposits.  We are in a whole new league, just by
nature of the affiliation.</P>
<P><B>Q: What about minority applications?</B></P>
<P>A: Applications from women and minorities have stayed constant.  There is no
change.  </P>
<P><B>Q: Has the applicant pool grown wider or stayed pretty much the same?</B></P>
<P>A: Much wider!  Students who have applied include almost 20 from California,
15 from Florida, 15 from New Jersey, 22 from New York, 50 from Canada, two from
Puerto Rico, eight from Virginia, nine from Texas and almost 100 from states
which have their own Big Ten Schools.  We have never had so many applicants (30)
from Ohio, which has nine law schools.  Previously, 80% of our applicants came
from Michigan.  This year, that number has decreased to 66%, but the applicants
are from a much larger range of areas within the state.  We have had several
foreign applicants, and we have accepted two students from as far away as Seoul,
Korea.  </P>
<P><B>Q: How long have you been working to put this first class together?</B></P>
<P>A: The Admissions Office has been in East Lansing since September, 1995.  It
is located in the Eppley Center.  We have a tiny office, which used to be the
kitchen and lounge for the accounting faculty.  The faculty and deans of the
Business College stop in frequently to see how we're doing.  As of this spring,
there also is a small office from the Financial Aid Department located here, and
the members of the law school faculty who will teach this year are beginning to
operate from their East Lansing offices.</P>
<P><B>Q: With you in Lansing and the faculty in Detroit up until now, how have
you managed to put the class together.</B></P>
<P>A: That is a minor glitch in the system.  The Faculty Admissions Committee
is in Detroit and I am in East Lansing.  So, I must go to Detroit to meet with
the committee every few weeks.  However, guidelines have been drawn, and I
accept or deny within those guidelines.  If I have any uncertainties within the
guidelines . . . and certainly outside of the guidelines . . . I bring the file
to the Faculty Admissions Committee.  I read every single file so I have a
better picture of the entire applicant pool, and Professor Matthew McKinnon,
Chair of the Committee, is extremely cooperative and easy to work with.</P>
<P><B>Q: What do you see for the future?</B></P>
<P>A: I believe that in a very few years we will fill the building to its
capacity.  We will need to continue to step up our publicity, stressing the
advantages to the local area.  It probably will take three to five years of
hosting events in the new building to make it a part of the consciousness of
those who are eligible.  Many people who would be in a position for taking

<P> Paul J. Carrier, '91, was selected for a Fulbright Foreign Scholarship for
the 1996-97 academic year.  As a Fulbright Scholar, Prof. Carrier will represent
the American people abroad and work to fulfill the principal purpose of the
Fulbright Program, that of increasing mutual understanding between the people of
the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and

<P> The letter from Hoyt Purvis, Chair of the J. William Fulbright Foreign
Scholarship Board, noted, &quot;Your impressive academic accomplishments have
made possible your participation in the Fulbright Program.&quot;   Prof. Carrier
will teach at Comenius University Law School of Univerzita Komenskeho in

<P>THE MEDICAL LEGAL SOCIETY is a new group of students recently formed at
DCL/MSU.  Plans include a medical legal journal, speaker events and a stronger
interaction with local health law firms.  Any alumni interested in assisting or
working with this group are asked to call students John Deluca at (810) 779-8387
or Anthony Eppert at (810) 774-4733.</P>
<H4>* * * * * * * * * *</H4>
<P>DIVERSITY WEEK, an opportunity for differing segments of the DCL/MSU
population to appreciate and enjoy the differences while working to increase
tolerance, will be held in January, 1997.  Any alumni wishing to support the
students working on the Diversity Week Committee should call Assistant Dean
Connell Alsup, '90, at (313) 965-0657.  &quot;Support&quot; is defined as
participation (speaking) to financial (providing food, providing honorariums).</P>

<P>The WOLVERINE STUDENT BAR ASSOCIATION 26th Annual Scholarship Banquet was
held Saturday, September 7, at the Detroit Yacht Club.  The theme of this year's
gathering was &quot;Opportunity Now &amp; Forever.&quot;  Although the event was
quite successful, with a large attendance, alumni assistance still is needed. 
Donations are welcome in the amount of $40.00 to reimburse costs for students
who were comped because they were financially unable to attend.  Call Phil Ragan
at (313) 222-1332.</P>

includes articles from Detroit Lions General Manager Steven Wilen and
entertainment and sports law attorney David Potts as well as past and current
DCL/MSU students.  </P>
<H4>* * * * * * * * * *</H4>
<P>Here's something to chew on: the Michigan Tuition Grant has been eliminated
for incoming law students.  1995 Michigan Senate Bill No. 850 states as follows:</P>
<P><I>Sec. 302 (2) Tuition grant awards shall be made to all eligible Michigan
residents who apply before September 1, 1996, and who are qualified.  Tuition
grant awards shall not be made to students newly enrolled in a juris doctor law
degree program after the 1 9996 [sic] (1995-1996) academic year.</I></P>
<P>How many alumni of DCL/MSU would not have been able to attend law school or
would have had a much more difficult time without the Michigan Tuition Grant? 
Is this chapter two of &quot;Let's Kill All the Lawyers?&quot;</P><IMG

<H3><A NAME="FINANCIAL">FINANCIAL AID </A>AT DETROIT COLLEGE OF LAW AT
MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY</H3>
<P>Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University makes every attempt
possible to assist its applicants and students in obtaining financial aid for
their legal educations.  The College has full-time Financial Aid officers who
assist applicants and students in determining the types and amounts of financial
aid available to them.</P>
<P>Students who need help to finance their legal educations should submit a
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) either by mail or
electronically.  Entering students are sent FAFSA forms via the Admission
Department's application packets.  Students may receive a FAFSA form by calling
our Office of Financial Aid or by picking it up at the information rack on the
second floor of the main campus or at the East Lansing Financial Aid Office. 
Students who applied for federal student aid for the 1995-96 academic year
usually will receive a 1996-97 renewal FAFSA from the U.S. Department of
Education at the home address used in 1995-96.  To submit a completed FAFSA or
renewal FAFSA by mail, students should use the pre-addressed envelope which is
included with the FAFSA or renewal FAFSA form.  Students wishing to transmit
their completed FAFSA or renewal FAFSA electronically may do so in the Office of
Financial Aid.  Students are encouraged to transmit their FAFSAs or renewal
FAFSAs electronically in order to receive a more timely processing of their
financial aid award.  </P>
<P>Students should ensure that the completed FAFSA or renewal FAFSA list
Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University (Title IV School Code:
G02254) as a college authorized to receive their FAFSA information from the U.S.
Department of Education.  To ensure consideration for all available types of
Financial Aid for fall and spring semesters, the approximate priority deadline
for the 1997-98 academic year for first-time applicants is February 15, 1997 and
the priority deadline for all other students is March 21, 1997.  Students filing
FAFSAs or renewal FAFSAs after the priority deadline receive State of
Michigan-backed financial aid on a first-come, first-served basis, based upon
the availability of funds.</P>
<P>After the FAFSA or renewal FAFSA has been filed, students will receive a
Student Aid Report (SAR) from the central processing service for the U.S.
Department of Education.  The Office of Financial Aid also will receive SAR
information electronically on an Institutional Student Information Report
(ISIR), as long as students list Detroit College of Law at Michigan State
University on the FAFSA or renewal FAFSA as a college authorized to receive this
information.  The SAR should be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the
student upon receipt.  Any changes or corrections that need to be made to the
SAR can be transmitted electronically in the Office of Financial Aid, or
returned by mail to the address given on the SAR.  The SAR is utilized to
provide first-time applicants with a preliminary award and to request other
necessary forms/documents to complete student files.</P>
<P>To be eligible for Financial Aid, all students must enroll for at least <B>five
(5)</B> credits per semester in which they are seeking financial aid assistance
and be making satisfactory academic progress.  To make satisfactory academic
progress, a student must advance a grade level each two semesters and have a
minimum overall cumulative grade point average of a C (2.00).</P>
<P>The Office of Financial Aid packages a combination of scholarships, loans
and work-study awards: </P>
<P><B><A NAME="stafford">FEDERAL STAFFORD LOAN</A></B></P>
<P>Federal Stafford Loans are low-interest loans made to students attending
school at least half-time.  (Each institution establishes what constitutes less
than half-time.  Less than half-time at DCL/MSU is <B>four (4)</B> credit hours
or less.)  Loans are made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or savings
and loan association.  These loans are insured by the guaranty agency in each
state and reinsured by the federal government.  This loan must be repaid.</P>
<P>Students may qualify for a &quot;subsidized&quot; Federal Stafford Loan,
which is based on financial need.  &quot;Subsidized&quot; means that the
government will pay the interest on the loan while the student is in school or
during deferment periods.  Repayment begins six months after graduation or when
a borrower's student status changes to less than half-time status.</P>
<P>Students also can get an &quot;unsubsidized&quot; Federal Stafford Loan
regardless of need.  &quot;Unsubsidized&quot; means that the interest is
accruing and the borrower is responsible for paying the interest while in school
or during deferment periods.  However, interest can be deferred and capitalized
only once, at repayment, depending on the borrowers' response to choices given
on the application. Students can borrow up to $18,500 in Federal Stafford loans
each academic year.  At least $10,000 of this amount must be in unsubsidized
Stafford Loans.  However, students cannot borrow more than the cost of education
minus any other aid received.</P>
<P>A Federal Common Loan Application must be utilized for these loans.  Various
lenders will make available these common applications with their logos for the
students' convenience.  However, a lender will accept any &quot;Federal Common&quot;
application with any logo, provided the borrower initials a change and includes
the correct lender code and complete mailing address.  Loan applications may be
obtained at the lending institution or at our Office of Financial Aid or
information rack.  Note that an interest fee, origination fee and insurance
premiums may be assessed with these loans. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="ALTERNATIVE">ALTERNATIVE LOAN PROGRAMS</A></B></P>
<P>Alternative loans are non-need, credit-based loans which may be used to
supplement other forms of financial assistance.  To be eligible for an
alternative loan, students must meet the criteria established by the specific
lender.  Although annual loan minimums and aggregate loan limits vary from
lender to lender, the maximum annual limit for an alternative loan must not
exceed a student's cost of education minus any other aid received.  Lenders who
offer alternative loans usually will offer law students a streamlined loan
program under which students may, through the mail or electronically, apply for
and receive the Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and the
lender's alternative loan with no requirements of personal interviews, banking
relationships or residency.  Loan applications for many of the lenders offering
alternative loans may be obtained at our Office of Financial Aid or from our
information rack. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="work">FEDERAL WORK-STUDY</A></B></P>
<P>The Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program provides jobs for students who need
financial aid.  FWS gives students a chance to earn money to help pay
educational expenses.  The Program encourages community service work.  Employers
participating in the Federal Work-Study Program usually are private, non-profit
organizations or local, state or federal public agencies, and the work performed
must be in the public interest.  To qualify for FWS, the student must meet the
following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI> U.S. citizenship or permanent U.S. residency
</LI>
<LI> Enrolled at least half-time
</LI>
<LI> Demonstrate financial need
</LI>
<LI> Satisfactory academic progress
</LI>
<LI> No defaults on any former  federally funded loan(s)
</LI></OL>
<P>Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University receives a limited
amount of FWS funds each year.  Students should submit a written request for
consideration for a FWS award to the Office of Financial Aid.  Students should
be aware that a FWS award may affect other need-based programs. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="VETERANS">VETERANS EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS</A></B></P>
<P>Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University is a State of
Michigan-approved institution for the education of veterans and other eligible
persons under Veterans Educational Programs.  A student planning to enter the
College who has never received VA educational benefits should visit the Office
of Financial Aid to complete an Application for Education Benefits (VA Form
22-1990), an Enrollment Certification (VA Form 22-1999) and submit their
Document of Discharge (VA Form DD2-14, No. 4).  Students who have previously
received VA educational benefits at another educational institution and who have
not reached their delimiting date should visit the Office of Financial Aid to
complete a Request for Change of Program or Place of Training (VA Form 22-1995)
and an Enrollment Certification (VA Form 22-1999).  A student who has previously
received VA educational benefits while attending DCL/MSU must visit the Office
of Financial Aid every semester to complete the College's Request for VA
Eligibility Certification form, at which time a Reenrollment Certification (VA
Form 22-1999-1) will be completed by the College.  The appropriate forms will be
certified by the College's Office of Financial Aid Veterans Affairs
representative and submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs for approval.
 Students will be notified by the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding the
status of their enrollment certification.  Students receiving a favorable
notification will receive a &quot;Notice of Award&quot; letter from the
Department of Veterans Affairs, which will provide the dates of certification
and the monthly award amount, or a prorated amount for a partial month.</P>
<P>Questions concerning possible benefits may be verified directly with the
Department of Veterans Affairs at (800) 827-1000 (National Office) or (313)
964-5110 (Regional Office).  Any changes to the elected program for a student
receiving VA educational benefits, or a complete withdrawal from the College 
must be submitted immediately, in writing, to the Office of Financial Aid.  </P>

prior to the completion of 30 hours of law school or in connection with a
student's previous or present employment may satisfy the ULWR.  The paper must
demonstrate an accurate understanding and analysis of the subject matter;
require the student to engage in substantial research to identify relevant
authorities and to marshall those authorities in support of the propositions
advanced in the paper; be supported by endnotes reflecting the student's
research for the paper; and demonstrate an ability to represent one's ideas in a
clear and organized manner.  The ULWR may be met by successfully completing a
seminar, directed study, law review program or other school-sponsored law
journal programs, or the school sponsored moot court program if that program or
course requires a paper of sufficient length and in-depth analysis to satisfy
the requirement.  Satisfaction of the ULWR through a moot court directed study
or through the school-sponsored moot court program shall be by an additional
paper beyond any briefs submitted as part of moot court activities and shall be
primarily the student's work product.  Upon successful completion of the ULWR,
the supervising professor shall notify the Registrar in writing, and a notation
of fulfillment will be indicated on the student's transcript.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ELECTIVE">ELECTIVE COURSES</A></H4>
<P>All elective courses are two (2) semester hours, unless otherwise indicated.
Not every elective course will be offered each semester. </P>
<P><B>Administrative Law</B> <BR>This course involves the study of the

law and jurisdiction with special emphasis on issues relating to maritime
personal injury, collision, carriage of goods by sea and the creation and
enforcement of maritime liens.  Attention also will be given to maritime
practice and procedure, focusing on such issues as removal to Federal Court,
right to jury trial, vessel seizure and attachment and the perfection of in rem
jurisdiction. </P>
<P><B>Advanced Civil Procedure</B> <BR>Prerequisite: Procedure I &amp; II
<BR>Advanced Civil Procedure is a continuation of the basic procedure courses
but delves more deeply into many of the issues introduced in those courses, such
as joinder of parties, discovery, class actions and former adjudication.  In
addition, a number of concepts will be explored that are typically not covered
in first year courses, such as the Abstention Doctrine, parallel proceedings in
two or more courts and various problems associated with the trial of the &quot;big&quot;
case.  As society has become more complex, the paradigm of the two-party lawsuit
has become less and less common.  The central purpose of the course is to
introduce students to the procedural  structures and judicial responses that
have been formulated to deal with changes in the nature and size of litigation.
</P>
<P><B>Advanced Seminar in Torts</B> <BR>The purpose of this course is to
analyze and discuss modern tort principles and their etiology from an
historical, moral and economic perspective.  Special consideration will be
placed upon changing attitudes towards compensation which has forced a modern
review of the concept of fault and to make some predictions on the next
generation of tort law and thought. <BR>Specifically, students interested in
practicing in the areas of personal injury, malpractice and products liability
will find the subject matter of this course relevant in its predictions of
further developments in these areas.<B></B> </P>
<P><B>Advocacy Workshops</B> <BR>Advocacy I and II (two semesters) <BR>Discovery
and Trial Preparation <BR>Prerequisites: Procedure I and II, Evidence (Evidence
may be taken concurrently with Advocacy I but extra preparation may be
necessary.) <BR>The purpose of these courses is to provide practical skills
training through simulated exercises. As far as practicable, students will be

<strong>All SCIENCEnet members</strong> or people on Omnet-managed mailing
lists have an Alias.<P>

<strong>You can e-mail</strong> the Alias directory, if you prefer.  Send
a message to:<P>

<dd>alias@omnet.com<P>

and include your search string as the first line of text.  It's fast!<P>

<strong>The Alias</strong> may be used for addressing in place of an
Internet address.<P>  

<strong>The format</strong> for a SCIENCEnet Alias is formal first initial
-- R for Richard, not D for Dick -- a period, and last name.  When more
than one member might have an identical Alias, we suggest the addition
of a suffix. For example:<br>
<dd>R.Smith.ONR<br>
<dd>R.Smith.Richard<br>
<dd>R.Smith.SUNY<P>

<strong>The SCIENCEnet Alias Directory</strong> is free to all.<P>

<strong>SCIENCEnet intends</strong> to create a world-wide master
directory of people in ocean and atmospheric sciences, updated annually, in cooperation with
existing agencies and societies.<P>

<p>

<B>SCIENCEnet began</B> in the late 1970's, a virtual environment in which
researchers and program managers working on far-flung large scale research
could exchange information easily.<P>

<B>Through the</B> 1980's it evolved as Omnet's people worked to push the
central system/store-and-forward system, Telemail, to do things it was
never really intended to do. The first ship-to-shore messaging via
satellite occurred on SCIENCEnet.  We took the software's forms capability
and developed an extensive on-line manual.  SCIENCEnet became the place
for earth science communications, from job postings to birth
announcements.  If everybody in the world-wide community needed access to
information it was posted on Ocean or Air bulletin boards.<P>

<B>Today, SCIENCEnet</B> rides the waves of the Internet as do its members
from the most prestigious universities, research institutions, and
government agencies around the world.<P>

<B>The array</B> of Internet-based SCIENCEnet services are designed, once
again, to create a sense of community.  Bulletin board messages are
available for reading the world over, using either Lynx or any Web
browser.  The maintenance of directories, standard Alias addressing, and
mailing list management will ease the administrative burden for the
community.  A galleria of earth science-related Web sites makes it easy to
find new products and services important to the community.<P>

<B>As the needs</B> of the community continue to evolve, Omnet will
continue to look for imaginative ways to meet those needs through
SCIENCEnet. <p>

Subject: CZM position
Date: 11 Dec 1996 09:24:05 -0500

<HR>
We have an interesting employment opportunity for a Coastal Resource
Management Specialist with experience in training.

We are in the process of preparing a project in Cambodia, to be funded by
Danish development aid assistance.  The project manager position we are
seeking to fill is a 12 month position, based most probably in Phnom Penh
with extensive travel to the coastal provinces.  The project is largely
training focused, and the idea is to convene a series of training sessions
over a one year period involving the main decison-makers in the key
government offices of the coastal provinces.  An important task of the
project manager would also be to further define a CZM support programme for
the longer term.

The person applying should have a strong background in resource planning,
CZM or related topics as well as some practical first hand experience with
training programmes in the developing country context.  The candidate should
also preferably have experience with programme design and development, be
extremely flexible, and have working experience in southeast Asia (Vietnam,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia or the Philippines) in coastal and
marine-related issues.

The candidate would be working very closely with other international
environmental NGO's and local NGO's.

We would appreciate communication with all persons interested in this
position and having the suitable background.  We would also appreciate it if
this opportunity could be transmitted to potentially interested persons you
know that may not have access to this mailing list.

Kindly address all communication directly to the following e-mail address

for the academic year 1997-98.  Fellows will play a central role in
a major multidisciplinary research program to shape an integrated
understanding of global environmental assessment and policy.  Its
goal is to advance understanding of the role of formal assessment
activities in societies' efforts to grapple with questions of
global environmental change.  In year 2, academic year 1997-98, the
project will continue its work on climate change and expand to
examine assessment experience in the management of long range
transport and tropospheric air pollution.  Applications are invited
from prospective fellows interested generally in the relationships
among science and policy on international environmental issues, or
specifically on the substantive themes noted above.  Core faculty
include William Clark, Edward Parson, John Holdren, and Robert
Stavins from the Kennedy School of Government; James McCarthy and
Michael McElroy from Harvard's natural sciences faculties, Robert
Keohane from Duke University, Sheila Jasanoff from Cornell
University, and Jill Jaeger from the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna.

                  POST-DOCTORAL STUDY IN CANADA

           Population Modelling of Marine Zooplankton
   A position is available immediately for an academically qualified
individual to undertake research into population modelling of Calanus
finmarchicus. This work is funded as part of the Canadian Global Ocean
Ecosystem Dynamics Programme (GLOBEC). The work will involve the
development of a life history model for Calanus, coupled with a primary
production model and the physical environment of the Northwest Atlantic.
Work is therefore required in the development of a biological model
which must then be coupled with the physics.  The successful candidate
should be able to demonstrate an excellent academic record in one or
more of Biology, Physical Oceanography, Population Modelling,
Mathematics or some related discipline. We are looking for someone with
enthusiasm and a dedication to research. This team involves four
committed scientists (Brad deYoung, Don Deibel, Geoff Evans and Pierre
Pepin).  The GLOBEC Canada program is funded for four years and involves
over 50 investigators across Canada. In addition to collaboration within
this team, there is the potential for exposure to and interaction with
many other marine scientists.

   For more details as to research programme and application procedures
please contact,

<HR>
CHIEF - CSIRO Land and Water
Adelaide, Australia

CSIRO Australia is seeking to appoint a person with an internationally
recognised record of research leadership, management experience and
scientific and technological achievement and innovation to the position
of Chief of its new Land and Water division.

The Chief will play a critical role in establishing the new division
and ensuring its integration into CSIRO's overall research effort for
relevant sectors of the economy and environment.

CSIRO is Australia's largest and most diverse scientific and industrial
research organisation.  Our purpose is to serve the Australian community
through research outcomes which provide social, economic and environmental
benefits.  Our mission is to be a world class research organisation vital
to Australia's future.

CSIRO Land and Water is a new division created from a merger of the
existing Divisions of Water Resources and Soils and the Centre for
Environmental Mechanics.  The new division's primary role is to carry
out and deliver research in soil, water and atmospheric processes
essential to the understanding and sustainable management of land and 
water in Australia.  Specific areas of attention include sustainable
agriculture, urban and rural water management, sustainable catchment
management, environmental processes and resources and related atmospheric
issues, tropical soils and water management, and groundwater management
and site remediation.  Through this research, CSIRO provides advice to 
government, industry and environment groups, and help develop management 
strategies.

CSIRO Land and Water is a multidisciplinary research division with 490
staff and an annual budget of $43m.  It operates from five major sites
across Australia and has a broad range of external sponsors who contribute
$15m to collaborative research.

The Chief will be accountable to the Deputy Chief Executive (Environment
and Natural Resources) for the performance and strategic direction of the
division.  Responsibilities will be carried out with a high degree of
freedom, whilst in accordance with CSIRO's corporate policies and as
negotiated with the Deputy Chief Executive.  The Chief will represent
CSIRO and interact nationally and internationally with Government,
industry and the community.

Opportunities and challenges will include:
 - development and maintenance of a scientifically excellent division
   which is at the world forefront of land and water research;
 - appointment and development of key staff and implementation of
   innovative staff management and development practices; 
 - leading and fostering the development of a strong and collaborative
   divisional culture;
 - integration of the division's research so that, together with the
   research of other relevant divisions, it anticipates issues and meets
   industry, government and community R&D needs;
 - effective delivery of R&D to customers; 
 - ensuring a continuing sound financial base for research activity; and
 - effective and efficient consolidation of the new division's research
   support services and infrastructure.

The appointee will have outstanding research leadership, vision and
strategic management skills; a thorough understanding of large-scale
environmental and sustainable development issues in land and water
management; and a commitment to consultative planning of research.  
A record of achievement in working with government and industry in
developing research partnerships and delivering valuable outcomes is
essential, as is a record of scientific accomplishment in an appropriate
field.

The appointment will be for five years and will involve an annual
performance contract with the Deputy Chief Executive.  The remuneration
package will be highly competitive and includes superannuation, a fully
maintained vehicle and relocation assistance.  The Chief's principal
office will preferably be in Adelaide.

More information on the position is available from Mr Michael Brown, 
Principal Adviser, Resources (tel: 61 6 276 6647; fax: 61 6 276 6594;
email: michael.brown@exec.csiro.au).  Interested applicants are invited

Date: 3 Jan 1997 21:33:37 -0500

<HR>
U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY EARTH
SCIENCES INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

Project Description for
EARTH SCIENCES INTERN -- Project
Number 000547

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: The
intern will work on the USGS project
titled *Plankton Dynamics in Tidal
Estuaries,* a research project of the
Water Resources Division, National
Research Program, Branch of Regional
Research-Western Region.  Broad
objectives of the project are to conduct
multidisciplinary research to identify the
patterns and mechanisms of water
quality and biological variability in
aquatic ecosystems, with emphasis on
San Francisco Bay as a representative
U.S. coastal ecosystem influenced by
natural and anthropogenic sources of
variability.  This project has collected
two decades of water-quality and
biological data in San Francisco Bay. 
The intern*s responsibilities will be to
assist in the continuation of the data
collection program, assist the project
chief in the organization/analysis of the
data set, and assist in the dissemination
of the data set through new programs of
outreach.

DEADLINE TO APPLY: January 15,
1997

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of
this internship is to provide an
opportunity for a young oceanographer
to develop/refine skills, and to assist
USGS project personnel in the conduct
of their research program.  This broad
objective has three specific components:
(1) water quality and biological sampling
in the San Francisco Bay estuary; (2)
supervised steps to organize and
analyze water quality and biological data
collected in San Francisco Bay by
USGS; and (3) work with the project
chief to develop a new program of
outreach to local schools.

SPECIFIC TASKS:
1.	To participate on regular USGS
sampling cruises in San Francisco Bay
aboard the research vessel Polaris and
small boats as needed; to operate
scientific instruments and sampling
devices aboard the research ship; to
process samples for analyses of
chemical constituents, plankton
populations, and rates of biological
processes such as primary production.

2.	To work with the USGS mentor to
help in the organization, display, and
retrieval of USGS water quality data
over the Internet; to assist project staff
in the analysis and interpretation of data
sets.

3.	To work with USGS mentor so
data sets from San Francisco Bay can
be brought into the classrooms of local
middle and high schools:  this will require
collaboration with educational
organizations, teachers, and USGS staff
to develop classroom exercises in
environmental science and instruction in
procedures through which
students/teachers can easily access
USGS water quality data through the
Internet.

BENEFIT: This multifaceted internship
will provide a developing scientist the
opportunity to broaden her/his skills in
field science, laboratory analyses, data
interpretation and publication, and
science outreach.  A key element will be
the opportunity to work as an integral
member of a highly successful and
productive research team; to have
access to a state-of-the-science
laboratory and computing facilities; and
to assist in development of a new
program to bring the excitement and
accomplishments of that scientific
enterprise closer to the public.

DURATION:  Two years, beginning
February, 1997

LOCATION: Menlo Park, California

SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS
REQUIRED: This multifaceted internship
requires a breadth of skills and
experiences that most likely would come
from attainment of an advanced degree
(MS) in one of the earth sciences
(preferably oceanography, limnology) or
environmental engineering.  The position
requires experience in: the field
collection of water quality and biological
samples from aquatic ecosystems such
as estuaries, rivers, reservoirs;
laboratory analyses of water samples
for dissolved nutrients, oxygen,
chlorophyll, seston, inorganic
constituents, and plankton populations;
data interpretation and analyses, with
particular skills in the application of
multivariate techniques as an approach
for creative exploration of patterns
contained in complex data sets;
technical writing that includes clear
presentations of original interpretations
of water quality or biological data.

ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS
DESIRABLE:  Success in this internship
will also require a sincere interest or
experience in finding approaches for
bridging the gap between science and
the public, especially through
development of exercises to teach
students how to access data over the
Internet and use these data for problem
solving of classroom exercises.

STIPEND: *$31,000 per year

But owning just a few funds thatuse the same investment approach, or simply owning too many funds, may not provide you with the diversification you need.<BR><BR>Owning several funds that all use the same investment approachis a recipe for disaster. For instance, suppose you hold smallstock funds that use an earnings momentum approach to investing. Most likely, your mutual funds will own many of the same stocks. If that investment style temporarily falls out of favor, all of your funds will take it on their glass chins.<BR>Here&#185;s a checklist to ensure that you&#185;re properly diversifiedagainst such misfortune:<BR><BR><OL><B><LI>Examine the holdings of your funds, listed in theirsemiannual reports.</B> If many of the largest holdings in your funds are the same, chances are the funds are using the same investment approach and are therefore vulnerable to the same risks. <BR><BR><B><LI>Buy funds that use different investment approaches and investin different size companies.</B> Hold a mix of funds that buy value and earnings growth stocks, as well as large and small shares. This way, when some of your funds are struggling, the other funds will likely pick up the slack. <BR><UL>A fund&#185;s prospectus or the letter to shareholders in the <BR></UL>semi-annual or annual report will spell out its investment approach. Keep in mind, however, that there are no precise guidelines for which investment style a fund uses or the type of stock it buys.<BR><BR><B><LI>Don&#185;t overdiversify. </B>There&#185;s no ideal number of funds to own, but if you own 10 or more non-specialized funds, you&#185;re probably overdiversified. In effect, you&#185;ll end up tracking the market indexes but your returns will likely trail the broad market by a wide margin since you&#185;re paying the expense fees on each fund.<BR>If you want to index, buy an index fund. Just remember, they&#185;re not actively managed, so they generally offer lower annual expenses than other types of funds. The savings from those lower fees is passed directly to shareholders.<BR><BR><B><LI>Set up a strategy and stick to it. </B>Investors who flock fromone hot fund or investment approach to another usually end up trailing the market. A proven investment style may fall out of favor from time to time, but it will always come back. And studies have shown that over the long term, value investing and growth investing have produced roughly the same rates of returns, although value has a slight edge, and with less risk than growth investing.<BR></OL><P><A HREF="readpro.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

Follow the paper trail.  Information that's vital to finding the best fund for your  needs is contained in the prospectus. A fund's prospectus  isn't just complex legal jargon--it also contains vital  information that every investor should take the time to read.<P>Many investors approach the prospectus as a dull chore and  only give it a cursory review. That's a big mistake. Even if  you already own a fund, you should carefully read its  prospectus. The Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.)  requires funds to give one to each prospective buyer. <P>Currently, two types of prospectuses are being used. The  primary one is the two-part prospectus, which was first  introduced in 1983. The second type is an experimental  &#34;profile prospectus&#34; being used by 24 funds.  While the profile prospectus will likely eventually supplant  the traditional two-part prospectus, this article deals with  deciphering the one you're most likely to receive after  calling a fund company. <P>If the prospectus reveals that your returns haven't been  commensurate with risks, you should consider moving into  another fund. Indeed, a common cause for dissatisfaction is  when a fund's investment objective doesn't match the  investor's needs. That objective--and the risks of achieving  it--are spelled out in the prospectus.<P>Other essential data to look for include: minimum initial and  subsequent investment requirements, services, such as the  fund's exchange policy, automatic investment program or check  writing privileges; and fees.<P>Keep in mind, one of the most important pieces of information  usually isn't found in the prospectus: the fund manager's  name. A fund's great long-term record may be irrelevant if a  new manager comes on board and changes the fund's focus. If  there's a new person running your fund, call the fund family  to get his or her track record.<P>All expected expenses are always reported in table format.  Fees are broken down into two groups: shareholder transaction  fees and annual fund operating expenses.<P>Transaction fees include the sales charge--a &#34;load&#34; that's  either front-end (imposed when shares are purchased) or  back-end (upon withdrawal), plus any redemption fee. Many  funds offer contingent-deferred or &#34;stepped-down&#34; loads, which  decline to zero after a certain number of years. <P>If a fund calls itself &#34;no-load,&#34; make sure it doesn't impose  a redemption fee or a stepped load. If it does, it's not a  true no-load fund.<P>Many fund families offer multiple classes of shares in the  same fund. Class A shares typically have a front-end sales  load. Class B shares usually have a stepped load that starts  at 5 or 6 percent and declines to zero after a corresponding  number of years. <P>Class B shares often look like the better deal, since all of  your money goes to work right from the start. But in exchange  for the deferred load, Class B shares usually come with higher  annual expense fees. If you hold the fund for more than five  years, your returns will likely be higher in the Class A  shares.<P>Some fund families also charge for switching assets among  their funds, typically within a specified time frame. If you  plan to move in and out of related funds often, check the cost  and the permitted number of moves per year. Also, don't  overlook any loads attached to reinvested dividends, a  function most funds provide for free.<P>Annual operating expenses are calculated as a percentage of  average daily net assets and may include the following:  management fees; 12b-1 fees, which allow the fund to pass the  cost of marketing a fund; and servicing costs. <P>The &#34;Total Fund Operating Expenses&#34; line is the sum of all  operating expenses. Operating expense ratios will vary  depending on the type of securities a fund invests in. For  stock funds, total expenses average about 1.35 percent; the  average bond fund's expenses are 1 percent. Established,  diversified funds that charge more are limiting your returns.<P>Funds must report the effect of expenses on a hypothetical  $1,000 earning 5 percent annually over various time frames. If  expenses are excessive, you should consider another fund.<P>The &#34;Financial Highlights&#34; section will provide you with a  historical overview of a particular fund. Among the figures  listed in this table are year-end readings in the fund's net  asset value, income from investment operations, income and  capital gains distributions, total returns, expenses as a  percentage of assets, and the portfolio turnover rate  (percentage of stocks that are bought and sold in a given  year).<P>The &#34;Investment Objective and Policies&#34; section spells out the  fund's goal and outlines the types of investments management  can buy. Often, this section will outline what a fund's  manager looks at when selecting stocks. The prospectus will  also outline the fund's policy on the use of &#34;derivative  securities,&#34; such as options, futures and options on futures,  as well as short sales, foreign securities, foreign currency  transactions and repurchase agreements.<P>The &#34;Purchases, Redemptions and Exchanges&#34; section explains  where to call or write to buy shares, redeem holdings or  switch assets among funds in a family of funds.<P>The &#34;Shareholder Services&#34; section offers details on various  services offered by the fund such as an automatic dividend  reinvestment program, automatic investment plan or systematic  withdraw plan.<P>Even more information regarding a fund can be found in its  Statement of Additional Information (SAI), also known as Part  B of the prospectus. The SAI will list all officers and  directors of the fund. It lists the fund manager's background  and it outlines the fund's advisory service contract and the  12b-1 distribution fee. Note that most funds do not provide  investors with an SAI unless they ask for it. <P>Profile Prospectus Twenty four mutual funds from eight investment companies are  currently participating in an S.E.C. pilot program offering  the &#34;profile prospectus.&#34; This experimental two-page  prospectus, devoid of the legalese found in most prosectuses,  is designed to provide investors with a standardized executive  summary of key information for a fund. <P>The information contained in the traditional prospectus  discussed above can be found in brief in the profile  prospectus. And unlike the old prospectus, the format for the  profile prospectus is exactly the same for each fund. <P>Between now and August 1996, investors who request a  prospectus for one of the partipating funds will receive both  new concise profile prospectus as well as the traditional  prospectus. <P>While I prefer the more detailed traditional prospectus,  investors who aren't willing to take the time to pour over  those 20-plus page booklets will find the brief profile  prospectus useful. <P>The fund families particpating in the profile prospectus  experiment include: American Funds, The Dreyfus Corporation,  Fidelity Investments, IDS Funds, Pacific Horizon Funds, T.  Rowe Price Associates, Scudder Stevens & Clark and The  Vanguard Group.  <P><A HREF="diverse2.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="withdraw.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

One  solution is to take advantage of the automatic withdrawal plan  offered by most mutual funds.</B><P>If the shares in your fund account exceed the minimum set  value (typically $5,000 or $10,000), you can elect to receive  monthly or quarterly payments in a specified amount of $100 or  more. Filling out some simple paper work is all that it takes  to get started. Note, however, that funds usually require that  all dividend and capital gains distributions be reinvested. <P>If you withdraw more than your account is earning after taxes,  an automatic withdrawal plan will eventually deplete your  assets. But if used wisely, these plans can substantially  enhance your golden years. <P>Suppose you want to boost your annual income by $10,000.  Assuming stocks' historic annual return of 10.4 percent, a  $100,000 initial investment in an S&P 500 stock index fund  would produce the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $10,000 a  year for the next 18 years.<P>Any amount you withdraw in excess of the fund's  annual income and capital gains is considered a return of  capital and therefore not taxable. On initial investments of  $150,000, however, you'll be able to withdraw $10,000 a year  in today's dollars indefinitely.<P>Also keep in mind that this is a simplified example, based on  an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket. Your actual tax  rate may be more or less, but the results won't differ by  much.<P>Rather than opting for a withdrawal plan using stock funds,  you may be tempted to invest in bond funds that pay a  relatively high stream of dividends to boost your annual  income. Your payout, however, will fluctuate depending on  prevailing interest rates. With a carefully crafted withdrawal  plan, you won't suffer the same fate.<P>What's more, while your capital is safe in a high-quality bond  fund, your total returns will likely keep ahead of inflation  by only a few percentage points annually. To keep well ahead  of inflation, stocks are the best game in town--especially for  long-term money.<P>Before you elect to use an automatic withdrawal plan, make  sure that your principal will outlast both you and your  spouse. If you're withdrawing more each year than you're  earning, your assets will eventually be exhausted. It's best  to play it safe and withdraw only what you need.<P><A HREF="readpro.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="cvs.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"><HTML><Title>INVESTOR'S CHOICE</Title><body bgcolor=FFFFFF><IMG  SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME Page</A> /<A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR><A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacdwi.html">Subscription Information</A></center></H6><UL><HR><P><H2>CONVERTIBLES:<BR>THE STOCK/BOND HYBRID</H2><H4>One of the most frequently overlooked areas of the investment world are convertible securities.</H4> Convertibles generally pay bond-like yields while offering the potential for stock-like capital gains. Since they're harder to understand than either stocks or bonds, many investors shy away from convertibles, thereby missing out on potential bargains.<P>A <B>convertible bond</B> is like owning a bond with the option to  switch into a specified number of shares at a later date.  There are also convertible preferred stocks that are  convertible into shares of common stock. These are very  similar to convertible bonds, but for the sake of space, I'll  only deal with convertible bonds here.<BR><P>All types of companies issue convertibles, from blue chips to  small companies with market capitalizations of less than $50  million. Convertibles are generally conservative,  high-yielding investments that will capture big gains if the  underlying stock climbs in value, while protecting against  losses if the underlying stock dips. The conversion feature  allows you to swap the bond for shares of stock, regardless of  the price of the stock. Moreover, you can make the conversion  at no charge, and it's not a taxable event.<BR><P>When you buy a convertible, you pay a premium for the option  of switching to stock later on. That premiums the difference  between the price of the convertible and its value if it were  switched today. <BR><P>The bigger the premium, the more the underlying stock must  rise to make conversion attractive. As a result, convertibles  with large premiums behave more like bonds, while those with  low premiums behave more like the underlying stock. Keep in  mind that you earn interest on the bond, but don't receive any  dividend yield paid on the common stock until you swap.<BR><BR><BR><P><H3>Low Volatility</H3> <B>Convertibles are less volatile than either stocks or bonds.</B></B>  When rising interest rates pummel bonds, convertibles will  hold their ground (assuming stocks are gaining at the same  time).<BR><P>As the price of the common stock rises, the convertible will  capture most of that gain. Conversely, if the stock price  falls (and bond prices remain steady), the convertible will  suffer only a portion of the loss. <BR><UL><P>FOR EXAMPLE: If the common stock gains 50 percent over 12  months, the convertible will capture about 43 percent of that  move. If the stock drops 50 percent, however, the convertible  will suffer only about 29 percent of the loss.<BR></UL><BR><BR><BR><H3>Convertible Drawbacks </H3>Critics of convertibles believe these hybrids lack the full  potential of either stocks or bonds. If both stocks and bonds  tumble, convertibles will dive too. For instance, if economic  growth slows while inflation is heating up, interest rates  will rise and stock prices are likely to sink. In this  worst-case scenario, the &#34;protection&#34; convertibles claim to  offer will evaporate.<BR> <P> <P><P><P><P>There are other <B>potential pitfalls</B> to convertibles as well:<BR><UL><BR><LI><P><LI>Convertibles can often be &#34;called&#34; or forcibly redeemed by the  issuing company once certain benchmarks are reached. Your  choices will be to sell the bond back to the issuer or convert  it into stock at the conversion value. <BR><BR><P><LI>Conversion is normally permitted for the life of the bond,  subject to any call provisions. A few bonds, however, attach  special conditions to the conversion.<BR><BR><P><LI>Gathering information can be a hassle. Newspapers and  financial publications don't always list convertibles  separately from bonds. Look for the little &#34;cv&#34; next to the  name. <BR></UL><BR><BR><H3>For More Information</H3><P>To obtain more detailed information--such as <B>conversion rates</B> and <B>call provision</B>--you'll have to consult a more specialized  service. <B>The <I>Standard & Poor's Bond Guide</I> is a good source.</B>  Most big libraries carry it. You can contact S&P at 25  Broadway, New York, NY 10004; 800-221-5277.<BR><BR><P><B>Pros also read the weekly <I>Value Line Convertibles</I> service.</B>  It's heavy going, and a bit pricey ($1,210 per year) for the  average individual. But for a quick immersion into  convertibles, the $65 eight-week trial is a good deal. Contact  <I>Value Line Convertibles</I> at 711 Third Avenue, New York, NY  10017; 212-687-3965.<BR><BR><BR><H3>Tips For Investors</H3> <UL><LI><P><P><B>Convertible bonds are traded on the New York and other  exchanges, and you can buy them through any stock broker.</B> The  bonds are sold in multiples of $1,000 face value. Commissions  run $5 to $15 per bond (usually with a five-bond minimum)  depending in the volume and the broker used. <BR> <BR> <LI><P><B>If you're thinking of buying a specific stock, check to see if  there's a convertible available.</B> This is one time a  full-service broker will come in handy. Their current list of  recommended convertibles along with research reports will  provide you with information you need to make an intelligent  decision.<BR> <BR><LI><P><B>Each convertible has a &#34;recapture&#34; or &#34;break-even&#34; period. </B> That's how long you must own the bond before your interest  covers the premium you paid for the privilege of converting. A  long break-even period--of four years or more--makes the  convertible less attractive than owning the common stock  directly.<BR> <BR> <LI><P><B>Buy convertibles less for yield, more for the underlying stock's potential.</B> The stock price is your key to future profits. To want the convertible, you first must want to own the common.<BR><BR><LI><P><B>Check prices carefully. </B>The difference between the bid price  (your price to sell) and the asked price (what you pay to buy)  can be much larger than on stocks since convertibles aren't as  actively traded. Your best bet is to stick with convertibles  traded n the NYSE.<BR><BR><LI><P><B>One defensive strategy is to buy convertibles selling so far  above their conversion values (stock price times conversion  rate) that they have become immune to any decline in the price  of the underlying stock.</B> These convertibles will rise and fall  more in line with the general bond market. But if the stock  should rise significantly, the convertible may also gain. <BR></UL><BR><BR><H3>Going The Fund Route</H3> If you'd rather not hassle over conversion rates and floor  values, try a <B>convertible mutual fund</B> instead. Just a few  years ago convertible funds were rare creatures. But in the  last 10 years their assets have grown rapidly and there are  now dozens of convertible funds to choose from.<BR><BR><P>Typically, a convertible fund must have at least 65 percent of  its assets in convertible bonds or preferred stocks at all  times. Dividends are normally declared monthly and paid  quarterly, with capital gains, if any, paid out annually. <BR><P><P><P>Mutual funds are the best way for most investors to tap  convertible profits. But there is one advantage to going it on  your own. Funds can't buy small thinly traded convertibles.  Smart individuals who spot the undervalued small issues can  profit handsomely.<P>Prices for convertible funds are listed along with other funds  in the newspaper and are easy to follow.<BR><BR><BR><H3>Glossary of Convertible Terms</H3> <DL><DT><B>Conversion rate</B><DD>The number of common stock shares you'll own  if the bond is converted.<BR><BR><DT><B>Conversion price</B><DD>The common stock price at which the bond  may be converted.<BR><BR><DT><B>Conversion value</B><DD>The current value of the bond if converted  to stock; number of shares (conversion rate) times current  common stock price.<BR><BR><DT><B>Conversion premium</B><DD>The difference between the bond's price  and its conversion value.

Going long  stocks is a strategy that works well in &#34;bull markets&#34; (when  share prices are trending higher). But stocks don&#39;t rise  indefinitely; they periodically undergo corrections (decline  in value). &#34;Bear markets&#34; are those in which stocks as a whole  are declining in value. <P>To maximize your profits, you may want to consider &#34;selling  short&#34; when you think a stock will decline in value. Short  selling is simply the reverse of going long: You&#39;re selling  high in anticipation of buying low.<P>When you sell short, you borrow stock from your broker, sell  it to another investor with the idea of buying it back later  at a lower price. The difference between the price you sell  the stock for and the cost of buying it back later after it  has fallen in price is your profit (or loss if the stock price  rises). <P>Brokers allow you to short most stocks on margin. This means  for every $1,000 in your margin account, you can control  $2,000 in stock. Of course you&#39;ll have to pay interest on the  full amount of stock you borrow during the time you&#39;re short.<P>Many investors never consider short selling because betting on  a stock&#39;s decline is somehow viewed as being un-American. This  is a silly idea since you&#39;re shorting a stock isn&#39;t likely to  have a negative impact on the share price. What&#39;s more, if a  stock is set to fall, there&#39;s no reason why you shouldn&#39;t  profit from the event.<P>The key to short selling is to find stocks that are  overpriced. Rapidly growing companies with stock prices that  have soared in anticipation of further growth are often good  short sale candidates. These companies may have difficulty  living up to Wall Street&#39;s high expectations. As a result,  they&#39;re most susceptible to severe declines in price when  their earnings come in below expectations.<P>When shorting a stock, you should remember that you&#39;re betting  on a stock to decline in price for a particular reason. You  must have patience: It may take months before that reason  becomes evident to other investors and a decline begins.<P>Anyone who&#39;s aggressive enough to find the option market  attractive should consider short selling before taking a  speculative position in options. Short selling is essentially  the same as buying a put option. Yet when you short a stock,  you&#39;re not locked into an expiration date, and you&#39;re less  likely to suffer through the volatile rise associated with  options. <P>Bear in mind that shorting isn&#39;t for everyone. Only aggressive  investors should be short selling. If you can&#39;t handle  temporary setbacks easily, shorting isn&#39;t for you.<P><A HREF="cvs.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="001compounding.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

But there are manyways to get in on the ground floor of investing--painlessly.<P>Most Americans don&#39;t invest at all. Their savings, if any,are tied up in banks, S&amp;Ls, insurance policies, pension funds,or some other investment paying much lower returns than alternativescurrently available. While there&#39;s certainly nothing wrong withthese low-return investments, why let others reap the financialrewards? Bank instruments are designed for liquidity purposesonly, not to create significant wealth for their holders.<P>By following some of these techniques, you&#39;ll be able towatch your savings grow at a much faster rate than you ever thoughtpossible:<P><H3>DCA ASAP</H3><P>Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a consistent savings and accumulationprogram designed to help you achieve your financial goals. DCAtakes the guesswork out of investing by enabling you to investa set dollar amount periodically (usually monthly), rather thanbuying a fixed number of shares of an investment. When stock ormutual fund share prices drop, your dollars buy a larger numberof shares. <P>For example: You invest $300 a month in ABC Mutual Fund. Overa six-month period, you have invested $1,800 with ABC. Duringthat time, ABC share prices started at $12, dropped graduallyto $9 then finally increased to $13.63.<P>Here&#39;s what you&#39;d pay per share and the number of sharesyou would purchase over six months of dollar-cost averaging:<P><TABLE ID=1 BORDER=010><TH>Share<br>Price<br>per month<TH>ABC<br>Shares<br>purchased<br>for<br>$300<TR><TD> $12<TD>25<TR><TD> 10<TD>30<TR><TD> 10<TD>30<TR><TD> 9<TD>33*<TR><TD> 12<TD>25<TR><TD>  13.63<TD>22*<TR><TD> $66.63<TD>165</TABLE><CAPTION>*Rounded to the nearest share</CAPTION></TABLE><P>The average price per share over six months ($66.63 divided by6) is $11.10. But your average cost is only $10.90 ($1,800 dividedby 165 shares). Why? Because you automatically bought more shareswhen the price was low. DCA takes the emotion out of investing,since you don't have to worry about exactly when to buy and howmuch.<P>The best time to use a DCA strategy is when the stock market issubstantially overvalued. It allows you to get off the sidelinesand start acquiring some high-quality stocks that are temporarilyoverpriced.<P>DCA allows you to play the ups and downs in a specific stock&#39;sprice and keeps you from buying too much at the top. Also, DCAdemonstrates why a systematic investing plan, over the long term,is one of the smartest strategies for acquiring wealth. <P>Keep in mind that DCA doesn't guarantee a profit over every timeperiod. No matter how well it works, if the price on the day youdecide to sell is lower than your average price, you'll lose money.But dollar cost averaging shifts the odds dramatically in yourfavor.<P><A HREF="001compounding.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="003drip.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

The idea was that by plowing dividends backinto shares of the issuing company, stock investors could takeadvantage of the magic of compounding as well as dollar cost averaging.<P>Today, nearly 1,000 firms offer dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).In most cases you must buy at least one share on the stock marketbefore you can take advantage of the company&#146;s dividend reinvestmentplan. But several now allow you to buy that first block of sharesdirectly from the company (see below).<P>Many DRIPs also allow participants to buy additional shares sanscommission charges. Some even give shareholders a discount offthe market price.<P>Why DRIPs? Rest assured, corporations are less than altruistic&#151;DRIPsbenefit them. How? By allowing corporations to raise new capitalwithout having to pay flotation costs of new stock issues. Infact, everyone benefits--except brokers.<P>Here&#146;s how to get started with a dividend reinvestment plan:<P>1. Call the company you want to invest in. Find out the requirementsand procedures to follow for joining their DRIPs and optionalstock purchase plans. Company phone numbers are available fromannual reports or the stock exchanges. When you call, ask for&#147;Shareholder Services.&#148;<P>2. Once you&#146;ve got this information, you&#146;re ready tobegin investing. Some utilities feature customer stock purchaseplans, which allow their power customers to sign up immediatelyfor DRIPs. <P>3. For companies that don&#146;t offer direct stock purchase,you&#146;ll have to buy at least one share from a broker beforeyou can sign on to the DRIP. Unfortunately, this can be quiteexpensive relative to the size of the purchase, even if you exclusivelyuse deep discount brokers.<P>If you already have a substantial account with a full-servicebroker, you should be able to cut this expense down. Otherwise,deep discount brokers are still the best bets. Some that chargebetween $20 and $25 for one-share purchases include: <I>Bidwelland Co</I>. (800-547-6337), <I>Kennedy, Cabot and Co</I>. (800-252-0090),<I>Marquette de Bary</I> (800-221-3305) and <I>Pacific Brokerage</I>(800-421-8395). Certain <I>Dean Witter</I> branches also offersingle-share purchases for just 10 percent plus postage and handling,but it&#146;s not the commission policy for the entire firm. Shoparound.<P>4. If you do purchase from a broker, tell them that you want theshare &#147;issued to you,&#148; i.e. that you want to have thestock certificate mailed to you. Once the share is issued, youwill be on the books of the company as a shareholder, rather thansimply a holder in &#147;street name&#148; (in the hands of thebroker). The company will then send you the stock certificate,and you&#146;ll be eligible to invest in the DRIP and optionalstock purchase plan.<P>Once you&#146;ve signed on to the DRIP, you have the option ofreinvesting all or just a portion of your dividends. Most plansdo charge a small withdrawal fee for cashing out, but it&#146;sconsiderably less than the commissions you&#146;d pay dealingthrough a broker.<P><A HREF="002rule72.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="006sminvestor.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"><HTML><Title>INVESTOR'S CHOICE</Title><body bgcolor=FFFFFF><IMG  SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME Page</A> /<A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR><A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></H6><UL><HR><P><H2>PLANNING &amp; THE SMALL INVESTOR</H2><P>It&#146;s very important for a small investor to begin a planningprocess and determine what investment markets he or she can play.To do this, you should:<P><ul><B><LI> List your assets and liabilities.<P><LI> Track your spending habits.<P><LI> Add up your current sources of income (but only count thoseyou know to be secure).<P><LI> Calculate the cash value of your insurance policy (usethe table in your policy).<P><LI> Explain your records to another family member in case somethingshould happen to you or your spouse.</B><P></ul>Before you &#34;pop open the trunk&#34; and invest, considersome of the fatal flaws that many novices (and a few old pros)fall for time and again. <P>1. <B>Failure to Plan.</B> Planning is basic. First set goals, then overseeyour affairs as if they were a small business. Successful investorsestablish both short- and long-term objectives, then set benchmarksto see how near they are to reaching them.<P>2. <B>Commission Omission.</B> Rare is the investment that doesn&#39;tcarry a fee, commission or transaction cost. These are the normalcosts of conducting business, but for the small investor theycan swallow a serious chunk of what should have been your profit.<P>Don&#39;t forget to shop around, as commission rates for thesame investment will vary. For stock investing we strongly recommendusing discount brokers. You&#39;re already paying us to get thebest investment advice; you don&#39;t need redundant, overpricedrecommendations from a full-service broker.<P>Unfortunately, many people totally ignore these charges when selectinginvestments or tracking the performance of their holdings. Weadvise that you always ask about commission charges up front.<P>3. <B>Dare to Diversify.</B> Smaller portfolios ($5,000 to $25,000) arebest concentrated in mutual funds, which provide automatic diversification.But don&#39;t buy too many mutual funds. More than six or sevenfunds could result in unnecessary paperwork, high fees and mediocrereturns. <P>4. <B>Safety First. </B>Remember, even in good economic times, thereare periods in which the market stumbles. You don&#39;t wantto get caught in a financial downdraft. To avoid an undue ordeal,here are a few investments that conservative investors shouldhold:<P><UL><B>Certificates of deposit:</B> Make sure the CD is government insured.CDs require investing for a specified period of time, from 30days to 10 years. The longer the period, the higher the return.<P><B>Treasury bills:</B> These are guaranteed by the government and arethe ultimate risk-free investment. They can be purchased freeof commissions from one of the nation&#39;s 12 Federal Reservebanks. Minimum investment is $10,000. <P><B>Money market funds:</B> It&#39;s a good idea to shop around for yieldshere; different funds can vary by as much as a full percentagepoint. Also, consider investing in a money market offered throughthe same mutual fund family as the stock funds you own. That way,you can switch back and forth easily when market conditions warrant.<P><B>U.S. savings bonds:</B> Many investors overlook these bonds, but theycan be quite useful. The best way to buy them is through a payrolldeduction plan, which enables you to automatically increase yourstake in a fairly painless manner.<P>The bonds are available in denominations of as low as $50. Youbuy them at a discount to face value; the sum received at maturityincludes accrued interest. </UL><h2>MUTUAL ADVANTAGE</H2><P>Think of a mutual fund as a group of people with similar investmentgoals pooling their money together as one. They hire a professionalmanager to invest that money in securities such as stocks, bonds,money markets, real estate and a variety of investments.<P>Open-end funds constantly issue new shares for new investors andredeem (buy back) shares from existing investors when they wantto leave the fund. An open-end fund is nearly always &#34;open&#34;to new investors. <P>Purchases of open-end mutual funds are generally made betweenthe investor and the fund itself. When an investor purchases shares,payment is made to the fund and new shares are issued. This isthe most popular type of fund offered today.<P>Closed-end funds are publicly traded mutual funds. Here&#39;show they work:<P>After start-up or initial public offering, fund shares are tradedon one of the major stock exchanges, or in the over-the-countermarket, like regular stocks. Ordinarily, publicly traded fundshave a fixed number of shares, meaning supply and demand rulescan apply (and cause price appreciation). Closed-end funds areadvantageous only when they&#39;re selling at a discount to theirnet asset value. <P><h2>DIVERSIFICATION: THE KEY BENEFIT</H2><P>Diversification is the term for not putting all your eggs in onebasket, perhaps the key benefit of mutual funds. By their verynature most mutual funds are diversified--assets are investedin many different securities within the stated objective of afund.<P>What&#39;s more, there are many different types of mutual funds,with different investment objectives, levels of growth potentialand risk that allow you to diversify your holdings even further.<P>The beauty of funds is that they provide investors with limitedbankrolls access to a broad spectrum of investments. Funds allowinvestors to create a diversified investment portfolio withouthaving to own the individual stocks or bonds themselves.<P>The fund manager chooses a mix of many different securities, withinthe fund&#39;s stated goals, so that the performance of any oneparticular security shouldn&#39;t have much effect on the fund.This safely distributes the fund&#39;s risk exposure among manysecurities. <P>Compare this situation to buying securities directly. Supposeyou invest a large portion of your portfolio in a single stockor bond. The value of your portfolio will depend heavily on howthat security performs. If the price falls you could lose a significantportion of your initial investment.<P>After comparing the safety of investing in mutual funds to thecosts associated with brokers&#39; commissions and the hoursit might take to conduct your own research on individual securities,it&#39;s clear mutual funds are the way to go. Just be sure todiversify your funds.<P>There are many other reasons investors own mutual funds. For theindividual investor, mutual funds provide the benefit of havingsomeone else manage your investments, maintain records for youand diversify your resources over many different securities thatmay otherwise not be available or affordable to you.<P><A HREF="003drip.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="009margin.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

It enablesyou to pay, for example, $5,000 to control a $10,000 investment.That kind of leverage turns a 10 percent gain into a 20 percentprofit. <P>You have to go through a broker to margin invest in a fund asopposed to going through a mutual fund family. Initial investmentminimums are frequently greater when buying funds on margin--youusually need $5,000 to set up a margin account. (By contrast,a typical initial investment minimum for mutual funds is only$1,000 or $2,000.)<P>And only use margin when the market&#39;s outlook is unequivocallybullish, since your losses are also doubled when margin investing.If a trade goes against you, your broker will require that youmaintain at least 35 percent of the value of the investment inyour account. <P>For example, if you originally put up $5,000 for a $10,000 investmentand the fund&#39;s value declines to $7,675, you&#39;ll getwhat&#39;s known as a &#34;margin call&#34; to inform you thatyour equity has fallen slightly below the required 35 percentof market value. If you don&#39;t wire the required amount tomeet the margin call immediately, the broker will automaticallyclose out your account, leaving you with a loss on the trade.<P><A HREF="006sminvestor.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="010brokers.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

All of your transactions are summarized each monthon one statement. And if you&#39;re an aggressive investor, manydiscounters offer the option of buying funds on margin, so youcan leverage your possible profits two-for-one. <P>But before you take the plunge, consider the following: <P>You may have to pay transaction fees, even on no-load funds. However,some discounters provide the service with no transaction fees.But investors typically must shell out an annual expense fee ofabout 0.25 percent of assets, on top of the annual expense feesimposed by the funds themselves. <P>In addition, the discounter may impose higher initial investmentrequirements. Worse still, you may also be forced to hold a fundfor a minimum period of time, such as 30 days or more, or elseface a penalty.<P>These two questions are crucial: Does the brokerage offer allof the funds you&#146;re interested in? Will they allow you totransfer your existing funds into a new account?<P>If you&#39;re an active trader, such accounts may be worthwhile.However, if you&#39;re a buy-and-hold investor, you may be betteroff buying directly from the fund families themselves--especiallyif all of your money is invested with one particular fund family.<P><A HREF="009margin.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="005bargainbond.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

No commissions or feesare charged.<P>Anyone can submit either a &#34;competitive&#34; or &#34;noncompetitive&#34;bid at a Treasury auction. A competitive bid demands a certainyield. This means that unless you guess right, you&#39;ll endup with either a subpar yield or nothing at all.<P>Leave competitive bidding to the institutions. The vast majorityof individual investors submit noncompetitive bids, meaning theyget the number of bonds they want regardless of what the finalyield turns out to be.<P>Bidding is simple. First, contact the Federal Reserve bank orbranch nearest you. (There are 12 banks and 25 branches; yourlocal commercial bank should be able to give you the phone number.)Tell them you&#39;d like an application to purchase 30-year Treasurybonds at the next auction; they can tell you when the next auctionis.<P>Then fill out the application and mail it in, along with a checkmade out to the Federal Reserve Bank (minimum purchase is $1,000;increments of $1,000 thereafter). The letter must be postmarkedby the day after the auction. You can also deliver it in personuntil noon on the day of the auction.<P>Remember that until the auction ends, you won&#39;t know theexact yield of the newly issued bond. This will be determinedby current interest rates and supply-and-demand dynamics at theauction. Treasury notes and bills can be bought in exactly thesame way as Treasury bonds, but the minimum purchase is higher.<P>You shouldn&#39;t buy bonds directly from the Treasury if youplan to sell them soon thereafter. Although they&#39;ll be registeredin your name in the Treasury&#39;s books, you won&#39;t receiveownership certificates unless you ask for them. And even then,the process is cumbersome. In the meantime, you&#39;ll have ahard time proving ownership.<P><A HREF="010brokers.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="012trade.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

If you prefer the help ofa full-service broker, however, there are several steps you cantake to reduce your trading costs. If you&#39;re an active investor,the savings can add up quickly.<P>The first thing to do is negotiate a discount on your presentcommission schedule. If you&#39;re shelling out $75 plus 10 centsa share for 300 shares of a $15 stock, you&#39;re paying toomuch.<P>Also, don&#39;t fall for the line that buying shares in odd lots(less than 100 shares) will cost you more. While some brokerageshave a firm policy on charging an additional eighth of a pointper share for odd lots, most don&#39;t. This extra cost is justanother way of boosting your broker&#39;s commission. <P>If your broker isn&#39;t willing to give in on these points,take your business elsewhere. In today&#39;s competitive market,you shouldn&#39;t have trouble finding another broker who&#39;swilling to negotiate.<P>Consider opening several accounts with different brokers. You&#39;llfind that one brokerage may give you a good deal on stocks, butnot on options or bonds. If you&#39;re trading in different markets,the extra accounts may be worthwhile.<P>But again, if you know what you want to buy, use a discounter.For a complete rundown on discount brokers&#39; commissions,pick up a copy of the most recent version of <I>The Mercer DiscountBrokerage Survey</I> ($34.95; 212-334-6212). For a rundown of brokers, check out the <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jdg/invest_brokers.html"><I>Investment Brokerage Guide</I></A>. The survey providesa detailed look at commissions for various transactions at mostdiscount brokerages as well as the typical full-service broker.<P><A HREF="005bargainbond.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="013hold.sell.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

But a sell recommendation on a company'sstock might induce that company to seek out another firm at sometimein the future to act as their investment bankers. <P>When reading brokerage reports, be sure to scan the fine print.If the company &quot;makes a market&quot; in a stock or has actedas an underwriter (helped bring a stock to market) in the past,it's usually footnoted.<P>Also, the mutual funds managed by the brokerage in question mayhave a position in a stock. And a buy recommendation could potentiallygive that stock a boost. We're not pointing any fingers, but dismissingthe possibility of this practice happening would be naive.<P>Any &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; recommendation on a stockfrom a brokerage house should be taken with a grain of salt.

The majority (60 percent)of people saving for retirement have their IRA savings in moneymarkets or certificates of deposit that generate a set rate ofreturn. Since this is money you&#39;ll need after you&#39;vestopped working, most individuals are afraid to put their retirementsavings at risk in the stock market.<P>But by placing your assets only in low-risk investments, you runthe risk of losing ground to inflation. Consider this: The long-termrate of inflation has averaged 3.1 percent annually. Historically,Treasury bills (a substitute for money markets) have returned5 percent annually, compared to average annual compound returnsof 5.3 percent on bonds, 10.8 percent on large stocks and 12.4percent on small stocks.<P>Clearly, net of inflation, stocks--especially small stocks--offerthe best long-term returns.<P>It&#39;s generally not practical to &#34;time&#34; the marketin a retirement account, however, since most people are limitedto just a few switches a year and those switches may only occurat certain times of the year.<P>If you&#39;re more than 10 years away from retirement, all yourretirement holdings should be in stocks. It may make the differencebetween going first class once you&#39;re retired and not beingable to retire at all.<P><A HREF="013hold.sell.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="015easy.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

Simply fill outa form provided by the fund's management, they'll do the rest.Each month or quarter, they'll systematically take money fromyour designated checking or savings account and invest it in anassigned fund. Monthly minimums vary but frequently start at aslittle as $50. <P>Investing equal amounts on a regular basis is known as &quot;dollarcost averaging.&quot; Over the long haul this strategy will guaranteethat you buy low and sell high because when stock pricesare dear, your dollar will buy fewer shares. But when share pricesare cheap, your money will buy more shares. <P>Automatic investment programs are also a great way to get aroundthe minimum investment requirements at most funds, minimum requirementsare frequently waived when you participate in these plans. <P>Some fund families, such as <I>Fidelity</I>, also offer automaticexchange programs between their money markets and stock funds.By keeping the money you're waiting to invest with in a moneymarket you can earn a slightly higher yield than you would ina savings or checking account. <P><A HREF="014stockup.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="016limit.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

The most frequently used orders are <I>marketorders</I> and <I>limit orders</I>.<P>A market order instructs the trader to buy the stock at the currentmarket price. A limit order tells your broker to buy a stock atthe price you specify. Using limit orders when buying small stockscan help you maximized your profit potential. <P>A market order is fine for large stocks that are heavily traded.But for smaller, more thinly traded shares, a market order canhave a negative impact on your bottom line, since buying on amarket order may result in you paying more for a stock than youhad anticipated.<P>All stocks have a &quot;bid&quot; price and an &quot;asked&quot;price. The bid is the price at which the market maker is willingto purchase shares from you. The asked price is the price at whichthey're willing to sell you shares. The difference between thesetwo prices is known as &quot;the spread.&quot; Pocketing thisspread is how market makers make their living.<P>Actively traded stocks generally have very small bid/asked spreads.When demand for a stock is light, however, market makers willcharge a wide spread. A wide bid/asked spread may mean you'llneed a 15 to 20 percent gain just to break even on a stock!<P>The best way to guard against a wide spread and to lower yourcost basis, is to use a limit order when buying. By placing alimit order on a stock at, or just below, the current asked price,you can buy the stock on your terms, maximize your profit potential.Of course the risk when using limit orders is that your tradewon't be executed and the stock will take off without you. Butin most cases, this is a risk worth taking.

The answer is simple:stops on small stocks--which are often quite volatile--will hurtmore often than help. <P>A stop/loss is designed to instruct your broker to automaticallysell a stock if it falls below a certain price, say 10 or 15 percentbelow your buy price. In theory this makes sense, since you'llbe taken out of your position before any more damage can be done.In practice, however, stops rarely function as they're supposedto. <P>Once a stock falls below your stop price, your order becomes a&quot;market&quot; order. Your broker will automatically sellyour shares &quot;at the market&quot; even if the stock continuesto decline. As a result, a stop designed to limit losses to just15 percent could actually result in a much greater loss. <P>One way around this problem is with a &quot;stop limit&quot; order.An &quot;18 stop, 17 limit,&quot; instructs your broker to sellthe stock if it falls to 18 but to hold the shares if it fallsbelow 17. However, such an order could result in your being takenout of a position just when a stock is bottoming.  <P>If you're investing in smaller shares or for the long term, your best bet is to rideout any short-term fluctuations and refrain from using a stop limit order. Only day traders and very active traders will find any benefit from this strategy. <P><A HREF="016limit.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="018proxies.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

Be careful if institutionalinvestors have loaded up on the stock. If they decide to unloadtheir stock all at once, it could have disastrous consequenceson the share price. Remember, you want to discover a stock beforeWall Street does, not after. <P>This section also includes the amount of the company&#39;s stockheld by its officers and directors. While there&#39;s no ruleof thumb, it&#39;s comforting to know that insiders are alsomajor shareholders, so your interests are being well served.<P><LI><B>Executive compensation. </B>This section will include cashcompensation, performance bonuses and incentive stock option plans.Good management should be well paid, not overpaid. Check to seeif management is getting rich at shareholders&#39; expense. Forexample, have excessive amounts of stock options been granted,even though the share price performance of the stock has beenless than exceptional? If so, look out. <P><LI><B>Transactions with management.</B> Small companies frequentlyhave financial arrangements with management through other companiesor limited partnerships. Most commonly, you&#39;ll find thatthe company is leasing office  space from a partnership that includesthe firm&#39;s president or CEO. This is nothing to get upsetabout, but again, make sure that the CEO isn&#39;t simply gettingrich at your expense.</ul><P><A HREF="017stops.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="019tech.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

To the uninitiated, these termsare meaningless. But if you're familiar with the concepts, theycan be helpful in making investment decisions. <P>Technical analysis deals with interpreting a stock's price pattern.The most basic concepts of technical analysis are support andresistance. <P>Consider a stock that has been stuck in a trading range for thelast six months bounded between $12 on the high end (resistance)and $9 on the low end (support). Once the stock moves above its$12 resistance level, it generally continues to climb, to saythe $15 area. Likewise, if it falls below its $9 support, quiteoften it will continue to slide, perhaps to $6. <P>The thing to remember is that once a stock has broken throughresistance, the old resistance level generally becomes the newsupport level. Likewise, if the stock falls through support, theformer support level becomes the new resistance level.<P>If a stock you own starts to climb rapidly, consult a price chart,such as those found in <I>Investor's Business Daily</I> or lookfor <I>Daily Graphs</I> in the reference section of your locallibrary. A quick glance at its chart can help you decide if it'stime to sell. <P>Numerous books have been written on technical analysis, most notably,<I>Technical Analysis of Stock Trends</I> by Robert D. Edwardsand John McGee. The book can be found in many libraries or orderedthrough bookstores.<P>Keep in mind that your best bet is to use technical analysis onlyin conjunction with good old-fashioned fundamental analysis.<P><A HREF="018proxies.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="020legally.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

Youcan also avoid the wash sale rule by selling a loser and thenbuying a similar stock immediately thereafter. This applies tomutual funds as well.<P><B>Wait to buy winning mutual funds.</B> Hold off on purchasingshares of a mutual fund that's likely to make a sizable capitalgain distribution in the next few months. When year-end distributionsare made, a fund's net asset value declines by a similar amount.But even though you're no better off after a distribution takesplace, you'll be taxed on the payout. You can avoid this taxableevent by purchasing your shares after the fund's &quot;ex dividend&quot;date.<P><B>Maximize contributions to your IRA, 401(k) or other retirementaccount. </B>Contributions to retirement accounts, up to a certainlevel, are made with pre-tax income, reducing the amount of incomethe IRS can tax.<P><A HREF="019tech.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A> | <A HREF="021smalltax.html">NEXT TIP -></A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

Thanks to the 1993budget bill, you can receive a substantial tax break if you investin certain types of small stocks for the long term.<P>If you invest in &#34;qualified small business stock&#34; andhold the shares for more than five years, you can exclude 50 percentof the gain on its sale. Typically, stocks that are held for morethan a year are taxed at a rate of 28 percent.<P>An investment in these stocks reduces your maximum capital gainsrate to 14 percent, limited to the greater of either $10 millionor 10 times your investment. On an after-tax basis, a 125 percentgain on a qualified small business stock would roughly equal a150 percent gain on a stock that didn&#39;t qualify for the exemption.<P>Under the new law, qualified small business stock is defined asan original public offering from a company with gross assets of$50 million, or less, at the time of the offering. The companycan grow beyond that $50 million cap, but it won&#39;t be allowedto offer additional &#34;qualified&#34; stock.<P>For its shares to qualify, a company must be engaged in manufacturing,retailing, wholesaling or some other business not excluded bythe bill. Excluded businesses include those in health, law, financialservices, farming and mining.<P><A HREF="020legally.html"><- PREVIOUS TIP</A><P><HR><h6><center><A HREF="index.html">Investor's Choice HOME  Page</A> / <A HREF="choicetips.html">Investor Tips</A> <BR> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise Investing</A> / <A HREF="pacchoice.html">Subscription Information</A></center></h6></UL></UL></UL><IMG SRC="choicelogo.jpg"> <h6>1996</H6></BODY></HTML>

<HR><H2>DOLLARWISE MISSION</H2>
<P>
Welcome to <I>DollarWise Investing</I>, America's premier electronic
newsletter devoted to big profits from small investments. Whether
you're saving for retirement, your children's education or just plain
wealth building, we're here to help. 
<P>
The goal of <I>DollarWise Investing</I> is to provide you with recommendations
on <B>low-priced small stocks</B> and small stock mutual
funds. These investments are generally priced below $25 a share,
allowing you to purchase &quot;round lots&quot; of 100 shares
increasing your ability to diversify and giving you more bang for your buck. <B>I don't recommend penny
stocks.</B> My focus is on quality companies with solid earnings
and growth potential.
<P>
Today is an exciting time to be investing in small stocks. History
has shown that long term, small stocks outperform large stocks
by about 2 percentage points annually. Over time, that small difference
adds up. 
<P>
For instance, suppose small stocks gain an average of 12 percent
annually and large stocks climb 10 percent a year. Over 20 years,
a $10,000 investment in large stocks will grow to more than $67,000.
The same investment in small stocks will soar to more
than $96,000. Moreover, by selecting <I>the best</I> small stocks, your
gains can be much greater.
<P>
Today, the little guys are in the middle of a multi-year upswing.
And the best is yet to come because inflation is heating
up. During times of rising inflation, small stocks outperform
all other investment classes hands down--including the traditional
inflation hedge, gold!
<P>
The reason for this is simple. During periods of rising inflation,
small companies have greater leeway to raise prices for their
goods or services. As a result, small companies' profits tend
to rise at a more rapid rate than in times when inflation is low
and competition keeps prices in check. 
<P>
In addition, periods of rising inflation lead investors to focus
more on growth than safety. They turn to small stocks, which generally
offer more growth potential than blue chip stocks. This increased
demand for small stocks pushes share prices even
higher. 
<P>
<H3>My Investing Philosophy 
</H3>
I'm a value-oriented contrarian by nature. I won't go against
the crowd simply for the sake of it, but if logic dictates that
a group of stocks will ultimately recover from whatever woes
have befallen them, I'll roll up my sleeves and get to work searching
for the best values in that sector. 
<P>
While I'll occasionally make short-term trades, I've found that
the best investments are those you buy and hold for a while. I therefore select stocks on the basis of their prospects
during the next three years. 
<P>
I won't recommend selling a stock simply because it has run up
in price. If earnings have come on strongly, the stock may be
a better investment, despite a 50 or 100 percent share price
increase. Likewise, while I'll be the first to admit when I've
made a mistake, I won't recommend selling a stock that has declined
in price unless there has been a change in the company's fundamentals.

<P>
I'll only sell stock if it isn't likely to appreciate much beyond
its current share price. As a result of my contrarian bent, however,
I'll occasionally get in on a stock too early and sell it too
soon. For instance, I was recommending health care stocks when
Wall Street had essentially written their obituary. Since then,
these stocks have risen substantially.
<P>
<H3>Why Listen To Me?</H3>

It's difficult to find an unbiased source for information on small
stocks. That's why I started this newsletter. <I>DollarWise Investing</I>
is totally independent and has no ax to grind. I earn my money
only if you're satisfied with the performance of the stocks and
funds recommended in the newsletter. So you can bet that I've
done my homework before a stock or fund is recommended here. 
<P>
What little information investors can find on small stocks frequently
comes from the brokerages that have underwritten those stocks'
public offerings. Since brokerage houses make their money from
selling stocks, they rarely say anything bad about a company--and
when they do, it's usually too late and the stock has already
fallen off a cliff. 
<P>
The biggest benefit to this lack of good coverage of small stocks
is that it creates opportunities to uncover undervalued gems.
<I>DollarWise Investing</I> takes advantage of this market inefficiency,
providing subscribers with market-beating returns.
<P>
<H3>Stock Selection</H3>
<P>
There are two broad camps in the investment world, those that
use a growth approach and those that seek out value. I fall into
the value camp. Both styles work very well, although one may temporarily
fall out of favor from time to time. Recent studies have shown
that value investing has a slight edge in terms of total returns
over the long haul, and with less risk than growth investing.
<P>
Growth investors buy stocks of companies
with high and rising earnings, regardless of their valuations.
They'll sell when those earnings start to wane. 
<P>
An offshoot of this group are the momentum players: those that
buy high relative strength stocks, regardless of valuations. Likewise,
they'll dump a stock at the first sign that it's no longer outperforming
the rest of the market. The trouble with this approach is that,
all too often, the slightest disappointment can send a stock reeling--before
most investors have a chance to sell.
<P>
Value investing, on the other hand, seeks out stocks trading at
low price-to-earnings, low price-to-sales, and low price-to-book
values. Because value stocks have lower expectations built into
their share prices, they're less likely to suffer sudden set backs.

<P>
Ben Graham, author of the widely read book <I>Securities Analysis</I>,
is the father of value investing. But value investing's best known
practitioner is Warren Buffett, the legendary billionaire investor
from Omaha. While I can't promise to make you as rich as Buffett,
I will help you discover great stocks selling at reasonable prices.
<P>
<H3>Here's a brief rundown of some of the things I look at when analyzing
a stock:</H3>

*<B>Strong earnings growth prospects.</B> A company doesn't necessarily
need to be earning money right now, but I prefer shares of companies
whose profits are likely to grow by 15 percent or more for at
least the next five years.
<P>
*<B>Low price-to-earnings ratio (P/E).</B> A stock's P/E is what investors
are willing to pay for every $1 in earnings. I look for stocks
with P/Es that are less than the company's projected earnings
growth rate. I consider selling a stock when its P/E rises to
the 1.25-1.5 times its earnings growth rate area.
<P>
*<B>High and rising operating margins (profits from operations).</B>
Thanks to myriad accounting tricks, earnings can be manipulated.
Operating margins, however, can't be and so are one of the best
measures of a company's profitability.
<P>
*<B>High free cash flow (earnings before interest, depreciation,
taxes and amortization, less capital expenditures).</B> This is money
that can be used to expand a company's operations, be paid out
in dividends or used to buy back its stock. 
<P>
*<B>Low debt. </B>There's no magic number here, but too much debt can
strangle a company. 
<P>
*<B>High return on equity (earnings divided by book value).</B> Ideally,
a company's ROE should exceed 15% or more over last several years.
<P>
*<B>High insider ownership.</B> I want management to be partners with
me on a stock. If they own a stake in the company, you can be
that they'll share your interests. 
<P>
*<B>Low institutional ownership.</B> I want to own a stock before Wall
Street has discovered it. Likewise, I don't want to own what institutions
are likely to sell, leaving me holding the bag.
<P>
*<B>A dominant position in its industry, a unique product, or a catalyst
to propel earnings higher.</B>
<P>
*<B>A history of corporate share buybacks.</B> 

<P>
Of course before taking any position I first take a look at a
stock's chart pattern. While I don't recommend using technical
analysis alone to select stocks, it can be a very useful in aid
in timing purchases and sales.
<P>
<H3>A Final Word On Small Stock Investing</H3>
<P>
Now you're ready to get started. But before you place an order
with your broker, here are two final points to consider:
<P>
Since you're not relying on your broker for advice, I suggest
using a discount broker for all of your stock transactions. By
using a discounter you can save substantially on commissions.
There are a number of excellent discount brokers to choose from.
For a run down of brokers on the Web, check out Yahoo's listings
of <B>Brokerage Houses</B> and the <B>Investment Brokerage Guide</B>.

<P>
I look forward to serving as your personal small stock advisor.

For those of you who could not attend, I thoughtyou might enjoy reviewing a synopsis of my talk. </I><B><BR>--GregDorsey</B><I> </I><P>My market outlook in the near term is <B>cautiously bullish</B>for several reasons.<P>1) Intense declines such as we've seen are bullish<P>2) No signs of a top in place yet<P>3) A 20+ percent correction still lies down the road<P>The latest correction, in which small stocks lost more than 15percent of their value, didn't come as a surprise. [Attendeeswere shown an overhead projection of Russell 2000 with MTI's buyand sell signals.]<P>One of my chief market indicators, my Market Trend Indicator orMTI, gave a sell signal June 21 with the Russell 2000 at 345.The Russell has come off its lows but today stands at 315--we'veavoided a 9 percent decline.<P>MTI is an intermediate-term indicator, it uses market momentum,the relative strength of small stocks, several measures of speculationand changes in bond yields to forecast the market's primary trend.I've been using MTI successfully for several years now. And someof its components have been used in &quot;real&quot; time successfullysince 1968.<P>The indicator hasn't told us to get back into stocks yet, buta buy signal is only a few weeks away. [<B>Note:</B> MTI registereda buy signal on August 5.] And despite MTI's current negativereading, I'm actually bullish in the near term.<P><B>Intense declines are bullish</B> <P>Stocks have undergone a much needed correction. Blue chips off10 percnt, the Nasdaq Composite is off 20 percent, the Russell2000 is off 16 percent. This was the first such correction insix years. Such corrections typically occur, on average, oncea year.<P>This decline was necessary. It will help remove a good deal ofthe speculative excesses out of the market and give the bull moreroom to run.<P>Corrections, even mild ones, tend to slow the economy down, andpeople become more cautious with their spending. Coupled withthe 1 percentage point rise in bond yields this year, it helpsto keep inflation in check. It will also aid stocks in their marchhigher.<P>But most importantly, during the last 35 years, intense declinessuch as we have just experience have been followed by six-monthgains of nearly 7 percent. This includes the devastating '73-'74bear market (when stocks lost 45 percent to 60 percent of theirvalue, depending on what market average you use).<P>Outside of recessions, or periods of rapidly rising interest rates,intense declines, were followed by average gains of nearly 14percent in the following 26 weeks. And quite often the marketmoved on to new highs.<P><B>No Market Top Yet</B> <P>You've no doubt heard a lot of talk about a market having madea top at this conference. Don't buy into it. Not one of the manyintense declines during the last four decades have coincided withthe outset of a bear market.<P>Market tops are quiet affairs: They begin with a whimper, nota bang. Outside of recessions, tops are marked by rising short-terminterest rates and poor relative strength of small stocks.<P>Right now, commodity prices remain in check: Raw Industrial commodityprices are 6 percent below year ago levels. These act as an earlyinflation gauge at the consumer level, so inflation is likelyto remain in check for a while.<P>Rising long-term rates are a negative here, but short-term ratesremain below year-ago levels of 5.4 percent. And this being anelection year, the Fed isn't likely to raise rates before November--althoughthat means inflation likely will be greater down the road.<P>Also, while the Nasdaq Composite was hammered in the recent decline,the average small stock, as measured by the unweighted averageof all stocks traded on the NYSE, actually held up better thanthe blue chips.<P>The economy isn't likely to grow as fast as it has in the past,but there's no sign that we're poised to slide into recessioneither.<P>A top is probably a few months away. Expect a 6-10 percent rallyto 335 or 345 on the Russell 2000 before all is said and done.<P>That said, <B>A bigger correction awaits us down the road.</B><P>Despite the recent decline, stock valuations are still very high,as they have been for a long time. Trailing P/Es: S&amp;P 500= 19, yield 2.3 percent, Russell 2000 = 24. High P/Es by themselvesaren't bad--but they pose a risk.<P>The greatest threat to market is inflation. Inflation is in checkfor now, but it could very easily pick up steam--especially ifFed is slow to raise interest rates when needed.<P>If the economy continues to grow as it has in the first half ofthe year, although that's doubtful, it would hasten the end ofthe bull market. If energy prices continue to rise--a very realpossibility--that, too, would increase the inflation rate.<P>Recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that wageinflation, after remaining in check for several years, is risingat a greater rate than overall inflation. The only thing thatwould change this scenario is a recession, and I don't foreseea recession any time in the near future.<P>High and rising inflation is good for small stocks long-term,but initially it will cause pain. Higher short-term interest rateswill be needed to stem the inflation tide and rising rates arewhat will kill the bull market.<P><B>Underlying deterioration: </B>Market divergences: A/D Lines,especially OTC A/D Line peaked some time ago. Small stocks aren'toutperforming as they were, although they're not trailing either.There's no clear market leadership.<P>Investor complacency remains high: Margin debt is at record levels(now more than 1 percent of GDP). Asset inflows into mutual fundshave been very high recently--typically flows very high near tops,because of the belief that &quot;stocks are the only place tobe.&quot; Low cash positions at mutual funds and pension fundsshow that fund managers are also very complacent.<P>Earnings comparisons are becoming difficult, so it's hard to justifytoday's high valuations.<P>Many argue in favor of investing in small stocks because the &quot;relative&quot;P/E (price-to-earnings ratio relative to the S&amp;P 500's) ofthe <I>T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund</I> is low at 1.5.<P>New Horizons is the granddaddy of small stock funds, having beenestablished in 1961. Historically, the small stock cycle of outperformancebegins when the relative P/E on this fund was around 1 and doesn'tend until the relative P/E approaches 2 or more.<P>But the absolute P/E, using forward earnings, is the highest ithas been since the outset of the devastating '73-74 bear market.So while small stocks may be cheap relative to blue chips, thisis no time for complacency. Investing with the idea that the ratiowill go to 2 before market tops out could prove to be a big mistakethis time around.<P><B>All of this sets the stage for a decline of 20 percent or moresometime later this year or early next year.</B> <B>The triggerfor that decline will likely be higher short-term interest ratesto stem inflation.</B> <P>(Attendees were shown an overhead projection of my 12-month forecasterfor small stocks. What followed was a discussion of what goesinto my model and what it is forecasting now.)<P>To sum up the key points:<P>1) Intense declines such as we've seen are bullish<P>2) There are no signs of a market top in place yet<P>3) A bigger correction awaits us down the road<P><B>Longer Term: Bullish. </B><P>A year from now, stocks should again be on the upswing. Inflationis initially bad, but longer term it's good for small stocks.And if I'm right on inflation, this will favor small stocks overlarge ones. But even if I'm wrong and inflation remains in check,quality small stocks should still do well.<P>The only thing that will derail this forecast is a recession.And so far as I can see, recession is no threat at this point.<P>[The workshop then continued with a review of some of the stocksI've recommended in <I>DollarWise Investing</I>, followed by aquestion and answer period.]</BODY><HR><H6><center><A HREF="dwi.homepg.html">DollarWise HOME Page</A> / <A HREF="inside.html">What's Inside DollarWise</A> / <A HREF="pacdwi.html">Subscription Info</A><BR><A HREF="login1.html">DollarWise SUBSCRIBER ONLY ACCESS</A> / <A HREF="email.html">Send Us E-Mail</A></center></H6></ul></ul><IMG  SRC="dwi.logo.jpg"> <A HREF="dwi.homepg.html"><IMG SRC="homebut.jpg"></A> <A HREF="pacdwi.html"><IMG SRC="orderbut.jpg"></A><H6>1996</h6></BODY></HTML>

The black rhino (Diceros bicornis) is not really black but
slate-colored. During courtship, rhinos snort, sniff, grunt, and
occasionally squeak. Sometimes they utter a loud whistle, perhaps
to express surprise. One of the largest mammals on land, rhinos
can weigh up to two tons. They are known to attack objects they
cannot identify by approaching and snorting furiously and then
veering off at the last minute.<p>

Click on the rhino to hear real audio of what a rhino sounds like. If you don't have real audio you can download a short <A HREF="/audio/rhino.wav">wave</A> or <A HREF="/audio/rhino.aif">aiff</A> file.
Each file is approximately 70K.<p>

World Wildlife Fund leads worldwide efforts to protect the world's threatened wildlife and the habitats they need to survive.  We are different from other conservation organizations because of the major international scope of our programs.<p>

World Wildlife Fund is part of the international <A HREF="network.html">WWF 
network,</A> which has national organizations or representatives in more than 50 countries across five continents. We are uniquely positioned to act quickly when conservation emergencies arise, such as the need to save a highly endangered species or habit
at or to acquire valuable land for a park or protected area.

 A land of temperate forests, tall-grass prairies, and extensive wetlands-home to wolves, bears, deer, bighorn sheep, alligators, and 600 species of birds-the United States is threatened by decades-old patterns of unbridled resource use. When the rest of the world looks at the United States, it sees not only the nation whose environmental laws and accomplishments have become models for wildlife conservation worldwide but also the world's leading consumer of natural resources and the world's leading producer of pollutants.<BR><BR>

Long known for its conservation outside the United States, World Wildlife Fund works at home to conserve wildlife, fisheries, forests, and wetlands. As a response to the growing crisis in our nation's fisheries, for example, in 1995 we recommended reforms of the Magnuson Act to prevent overfishing, protect fish habitat, and eliminate conflicts of interest on regional fisheries management councils so as to ensure more balanced stewardship of these scarce resources.<BR><BR>

On July 4, 1994, the government declared our nation's symbol, the bald eagle, recovered from danger of extinction. This landmark decision followed 20 years of protection under the Endangered Species Act, which helped the bald eagle rise from about 1,600 nesting adults in the lower 48 states in the 1960s to about 7,000 today. Yet the bald eagle remains threatened by toxic chemicals and habitat destruction. And this calls for a renewed commitment to protect the bald eagle and other wildlife and wildlands that are a part of our national heritage.<BR><BR>

More than three decades of international experience give WWF a unique perspective on the global importance of U.S. biological resources and the conservation challenges facing the United States. Throughout the country, we work to bring home the message that conservation makes political and economic sense and that it works best when it begins in the backyards and the boardrooms of America.<BR>

The people of Africa have long understood the importance of their natural heritage. Many traditional African practices anticipated by centuries the methods that today's conservationists consider innovative and successful. Africa leads the developing world in setting aside land for conservation-more than 20 percent of Malawi and Tanzania, for example.<br><br>     Since 1961, World Wildlife Fund has been working with the people of Africa and Madagascar to maintain their natural heritage and restore the health of natural resources. Protecting elephants, rhinos, gorillas, and cheetahs; establishing and strengthening the management of parks like Dzanga-Sangha and Chobe; training Malagasy professionals to guide conservation in the future; seeking new approaches to livestock and wildlife management in Namibia: These are but a few of the approaches now being used to sustain wildlife and the human population, all of which depend on Africa's abundant and fertile natural resources.<br><br>     In Namibia, community game guards confront elephant poachers. In Madagascar, funds from a WWF debt-for-nature swap have helped train more than 350 forest agents and support locally run reforestation plantations. Thanks to a 1989 worldwide ban on ivory trade, many elephant populations are beginning to recover. Black rhinos in Kenya and white rhinos in South Africa are also making a comeback.<br><br>     WWF's increased emphasis on professional training has helped ensure that the region's abundant wild resources are today more securely in the hands of local stewards because conservation works best in Africa when it is done by Africans.<br><br><br><center><A HREF="/cgi-bin/imagemap/wwfwho"><IMG border=0 SRC="/images/wwfwho.gif" ISMAP USEMAP="#wwfwho"></A><br>Copyright &copy; 1996.  <A border=0 HREF="/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/images/tinypanda.gif"></a> World Wildlife Fund<br></center></html>

     Home to more than half the world's human population, the Asia and Pacific region also harbors some of the most critically endangered species: tigers, Asian elephants, pandas, and rhinos. The world's most rapidly developing region also has the tallest mountains and deepest valleys, the largest flower and smallest mammal, a coral reef so great it can be seen from space, and a butterfly with a wingspan larger than a human hand.<br><br>

     Economic growth and rising living standards in many parts of Asia, coupled with enormous population growth, are putting greater pressure on natural resources and wildlife. Working with conservation partners in the region, World Wildlife Fund tackles problems that transcend national interests and helps to shape solutions that extend across international borders. Tigers, for example, which exist only in Asia, are threatened by clandestine trade routes that stretch from Delhi to Vladivostok and carry money to poachers and tiger bone to the markets of the Far East and beyond. Our efforts to curb this trade employ many strategies, from support of antipoaching patrols in India and other countries, to investigation of medicinal markets in Asia as well as U.S. cities, to development of regional, national, and international policy initiatives and management plans to protect tigers throughout their range.<br><br>

     Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and other nations of Asia and the Pacific are making substantial commitments to conserving their natural resources. Today, for example, there is a WWF-trained professional in every forest or parks department in Asia. Throughout this part of the world, we emphasize cooperative, regional strategies that move beyond national boundaries to protect the species and habitat that make Asia a land of superlatives.<br>

<IMG align=left SRC="/images/do1.jpg"><B>CREATE AND PRESERVE PROTECTED AREAS</B><BR>

Through grants and technical assistance, WWF supports the establishment and management of such parks and protected areas as Manu National Park in Peru, Etosha National Park in Namibia, and Black Mountain National Park in Bhutan.  Since 1961, WWF has helped protect more than 450 parks and reserves worldwide-an area that is four times the size of the state of California.<BR><BR>
<br>
<br>




<IMG align=left SRC="/images/do2.jpg"><b>PROTECT SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONCERN</b><BR>

WWF campaigns to rescue endangered and threatened species, such as whales, tigers, elephants, rhinos, and our symbol, the giant panda.  We safeguard habitats, investigate poaching and smuggling, advocate strengthened national and international policies, and mount public education campaigns.<BR><BR>

<BR>
<br>




<IMG align=left SRC="/images/do3.jpg"><b>LINK CONSERVATION AND HUMAN NEEDS</b><BR>

Human  pressures weigh heavily on habitats and species both inside and outside parks and reserves.  To reconcile human needs with nature conservation, WWF carries out community development projects like the Annapurna Conservation Area Project in Nepal and the LIFE (Living in a Finite Environment) project in Namibia and brings the lessons learned to the attention of national and international decision makers.<BR><BR>
<BR>






<IMG align=left SRC="/images/do4.jpg"><b>BUILD CONSERVATION CAPACITY</b><BR>

Long-term conservation success requires local will, know-how, and financial resources.  WWF provides support to public and private institutions; designs funding mechanisms for conservation; and invests in environmental education.  WWF's new Education for Nature program aims to train the next generation of local conservation leaders through scholarships, fellowships, and institutional grants.<BR><BR>


<br>
<br>




<IMG align=left SRC="/images/do5.jpg"><b>ADDRESS GLOBAL THREATS</b><BR>

Some of the most serious threats to wildlife and habitat come from global problems like <a href="/new/issues/feature.html">toxic chemicals</a> and climate change.  WWF works with national governments and in the international arena to raise awareness of these threats and to shape policies.<BR>

"Wildlife smuggling" conjures up images of shady characters securing diabolical deals in a tumbledown bar in a far-away place. But it can and does happen in some of the most populated places in America.<P>
 
Each year, billions of dollars are swapped for woolly, winged, skinned and shelled species. These species are among the world's "most wanted" plants and animals-10 of the most threatened species in significant demand for international trade.<P>

As Congress considers changes that could severely weaken the US Endangered Species Act (ESA), World Wildlife Fund has identified nine representative plants and animals that, despite national and international protection, are particularly threatened by illegal and unsustainable trade:

Currently, the dollar figure for international illegal wildlife trade is estimated conservatively at $2 to $3 billion a year, with a total value of global wildlife trade put at a minimum of $10 billion.  According to government statistics, the U.S. portion of global wildlife trade is upwards of $1 billion.

    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor1"><B>Black rhino</B></A> <I>(Diceros bicornis)</I>  In east and southern Africa, black rhino populations have dropped to fewer than 2,000-more than a 95 percent decline since 1970.  Rhinos are killed primarily for their valuable horns, which are ground into powder for use as a fever-reducing agent in traditional oriental medicines and carved into dagger handles in the Middle East.</TD>

  </TR>

<TR><!--Indo Chinese Tiger-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><!--Empty Cell--></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor2"><B>Indo-Chinese tiger</B> </A><I>(Panthera tigris corbetti):</I>  As Western businesses move into IndoChina and Southeast Asia, opportunities increase for poaching of this highly endangered tiger subspecies-especially as countries like Laos, Burma, and Cambodia are not party to CITES, the international wildlife trade treaty.  Fewer than 1,500 Indo-Chinese tigers are likely to remain in the wild.  Five subspecies exist today, all are highly endangered.  Recently, poaching for tiger bones and other body parts for use in traditional Oriental medicines has accelerated and is now the most urgent threat to the 5,000 to 6,000 wild tigers left in Asia and the Russian Far East.</TD>

  </TR>



  <TR><!--Giant Panda-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><IMG SRC="/images/species_end3.jpg"  ALIGN=TOP></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor3"><B>Giant panda</B></A> <I>(Ailuropoda melanoleuca):</I>  Numbering as few as 1,000 in the wild in China, giant pandas could face extinction before the end of the century.  Habitat loss and poaching have been major reasons for this species' decline, but pandas are also in big demand by zoos around the world.  In the past, panda loans from China have created incentives for removing pandas from the wild, and although they are more carefully regulated today, must be closely monitored to ensure that they do not threaten the panda's survival in the wild.</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR><!--Asiatic black bear-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><!--Empty Cell--></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor4"><B>Asiatic black bear </B></A><I>(Ursus thibetanus): </I> Illegal trade of Asiatic black bear gallbladders imperils this protected large mammal.  Six of the world's eight bear species are declining as a combined result of habitat loss and poaching for trade.  The dried bile salts from gallbladders are used in Asian medicines to fight fevers and reduce inflammation.
</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR><!--Tibetan antelope-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><IMG SRC="/images/species_end5.jpg"  ALIGN=TOP></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor5"><B>Tibetan antelope </B></A><I>(Pantholops hodgsoni): </I> The world's finest, lightest and most expensive wool (shahtoosh) comes from this rare antelope species.  While prohibited from trade by CITES, high end department stores in the US, Europe and Japan carry shahtoosh scarves and shawls that sell for up to US$8,000.  Whole herds are often indiscriminately killed, and their wool trafficked through Nepal, before ending up in India to be woven into final products and exported illegally worldwide.</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR><!--American box turtles-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><!--Empty Cell--></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor6"><B>American box turtles</A></B><I> (Terrapene spp.):</I>  While widely distributed from Canada to Mexico, these familiar American species are becoming increasingly rare.  Commercialization is restricted in many states, but this has not slowed down trade, partly because of inconsistent or lack of enforcement of existing regulations.  Booming demand for the pet trade has led to international trade controls, but many turtles die in shipping because of poor packing conditions.</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR><!--North American lady slipper orchids-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><IMG SRC="/images/species_end7.jpg"  ALIGN=TOP></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor7"><B>North American lady slipper orchids</B></A> <I>(Cypripedium spp.):</I>  While most orchids in trade are artificially propagated and traded legally, lady slippers are an exception.  The pink lady slipper, a delicate terrestrial orchid from eastern North America, is collected for horticultural and medicinal markets, often without legal authorization, and wild populations are under increasing pressure from overexploitation.  Wild lady slipper orchids are particularly vulnerable when transplanted and often die because their extensive root systems are very sensitive and easily damaged.
</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR><!--Day geckos-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><!--Empty Cell--></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><A NAME="anchor8"><B>Day</A> geckos </B></A><I>(Phelsuma spp.):  </I>Endemic to a few islands in the Indian Ocean, notably Madagascar, these vividly marked and often brightly colored lizards are among the most sought-after reptiles for the booming exotic pet market.  Madagascar has exported thousands of wild day geckos since the mid-1980s, and some populations are believed to have declined markedly.  Day geckos can sell for upwards of several hundred dollars in US pet stores, depending on the species.  Some of the more than 50 subspecies of day gecko can be bred in captivity, but many more are captured in the wild to meet international trade demand.</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR><!--Saint Francis' satyr butterfly-->

    <TD WIDTH=160><!--Empty Cell--></TD>
    <TD><font size=+1><B><A NAME="anchor9">Saint Francis' satyr butterfly </B><I>(Neonympha mitchellii francisci):</I>  Found only in a small area of the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, this brown, yellow and orange butterfly, thought extinct, was rediscovered in 1992.  Ironically, the scientist who found the St. Francis was convicted of butterfly poaching shortly thereafter.  This species was recently listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act.</A></TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WWF works with many companies to develop products and promotions that benefit our work and help spread the word about the urgent need to conserve our planet's endangered animal and plant species and the wild habitats they need to survive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Check out these products and promotions in your area!</H2>

WWF's international conservation programs are
now benefitting from an exciting t-shirt fundraising
program created for schools and other non-profit
organizations by <a href="http://www.4Rworld.com">Our World</a>.
  The t-shirts feature
colorful designs of endangered species and the
natural world created by world-renowned artists
and photographers.  The school or non-profit group
receives $5.00 from the sale of each t-shirt and
WWF earns a royalty of 4% to 6% of the t-shirt
price.
<br><br>

<B>Sara's Prints</B> has created a World Wildlife Fund Collection of 100% cotton knit sleepwear, long johns and playwear for toddlers and children. The bright, colorful prints of animals and their habitats are fun, educational and they benefit the conservation efforts of WWF. For more information, visit
<A HREF="HTTP://www.owplaza.com/cottonkids">Sara's Prints.</A><BR><BR>

Go wild with <B>Fruit Stripe Gum's</B> endangered animal tattoos! Throughout 1996, the gum stick wrappers will feature fun facts and rub-on tattoos for nine different animals. Nineteen zoos nationwide will offer reduced admission with Fruit Stripe proof of purchase. <BR><BR>

WWF and <B>Microsoft</B> joined to create two CD-ROM products: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/products/Danger/default.htm#top">Dangerous Creatures</A> brings more than 250 of the wildest creatures on Earth into your home. <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/products/Oceans/default.htm#top">Oceans</A> introduces you to the inhabitants of the world's oceans and the adventurous people who explore those waters. <BR><BR>




<B>Welch's Endangered Species Jelly Glasses</B> feature 12 endangered animals you'll love to start saving. These recyclable jars highlight the animals in their natural habitats with an interesting fun fact on the back of the jar. Collect all 12 scenes and learn more about the animals you're helping to save.    <br><br>

<b>KB Designs</b> offers a line of WWF-licensed sterling silver 
and pewter baby animal pendants attached to natural stone spheres. 
Twelve different animals are featured, including the giant panda 
and an orangutan. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.kbamerica.com">KB Designs</a>.<br><br>

Send an <b>E-CARD</b> and help World Wildlife Fund in the process.
E-cards are the postcards of the Internet: e-mail with pictures. 
E-cards are free to send and receive. Every card you send generates
a donation to WWF from advertisers on the E-Cards web site. 
Visit <a href="http://www.e-cards.com">E-Cards</a>, select a photo of wildlife, nature, or people 
from around the world, type in your message, and send it to family 
and friends on the Internet.<p>

<H2>NEW CONSERVATION TOOL GUIDES WORK IN LATIN AMERICA</H2>

The extraordinary Amazon rain forest has captured the world's imagination and the bulk of conservation efforts in Latin America, but an intensive two-year study carried out by World Wildlife Fund confirms that the Amazon represents only a portion of the e
ndangered biological wealth of Latin America and the Caribbean. Other important terrestrial ecosystems, such as tropical dry forests, grasslands, and deserts, are often equally threatened by habitat loss and degradation.<p>

 "Although the biological richness and importance of these other habitats equal those in the rain forests, they tend to receive less attention and, as a result, less funding," say Eric Dinerstein and David Olson of WWF's Conservation Science Program and p
rincipal authors of the study, A Conservation Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean (World Bank, 1995). "We have provided donors with a tool to identify these largely overlooked ecoregions and to better direct the tim
ing of conservation investments."<p>

 Scientists involved in the study divided Latin America and the Caribbean into 191 ecoregions, identified priority areas, and located the gaps in regional protection. For each ecoregion, five major landscape features, such as species endemism and rarity o
f ecosystem, were compared with major threats to the region. Using this information, the ecoregions were then categorized as extinct, critical, endangered, vulnerable, relatively stable, or relatively intact.<p>

According to the study, the highest number of critical and endangered ecoregions occur in tropical moist broadleaf and tropical dry broadleaf forests. Deserts, Mediterranean scrubs, pine forests, and tropical dry forests all have high percentages of threa
tened areas.<p>

 Globally outstanding ecoregions include the Puna and Paramo grasslands of the high Andes; the montane pine forests of Mexico; the Mediterranean shrublands in Chile and Mexico; deserts of northwestern Mexico; tropical dry forests of Ecuador, Mexico, and B
olivia; and rain forest of the Choco, the Guayanan Highlands, and slopes of the Andes.<p>

 "Of course, WWF has long been active in many of these areas, like Colombia's Choco region, home to the spectacled bear and an amazing diversity of plants," says Gonzalo Castro of WWF's Latin America and the Caribbean program. "But this study provides for
 the first time an objective way to better identify priorities and thus increase our effectiveness in the region."

<A NAME="story1"></A><H2>ELEPHANTS MAY HELP PROTECT ZAIRE'S WHITE RHINO POPULATION</H2>

In 1984, due to widespread poaching, the northern white rhino population in northeastern Zaire dropped to 15, all of which inhabited Garamba National Park. Today, due to intensive monitoring and antipoaching efforts supported in part by WWF, the populatio
n has reached 30.<p>

 Adapted to the high rainfall, lightly bushed, seasonally long grass savannas found in northeastern Zaire, the rare northern white rhino is a different sub-species from the white rhinos found in southern Africa.<p>

 According to Kes and Fraser Smith, who have worked to rehabilitate Garamba National Park since 1984, conditions in the park-which is the size of Delaware-are difficult at best. Zaire's infrastructure is crumbling, and project staff must rely on air trans
port for supplies, communications, and fuel. Sudan's ongoing civil war has increased the number of armed poachers entering the park from the north. The park's isolation, in turn, makes it difficult for tourists to visit.<p>

 Now, the Smiths believe that tourists may be attracted to the park by the only trained elephants in Africa. In the late 1800s, King Leopold of Belgium commissioned several of his military officers to domesticate African elephants in the region that inclu
des Garamba. Although they had trained more than 130 elephants by the 1930s, the population dwindled to three that carry tourists in the park today.<p>

 In the coming year, the park project staff hope to lure more tourists with the opportunity to view from elephant-back the rare northern white rhinos. The tourism could play a role in financing the staff's plans to add work with local communities to their
 ongoing antipoaching, wildlife monitoring, and park development efforts.

 

<A NAME="story2"></A><H2>RWENZORI PLANT STUDIES UNDER WAY</H2>
In Uganda's Rwenzori National Park, WWF is supporting wide-ranging studies of the region's remarkable high altitude plant life. The ethnobotanical investigations are part of WWF's "People and Plants" initiative, a collaboration with UNESCO and Kew Gardens
 in England.<p>

 The first component of the plant studies will create a herbarium of plants from the Rwenzori Mountains. Nine project extensionists have collected, pressed, and identified 600 specimens, 400 of which have now been mounted for the collection. Staff from th
e University of Makarere in Kampala have identified the species. Kew Gardens is helping the park develop a database of local plant species, and the project is training a park ranger in computer and database skills. A booklet describing the common plants i
n the Rwenzoris also is being designed and produced.<p>

 As a second component of the plant project, park and project extensionists are working with local people to collect information about how the plants are used. The information will be incorporated into the database. The project is also providing basic equ
ipment for monitoring plants in the park, including measuring tapes, compasses, tree tags, stereoscopes, and rain gear.<p>

 Finally, because local people depend on fuelwood, building materials such as bamboo, and medicinal plants from the local region, WWF and the Rwenzori project are helping the park and communities to negotiate joint management agreements for use, monitorin
g, and care of plant resources in and around the park. A graduate student from Makerere University, with a research grant from the project, is helping communities map the location of their important plant resources. Armed with this information about impor
tant plants and their use, park and project staff are beginning to work with communities to reach agreements over how resources will be used and how both the communities and the park can ensure they are used in an ecologically sound manner. 


<A NAME="story3"></A><H2>NATIVE AMERICANS AND CONSERVATIONISTS JOIN TO PROTECT NORTHERN ROCKIES</H2> 

Thanks to a meeting convened in December by World Wildlife Fund and the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society, American Indian tribes and conservation organizations from Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have forged new alliances that may lead to increased 
protection of natural resources in the northern Rockies.<p>

 During the four-day meeting at the Flathead Indian Reservation in Polson, Montana, representatives of 14 tribes and 20 environmental organizations discussed ground rules for future cooperation on issues including water quality, sacred sites, ecosystem pr
otection, and mining. The tribes included the Nez Perce, Blackfeet, Coeur d'Alene, Crow, and Chippewa Cree.<p>

 The participants agreed to establish a computer network as a tool for fostering joint conservation efforts. In addition, representatives of the Montana tribes will form a fish and wildlife commission representing the tribal fish and wildlife managers.<p>


 The meeting also gave tribes and conservation organizations an opportunity to learn more about each other and explore possible collaborations. Charles Wilkinson, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, and Dan Decker, Managing Attorney for the Co
nfederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation, provided historical overviews of tribal sovereignty and self-governance and described their importance to modern tribes.<p>

 According to Bill Eichbaum, WWF's Vice President for the U.S. Program, the meeting was "a quantum leap forward in relations between tribes and conservation organizations. Environmentalists and tribes have mutual goals for conservation. Now, as a result o
f this landmark meeting, the two communities better understand each other and can better work together to protect the threatened resources of the northern Rockies."<p>

 AT&T Foundation provided funding for the meeting. Additional funding was provided by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Montana Power Company.

<A NAME="story4"></A><H2>ASIAN MEDICINAL TRADE THREATENS INDOCHINESE TIGER</H2>

Every week, at least one tiger is killed in Indochina. According to a new WWF report, tigers are being heavily hunted in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to supply a lucrative demand for their parts in traditional Chinese medicine. Indochinese tigers, which pr
obably number fewer than 1,500 in the wild, are also killed in the rest of their range in Thailand, Malaysia, and Burma.<p>

 "While world attention is fixed on the crisis facing Bengal and Siberian tigers, the tigers of Indochina are quietly disappearing," says Ginette Hemley, WWF's Director of International Wildlife Policy. "The result of years of war and isolation from the r
est of the world make Indochinese tigers possibly the most vulnerable of all. They are the world's forgotten tigers."<p>

 Cambodia, Laos (Lao PDR), and Burma (Myanmar) are not parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the treaty that bans international trade in tiger parts. In Vietnam, tiger products are openly sold domestically and at 
international airports in violation of both national law and CITES. Two to three fresh skins are offered each month in the markets of Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital. Other species, displaced by illegal logging, are caught, caged, and sold in Cambodia and 
probably in Laos.<p>

 According to the WWF report on Indochinese tigers, urgently needed protection measures include status surveys to determine the location and viability of tiger populations; the establishment and strengthening of protected areas; training for park and wild
life officials; cross-border trade controls; and reduction of tiger product consumption in the major consumers of China, Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan. WWF recently provided emergency funding for regional training workshops to bring together, for the fir
st time ever, experts from within Indochina and Southeast Asia to address these urgent tiger conservation needs. 


<A NAME="story5"></A><H2>BHUTAN PLANS REDUCTION IN PESTICIDE USE</H2>
Since first supporting conservation efforts in Bhutan in 1977, WWF has had great success in helping the small, eastern Himalayan kingdom anticipate and respond to conservation threats. Typical of the government's receptivity to conservation practices is i
ts plan to reduce pesticide use in response to a WWF-commissioned study that found that Bhutan's small-scale farmers are using more pesticides than farmers in other Asian countries. The pesticides-including herbicides, rodenticides, insecticides, and fung
icides-are used on Bhutan's main cash crops of rice, apples, and mandarins.<p>

 The study determined that the biggest increase has been in herbicide use. In 1986, Bhutan imported less than 9,000 pounds of herbicide. By early 1995, the figure had jumped to nearly 200,000 pounds. The rise is due to a chronic lack of labor for such agr
icultural tasks as hand-weeding cereal crops.<p>

 The findings were discussed at a May 1995 meeting attended by Bhutan's Health and Education Deputy Minister, the Environment Deputy Minister, the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, and WWF staff. Several recommendations were adopted. The Ministry 
of Agriculture agreed to host a workshop for its agricultural and animal husbandry extension workers to disseminate information about pesticide issues. In addition, the Ministry of Health will direct its malaria control staff to collect all DDT in the cou
ntry for safe storage until the National Environment Commission secures funds its safe disposal.<p>

 The government is gradually eliminating subsidies on insecticides, fungicides, and rodenticides. Since this past July, farmers are now paying the full cost for these chemicals. 


<A NAME="story6"></A><H2>WWF WORKS TO RESTORE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN</H2>
To show that restoration of some of the natural characteristics of the upper Mississippi River basin is essential to reducing future flood damages, World Wildlife Fund, The Wetlands Initiative (a Chicago-based nonprofit organization dedicated to wetland r
estoration), and several local groups recently identified three demonstration project areas. Located in Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota, the projects will promote wetland restoration using soil and water conservation practices to reduce flooding.<p>

 In the Redwood River basin in Minnesota, for example, wetland drainage for agriculture has exacerbated flood damages. In 1993, total flood damages for Lyon County, Minnesota, exceeded $17 million. WWF and The Wetlands Initiative initiated a study of the 
basin to determine whether wetland restoration and other measures will substantially contribute to flood damage reduction. Following the study, the groups plan to move ahead with wetland restoration projects on property owned or donated by willing landown
ers. Two federal agencies have already set funds aside for the project next year, and a number of state and local organizations have expressed interest in participating in the project.<p>

 According to Constance Hunt, senior program officer in WWF's U.S. Program, federal farm policy will help determine the success of these projects. The Farm Bill, which establishes federal policy, is up for reauthorization this year. At stake are federal p
rograms that pay farmers for wetland restoration and other conservation work, as well as "Swampbuster," the program that discourages farmers from draining wetlands on their property. WWF is working with other conservation groups to maintain the conservati
on provisions of the Farm Bill. "Strong Swampbuster and wetland reserve programs are essential to our efforts to conserve and restore the wetland resources of the upper Mississippi River basin, which are in turn essential to reducing future flood damages 
in the basin," says Hunt. "Any significant roll-back in these programs will stymie our efforts to make the basin less vulnerable to flood damage and will result in greater harm to human health and property and the environment during the next flood."

<p>Biodiversity--the incredible variety of life on Earth--is everything from the tiniest 
microbes to the tallest trees, from creatures that spend their entire lives in water 
to those that are firmly anchored in the soil of the Earth's crust.  It's also the 
wealth of habitats that house all life forms and the interconnectedness that ties 
us together.  Many people also believe that it encompasses the diversity of 
human culture--the wealth of languages, traditions, and customs that have 
developed in different regions of the world.</i></td></table>

The Biodiversity Crisis</center></b></font><p>The loss of biodiversity has been 
identified by experts, including the National Academy of Sciences and the 
Science Advisory Board to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as one 
of the most critical environmental problems facing the world.  According to some 
estimates, we are currently losing one plant or animal species every hour 
worldwide--a rate that is expected to increase dramatically 
by the turn of the century.  For example, the National Science Foundation task 
force on the biodiversity crisis reported that one quarter to one half of the Earth's 
species could become extinct in the next thirty years.  In addition, an increasing 
number of ecosystems around the world have been diminished to mere 
fragments.</i></td></table><p>

<center><FONT SIZE=+1><I>If you trekked across the country, it wouldn't take you long to see how much 
biodiversity varies from place to place.  Scientists have 
subdivided the United States into 84 major habitat zones called "ecoregions."  
Ecoregions are broad geographic areas that share similar climate, physical 
features, and plant and animal communities.  No matter where you live, your 
home falls within one of these ecoregions.  Experts have ranked the 84 
ecoregions to reflect which ones support the most outstanding biodiversity and 
which ones are more threatened by habitat loss and other problems.  
By integrating these two factors they've determined which ecoregions should get 
priority attention for conservation.  Take a look at the map below to "visit" 
some of the most critical--and threatened ecoregions across the country.</I></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><i>Windows on the Wild</i> is a national environmental education program 
of World Wildlife Fund designed to educate our nation's young people 
about the incredible variety of life on Earth, called<IMG SRC="/windows/images/edu1.jpg" align=left border=0> biodiversity.  Ultimately, <i>Windows on the Wild</i> aims 
to help create a nation of critical and creative thinkers who have the knowledge, 
skills, and commitment to build a more sustainable future.  
<p>
<i>Windows on the Wild</i> provides educators with interdisciplinary <A HREF="/windows/resources/index.html">curriculum 
materials</A> and seeks to <IMG SRC="/windows/images/edu2.jpg" border=0
align=right>stimulate critical thinking, discussion, 
and action on behalf of the environment.  By using biodiversity as its 
organizing theme, <i>Windows on the Wild</i> provides students with a unique window 
for exploring a range of topics including science, economics, social studies, 
language arts, geography, and civics.  <I>WOW</I> materials initially target middle 
school students and educators.  Future materials and training will target 
elementary and secondary school educators, university students, parents, and 
the general public.<p>

<i>Windows on the Wild</i> also strives to enhance community action by helping to 
strengthen the ties between schools and nonformal institutions such as zoos, 
aquariums, museums, nature centers, and botanical gardens.  <I>Windows on the 
Wild</I> has partnered with many of these institutions across the country to offer 
workshops and other <A HREF="/windows/educate/two.html">training opportunities</A> for 
educators.
<p>
To help develop an educationally sound program, World Wildlife Fund 
<IMG SRC="/windows/images/edu3.jpg" align=left>assembled a national advisory board of classroom educators, university 
professors, scientists, industry representatives, environmental educators, and 
nonformal educators; conducted a national needs assessment to assess 
students' and educators' needs; and developed a biodiversity education 
framework that provides the foundation of the <i>Windows on the Wild</i> program.  
The framework identifies key concepts, issues, and sample experiences and 
provides ties to existing standards in a variety of disciplines.  <I>The Windows on 
the Wild</I> <A HREF="/windows/educate/three.html">Approach to Environmental Education</A>  
incorporates current thinking and best practices in education today.<p></td></FONT>

<BR><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>A Warning from Wildlife</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>

In 1950, scientists Howard Burlington and V.F. Lindeman conducted a study on DDT, a substance that had been synthesized 12 years earlier. Their intent was to gain greater understanding of the effects of this widely used pesticide on chickens. Finding that young roosters treated with DDT failed to develop male characteristics, the scientists noted a similarity between DDT and DES, a synthetic estrogen given to women for problem pregnancies. DDT, they observed, "may exert an estrogen-like action" on the animal in question.<BR><BR>

This warning went largely unheeded for two reasons: First, as a leading force behind the country's emerging economic prowess following World War II, chemicals like DDT were a boon to consumer markets and American farmers. Second, the chemicals' adverse health and environmental effects were little noticed nor well understood until Rachel Carson's classic <I>Silent Spring</I> was published in 1962. Then, as effects became apparent, Americans fixated on cancer. For the most part, scientists and government regulators assumed that limits set to protect people against cancer would also protect them against other hazards.<BR><BR>







<img src="/images/issues_blue_bar.gif"><BR>

The use of DDT has been restricted in the United States since 1972, but the restriction was based on the likelihood that it was a possible carcinogen, not on the chemical's 'estrogen-like action.' Although federal law restricts the use of DDT in this country, the pesticide still is used around the globe and reaches the United States in imported food products or by means of air and ocean currents. In the United States, DDT concentrations in people fell after restrictions were imposed in 1972, but that decline has leveled off. Today, everyone in the developed world contains within their body at least 250 different measurable synthetic chemicals.<BR><BR>

 Indeed, evidence amassed from wildlife observations, epidemiological studies, and lab tests now supports a hypothesis with ominous implications: Exposure to endocrine disruptors- man-made chemicals that act like or interfere with an organism's natural hormones- is upsetting growth, development, behavior, intelligence, and reproductive capability in the offspring of animals and human beings as the result of exposure via the mother. Contaminants have been detected in wildlife from the Arctic to Antarctica- in alligators, bald eagles, bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales, great blue herons, seals, polar bears, sea turtles, and people. The work of these researchers calls for a vigorous response from scientists, industry, and governments (<A HREF="recommendations.html">see 'Recommendations'</A>).<BR><BR>



As evidence for endocrine disruption mounts, WWF scientist Theo Colborn has been at center stage. Combining a background in pharmacy, freshwater ecology, toxicology, epidemiology, and zoology, she helped prepare a 1990 report on the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Alarmed by studies of wildlife in the region that reported deformed offspring and unusual behavior, Colborn knew something was amiss. Since publication of Great Lakes, Great Legacy? (World Wildlife Fund, 1990), she has been at the center of a network of researchers who are adding important pieces to the scientific puzzle about how man-made chemicals may affect life on Earth.<BR><BR>

The story of this investigation is recounted in Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival?- A Scientific Detective Story (E.P. Dutton, March 1996), by Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski, and J. Peterson Myers. The authors make a compelling case that increased mortality, failure to mature sexually, and inability to reproduce have led to declines- in some cases catastrophic- in wildlife populations exposed to endocrine disruptors.<BR><BR>

For people, the implications are also portentous. Endocrine disruptors could explain rising rates of certain cancers, falling sperm counts, and increasing human reproductive abnormalities. Additional evidence indicates that endocrine disruptors may impair human development, including behavior, intelligence, and the immune system.<BR><BR>

The endocrine system functions normally through hormones that regulate specific responses in target cells during fetal development and later in life (<A HREF="endocrine.html">see 'The Endocrine System'</A>). Endocrine disruption occurs when the body mistakes certain man-made chemicals for real hormones or when these chemicals interfere with hormone functions.<BR><BR>

Even minute doses of an endocrine-disrupting chemical can induce irreversible effects if delivered at a critical stage in fetal development. In the 1930s, researchers at Northwestern University's Medical School found that an extra dose of estrogen given to a pregnant rat produced dramatic abnormalities in the off spring's sexual development. In the late 1970s, biologist Frederick vom Saal demonstrated that tiny variations in maternal hormones before birth matter a great deal. His studies of rat pups in the womb underscored that hormones permanently program cells, organs, the brain, and behavior before and shortly after birth. Vom Saal found differences among pups resulting from as little as one-tenth of a trillionth of a gram per cubic centimeter in their exposure to the female hormone estradiol. To understand how infinitesimally small this is, says Colborn, imagine one drop of gin in 660 railroad tank cars of tonic. That is one part per trillion or ten times the dose in vom Saal's experiment.<BR><BR>

<B>Identifying the Suspects</B><BR>

More than 50 chemicals, including pesticides and industrial chemicals, as well as lead and mercury, have been identified as endocrine disruptors. They are found in food, detergents, and plastics, including some used to store or prepare food, canned goods, and personal care products. Of the 100,000 man-made chemicals used in commerce, however, only a fraction has been fully tested for stand-ard effects, such as cancer or obvious birth defects. The U.S. government has not yet required testing for endocrine disruption.<BR><BR>

<I>-Our Stolen Future</I></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Some disruptors like DDT and PCBs concentrate and move up the food web as larger organisms eat smaller ones. Stored in body fat, they are passed along to offspring during gestation or egg-laying and as mothers nurse their young. In six months of breast feeding, a baby in the United States gets the EPA's recommended lifetime dose of dioxin for an adult weighing over 150 pounds. Dioxin is a toxic by-product of combustion, such as incinerating trash that contains plastics and paper. This calculated dose is based only on dioxin's cancer-causing potential, which occurs at higher exposure levels than endocrine-disruptive effects. Because not enough is yet known about how to weigh the benefits of breast-feeding against the risks, Colborn and her colleagues believe it is premature to advise against breast-feeding, except in cases of known high exposure.<BR><BR>

The manufacture of PCBs was banned in 1976. Yet most of the PCBs made before then are still in use. Omnipresent in electrical equipment, PCBs are released into the environment by accidents, equipment dismantling, and other events. Once released into the environment, these chemicals persist for centuries.<BR><BR>

<TABLE align=left BORDER=1 WIDTH=50%>
<TR><TD><B>"This might be hard to imagine in a world facing soaring human numbers, but the sperm count studies suggest environmental contaminants are already having an impact on the human population as a whole, not just on the individuals."</B><BR><I>-Our Stolen Future</I></TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<B>Evaluating the Evidence</B><BR>In 1991, Colborn convened a conference of scientists from more than a dozen disciplines, who had been conducting independent investigations about the endocrine system- some in the lab, some in wildlife studies, and some with human subjects. At this meeting, known as Wingspread I, many of the scientists comprehended for the first time the potential scope and impact of endocrine disruption. Participants concluded they knew with certainty that 'a large number of man-made chemicals...released into the environment...have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, including humans,' and, further, that 'many wildlife populations are already affected....'<BR><BR>

Effects on wildlife cited by the Wingspread researchers included thyroid dysfunction in birds and fish; decreased fertility in birds, fish, and mammals; decreased hatching success and gross birth deformities in birds, fish, and turtles; behavioral abnormalities in birds; and compromised immunological systems in birds and mammals.<BR><BR>

Even before the 1991 Wing- spread meeting, evidence for these effects had been mounting worldwide:<BR><BR>



<UL>

<LI>In <B>1970</B> on Lake Ontario's Near Island, 80 percent of herring gull chicks died before they hatched, and there were gross deformities among those that did hatch. <BR>

<LI>In the early <B>1970s</B> in California's Channel Islands, female western gulls were observed nesting with other females.<BR>

<LI> In <B>1988</B> in England, experiments with caged fish in sewage outfalls saw an estrogenic response in the fish with the males making egg-yolk protein that normally is produced only by females.<BR>

<LI>In one widely reported story, Lou Guillette, a reproductive biologist at the University of Florida, made a startling discovery while searching for a source of eggs for alligator-ranching. In the early <B>1990s</B> while exploring Lake Apopka near Orlando, he found widespread reproductive problems among the alligators. Fewer than a fifth of the eggs hatched, compared to 90 percent in another Florida lake; and half the hatchlings died within 10 days. More than 60 percent of the males had a tiny penis, and some showed hormone profiles typical of a female. Females showed abnormalities in the reproductive tract. Yet, in terms of water quality, Lake Apopka was considered clean. Thanks to information disseminated by the 1991 Wing- spread participants, Guillette was able to tie these problems to a 1980 spill of the pesticide dicofol, whose breakdown product, DDE, is a known endocrine disruptor. More recently, Guillette has found other Florida lakes with similar problems though none as severe as Lake Apopka's.

</TABLE>

Scientists are focusing on exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals to explain population declines and other problems in a variety of wildlife (<A HREF="risk.html">see 'Marine Mammals at Risk,'</A>). The decline of the Florida panther, for example, was largely attributed to inbreeding and mercury poisoning. Although these concerns remain, a 1995 study revealed other problems- abnormal hormone levels, low sperm counts, undescended testicles- that could be linked to endocrine disruption.<BR><BR>



<B>Discovering Human Victims</B><BR>

Results from a variety of research studies lend support to the hypothesis that exposure to endocrine disruptors in the womb and during early childhood development is causing reproductive and developmental problems in humans. Possible links between chemical contamination and a growing incidence of undescended testicles in males in England and testicular cancer in Denmark- phenomena that are both prenatally determined- are being investigated, for example, as are declining sperm counts, quality, and motility.<BR><BR>

</TABLE>



Lab experiments and discoveries and other research studies continue to expand scientists' knowledge about endocrine disruptors and provide insight into human susceptibility (<A HREF="discoveries.html">see 'Discoveries in the Lab'</A>). Two Great Lakes studies are among the most important work drawing links between chemical contaminants and impaired development in children. In the early 1980s, Wayne State University psychologists Sandra and Joseph Jacobson found adverse effects in the offspring of mothers who had eaten, for at least six years before pregnancy, two or three meals a month of Great Lakes game fish, including salmon and trout, which were laden with PCBs and other contaminants. A higher lifetime consumption of Lake Michigan fish by mothers was associated with lower birth weight, smaller head circumference, and shorter gestational period in their infants compared to a control group. Neurological problems- impaired cognitive, memory, and verbal skills- were also evident in these children.<BR><BR>

Building on the Jacobsons' work, the late Helen Daly, a psychologist, and her coworkers at the State University of New York at Oswego compared laboratory studies of rats fed Lake Ontario fish with studies of children of mothers who have eaten fish from the Lake. When life was stress-free for the rats, no difference was found in behavior of the fish-eating and control groups. As soon as even mildly stressful events were introduced- being deprived of one or two food pellets, suffering mild shock, or a  change of scenery in the cage- the rats fed Lake Ontario fish became hyper-reactive, as did their rat pups, which were never fed fish.<BR><BR>

Among humans, the children of mothers who had eaten even modest amounts of Lake Ontario fish over their lifetimes also exhibited the same increased response to stressful events, and they scored lower on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale- a result similar to that which the Jacobsons found a decade earlier in children of mothers who ate Lake Michigan fish.<BR><BR>



<B>Taking Corrective Action</B><BR>

Whether they agree or disagree with the hypothesis that man-made chemicals interfere with development, there is broad consensus among scientists and public policy makers a substantial investment in research is needed to better understand the nature and extent of endocrine disruption by man-made chemicals (<A HREF="research_needs.html">see 'Research Needs,'</A>). The public has a right to know about the possible adverse health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established a division for endocrine disruptors in its National Health Effects Research Laboratory. The National Academy of Sciences expects to complete its assessment of the problem and present a research agenda in the spring of 1997.<BR><BR>

Many researchers who have been studying endocrine disruption believe the evidence already is ample enough to justify preventive and protective measures, including reduced reliance on synthetic pesticides. To help curb the release of endocrine-disrupting chemicals into the environment, they advocate pollution prevention strategies, which a growing number of firms already are embracing for many reasons. Some firms are shifting to or investigating closed-loop and waste-recycling production processes. Others are considering product redesigns. The warning from wildlife is clear. We need to listen.

<center><h2>Saving the Asian Elephant</h2></center>





<hr size=1 noshade>



<b><tt>Executive Summary</tt></b>





<p>



<img align=left src="T.gif">



<br>

he Asian elephant - a symbol that adorns flags and temple grounds

of royal kingdoms and worshipped as a god and honoured as a scribe

from India to Japan - is being squeezed out of its forest home

by unchecked logging, agricultural clearance, and ill&#173;planned

development schemes.<BR>

<BR>

The continually growing human population of tropical Asia has

encroached upon the elephant's dense forest habitat. This fierce

competition for living space has resulted in human suffering,

a dramatic loss of forest cover, and reduced Asian elephant numbers

to 34,000 to 51,000 animals in the wild, or less than one tenth

of the estimated total of African elephants. Moreover, unlike

African elephant populations, Asian elephant populations are highly

fragmented with fewer than 10 populations comprising more than

1,000 individuals in a contiguous area, greatly decreasing long&#173;term

viability.<BR>

<BR>

Poaching for ivory, which is only found in Asian elephant males,

is severely damaging the sex ratio in some areas, notably southern

India. In addition, both sexes are poached for hide and increasingly

for their teeth. The hide is turned into bags and shoes, and both

products are smuggled to China for medical use.<BR>

<BR>

The Asian elephant, <I>Elephas maximus</I>, whose ancestors originated

in Africa some 55 million years ago and ranged from modern Iraq

and Syria to the Yellow River in China, but is now found only

from India to Vietnam, with a tiny besieged population in the

extreme southwest of China's Yunnan Province. It is not only a

separate species from its African cousin <I>Loxodonta africana</I>,

but is also placed in a different genus.<BR>

<BR>

The absence of good data from past times, and the difficulty of

counting elephants which live in thick tropical forests, means

that it is impossible to quantify a decline in Asian elephant

numbers, but it can be confidently assumed that destruction of

habitat has led to a large reduction in elephant populations -

and resulted in a serious loss of biodiversity throughout their

range.<BR>

<BR>

Asian elephants live in the region of the world with the densest

human population, which is growing at about 3 per cent a year.

<BR>

<BR>

Clearance of forests for settlement and agriculture is disrupting

traditional elephant migration routes and leading to violent clashes

when hungry elephants raid crops. As a result, a once largely

peaceful co&#173;existence has turned bitter on both sides. Hundreds

of people are killed by elephants in Asia every year, with up

to 300 deaths in India alone. Between 1990&#173;1992, two elephant

populations, comprising no more than 50 individuals, killed 28

people in southern Vietnam.<BR>

<BR>

Until only a few decades ago, thousands of wild elephants were

domesticated throughout Asia for use in battle, work in timber

extraction, construction, transport, and in religious, cultural,

and social activities. Today Burma has 4,600 registered working

elephants in the timber industry, and other Asian countries use

them for tourism, transport, and tracking during scientific expeditions.

<BR>

<BR>

Bangkok has 3,000 elephants unemployed since the country declared

a logging ban in 1989. In February 1995, the city banned the elephants

- brought in from the countryside - from its overcrowded streets

to protect the animals from heat exhaustion and pollution. Burma

has offered the elephants jobs in its timber industry.<BR>

<BR>

The relationship between humans and elephants is so unique that

the animal has become a sacred and beloved deity. Effigies of

Ganesha, the elephant&#173;headed god, with his plump humanlike

body, are found throughout Asia in village homes and on household

altars. His head is sometimes adorned with jewels. White elephants

are believed by many to be the reincarnation of Lord Buddha and

wars have been fought over them. Thus, the growing conflict between

humans and elephants is one of the most tragic and urgent challenges

facing governments today. Through WWF&#173;supported projects

in Thailand, Vietnam, China, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bhutan,

Nepal, and Malaysia, this problem is being assessed and solutions

are being sought.<BR>

<BR>

Because elephant herds range over such large areas, protection

is more difficult than for tigers and many other threatened species.

Large, well&#173;managed reserves are required, but extended areas

in which human activities compatible with the existence of elephants

need to be established as &quot;Managed Elephant Ranges&quot;.

Corridors linking reserves should be well&#173;designed and maintained.

Scientific research should also be increased in order to determine

elephant numbers and distribution. In addition, their social behaviour

needs further study.<BR>

<BR>

People living in elephant areas should be assisted in protecting

their homes so that they do not turn hostile towards elephants.

Compensation should be paid to villagers for loss of crops and

help should be given to those whose relatives are killed by marauding

elephants. Ways in which to minimize the conflict need to be devised

as one of Asia's highest conservation priorities.<BR>

<BR>

This could include elephant drives or safe, carefully planned

translocation of rogue animals, techniques for warding off troublesome

animals, reforestation programmes, public awareness and education,

monitoring of migrating elephant populations, avoidance of agricultural

clearance in migratory routes, and redesign of management areas

taking in the socio&#173;economic needs of the communities living

in or near elephant habitat.<BR>

<BR>

Poaching for ivory has also taken a serious toll on tuskers, while

hunting for meat, hides, and other parts affects both sexes and

the young. In 1995, China announced death penalties for five men,

including two police, for involvement in poaching 16 elephants

for their tusks. The dead elephants represent 5&#173;10 per cent

of China's known elephant population. Poaching for ivory by Laotians

and Vietnamese is a serious problem along their shared border

and incidents have also been reported in Burma and Malaysia and

in other elephant range states throughout Southeast Asia where

protection is weak. Elephant poaching in Sabah, Malaysia has risen

sharply since 1992, and although not yet a very serious threat,

it could easily escalate.<BR>

<BR>

Therefore, regulations of the Convention on International Trade

in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banning

trade in Asian elephant products should be strongly enforced.

Strict anti&#173;poaching measures should also be established

throughout the elephant's range, along with the monitoring of

vulnerable tuskers.<BR>

<BR>

Nations with elephants need to incorporate the requirements of

elephants in their National Conservation Strategies, to formulate

specific National Elephant Strategies, and to implement them immediately.

In 1991, the government of India, in collaboration with the State

governments, launched Project Elephant, &quot;a major conservation

effort aimed at preserving the gene pool of this unique species

and its natural habitats&quot;. In 1994, the government of Sri

Lanka, published its Elephant Action Plan in a country where it

is believed the animal has declined by almost 85 per cent since

the turn of the 19th century. Sabah, Malaysia is in the process

of finalizing its species management plan for elephants, based

on a draft completed in 1994. Neighbouring Vietnam, whose elephant

population has been reduced by an estimated 75 per cent in the

last 25 years, expects to launch its Elephant Action Plan in 1995.

<BR>

<BR>

Support for development and realization of national elephant strategies

should be provided by the international community. Richer governments

have a duty to give technical and financial aid to tackle urgent

human/elephant conflicts and to ensure that there are sufficient

well&#173;trained personnel to deal with the sociological, economic

and ecological problems which threaten the survival of a heritage

that belongs not only to Asia but to all the world's peoples.

<b><tt>Elephants and People</tt></b>



<p>


<br>


<img align=left src="N.gif">

<p>

<br>


o other animal has had such a close relationship with

people as the Asian elephant, and still remained wild. Although

never domesticated in the same way as the horse, it has been tamed

and used as a beast of burden for thousands of years. Carved seals

from the Indus Valley civilization, 5,000 years ago, show elephants

with a cloth flung over their back, indicating that they were

trained.<BR>

<BR>

Indigenous people in India and other parts of Asia probably subjugated

elephants even earlier. The Vedas, ancient Hindu writings from

between 1500 BC and 1200 BC, mention tame elephants. At first,

they were called &quot;wild beast (<I>mriga</I>) with a hand (<I>hastin</I>)&quot;,

a reference to the trunk. Later, they became just <I>hastin</I>,

and, to this day, elephants are called &quot;<I>hasti</I>&quot;

or &quot;<I>hathi</I>&quot; in India and Sri Lanka.<BR>

<BR>

Wild elephants were also found over large areas of ancient China.

Some were kept in zoos or used for riding and transport.<BR>

<BR>

Throughout elephant range in Asia, rulers amassed large elephant

stables for use in peace and war. When Timur, King of Samarkand,

attacked Delhi in 1398, his men were nervous at the sight of the

defenders' elephants. But Timur sent camels and buffaloes with

blazing grass on their backs among them, causing them to panic

and to trample and disorganize the Indian forces. Timur marched

into the city and sacked it.<BR>

<BR>

Emperors and rulers throughout tropical Asia kept thousands of

elephants, which they used for ceremonies, hunting, and war. Some

were employed as executioners to trample the condemned.<br><BR>

For Asian peoples, however, the elephant has had much greater

significance than merely as a beast of burden or war. It has been

an inseparable part of their life and culture. Ancient Hindu works

frequently refer to elephants, and there is a major work on elephant

lore, the Gajasastra.<BR><br>

One of the most popular gods to this day is elephant&#173;headed

Ganesha, son of Siva, one of the principal Hindu deities, and

Parvati. As the God of Wisdom and Remover of Obstacles, Ganesha

is worshipped by Hindus at the beginning of any important undertaking.

He is invoked at the beginning of books because he is said to

have been the scribe who wrote down the great epic, the <I>Mahabharata</I>.

His worship was spread through Southeast Asia by Hindu voyagers

and settlers.<BR><br>

For Buddhists, too, the elephant has special significance.Before

Gautama Buddha's birth, his mother, Maya, dreamt that a white

elephant entered her side. Wise men told her it was a sign that

she would give birth to a great man. The white elephant features

in many Buddhist stories and has been revered for centuries in

Thailand and adjoining areas: there have been bloody wars over

ownership of the rare white elephants found in the wild. Even

today any white elephant captured in Thailand automatically belongs

to the King.<BR>

<BR>

Elephants continue to be stars of oriental pageantry. In Sri Lanka,

a giant caparisoned tusker, escorted by other richly decorated

elephants, carries the reputed tooth of the Buddha in stately

procession at the annual Esala Perahera festival in Kandy. Many

Hindu temples in south India maintain stables of elephants for

ceremonial occasions. In Mysore, south India, the great autumn

festival of Dussehra is famous for its parade of elephants painted

with colourful designs, and draped with rich cloth. Ceremonial

elephants also carry the royal family and their guests at the

coronation of Kings of Nepal.<BR>

<BR>

In Vietnam's central highlands annual elephant races are still

held every spring, and in some tribal villages graves are decorated

with elephant tusks carved out of dipterocarp trees. Laos was

called &quot;the land of a million elephants&quot; and its flag

still bears the symbol of the elephant.<BR>

The Chinese predilection for animal medicines included parts of

the elephant. Ivory parings were used as a diuretic, and for epilepsy,

osteomyelitis, smallpox, jaundice, and female sterility. Flesh

was prescribed for bald spots; bile for halitosis; eyeball mashed

in human milk for eye diseases; skin for injuries and ulcers;

and bone as an antidote for poisons, as well as for vomiting,

diarrhoea, and poor appetite.<BR>

<BR>

The most practical use of elephants today is in the timber industry.

Over 4,000 trained elephants help to harvest teak in Burma's forests.

Others are employed in India, Thailand, and Indo&#173;China, and,

in 1914, they helped build the Long Beach board&#173;walk on Long

Island, New York.<BR>

<BR>

In the past, elephants provided safe mounts for hunting tigers

and rhinos. Nowadays, scientists find elephants ideal transport

for many of their studies, because wild animals are generally

not disturbed by them or their riders. Elephants also carry patrols

in national parks and provide transport in difficult terrain.

For tourists, the highlight of a visit to India, Nepal, Thailand,

and Sumatra, Indonesia is a ride on an elephant, which can safely

take them into the jungle for close&#173;up views of wild animals.

<BR>

<BR>

Most circus elephants are Asian. Their skills demonstrate the

control they have over their apparently unwieldy bodies. Standing

on their hind legs, however, is not just a circus trick. Elephants

     in the wild do this to reach high branches for food.<BR>

<b><tt>Evolution of the Asian Elephant</tt></b>



<p>

<br>


<img align=left src="T.gif">

<p>

<br>

</FONT></B>he direct ancestors of Asian and African elephants

appeared about five million years ago in Africa. They evolved

from an animal, about the size of a large pig, named <I>Moeritherium</I>,

which lived near Fayyum, in Egypt, about 50 million years ago.

<I>Moeritherium</I> had no trunk, but its descendants evolved

into more than 30 species of trunked animals, all long extinct.

Some of them were much larger than today's elephants and they

lived in north and south America as well as in Africa and Asia.

<BR>

<BR>

The Asian elephant evolved from a form in Africa called <I>Primelephas</I>.

The family grew to more than 20 species, including mammoths, which

spread into Eurasia and the Americas. Mammoths are closely related

to living elephants, especially to the Asian elephant. One of

the best known is the woolly mammoth, which was about the same

height as the average Asian elephant - 3m at the shoulder. It

is widely depicted in Stone Age cave paintings dating back 20,000

years, and deep&#173;frozen carcasses have been uncovered in Siberia,

complete with woolly hair and stomach contents.<BR>

<BR>

The Asian elephant, <I>Elephas maximus</I>, is not only a separate

species from its African cousin <I>Loxodonta africana</I>, but

is placed in a different genus. It is smaller, although large

males still weigh up to 5,000kg and may reach more than 3.5m in

height. It is easily distinguished because its ears are much smaller

and its back slightly rounded or flat, unlike the concave saddle&#173;back

of the African species. Asian elephants have a single &quot;finger&quot;

on the upper tip of the trunk, while African elephants have a

second on the lower tip; and twin mounds on the forehead instead

of the African's single dome.<BR>

<BR>

<B>The elephant's trunk and tusks<BR>

</B>The Asian elephant is surrounded by legend, with its spectacular

trunk the central theme. The trunk combines nose and upper lip

and enables an elephant to breathe, locate scents, drink, and

to seize and manipulate objects with extreme sensitivity. It is

used both for gentle caresses and admonitory slaps at its young.

It is not used as a weapon: a charging elephant will fold its

trunk back, using its forehead as a battering ram, its forefeet

to kick or trample, and its tusks to stab.<BR>

<BR>

Unlike the African elephant, only male Asian elephants have tusks.

The females have small &quot;tushes&quot;, which seldom protrude

beyond the lip. Some male Asian elephants do not grow tusks, but

these tuskless males, known in India as <I>makhnas</I>, are often

bigger than their tusked fellows.<BR>

<BR>

Tusks are actually giant incisor teeth, which grow throughout

the elephant's life. The longest recorded pair, which are held

in Bangkok, are of 3m and 2.74m each. A shorter tusk from India,

and held in the British Museum, was heavier, weighing 146kg. The

relentless poaching for ivory in recent times has meant that tusks

approaching this size are no longer found.<BR>

<BR>

Unlike humans and other animals, elephants have a &quot;queue&quot;

of six molars in each side of each jaw, which move forward as

each successive tooth wears out. With the loss of the sixth molar,

when an elephant reaches its sixties, it is doomed because it

can no longer feed.<BR>

<BR>

The elephant's brain is larger than that of any other mammal at

birth (35% of the adult brain weight), accounting for its learning

ability, although smaller than the human brain in relation to

the elephant's size.<BR>

<BR>

Smell is the most highly developed sense in elephants. They can

pick up surrounding scents on the breeze, and they constantly

feel and smell each other with their trunks. In this way males

pick up the pheremones which identify oestrus females ready to

mate. Eyesight is limited, but hearing is acute.<BR>

<BR>

Although known for their loud trumpeting, it was discovered recently

that elephants also communicate with subsonic rumbles which can

travel up to five kilometres. This discovery solved the mystery

of the coordination observed in members of herds feeding at a

distance and out of sight of each other.<BR>

<b><tt>The Status of the Asian Elephant</tt></b>



<p>

<img align=left src="T.gif">

<p>

<BR>



oday, according to IUCN's Species Survival Commission's

Asian Elephant Specialist Group, there are estimated to be between

38,000 and 51,000 wild Asian elephants (compared with more than

600,000 African elephants). Between 20,000 to 24,000 live in India,

mainly in the southwest and the northeast, with smaller numbers

in east&#173;central India and in the foothills of the Himalayas.

They are largely restricted to hill areas because their natural

habitat in the fertile river valleys has been taken over by humans.

<BR>

<BR>

Despite their size, elephants are extremely difficult to count

in the forests, where they can remain undetected only a short

distance from the observer. To overcome this difficulty, a method

of estimating numbers from dung counts has been developed Richard

Barnes in Africa and adapted by Shanthini Dawson in Asia. However,

systematic censuses have not been attempted in most of the range,

and the population estimates given here are mostly tentative.

(see table)<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>Country Status from West to East<BR>

<BR>

</FONT><I>India, Nepal, and Bhutan<BR>

</I>India's 20,000&#173;24,000 wild elephants exist in

four regions. In the southwestern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu,

and Kerala there are about 6,000 elephants. In the north&#173;east,

up to 9,000 remain to the north of the Brahmaputra river, and

about 5,000 to the south. A population along the foot of the Himalayas

west of Nepal numbers around 500, while some 2,000 live in highly

fragmented populations in the states of Bihar and Orissa. Small

numbers of elephants in Nepal and Bhutan are essentially part

of neighbouring Indian populations. Recent reports from WWF's

office in Bhutan indicate that as many as 2,000 to 3,000 elephants

could migrate from India to Bhutan during the summer months. There

are about 2,500 domesticated elephants in the region.<BR>

<BR>

<I>Bangladesh<BR>

</I>Elephant habitat in Bangladesh is confined almost entirely

to the forested hills of the east, and even there habitat is giving

way to monoculture plantations of teak, rubber, and tea. Only

200&#173;350 wild elephants are thought to survive, with herds

moving between Bangladesh and neighbouring India. There are 50

domestic elephants.<BR>

<BR>

<I>Sri Lanka<BR>

</I>The island of Sri Lanka has been famed for its elephants.

In  contrast to other areas of the Asian elephant's range, the

2,500&#173;3,000 elephants are found in the plains. In former

times they lived also in the central massif, but they were forced

out with the development of plantations for tea, coffee, and rubber,

and settlement by an expanding human population. Some 400&#173;500

domestic elephants are kept in Sri Lanka.<BR>

<BR>

<I>Burma<BR>

</I>Extensive forests remain in Burma, despite increasing

deforestation. Lacking systematic surveys, the elephant population

is estimated at 5,000&#173;6,000. The largest number is in the

north, but elephants are found in many parts of the country. Burma

has 4,600 registered working elephants in the timber industry.

<BR>

<BR>

<I>Thailand<BR>

</I>Thailand has converted virtually all its lowland forests

in the heart of the country to agriculture and settlement. Elephants

are now confined to the hill forests. Over half the 1,300 to 3,000

elephants in the country are found in the western region bordering

Burma, where there are transborder migrations. In central Thailand,

there are elephants in Khao Yai National Park, and to the north

in the Petchabun range. Elephants are also present in east and

west Dangrak, bordering Cambodia.<BR>

<BR>

From tens of thousands of working elephants

a century ago, the number of domesticated elephants dropped to

13,390 by 1950 and to below 5,000 in the early 1990s. According

to IUCN/SSC's Asian Elephant Specialist Group, &quot;the population

has certainly gone down&quot;. (<I>R Sukumar</I>)<BR>

<BR>

<I>Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam<BR>

</I>As elsewhere, elephants in Indo&#173;China have been forced

by human settlement into mountainous areas, which form the borders

of the three countries and of the region with Thailand. More than

half of Laos's 2,000 to 3,000 elephants are found along the borders

with Vietnam and Cambodia and form a single population with 300

to 400 elephants in Vietnam, while most of Cambodia's 2,000 elephants

live in the mountains adjoining Thailand. There are still over

500 domestic elephants in Cambodia; 1,300 in Laos; and 300 to

400 in Vietnam.<BR>

<BR>

<I>China <BR>

</I>China's once widespread elephant population has been reduced

to remnants in the extreme south&#173;west of Yunnan province,

bordering Burma and Laos, where between 150 and 300 are thought

to survive.<BR>

<BR>

<I>Malaysia<BR>

</I>(for Sabah see Borneo below) <BR>

In peninsular Malaysia, large&#173;scale conversion of lowland

forests to plantations, agriculture, and settlement has confined

elephants to hilly areas, where there are estimated 800&#173;1,000

in scattered groups. There are only a few domesticated elephants.

<BR>

<BR>

<I>Indonesia<BR>

</I>(for Kalimantan see Borneo below)<BR>

Between 2,500 and 4,500 elephants are thought to exist in Sumatra.

However, because of extensive conversion of forests to make way

for millions of people moved from over&#173;populated Java, Bali,

and Madura, the population is heavily fragmented, although still

distributed over most of the large island. The rulers of Aceh

province in the north once had large numbers of captive elephants,

but there are now only about 200 overall. In recent years, elephants

which were isolated or causing local problems have been captured

and trained for work.<BR>

<BR>

<I>Borneo<BR>

</I>Elephants are not thought to be native to Borneo, but there

are between 500 and 2,000 in the northeast, where most are in

the Malaysian province of Sabah and the rest in adjoining Indonesian

Kalimantan. Although there is no firm evidence, it is considered

that these elephants are probably descendants of domesticated

elephants introduced to northern Borneo in past centuries.<BR>

<h2>Threats to the Asian Elephant</h2>



<hr size=1 noshade>





<b><tt>The Threats to the Asian Elephant</tt></b>



<p>

<br>



<img align=left src="A.gif">


<b>Habitat loss</b>

<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Courier New">bout 20 per cent of the world's human

population lives in or near the present range of the Asian elephant.

With human numbers increasing at a rate of about three per cent

per annum, this could mean doubling the population in 23 years.

Therein lies the root of the problem of conserving the Asian elephant.

<BR>

<BR>

The elephant's forest home has already been reduced to a fraction

of what it once was in most countries in its range. India's formerly

extensive forests, where elephants roamed widely, now cover less

than 20 per cent of the country, and barely half that is suitable

for elephants. The central India population has been seriously

fragmented. Thailand has cleared almost all its lowland forest,

creating a huge void of wildlife habitat in the heart of the country.

On the Indonesian island of Sumatra, vast areas of forest are

being cleared to accommodate millions of people, resettled from

the crowded islands of Java, Bali, and Madura. Indo&#173;China's

forests were seriously damaged during 30 years of constant warfare,

particularly by the use of chemical defoliants, napalm, and massive

bombing during the US/Vietnamese conflict. However, more forest

land has been cleared since the Vietnam war ended than during

it. In Sri Lanka, the vast Mahaweli River Valley Project for settlement,

crops, and irrigation cuts a wide swathe through the heart of

elephant country. Burma, Cambodia, and Laos still have considerable

forest cover, but this is suffering from unmanaged and unsustainable

logging.

<BR>

<BR>

<b>Fragmentation of habitat</b>

<BR>

<BR>

The fragmentation of the elephant's forest habitat is particularly

damaging. Elephants migrate with the seasons to find the best

feeding areas. Now the migration routes have been disrupted and

herds are constantly confronted by new settlements and agriculture,

where they are not welcome. When they invade crops, and sometimes

villages, there are violent clashes as people try to drive them

away with fire, muzzle&#173;loading guns, and crude bombs. Elephants

and people are killed and injured - the elephant, a lovable animal

for the world at large, has become a nightmare for many living

in its range.

<BR>

<BR>

The situation is particularly tragic when elephants are &quot;pocketed&quot;

in small patches of forest, which cannot meet their food and water

requirements, and from which they have no way to escape. Killing

the elephants is not an acceptable option in many parts of Asia,

and particularly in India, but demand for working elephants is

limited.<BR>

<BR>

Mortality during capture of wild elephants<BR>

Capture of wild elephants for domestic use has become a threat

to wild populations where numbers have been seriously reduced.

Because of the long years of infancy, when an elephant is not

capable of work, it has been the custom to take wild elephants

and train them rather than breed from domesticated animals. India

has banned capture in order to conserve its wild herds, but in

Burma hundreds are caught each year for the timber industry. Unfortunately,

crude capture methods have led to a high level of deaths and efforts

are being made, not only to improve safety, but also to encourage

captive breeding rather than taking from the wild.<BR>

<BR>

<b>Poaching</b>

<BR><BR>

Male Asian elephants have suffered from the ivory trade, like

their African cousins, both male and female. This is by no means

a new phenomenon, for ivory has been a valued substance from time

immemorial, and Asian artists and craftsmen have always been renowned

for their skills in transforming tusks into complex and beautiful

objects.<BR>

<BR>

Despite legal protection of all elephants in the country, tuskers

in southern India have been particularly hard hit, and few remain

of the magnificent specimens that once roamed the land. Some of

the ivory was illegally used locally because, until recently,

African ivory was imported for carving by Indian craftsmen and

it was difficult to distinguish between the two varieties. Apart

from tusks used within India, tusks were smuggled out of the country,

often to Arabian countries.<BR>

<BR>

China recently passed the death sentence on five men, including

two policemen, accused of involvement in poaching 16 elephants

(5&#173;10% of the known population) for their tusks. Fourteen

others were given suspended death sentences, life sentences, or

unspecified gaol terms. Recent reports indicate poaching for ivory

and hide is increasing in Laos, Vietnam, and Malaysia.<BR>

Poaching for meat, hide, and bones occurs in some areas, including

upper Burma. Hide is smuggled to Thailand, where it is turned

into bags and shoes, and to China, where the ash is used to treat

ulcers and wounds. Bone ash is prescribed for stomach problems.

<BR>

<BR>

<b>Genetic Threat</b>

<BR><BR>

There has been concern about the genetic effects of reducing the

number of big tuskers. However, an elephant with large tusks will

have contributed its genes to the population. Danger arises when

the big tuskers are eliminated and poachers find that killing

immature males for their small tusks is worthwhile. When tuskers

are killed, the number of males in a population decreases, resulting

in skewed sex ratios. The latter increases genetic drift which

leads to inbreeding and eventually to high juvenile mortality

and low breeding success. Removing tuskers also reduces gene exchange

by these longer ranging loners that mate with females of different

sub&#173;populations. In populations with a high ratio of makanas,

or large tuskless males, the sex ratio would be better balanced,

reducing adverse genetic effects.<BR>

<BR>

<b>Disease</b>

<BR><BR>

A recent outbreak of <I>Haemorrhagic Pepticaemia</I>, a cattle

disease that is rare among elephants, was responsible for the

deaths of several animals in Sri Lanka's Uda Walawe National Park

in May 1994 (<I>Santiapillai</I>). In small herds of elephants,

epidemics could wipe out entire groups.<BR>

Through its regional state affiliates, WWF&#173;India has assisted

in environmental awareness programmes, aimed especially at reducing

conflict between wildlife and people living in and around protected

areas including Bandipur, Mudumalai, and Dudhwa. Recently, WWF&#173;India

formulated an action plan for conserving the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve

which also has an elephant population. The Community Biodiversity

Conservation Programme has funded studies in relocated villages

of the Chandaka Elephant Reserve in Orissa, and its Conservation

Corps Volunteers have been studying human&#173;elephant conflicts

in north Bengal.<BR>

<BR>

Elephants occur in several of India's famous national parks, including

Corbett and Kaziranga National Parks and Manas Tiger Reserve,

as well as in many smaller wildlife and forest reserves. However,

few of them are large enough to contain a resident population

within their boundaries and problems are bound to occur when elephants

range outside in search of food and water. Ivory poaching is a

particular problem in southern India, where there is a long tradition

of carving. <BR>

From 1976 to 1982, WWF was involved in a series of projects aimed

at conserving elephants in the four main areas. During this period,

WWF aided conservation of Asian elephants throughout the range

states mainly through support to the IUCN/SSC's Asian Elephant

Specialist Group. In India, four task forces of the group surveyed

and monitored elephant status and habitat in the northwest, south,

central, and northeast. The earliest assisted the Government in

identifying and protecting the watershed areas of the Western

Ghats, which contain some of India's finest elephant habitat.

As a direct result, a 5,500km<SUP>2</SUP> area protecting elephant

ranges north of the Palghat Gap was later declared a Biosphere

Reserve. Today, this area contains a population of about 2,500

elephants. A census of elephants south of the Palghat Gap in the

Anamalai Hills and neighbouring Kerala forests was conducted in

1981&#173;1982: although the habitat was found to be adequate,

elephant numbers were lower than expected - many elephants had

been captured from this population in the past century. Seasonal

migration patterns have been disrupted because of hydroelectric

and irrigation schemes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>IUCN's Asian elephant Specialist Group<BR>

</B>In central India, the status and ecology of elephants in Bihar

and Orissa were studied. Distribution, numbers, ecology and human/elephant

conflicts were evaluated with the collaboration of the Asian Elephant

Specialist Group of IUCN/SSC. Elsewhere in India, the elephant

populations of the northeast were the focus of another WWF funded

project. Again, their numbers and distribution were charted and

enough data collected to prepare a master plan to enable the Forest

Department to act. There are an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 wild

elephants in the region, in fragmented populations, and at least

half live entirely outside protected areas. The West Meghalaya

population (2,500&#173;3,000) is probably the most threatened

population of its size throughout the entire range of the Asian

elephant. Other WWF projects in India have been concerned with

support to protected areas, including Kaziranga.<BR>

 <BR>

In 1988, WWF&#173;India was involved in setting up the IUCN Asian

Elephant Conservation Centre at the Centre for Ecological Studies

at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Project Elephant<BR>

</B>WWF has spent almost US$290,000 on elephants and their habitats

in India. Currently, WWF&#173;India supports a number of national

parks containing elephants under Project Tiger, spending US$53,000

to date. WWF also supported the establishment of TRAFFIC&#173;India

to help the government of India abide by its obligations to regulate

trade in wildlife products, including ivory, under CITES. Expenditure

to date on TRAFFIC&#173;India and other wildlife trade monitoring

is over US$1,000,000.<BR>

<BR>

In 1991, the government of India initiated Project Elephant. This

is a nationwide attempt to manage both wild and captive elephant

populations throughout India. The project proposes to establish

Elephant Reserves to protect the range of as many populations

as possible, to establish corridors between these reserves, and

to accommodate the socio&#173;economic needs of people living

within elephant range areas. The welfare of captive elephant populations

is also a concern. Recently, WWF&#173;India's Secretary&#173;General

was a member of the Government Task Force set up to identify Project

Elephant reserves.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Thailand's Elephant and Forest Conservation Fund<BR>

</B>In 1979, WWF funded one of the early surveys of elephant status

and distribution in Thailand. The survey identified the need to

enlarge existing protected areas and create new ones in order

to encompass more of the elephants' dwindling range. It also identified

Khao Yai national park, which contained one of the largest elephant

populations in Thailand, as the most suitable venue for further

research on elephant ecology. Thus began a series of projects

at Khao Yai, starting with a more exhaustive survey of elephants

in 1980 and later a range of activities in collaboration with

Thailand's Royal Forest Department to address management problems.

 By working with communities along the Park's boundaries, Wildlife

Fund Thailand (with support from WWF) and other local NGOs began

an attempt to integrate conservation with rural development in

1983.<BR>

<BR>

Khao Yai contains about 10 per cent of all Thailand's remaining

elephants, and elephants have served as a central theme throughout

the community outreach scheme. Khao Yai's buffer zone and sustainable

development programme is one of the best known in Asia.<BR>

<BR>

The lessons learned in Khao Yai have proved valuable in addressing

the needs of rural communities living near other protected areas

in Thailand. The Huai Kha Khaeng/ Thung Yai (HKK/TY) Reserve is

the largest protected area complex in Thailand, and contains a

rich and varied flora and fauna, including 250&#173;300 elephants

and tigers. Like other such areas, it is threatened by forest

fires and encroachment, and elephants and other wildlife are poached.

WWF has been funding studies on the biodiversity of the reserve

and assisting the Wildlife Conservation Division in coordinating

all conservation activities in the area including management of

the buffer zone and providing conservation education to local

communities. The 1994/95 budget for HKK/TY is around US$130,000,

not including coordination costs.<BR>

<BR>

In 1993, WWF supported and participated in the launch of the Elephant

and Forest Conservation Fund. One year later, Wildlife Fund Thailand,

the Royal Forestry Department and Amway Thailand celebrated the

fund's first anniversary with the announcement and publication

of the results of a 12&#173;month research programme at Khao Yai

National Park, carried out with partial funding by WWF. One of

the main objectives of this project is to gain grassroots cooperation

to protect the wild elephant, which is still under threat from

poachers. Further research and a public awareness and fundraising

campaign are being planned to conserve the elephant. The two target

groups at which the campaign will be aimed are: tourists (some

900,000 people visit Khao Yai each year) who will be advised on

how to avoid disturbing animals and their habitat, and people

living from the forest. The latter depend on the forest as a source

of food and often hunt elephants. The fund recommended that the

groups be helped in developing alternative livelihoods and be

provided with assistance and education. In addition to funding

by WFT and the United States Agency for International Development,

WWF has budgeted around US$63,000 for the Khao Yai TEAM (The Environmental

Awareness and Development Mobilization) project this year. So

far, WWF has spent over US$400,000 in projects relating to elephants

and their habitat in Thailand.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Indonesia<BR>

</B>Since 1966 WWF has worked with Indonesia's Directorate General

Forest Protection of Nature Conservation (PHPA) to carry out a

number of projects and develop and manage protected areas. In

the 1980s, WWF assisted surveys of large mammals, particularly

elephants, in Sumatra, in order to advise the PHPA on their management.

One of the early findings was that elephant numbers had been grossly

underestimated in the past: in one heavily forested area, thought

to contain 80 elephants, over 232 were flushed out using army

personnel and helicopters (nowadays more subtle methods are used

for counting elephants in forests). Further research on the distribution

and ecology of elephants will be useful for improved management

and resolution of human/elephant conflicts. Currently work is

being carried out to determine how to manage wild elephants in

north Sumatra.<BR>

<BR>

The Way Kambas National Park is unique in that it has an Elephant

Training School, set up in 1984. Among other development activities,

WWF assisted in improving the nature trail used by visitors, using

trained elephants. Problem elephants have also been successfully

transferred to the training school, with all due caution that

needs to be exercised during translocation.<BR>

<BR>

However, WWF's Indonesia Programme feels that capturing and taming

elephants does not solve the root of the problem: habitat loss

and agriculture development which invites crop raiding. Thus,

the Indonesia Programme is examining ways to solve the human/elephant

conflict and undertaking public awareness activities with the

media to help both government officials and the general public

to better understand the problems.<BR>

<BR>

<I><B>Gunung Leuser<BR>

</B></I>WWF's connections with Gunung Leuser, Indonesia's second

largest protected area, go back to the early 1970s when assistance

was given for a variety of management and research activities.

Gunung Leuser, now the centre of a thriving tourist industry,

is still a focus of WWF Indonesia activity. Leuser's elephants

are far from secure: loss of habitat has led to the populations

being fragmented and then are in danger of dying out. Recently,

teams surveyed elephant migration patterns in and outside the

northeast part of the park (where dam construction, possible transmigration

areas and heavy logging pose threats), with a view to rejoining

fragmented elephant populations through corridors. The biggest

challenge for managers of the Gunung Leuser National Park is trying

to find a way to solve the conflicts occurring in the people&#173;park

interaction zones at the park periphery. Recently, WWF redesigned

a project for protection of Gunung Leuser with a focus on resolving

this conflict. WWF hopes to strengthen local capacities and develop

community&#173;based enterprises with government support. With

matching funds from Britain's Overseas Development Agency, WWF

has budgeted around US$500,000 for a variety of activities including

elephant conservation from 1994 to 1997.<BR>

<BR>

<I><B>Kerinci&#173;Seblat<BR>

</B></I>Kerinci&#173;Seblat was gazetted as a National Park in

1981 and is the largest protected area complex in Sumatra. It

extends into four provinces of western Sumatra and includes some

of the best closed&#173;canopy forest along the country's spine.

The forest contains elephants, tigers, and rhinos and is considered

one of the most biologically diverse areas in Southeast Asia.

Many communities live along the park's border and nearly 300,000

people live in an enclave <I>inside</I> the park. This enclave

is believed to be the world's biggest human enclave, with an annual

population growth rate of around 2.4 per cent. WWF has been working

since 1991 with local communities to resolve some of the conflicts

which inevitably arise when peoples' interests and conservation

needs differ. Early this year, park staff reported that they have

managed to stabilize the boundary around the enclave. Nurturing

and strengthening of conservation activities by NGOs and local

communities located in areas surrounding the park is one of the

main objectives of the project. WWF's budget from 1990 to 1996

for support of conservation activities in and around Kerinci Seblat

is around US$750,000.<BR>

<BR>

<I><B>Tigapuluh Hills<BR>

</B></I>The Tigapuluh Hills (Seberida) in the eastern lowlands

of Sumatra are a biologically rich area of rainforest which contains

a small number of elephants. Proposed as a nature reserve as far

back as 1983, progress has been made towards achieving that goal.

The Ministry of Forestry has decided to withdraw some logging

concession in the area of the proposed Seberida Nature Reserve

in east&#173;central Sumatra, and to move immediately toward establishing

a new national park, Bukit Tigapuluh. WWF is looking at ways to

speed up the process of declaring it a protected area and developing

an integrated conservation/development project involving local

communities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Nepal <BR>

</B>WWF has been involved for many years in helping to develop,

protect, and manage Nepal's national parks and reserves. Under

the `Operation Tiger' banner, WWF has funded activities in Royal

Chitwan National Park, Royal Sukhla Phanta Wildlife Reserve and

Royal Bardia National Park which all contain small numbers of

elephants. The wild population of elephants in Nepal is about

70 and these animals are scattered in three areas in eastern,

central, and far western Nepal. WWF has no specific elephant project

in Nepal but it aids conservation of elephants indirectly in most

reserves through its institutional support programme and park

management assistance. WWF has been supporting species and habitat

conservation in Bardia National Park, as in Chitwan, since 1973.

So far, over US$200,00 has been allocated for conservation activities

in Bardia. WWF has also developed, in close cooperation with the

King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), and the Parks

Department, a community&#173;based sustainable development and

biological diversity conservation programme with a budget, in

1994&#173;1997, of around US$150,000. In addition, WWF has developed,

as part of the Biodiversity Conservation Network, a consortium

made up of WWF, the Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources

Institute, a project that will eventually involve 60,000 subsistence

farmers living around Chitwan.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Bhutan<BR>

<IMG SRC="img00006.gif" alt="Distribution map of elephant population in Bhutan"><B><BR>

<BR><BR><BR></B></B>WWF has been associated with conservation in Bhutan since

1977 and currently has a range of projects concerned with community

awareness and conservation education. Technical and other assistance

to the Forestry Services Division, which oversees Bhutan's protected

areas, is also playing an important role in protecting elephant

habitat. Assistance, amounting to US$500,000, has been given to

Royal Manas National Park for years under Operation Tiger.<BR>

<BR>

All the existing wild elephant populations in Bhutan are found

along the border with India, in several forest reserves and wildlife

sanctuaries, the most famous being Royal Manas National Park.

Traditionally, elephants have made seasonal migrations in the

wet summer months out of Bhutan's forests in the Himalayan foothills,

to India's grasslands. As the grasslands mature and dry out they

return to their winter range in Bhutan. Now these movements are

blocked by human settlements and are no longer possible in many

areas. The estimated population of wild elephants in Bhutan in

1990 was 60 to 150. However, recent estimates are between 2,000

to 3,000. This sharp increase does not represent a drastic rise

in numbers. These elephants are migrant populations and can be

found either in Bhutan or India depending on the season and food

availability. It is thought that as many 3,000 elephants spend

the summer in Bhutan, most of which migrate to Phibsoo Wildlife

Sanctuary, Khaling, and the Royal Manas National Park, which is

contiguous with the Manas Tiger Reserve in India. Only Manas is

large enough to hold a resident elephant population. Royal Manas

is the oldest protected area in Bhutan, having been set up in

1966 as a Wildlife Sanctuary and upgraded to National Park status

in 1988. So far, WWF has allocated about US$500,000 for Manas

to help the Forestry Services Division establish a basic infrastructure,

construction of guard posts, patrol roads, staff housing trails,

watch towers, water holes, demarcation of park boundaries, and

provision of field equipment. WWF's current project which focuses

on finalizing and helping implement a long term management plan

for Royal Manas National Park, including biodiversity assessment,

mapping distribution and density and activities with communities

living adjacent to the park, has a budget of around US$500,000

for 1995&#173;1998. In addition, WWF has budgeted nearly US$70,000

for institutional support for Bhutan's Forestry Services Division

from 1995 to 1997. WWF's anti&#173;poaching programm has been

allocated US$20,190 for 1995&#173;1996<BR>

.<BR>

<B>Vietnam <BR>

</B>For over a decade WWF has been actively involved in conservation

activities in Vietnam beginning with assistance in helping the

country develop its <I>National Conservation Strategy</I> and

researching the environmental effects of war. In June 1995, WWF

and the Ministry of Forestry convened an elephant workshop, inviting

representatives from 15 provinces with wild elephant populations.

The workshop produced a draft Elephant Action Plan for Vietnam

elephant populations, whose estimated numbers have been reduced

by 75 per cent in the last 25 years. WWF began survey work of

elephants and other large mammals in Vietnam in 1990 under a Biodiversity

Conservation Studies Project for which over US$200,000 has been

spent to support Vietnamese and international scientists. Specific

elephant surveys in the past few years have revealed that there

may be as few as 300 to 400 elephants remaining, mainly in isolated

forest pockets that are shrinking rapidly. In 1991&#173;1992 WWF

funded a feasibility study and training programme on translocation

techniques, but no successful translocation of elephants has taken

place in Vietnam yet. In fact, some 15 elephants died through

a failed attempt undertaken independently by a private Singapore

company to move an isolated herd in 1993. Vietnam is hoping that

it can generate support for its Elephant Action Plan and the critically

endangered species whose greatest threat in Vietnam is loss of

its forest habitat. Recent reports indicate male elephants are

being poached for ivory and other products.<BR>

<b><tt>That WWF is doing to save the Asian Elephant</tt></b>



<p>

<br>


<img align=left src="W.gif">



<p>

<BR>



WF has been supporting Asian elephant conservation for

nearly 30 years, beginning with survey work in Sri Lanka and India

in the 1960s. Over the years it has funded conservation efforts

through IUCN's Species Survival Commission's (SSC) Asian Elephant

Specialist Group, through TRAFFIC (WWF and IUCN's wildlife trade

and monitoring programme), and by providing seed money for the

creation of the Asian Elephant Conservation Centre at the Indian

Institute of Science in Bangalore, India.<BR>

<BR>

<FONT FACE="Courier New">Despite the long history of human contact

with, and use of, the Asian elephant, scientific studies of its

ecology and behaviour only began in the 1960s. WWF started supporting

Asian elephant conservation with its contribution of funds towards

the three&#173;year &quot;Smithsonian Elephant Survey&quot; in

Sri Lanka, a country world&#173;renowned for its elephants. This

first WWF Asian elephant project revealed early on the inevitable

increase of conflicts between humans and elephants. In view of

plans to clear forests for cultivation, which could mean the survival

of elephants only in protected areas, the investigators concentrated

on studying the ecology and population dynamics of elephants in

the National Parks of Wilpattu, Gal Oya and Ruhuna. They found

that herds left the parks according to traditional seasonal movements,

attracted by rice fields or sugar cane plantations, or because

the park could not offer sufficient food and water throughout

the year. Park authorities corrected the situation by removing

buffaloes from the park and restoring water holes. Further assistance

was given to the Wildlife Department in the form of equipment

and anti&#173;poaching patrols.<BR>

 <BR>

In the 1980s, WWF also provided help in securing new protected

areas for elephants in the Mahaweli valley. After a WWF study

of elephant ecology in the floodplains, recommendations were made

for the boundaries of the new Madura Oya National Park which protects

part of the elephants' range. Corridors linking the new park to

other protected areas were identified. WWF also gave assistance

to Sri Lanka's Elephant Conservation Unit. This was a direct input

into the Mahaweli Environment Programme, initially providing salaries

for a park planner and two other staff to ensure that the new

protected areas met their objectives - to protect watersheds and

elephant populations, and to provide sustainable benefits to the

local people. Seven new protected areas were set up under the

programme.<BR>

<BR>

Although Sri Lanka's Mahaweli Environment Programme secured a

number of key protected areas in the Mahaweli floodplains, the

great influx of settlers has escalated the human/elephant conflict.

In January 1995, a rampaging wild elephant killed six members

of one family and smashed their mud hut. Three other people were

injured before the elephant was shot by soldiers. The government

has identified over 60 elephant/human trouble spots and its national

elephant conservation strategy calls for mitigation of the human/elephant

conflict as its first priority. WWF supported publication of this

model strategy in <I>Gajah</I>, the Journal of IUCN's Asian Elephant

Specialist Group. <BR>

<BR>

WWF provides annual support to the activities of the Specialist

Group through IUCN's SSC and a small grant that pays for publication

of <I>Gajah</I>. WWF has been working to protect elephants in

Sri Lanka for almost 30 years and has contributed about US$140,000.

<BR>

<BR>

Rainforest elephant conservation in Malaysia<BR>

A study of elephants in Malaysian rainforests began in 1973. The

British&#173;based Nuffield Foundation provided primary support

while WWF made a supplementary grant in 1976 to enable aerial

radio tracking, which proved to be crucial in establishing the

movements and ranges of elephants hidden in dense rainforests.

Five elephants from different herds were immobilized and fitted

with radio&#173;collared transmitters. From a light aircraft their

movements were accurately recorded despite their being hidden

under the forest canopy. A broad comparison was thus obtained

of minimum home ranges of similar sized herds over the same period

in different habitats. The results showed that elephants in primary

forest moved as much as three to four times the distance to feed

than those in secondary forest, which offered a more plentiful

and greater quality food. Thus the initial stages of land development,

which ultimately threatens the survival of the elephant, may actually

improve its living conditions. This could mean that sustainable

timber extraction could go hand&#173;in&#173;hand with conserving

wild elephant populations - provided that management is integrated.

In other words, habitat management which allows limited, compatible

human exploitation might actually improve elephant ranges.<BR>

<BR>

In the early 1980's, WWF provided funds to the Sabah Forest Department

for a faunal survey of Sabah, to identify high priority areas

for protection. One of the four areas pinpointed as having high

biodiversity value was gazetted as the Tabin Wildlife Reserve

in 1984. Tabin was chosen because it had the only viable populations

of elephant and Sumatran rhino. Tabin also has the largest elephant

population in Borneo. WWF&#173;Malaysia helped to publish a management

plan for Tabin later the same year. Over the years WWF has supported

a variety of projects in habitats supporting elephants. In 1992,

WWF funded a project to estimate elephant numbers in Tabin. Since

it is extremely difficult to sight elephants in dense tropical

forest, an indirect standardized method of estimating numbers

based on dung density was used. This project resulted in training

of wildlife department staff in the standardized method. The trained

staff are also carrying out the recommendations of the study including

the development of a species management plan. WWF is seeking money

for an elephant conservation project, planned for Peninsula Malaysia

for 1995&#173;96.<BR>

<BR>

Elephant&#173;riding nation: China <BR>

Rapid deforestation in tropical Asia led to increasing concern

about its effects on elephant numbers and in 1980, WWF launched

a series of projects to promote conservation in Burma, India,

Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Later, WWF began conservation

of elephant habitat in China, Nepal, Bhutan, and more recently

in Vietnam. Most of the projects involved carrying out status

surveys to establish elephant numbers and the state of their habitat

in various regions.<BR>

<BR>

 Unlike in the rest of China, the people of southern Yunnan province

have had a long relationship with the elephant. They were referred

to as long ago as 200 BC as an `elephant&#173;riding nation':

almost every family kept an elephant as a work animal. Today,

Yunnan's elephant populations have dwindled to a remnant and the

few remaining elephants are regarded as pests. Recent estimates

put the number of elephants at about 150 to 300. Counting them

is difficult because of thick tangled vegetation and mountainous

terrain. Deforestation due to shifting cultivation, forest fires

and illegal logging is a serious problem in the elephant's last

remaining stronghold in China.<BR>

<BR>

The human population has doubled since 1950. Elephant populations

are scattered and small. Although large areas of forest have been

set aside for the elephants, croplands and rubber plantations

both inside and outside the reserve are inevitably a source of

conflict between elephants and humans (most of whom are armed).

The largest reserve, the 2,000km<SUP>2</SUP> Xishuangbanna Nature

Reserve, is the site of a WWF project co&#173;funded by Britain's

Overseas Development Agency. This project aims to develop and

implement a management plan to protect the Xishuangbanna forests.

This involves working closely with the local Dai people, training

reserve staff in integrated management techniques and providing

educational materials for local communities. To encourage people

to protect rather than destroy the forest, living standards must

be raised and the forest seen as an economic asset. Four `model'

villages are being introduced to agroforestry techniques which

will improve soil fertility, thus lessening the need for shifting

cultivation. Elephant barriers have been provided.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

India's Project Elephant<BR>

Ever since its establishment in 1969, WWF&#173;India has been

deeply committed to the conservation of the Asian elephant and

its habitat. WWF&#173;India has also been monitoring the trade

in ivory and other wildlife products through TRAFFIC&#173;India.

In 1993, it was successful in obtaining a stay order on the banned

trade in ivory vacated in the Delhi High Court. WWF&#173;India

is also helping in the effort to rehabilitate ivory carvers by

displaying and selling in its shops products made from ivory substitutes.

Through its regional state affiliates, WWF&#173;India has assisted

in environmental awareness programmes, aimed especially at reducing

conflict between wildlife and people living in and around protected

areas including Bandipur, Mudumalai, and Dudhwa. Recently, WWF&#173;India

formulated an action plan for conserving the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve

which also has an elephant population. The Community Biodiversity

Conservation Programme has funded studies in relocated villages

of the Chandaka Elephant Reserve in Orissa, and its Conservation

Corps Volunteers have been studying human&#173;elephant conflicts

in north Bengal.<BR>

<BR>

Elephants occur in several of India's famous national parks, including

Corbett and Kaziranga National Parks and Manas Tiger Reserve,

as well as in many smaller wildlife and forest reserves. However,

few of them are large enough to contain a resident population

within their boundaries and problems are bound to occur when elephants

range outside in search of food and water. Ivory poaching is a

particular problem in southern India, where there is a long tradition

of carving. <BR>

From 1976 to 1982, WWF was involved in a series of projects aimed

at conserving elephants in the four main areas. During this period,

WWF aided conservation of Asian elephants throughout the range

states mainly through support to the IUCN/SSC's Asian Elephant

Specialist Group. In India, four task forces of the group surveyed

and monitored elephant status and habitat in the northwest, south,

central, and northeast. The earliest assisted the Government in

identifying and protecting the watershed areas of the Western

Ghats, which contain some of India's finest elephant habitat.

As a direct result, a 5,500km<SUP>2</SUP> area protecting elephant

ranges north of the Palghat Gap was later declared a Biosphere

Reserve. Today, this area contains a population of about 2,500

elephants. A census of elephants south of the Palghat Gap in the

Anamalai Hills and neighbouring Kerala forests was conducted in

1981&#173;1982: although the habitat was found to be adequate,

elephant numbers were lower than expected - many elephants had

been captured from this population in the past century. Seasonal

migration patterns have been disrupted because of hydroelectric

and irrigation schemes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>IUCN's Asian elephant Specialist Group<BR>

</B>In central India, the status and ecology of elephants in Bihar

and Orissa were studied. Distribution, numbers, ecology and human/elephant

conflicts were evaluated with the collaboration of the Asian Elephant

Specialist Group of IUCN/SSC. Elsewhere in India, the elephant

populations of the northeast were the focus of another WWF funded

project. Again, their numbers and distribution were charted and

enough data collected to prepare a master plan to enable the Forest

Department to act. There are an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 wild

elephants in the region, in fragmented populations, and at least

half live entirely outside protected areas. The West Meghalaya

population (2,500&#173;3,000) is probably the most threatened

population of its size throughout the entire range of the Asian

elephant. Other WWF projects in India have been concerned with

support to protected areas, including Kaziranga.<BR>

 <BR>

In 1988, WWF&#173;India was involved in setting up the IUCN Asian

Elephant Conservation Centre at the Centre for Ecological Studies

at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Project Elephant<BR>

</B>WWF has spent almost US$290,000 on elephants and their habitats

in India. Currently, WWF&#173;India supports a number of national

parks containing elephants under Project Tiger, spending US$53,000

to date. WWF also supported the establishment of TRAFFIC&#173;India

to help the government of India abide by its obligations to regulate

trade in wildlife products, including ivory, under CITES. Expenditure

to date on TRAFFIC&#173;India and other wildlife trade monitoring

is over US$1,000,000.<BR>

<BR>

In 1991, the government of India initiated Project Elephant. This

is a nationwide attempt to manage both wild and captive elephant

populations throughout India. The project proposes to establish

Elephant Reserves to protect the range of as many populations

as possible, to establish corridors between these reserves, and

to accommodate the socio&#173;economic needs of people living

within elephant range areas. The welfare of captive elephant populations

is also a concern. Recently, WWF&#173;India's Secretary&#173;General

was a member of the Government Task Force set up to identify Project

Elephant reserves.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Thailand's Elephant and Forest Conservation Fund<BR>

</B>In 1979, WWF funded one of the early surveys of elephant status

and distribution in Thailand. The survey identified the need to

enlarge existing protected areas and create new ones in order

to encompass more of the elephants' dwindling range. It also identified

Khao Yai national park, which contained one of the largest elephant

populations in Thailand, as the most suitable venue for further

research on elephant ecology. Thus began a series of projects

at Khao Yai, starting with a more exhaustive survey of elephants

in 1980 and later a range of activities in collaboration with

Thailand's Royal Forest Department to address management problems.

 By working with communities along the Park's boundaries, Wildlife

Fund Thailand (with support from WWF) and other local NGOs began

an attempt to integrate conservation with rural development in

1983.<BR>

<BR>

Khao Yai contains about 10 per cent of all Thailand's remaining

elephants, and elephants have served as a central theme throughout

the community outreach scheme. Khao Yai's buffer zone and sustainable

development programme is one of the best known in Asia.<BR>

<BR>

The lessons learned in Khao Yai have proved valuable in addressing

the needs of rural communities living near other protected areas

in Thailand. The Huai Kha Khaeng/ Thung Yai (HKK/TY) Reserve is

the largest protected area complex in Thailand, and contains a

rich and varied flora and fauna, including 250&#173;300 elephants

and tigers. Like other such areas, it is threatened by forest

fires and encroachment, and elephants and other wildlife are poached.

WWF has been funding studies on the biodiversity of the reserve

and assisting the Wildlife Conservation Division in coordinating

all conservation activities in the area including management of

the buffer zone and providing conservation education to local

communities. The 1994/95 budget for HKK/TY is around US$130,000,

not including coordination costs.<BR>

<BR>

In 1993, WWF supported and participated in the launch of the Elephant

and Forest Conservation Fund. One year later, Wildlife Fund Thailand,

the Royal Forestry Department and Amway Thailand celebrated the

fund's first anniversary with the announcement and publication

of the results of a 12&#173;month research programme at Khao Yai

National Park, carried out with partial funding by WWF. One of

the main objectives of this project is to gain grassroots cooperation

to protect the wild elephant, which is still under threat from

poachers. Further research and a public awareness and fundraising

campaign are being planned to conserve the elephant. The two target

groups at which the campaign will be aimed are: tourists (some

900,000 people visit Khao Yai each year) who will be advised on

how to avoid disturbing animals and their habitat, and people

living from the forest. The latter depend on the forest as a source

of food and often hunt elephants. The fund recommended that the

groups be helped in developing alternative livelihoods and be

provided with assistance and education. In addition to funding

by WFT and the United States Agency for International Development,

WWF has budgeted around US$63,000 for the Khao Yai TEAM (The Environmental

Awareness and Development Mobilization) project this year. So

far, WWF has spent over US$400,000 in projects relating to elephants

and their habitat in Thailand.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Indonesia<BR>

</B>Since 1966 WWF has worked with Indonesia's Directorate General

Forest Protection of Nature Conservation (PHPA) to carry out a

number of projects and develop and manage protected areas. In

the 1980s, WWF assisted surveys of large mammals, particularly

elephants, in Sumatra, in order to advise the PHPA on their management.

One of the early findings was that elephant numbers had been grossly

underestimated in the past: in one heavily forested area, thought

to contain 80 elephants, over 232 were flushed out using army

personnel and helicopters (nowadays more subtle methods are used

for counting elephants in forests). Further research on the distribution

and ecology of elephants will be useful for improved management

and resolution of human/elephant conflicts. Currently work is

being carried out to determine how to manage wild elephants in

north Sumatra.<BR>

<BR>

The Way Kambas National Park is unique in that it has an Elephant

Training School, set up in 1984. Among other development activities,

WWF assisted in improving the nature trail used by visitors, using

trained elephants. Problem elephants have also been successfully

transferred to the training school, with all due caution that

needs to be exercised during translocation.<BR>

<BR>

However, WWF's Indonesia Programme feels that capturing and taming

elephants does not solve the root of the problem: habitat loss

and agriculture development which invites crop raiding. Thus,

the Indonesia Programme is examining ways to solve the human/elephant

conflict and undertaking public awareness activities with the

media to help both government officials and the general public

to better understand the problems.<BR>

<BR>

<I><B>Gunung Leuser<BR>

</B></I>WWF's connections with Gunung Leuser, Indonesia's second

largest protected area, go back to the early 1970s when assistance

was given for a variety of management and research activities.

Gunung Leuser, now the centre of a thriving tourist industry,

is still a focus of WWF Indonesia activity. Leuser's elephants

are far from secure: loss of habitat has led to the populations

being fragmented and then are in danger of dying out. Recently,

teams surveyed elephant migration patterns in and outside the

northeast part of the park (where dam construction, possible transmigration

areas and heavy logging pose threats), with a view to rejoining

fragmented elephant populations through corridors. The biggest

challenge for managers of the Gunung Leuser National Park is trying

to find a way to solve the conflicts occurring in the people&#173;park

interaction zones at the park periphery. Recently, WWF redesigned

a project for protection of Gunung Leuser with a focus on resolving

this conflict. WWF hopes to strengthen local capacities and develop

community&#173;based enterprises with government support. With

matching funds from Britain's Overseas Development Agency, WWF

has budgeted around US$500,000 for a variety of activities including

elephant conservation from 1994 to 1997.<BR>

<BR>

<I><B>Kerinci&#173;Seblat<BR>

</B></I>Kerinci&#173;Seblat was gazetted as a National Park in

1981 and is the largest protected area complex in Sumatra. It

extends into four provinces of western Sumatra and includes some

of the best closed&#173;canopy forest along the country's spine.

The forest contains elephants, tigers, and rhinos and is considered

one of the most biologically diverse areas in Southeast Asia.

Many communities live along the park's border and nearly 300,000

people live in an enclave <I>inside</I> the park. This enclave

is believed to be the world's biggest human enclave, with an annual

population growth rate of around 2.4 per cent. WWF has been working

since 1991 with local communities to resolve some of the conflicts

which inevitably arise when peoples' interests and conservation

needs differ. Early this year, park staff reported that they have

managed to stabilize the boundary around the enclave. Nurturing

and strengthening of conservation activities by NGOs and local

communities located in areas surrounding the park is one of the

main objectives of the project. WWF's budget from 1990 to 1996

for support of conservation activities in and around Kerinci Seblat

is around US$750,000.<BR>

<BR>

<I><B>Tigapuluh Hills<BR>

</B></I>The Tigapuluh Hills (Seberida) in the eastern lowlands

of Sumatra are a biologically rich area of rainforest which contains

a small number of elephants. Proposed as a nature reserve as far

back as 1983, progress has been made towards achieving that goal.

The Ministry of Forestry has decided to withdraw some logging

concession in the area of the proposed Seberida Nature Reserve

in east&#173;central Sumatra, and to move immediately toward establishing

a new national park, Bukit Tigapuluh. WWF is looking at ways to

speed up the process of declaring it a protected area and developing

an integrated conservation/development project involving local

communities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Nepal <BR>

</B>WWF has been involved for many years in helping to develop,

protect, and manage Nepal's national parks and reserves. Under

the `Operation Tiger' banner, WWF has funded activities in Royal

Chitwan National Park, Royal Sukhla Phanta Wildlife Reserve and

Royal Bardia National Park which all contain small numbers of

elephants. The wild population of elephants in Nepal is about

70 and these animals are scattered in three areas in eastern,

central, and far western Nepal. WWF has no specific elephant project

in Nepal but it aids conservation of elephants indirectly in most

reserves through its institutional support programme and park

management assistance. WWF has been supporting species and habitat

conservation in Bardia National Park, as in Chitwan, since 1973.

So far, over US$200,00 has been allocated for conservation activities

in Bardia. WWF has also developed, in close cooperation with the

King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), and the Parks

Department, a community&#173;based sustainable development and

biological diversity conservation programme with a budget, in

1994&#173;1997, of around US$150,000. In addition, WWF has developed,

as part of the Biodiversity Conservation Network, a consortium

made up of WWF, the Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources

Institute, a project that will eventually involve 60,000 subsistence

farmers living around Chitwan.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Bhutan<BR>

<IMG SRC="img00006.gif"><B><BR>

<BR><BR><BR></B></B>WWF has been associated with conservation in Bhutan since

1977 and currently has a range of projects concerned with community

awareness and conservation education. Technical and other assistance

to the Forestry Services Division, which oversees Bhutan's protected

areas, is also playing an important role in protecting elephant

habitat. Assistance, amounting to US$500,000, has been given to

Royal Manas National Park for years under Operation Tiger.<BR>

<BR>

All the existing wild elephant populations in Bhutan are found

along the border with India, in several forest reserves and wildlife

sanctuaries, the most famous being Royal Manas National Park.

Traditionally, elephants have made seasonal migrations in the

wet summer months out of Bhutan's forests in the Himalayan foothills,

to India's grasslands. As the grasslands mature and dry out they

return to their winter range in Bhutan. Now these movements are

blocked by human settlements and are no longer possible in many

areas. The estimated population of wild elephants in Bhutan in

1990 was 60 to 150. However, recent estimates are between 2,000

to 3,000. This sharp increase does not represent a drastic rise

in numbers. These elephants are migrant populations and can be

found either in Bhutan or India depending on the season and food

availability. It is thought that as many 3,000 elephants spend

the summer in Bhutan, most of which migrate to Phibsoo Wildlife

Sanctuary, Khaling, and the Royal Manas National Park, which is

contiguous with the Manas Tiger Reserve in India. Only Manas is

large enough to hold a resident elephant population. Royal Manas

is the oldest protected area in Bhutan, having been set up in

1966 as a Wildlife Sanctuary and upgraded to National Park status

in 1988. So far, WWF has allocated about US$500,000 for Manas

to help the Forestry Services Division establish a basic infrastructure,

construction of guard posts, patrol roads, staff housing trails,

watch towers, water holes, demarcation of park boundaries, and

provision of field equipment. WWF's current project which focuses

on finalizing and helping implement a long term management plan

for Royal Manas National Park, including biodiversity assessment,

mapping distribution and density and activities with communities

living adjacent to the park, has a budget of around US$500,000

for 1995&#173;1998. In addition, WWF has budgeted nearly US$70,000

for institutional support for Bhutan's Forestry Services Division

from 1995 to 1997. WWF's anti&#173;poaching programm has been

allocated US$20,190 for 1995&#173;1996<BR>

.<BR>

<B>Vietnam <BR>

</B>For over a decade WWF has been actively involved in conservation

activities in Vietnam beginning with assistance in helping the

country develop its <I>National Conservation Strategy</I> and

researching the environmental effects of war. In June 1995, WWF

and the Ministry of Forestry convened an elephant workshop, inviting

representatives from 15 provinces with wild elephant populations.

The workshop produced a draft Elephant Action Plan for Vietnam

elephant populations, whose estimated numbers have been reduced

by 75 per cent in the last 25 years. WWF began survey work of

elephants and other large mammals in Vietnam in 1990 under a Biodiversity

Conservation Studies Project for which over US$200,000 has been

spent to support Vietnamese and international scientists. Specific

elephant surveys in the past few years have revealed that there

may be as few as 300 to 400 elephants remaining, mainly in isolated

forest pockets that are shrinking rapidly. In 1991&#173;1992 WWF

funded a feasibility study and training programme on translocation

techniques, but no successful translocation of elephants has taken

place in Vietnam yet. In fact, some 15 elephants died through

a failed attempt undertaken independently by a private Singapore

company to move an isolated herd in 1993. Vietnam is hoping that

it can generate support for its Elephant Action Plan and the critically

endangered species whose greatest threat in Vietnam is loss of

its forest habitat. Recent reports indicate male elephants are

being poached for ivory and other products.<BR>

<br>


uccessful conservation of elephants will inevitably

result in conservation of biodiversity over their vast range.

The key to securing the elephant's survival and resulting biodiversity

conservation in Asia is entirely in human hands. Conservation

programmes which reconcile the needs of elephants and people are

of the utmost priority. The escalating and fierce competition

between Asia's growing human population and elephants - who are

battling for the same living space - will inevitably increase

unless the problem is assessed and dealt with on a systematic

basis. Conservation of the elephant's traditional habitat - tropical

forests - is critical not only for the elephant and its very important

role of maintaining biological diversity, but also for the people

themselves, who depend on the woodlands as a watershed as well

as a source of wood, fuel, food, and other forest products. In

many cases the forest has already been cleared, irrigation schemes

introduced, dams built, crops planted, or grazing introduced.

Elephants often find themselves migrating through an area formerly

covered in vegetation and now occupied by people, farms, or even

concrete. Confrontation, often resulting in death on both sides,

is inevitable - but avoidable.<BR>

<BR>

<FONT FACE="Courier New">Scientists who have worked for WWF and

IUCN in elephant conservation for years, including the Executive

Officer of IUCN/SSC's Asian Elephant Specialist Group, Dr Charles

Santiapillai, and Mangala de Silva, of the University of Peradeniya

in Sri Lanka, point out in the introduction of their country's

recently published Elephant Action Plan, that &quot;without timely

action, backed by strong political will and local understanding

and financial support, the elephant population is at risk of becoming

locally extinct in a number of areas in Sri Lanka...the emphasis

is...on accommodating elephants and human beings rather than simply

protecting the elephants in their habitat. Man and elephant in

Sri Lanka have to live together by mutual adjustment&quot;. <BR>

<BR>

This philosophy underpins and exemplifies the approach that needs

to be taken as the highest priority throughout Asia and one which

has been taken by India and is expected to be undertaken as part

of Vietnam's Elephant Action Plan.<BR>

<BR>

However, the current international economic situation places stress

on countries with elephants or range states which have little

capacity (small or shrinking conservation budgets) to manage resources

in their borders or to enforce national and international legislation.

Often, the political will to conserve elephants in range states

exists, but financial support is inadequate. In order to combat

these problems and to ensure harmony between humans and elephants

the following steps must be carried out immediately:<BR>

<BR>

<B>1. Assessing, controlling and reducing human/elephant conflicts

<BR>

</B>Surveys and sociological studies need to be carried out throughout

the elephant's range to document recent human&#173;elephant conflicts,

notably deaths and injuries on both sides. Methods and techniques

to minimize these often deadly encounters need to be tested and

implemented. Where they are not effective, alternatives must be

developed. A variety of options suitable to each geographic area

need to be examined.<BR>

<BR>

<B>2. Setting priorities and developing strategies<BR>

</B>The Asian Elephant Action Plan prepared by the Asian Elephant

Specialist Group aims at conserving as many elephants as possible,

throughout their range, while minimizing conflict with people.

<BR>

<BR>

Because of the continued increase in human populations and the

need for land for agriculture and settlement, the action plan

recognizes that it will not be possible to save all Asia's wild

elephants, but losses can be minimized if economic development

takes into account the needs of elephants, and elephant conservation

plans take into consideration the needs of local people. To this

end, the action plan calls for national conservation strategies

to include provision for elephants, and for the development of

specific National Elephant Conservation and Management Strategies.

Existing national elephant action plans should be reviewed and

revised as appropriate and necessary.<BR>

<BR>

<B>3. Scientific status surveys to establish elephant presence

and numbers using standardized methods<BR>

</B>Scientific surveys are necessary throughout the elephant's

remaining range. Such surveys should note the condition of the

habitat, including important food sources and water availability.

Monitoring should follow to establish trends in elephant numbers

and habitat condition. Reviews of completed and ongoing surveys

should be carried out, and priorities established for future study.

These studies should result in management plans and local policies,

with mechanisms and means for implementation.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4. Networks of protected areas linked by corridors<BR>

</B>Ideally, every country in Asia should develop a network of

protected areas for elephants, linking them, whenever possible,

by corridors which provide for migration. However, it must be

recognized that in many countries elephants live in isolated patches

of forests which cannot be linked because of forest loss and agricultural

settlement. Because many of the surviving elephants live in forests

which protect water supplies for large regions of human settlement,

the protected areas can make an important contribution to human

welfare. The protected forests around reservoirs can serve as

elephant refuges, while the presence of the elephants serve as

indicators of these forest catchment areas. Local and national

governments should recognize the mutual benefit of maintaining

watersheds and conserving elephants and other species in these

life&#173;sustaining, product&#173;providing forest habitats.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>5. Managed Elephant Ranges (outside protected areas) and land

use planning<BR>

</B>Elephants are wide&#173;ranging animals, and it is not possible

in present circumstances to set aside sufficiently large reserves

for them. A compromise is needed by which &quot;Managed Elephant

Ranges&quot;, shared by people, are established. In these areas,

human activities compatible with elephant conservation could be

allowed, but priority would be given to managing and protecting

the area for the elephants. Where elephant range is fragmented,

former links should be rehabilitated to provide corridors through

which herds may travel. Wide&#173;ranging environmental education

programmes should be carried out in &quot;Managed Elephant Reserves&quot;.

Particular outreach should be to settlers who have never before

co&#173;existed or lived in close proximity with elephants.<BR>

<BR>

<B>6. Mapping - Geographic Information Systems/Ground&#173;truthing

<BR>

</B>Maps using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) should be

used to determine amount, quality, and type of remaining forest

cover. Information should be ground&#173;truthed and made use

of in planning elephant reserves and corridors. GIS is a useful

tool that can help identify potential areas of human/elephant

conflict through examination of satellite imagery of land use

patterns and density.<BR>

<BR>

<B>7. Protect people and crops and compensate for losses<BR>

</B>Assistance should be given to agricultural communities to

protect their crops when elephants are in the area. A belt of

crops which are unattractive to elephants, such as tea, can serve

as a barrier, particularly if it lacks the water they crave. Trenches,

steep&#173;sided canals and high&#173;voltage electric fencing

can also keep elephants away. Special teams can play an important

role by monitoring herd movements and organizing crop protection.

Compensation for damage can be provided on a limited basis, but

is not a satisfactory long&#173;term solution to problems of elephant

depredation. Existing compensation plans should be regularly reviewed,

and where possible crop insurance schemes established.<BR>

<BR>

<B>8. Elephant drives or <I>cautious</I> translocation<BR>

</B>Translocation can in some circumstances save elephants pocketed

in unsuitable areas, provided suitable habitat is available elsewhere.

Herds have been successfully driven overland to other habitats

in India, Sri Lanka, and Sumatra. In Malaysia, translocations

have been successful. However, in most instances, elephants have

returned to their original habitat. In Sumatra, Thai&#173;Indonesian

cooperation has resulted in the translocation of rogue elephants

to an Elephant Training Centre. However, translocation is costly

and has sometimes resulted in the death of elephants and humans.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>9. Anti&#173;poaching<BR>

</B>Elephants, especially tuskers, need to be protected from poachers

by well&#173;equipped teams which continually monitor the movements

of vulnerable animals. Undercover intelligence networks, in collaboration

with police and other civil authorities, can assist in tackling

poaching threats by obtaining information about poachers' activities

and illegal trade networks. Appropriate technology and radio&#173;telemetry,

wireless communications and village policing informant units can

improve protection of wild elephants inside and outside protected

areas.<BR>

<BR>

<B>10. Enforcing CITES and internal legislation<BR>

</B>All countries with elephants should enforce the regulations

of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species

of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Asian elephant has been on

Appendix I, which bans international commerce, ever since the

convention's inception in 1975. Existing national legislation

should be reviewed, and strengthened where necessary. Special

undercover investigation and monitoring of illegal trade in elephant

products should be undertaken in close cooperation with TRAFFIC

offices in Asia. Exit points such as airports and border crossings

should be reviewed and monitored closely. Penalties should be

strong enough to deter smuggling, and all customs officials should

be trained in identifying wildlife and wildlife products.<BR>

<BR>

<B>11. Captive breeding, not wild capture, for domestication<BR>

</B>Domesticated elephant populations should be maintained, as

far as possible, by captive breeding. Where capture of wild elephants

is necessary, improved methods which minimize risks to the elephants

should be used. Data should be maintained and analyzed on the

biology of elephants in captivity in order to support conservation

of elephants in the wild. Exchange of elephants and expertise

between countries such as the successful cooperation between Thailand

and Indonesia should be encouraged.<BR>

<BR>

<B>12. Improving census and monitoring techniques<BR>

</B>Scientific research must be carried out on census techniques;

monitoring of sex and age ratios in the wild; effectiveness of

protected areas and the corridors linking them; habitat evaluation;

the effects of translocation; and improved methods of distinguishing

Asian and African ivory.<BR>

The two standard census methods endorsed by the Asian Elephant

Specialist Group should be used to enable repeatability and comparability.

Determination of home ranges on an annual basis using radio&#173;telemetry

is another option.<BR>

<BR>

<B>13. Environmental impact assessments<BR>

</B>Evaluation of the environmental impact of economic development

projects in elephant ranges should be carried out well in advance

so that adverse impacts can be avoided and the interests of elephants

and people provided for.<BR>

<BR>

<B>14. Conservation awareness, education, and campaigns<BR>

</B>Public education programmes should disseminate factual and

reliable information about elephants, and, in particular, increase

the understanding of elephant behaviour and needs in areas where

elephants and people coexist. This includes communicating the

tangible benefits of elephant conservation, provision of employment

in fire&#173;control, enlisting villagers to manage and utilize

forests in a sustainable way, and to restore and replant when

possible. Wildlife clubs, schools, local NGOs, community based

organizations should be enlisted to develop and participate in

publicity campaigns aimed at households, decision (policy) makers,

police, non&#173;wildlife forest managers, the business community,

and developers.<BR>

<BR>

<B>15. Coordination of Asian elephant conservation<BR>

</B>Elephant conservation units could be established in regions

determined to be of highest conservation priority. These could

include rangers or wildlife officers, veterinarians experienced

in tranquillization or translocation techniques, elephant trainers

experienced in elephant drives or elephant warding off techniques,

communication or education officers, wildlife biologists or scientific

officers, and administrative staff.<BR>

<BR>

<B>16. Community development - return of revenue<BR>

</B>Communities living in proximity to elephants should ideally

benefit from their presence. Where protected areas exist, long&#173;term

residents can be hired as trackers, rangers, elephant drivers,

and trainers at fair pay scales comparable to those employees

hired from outside the region. Furthermore, long&#173;term residents

could also be trained and employed in protected area management,

thus providing the opportunity of combining traditional knowledge

and modern and sound conservation methods. If tourism generates

income, this revenue could be shared among the communities through

a direct percentage of return or through employment in the tourist

industry. Revenue generated from eco&#173;tourism or other small&#173;scale

businesses could provide some, but  - realistically speaking -

probably not all of the following: improvements in drinking water

quality (provision of wells and sanitation), health care centres,

establishment of schools and conservation clubs, alternative energy

sources, improved agricultural methods and training in these,

replanting schemes, regulated grazing or use of forest products,

and classes or village workshops in understanding elephant behaviour.

<BR>

 <BR>

The former could be paid for through revenues from wildlife recreation

or nature tourism or through local or national agencies committed

to the survival of the Asian elephant as a necessary and integral

part of the country's biological and cultural diversity. Elephants

will have increasing difficulty surviving in areas of rapidly

growing human population, particularly in close proximity to communities

that are impoverished and that are constantly threatened by crop

depredation and death. Villagers will understandably poach elephants

for their tusks, hide, or meat if the above conditions are not

improved. Elephants are poisoned or shot by disgruntled villagers

in order to prevent crop damage or trampling of family members

and homes.<BR>

<BR>

If the elephant is seen as a source of income and welfare, a symbol

of what the forest has to offer in terms of what products and

uses it can yield, only then will it survive. Its future on the

planet is in the hands of the people with whom it has lived side

by side for thousands of years.<BR>

<P>

The world is in the grip of a fisheries crisis that transcends political boundaries and affects north and south alike. Nearly everywhere, fisheries that have sustained coastal communities for generations have suffered catastrophic declines. In some areas, excessive fishing has driven staple species such as the Atlantic cod and the Atlantic halibut to commercial extinction.
<P>


The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that 70 per cent of the world's commercially important marine fish stocks are either fully fished, overexploited, deleted, or slowly recovering. Gone forever are the historical estimates that marine catches could top 500 million metric tons per year. Without doubt, we have exceeded the limit of the seas.
<P>


To make matters worse, evidence is mounting that modern fisheries significantly affect the physical environment of the oceans and represent a serious threat to marine biological diversity. According to the FAO, indiscriminate fishing practices kill and waste between 18 and 40 million metric tonnes of unwanted fish, seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals, and other ocean life annually-fully one-third of the world catch. Unsustainable, `dirty' fishing has become an industrial addiction.
<P>


Attempting to bolster a faltering industry, governments pay US$54 billion per year to subsidize catches worth just US$70 billion. These payments sustain massive fishing fleets that `hoover' up fish at an alarming rate. Sophisticated vessels, mostly from developed countries that have overfished their own waters, now plunder the fishing grounds of developing countries, offering foreign exchange in return for fishing rights. Presently, more than 25 per cent of the fish caught by the European Community is taken from outside its home waters. Northern countries routinely tempt developing nations into opening up their coastal fisheries to overexploitation.
<P>


Increasingly volatile `fish wars' have erupted all over the globe as fishing fleets clash over the remnants of rapidly declining stocks. In early 1995, Canadian officials touched off a transatlantic `turbot war' by seizing a Spanish trawler caught fishing illegally on the Grand Banks just outside Canada's 200-mile limit. Gunfire is a regular feature of fisheries disputes among Southeast Asian nations, and violent acts occur in territorial waters around the globe. In India, traditional fishers in Kerala state, angry at the decline of coastal fisheries, burned 14 trawlers, seized four others, and held a vessel owner hostage. In the Barents Sea, Norway's coastguard fired warning shots and slashed the nets of Icelandic trawlers fishing too close to an island over which Norway claims jurisdiction. 
<P>


Throughout modern history, governments have largely managed marine fisheries for the growth and development of their commercial fishing industries. Decision makers have paid scant attention to the sustainability of ocean fisheries, much less to the health of their associated ecosystems or the needs of artisanal fishers exploiting the same species. In virtually every case, the short-term social and economic needs of a region's fishing industry have rendered long-term sustainability of catches a futile management goal. Governments have typically devised politically-expedient `solutions' and then described them as environmentally necessary. These efforts have mostly been too little, too late. Management actions that might have prevented the disastrous collapse of fisheries, but which carried a price unacceptable to industry, have been scrupulously avoided.
<P>


Many species have fallen victim to this vicious circle of overexploitation and mismanagement. Among the hardest hit have been the large pelagic (ocean-wandering) predators: tunas, swordfish, marlins and sharks-the `lions and tigers of the sea'. These magnificent animals include the largest of all bony fishes, which migrate over vast distances at speeds that can, on occasion, exceed 110 kph. Overfishing has reduced spawning populations of many of these species by more than 80 per cent in the past two decades.
<P>


Of the 13 species of tunas, those of the genus Thunnus are subjected to the most intensive commercial fishing. The two largest, northern and southern bluefin tuna, have suffered steep declines in the past two decades. The spawning population of northern bluefin in the western Atlantic, for example, has fallen by nearly 90 per cent since 1975. The species' red, oily flesh is much prized in Japan for gourmet sushi and sashimi. A large, top quality bluefin can fetch more than US$30,000 dockside, sell at auction in Tokyo's Tsukigi fish market for US$60,000, and cost US$200 a plate at the sushi bar. Big bluefin are now so profitable it has become common practice to use spotter planes to locate them. Fishers may spend weeks hunting down just a few individuals. The bluefin is truly an `ocean-going Porsche'-as heavy, fast, and valuable as the sports car.
<P>


Billfish, so-called after the long, spear-like projection of the upper jaw, range over vast distances in tropical and temperate waters. They include the sailfish, marlins, spear fish, and swordfish. Large numbers of billfish are killed by commercial fisheries, either as target species or as incidental bycatch in tuna and shark fisheries. In the Atlantic, spawning populations of these species have fallen dramatically since 1980 and continue to decline.
<P>



The gold rush mentality seen in many fisheries is also pervasive in the world's shark fisheries. Every year, millions of sharks are hunted for their fins, meat, skin, and cartilage, while many more are caught and killed as bycatch in fisheries targeting other species. Still worshipped as gods of the sea in some maritime cultures, sharks are feared and hunted for sport or profit in others. Their unique life histories-most are slow to mature, bear live young and have low reproductive potential-make them a fragile resource, extremely vulnerable to overexploitation. Historically, every large-scale directed shark fishery has ended in collapse, but global exploitation and trade remain virtually unregulated. The international trade in fins for shark-fin soup, a popular delicacy in east Asia, now poses perhaps the greatest threat to sharks.
<P>


Conservationists have responded to the growing crisis in marine fisheries by seeking to strengthen laws and treaties and bolster government action. However, the northern fishing industry, dependent on a steady income to sustain boat mortgages and marginal businesses, has steadfastly resisted change. Thanks in part to this political stalemate, the decline of world fisheries has proven virtually impossible to reverse. The history of fishery management is replete with spectacular failures, and managers have been unable to prevent the `mining' of most commercially exploited fish populations.
<P>


In 1995, to help alleviate this global crisis, WWF launched a new, three-year effort known as the Endangered Seas Campaign to promote the conservation and sustainable use of marine fisheries worldwide. WWF will invest nearly US$1 million per year to reverse the effects of unsustainable fishing on marine fishes and the ocean ecosystems on which they depend. The campaign will work to build the necessary political will around the world to end chronic overfishing, restore devastated fisheries, improve management schemes, and reduce the use of destructive fishing practices.
<P>


Fisheries are the last major world industry exploiting wild natural resources for food. Only a series of fundamental reforms of contemporary management, coupled with heightened public interest and powerful economic incentives, will bring chronic overfishing to a halt and shift the paradigm of fishery management from development and exploitation to conservation and sustainability. If we are to save marine fishes-both as an important source of food and a vital component of ocean ecosystems-we must bring to bear the same worldwide public concern that drove the international community to protect the great whales, tigers, and elephants. This increased public support, together with powerful market forces, must be used to create social, economic, and political incentives for fishing that is both sustainable and lean. That won't be easy, fish neither "sing" like whales nor look like pandas, but the stakes are high: the future of world fisheries, their associated marine ecosystems, and the millions of people who depend on them for food and employment.

<h1><font color="#3333ff">2. Gods of the sea</font></h1>
</center>

<hr size=1 noshade>


Large sea animals, whether fish or marine mammals, have always been creatures of awe and 

inspiration. They are embodied in cultures and religions all over the world. Images of sharks, 

porpoises, swordfish, seals, and whales, adorn palaces, temples, and homes on every continent. In 

the Bible, it is written that Jonah was swallowed by a leviathan, or a whale, and in his world-famous 

novel, <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I>, Ernest Hemingway romanticized the marlin, one of the ocean's 

giants. 


Many fishing families in developing countries still pray to gods of the sea for protection at small 

private altars or shrines before setting out on the water. They often seek immunity from the shark, 

which in many societies evokes terror. But for a number of peoples, even those who fear its attack, 

it is respected as a top predator and worshipped as a god. In Hawaii, for example, the shark is 

known as an <I>aumakua</I>, or 'guardian god of a family' into which it is hoped that a child of the shark 

god will be born. In Hawaiian legend, it is an honour for a dead person to return as a shark, an 

animal that reportedly helps drowning people safely to shore, goes fishing with humans and shares 

the catch, kills enemies, and protects families from other sharks.
<P>


Similar legends are still told among many fishing peoples in the Pacific to this day. In the Solomon Islands, caves have been carved out for this god of the sea, and in Vietnam, where the whale shark is known as Lord fish, its bones are taken to selected 
temples and given sacred burials. In the 

Solomon Islands, elders or shamans engage in "shark calling." After attracting the sharks, they 

swim with them. In effect, so do avid snorkelers and scuba-divers, often seeking sharks out. The 

legends vary however, and in some cultures the shark is a demon, both worshipped and feared as 

the ruler of the seas. The constellation of Orion, as it was named by the Greeks, is to the Warran 

people of South America a cluster of stars depicting a man's leg bitten off by a shark. To the 

bathers and surfers off the coast of Australia, in what are considered to be some of the most 

dangerous shark waters in the world, the image of a shark is chilling, especially in areas where they 

are not held back from shore by a system of nets.
<P>


Fish worship is by no means limited to the shark. In Japan, the shark is an important mythological 

figure, paid homage to as the god of the storms or the shark-man, <I>Same-Hito</I>. The Japanese have 

also built a Buddhist shrine in honour of the red snapper. Around 700 years ago they created a 

marine sanctuary which prohibits fishing for this species. Japanese legend varies; some say that at 

the birth of the holy Buddhist monk Nichiren-shonin, schools of red snapper exhibited unusual 

schooling behaviour. The numbers were massive and the waters red with their brightly coloured 

bodies. Some people believe that a huge red snapper saved the life of the venerable Buddhist monk 

by carrying him safely to shore. In Japan, the red snapper has been declared a "natural monument", and a temple erected in the monk's honour on the shore near the site of his birth. Upon entering the 

area, visitors are greeted by a huge sculpture of a red snapper.
<P>


Like the villagers of Tainoura in Japan, the Squamish people of the Pacific Northwest welcomed 

their visitors with the image of a wooden statue in the likeness of the Salmon Chief. Carved in the 

statue is the legend of "why the salmon came to the waters of the Squamish people". The tale 

describes how one of four brothers transformed himself into a salmon in order to entice fellow fish 

into the waters of the Squamish, how subsequent salmon feasts were shared, and how what is 

gained from the sea must be returned. It is a parable of generosity and giving. Along a similar line 

of philosophy, but from a distant part of the globe, one of Germany's best loved fairy tales describes 

the wisdom of a fish and the lessons he teaches a fishing couple about the pitfalls of greed. Given 

the state of the world's fisheries today, humankind seems to have ignored the ancient lessons of its 

ancestors and has forgotten many stories and beliefs that today are still shared among small-scale fishers.
<BR>

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Early Fishing Peoples</B></font><P>

<P>


The first semi-sedentary fishing people known to anthropologists lived along the coast of the Baltic 

Sea some 10,000 years ago. The main diet of the Maglemosians, who lived during the Mesolithic 

and then into the Neolithic period, consisted of wild plants and shellfish gathered from the coastal 

marshes and bogs rimming the Baltic. In addition to fish hooks and serrated harpoon tips fashioned 

from bone, they also left behind huge shellfish mounds and the remains of the first coastal 

boardwalks. In warmer climates, fishing societies were well established at the mouth of the Nile 

some 8,000 years ago and in Japan and Peru some 5,000 years ago. The first documented `fish 

crisis' due to overfishing occurred along the coast of Peru between 3000 and 1000 BC. 

Anthropologist James R McGoodwin suggests that the sequence of events probably happened like 

this: "First, a climatological catastrophe such as the El Nino phenomenon caused a sudden and 

widespread reduction in marine resource supplies along the coast; second, the large sedentary and 

concentrated populace that had been accustomed to relying heavily on these resources, probably 

attempted to exploit them at their usual levels...". This would have prevented recovery of the 

stocks and led to a collapse of their fishery. The flourishing society had no choice but to find other 

terrestrial food sources and to stop fishing, or at least sharply reduce the levels at which they were 

fishing. This seems logical, and McGoodwin says the Peruvians probably did just that, developing a 

"passive strategy of fisheries management". Mexico's Olmec civilization, which began around 800 

BC in coastal zones along the Gulf, and societies located north of Mexico in California, also left 

behind evidence that they practiced fisheries management. However, other societies, some of which 

were living along the coast of California, fished themselves into oblivion. Disastrous declines in 

salmon fisheries caused by aboriginal peoples along the northern coast of California have also been 

confirmed, while overhunting of dolphins for their teeth in the Solomon Islands, and serious 

depletions of marine resources by indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Hawaii, the Aleutian 

archipelago, and the Caroline islands of Micronesia, to name a few, have also been recorded. Like 

the modern fisheries of today, some pre-modern peoples managed their fisheries resources and 

survived, while others depleted them so seriously that they brought about their own cultural 

extinction.

<TITLE>The rise and Fall of Modern fisheries</TITLE>

<P>


Early pre-industrial fisheries management probably resulted from trial and error and hard lessons learned among fishing societies. Human population density was low, fish were abundant, fishing areas were large, and capture methods were rudimentary and inefficient. Regulation of fisheries was born out of necessity and not because early peoples were natural conservationists. For the most part, people considered that fish supplies were infinite until they discovered otherwise and were forced to manage them. But this belief that the sea is boundless, that the cornucopia of the ocean will never be empty, still pervades many fishing societies today whether they fish from dowls (handwoven basket-like boats) or trawlers and factory ships the size of football fields.

<P>

This blinkered thinking was shaped by authorities such as the Dutch lawyer Hugo Grotius, the father of international law. In 1609 he wrote "Everyone admits that if a great many persons hunt on the land or fish in a river, the forest is easily exhausted of wild animals and the river of fish, but such a contingency is impossible in the case of the sea". This short-sightedness was further promulgated more than two centuries later by the eminent British scientist Thomas Huxley who stated in 1883, "I believe that the cod fishery, the herring fishery, the pilchard fishery, the mackerel fishery, and probably all the great sea-fisheries are inexhaustible; that is to say, nothing we can do seriously affects the number of fish". 
<P>

Within a decade, a Select Committee of the English House of Commons voiced its concern over the scarcities of fish in the North Atlantic and North Sea fisheries. In 1899, following six years of discussions between North American and European nations over dwindling fish supplies, Sweden hosted one of the world's first global fish conferences. This meeting led to the creation of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1902, the principal body that helps set policy for North Atlantic and North Sea fisheries. The hard lessons that coastal fishing communities had learned over centuries were soon to be rediscovered by industrial fisheries working on the `limitless seas'. Sad to say, they ignored the lessons of the past for nearly a century. The world's marine fish catch peaked at about 85 million metric tonnes in 1989, and has been slowly declining ever since. At the turn of the century, the world marine catch was three million tonnes. The FAO estimates that if fish populations are allowed to recover, and are managed responsibly, about 100 million metric tonnes of fish could be caught annually on a sustainable basis. Instead, in the past two decades, the world has witnessed the collapse of one fishery after the other. Fish populations in four of the world's 17 major fishing regions are seriously depleted, while catches in nine others are declining. Only in the Indian Ocean, where the use of modern fishing methods is just beginning, is the marine catch on the increase.

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>THE STORY OF THE GRAND BANKS
</B></font><P>



When explorer John Cabot arrived on the Grand Banks off the coast of North America in 1500, he remarked that the area was so "swarming with fish (that they) could be taken not only with a net but in baskets let down with a stone". The rush for the Grand banks was on, and it continued off the coast of Canada and New England until the fisheries there were finally exhausted in 1993. After centuries of over-exploitation by sail, then steam, then gasoline and diesel-powered fishing vessels, stocks of Atlantic cod have reached their lowest levels ever, and haddock and other species declared commercially extinct. In 1993, the Canadian cod fishery was shut down off the Grand Banks, more than 40,000 jobs were lost, and US$1.8 billion in unemployment benefits were paid to the fishers.
<P>

	The reckless pattern among shell fishers was no better. Settlers plundered and polluted New England's Chesapeake Bay. Like John Cabot, the early European arrivals were overjoyed by the plentitude of oysters, and initially collected many of them using the sustainable techniques taught to them by the Algonquin Indians. But by 1860, these methods had long been discarded and a record number of oysters were landed, weighing some 52.2 million kg. By 1962, overfishing of oysters and sewage contamination had taken their toll on the bay, and only 6.6 million kg of oysters were landed. But fishing continued unabated until the mid-1980s when only a fragment of the original abundance of oysters remained. As McGoodwin points out, "What is fascinating - and also tragic -about the fishery industry is that it so actively participates in its own annihilation".

Among the various species of sharks, tunas, and billfish are some that are truly giants, reaching half a metric tonne or more. These great fish are almost all nomadic, undertaking epic migrations in search of prey and returning thousands of kilometres to 

breed in ancestral spawning areas. For hundreds of millions of years these huge predators have reigned supreme, as essential to the healthy functioning of marine ecosystems as the great cats are to the African savannas. But the ocean giants are in decline

. Ironically, the highly migratory nature of large pelagic fish makes them particularly vulnerable to overexploitation; if they are not fished at one stage of their life in one place, they will be caught later elsewhere. Because they frequent 

international waters as well as passing through the coastal zones of many nations in the course of their migrations, their survival hinges on a wide range of factors, from the integrity of individual fishers to enforcement of national fishing policies and 

international cooperation.

<H3>Tunas - Porsches of the Seas</H3>
<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Northern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus)
</B>
</font><P>


Big, fast, and valuable, a large northern bluefin tuna measures three metres long, weighs more than 600kg, and can accelerate to speeds of up to 80 kph. The bluefin's red oily flesh is much prized in Japan for gourmet sushi and sashimi, commanding 
enormous prices in the Tokyo fish markets. A large bluefin which can fetch over US$30,000 on the dockside, will sell at a Tokyo auction for US$60,000, and cost the customer US$200 a plate at a sushi bar. Eighty-five percent of Japan's bluefin tuna 
imports come from the Pacific, Indian, and eastern Atlantic Oceans, but Atlantic bluefins reach a greater size than those in 
the Pacific and are the most sought-after. <P>


Of the 13 species of tunas, those belonging to the genus <I>Thunnus</I> are subjected to the most intensive commercial fishing. The bluefin tunas, <I>T. thynnus </I>(northern bluefin), and <I>T. maccoyi<I></I></I> (southern bluefin) have suffered dramatic
declines in the past few decades.
<P>


Northern bluefin are pelagic but often frequent shallow coastal waters. Highly mobile, they make seasonal migrations which appear to be tied to spawning behaviour, water temperature, and prey concentrations. Tagged northern bluefin have travelled 7,770km 

across the Atlantic in 119 days - an average distance of 65km per day. Bluefin are social animals, forming large `peer' schools in which individuals of similar size are found together.
<P>


Current data suggests that although there are two populations of northern bluefin in the Atlantic, there is only a single population in the Pacific, spawning in the western part of the ocean around Japan, and between Japan and the Philippines. At 

different stages of life, parts of this population migrate to the eastern Pacific but the extent and significance of these movements is not known. In the eastern Pacific, bluefin migrate northward from Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska. In the western Pacific

, around Japan, they migrate north in summer and south in winter, and are found as far south as the Philippines.
<P>


In the western Atlantic, giant northern bluefin arrive in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico to spawn in January. Here they remain until June, migrating north for another feeding season off New England and maritime Canada after spawning is completed. 
Only one other spawning ground - in the Mediterranean - is known for Atlantic bluefin.
<BR>
<BR>


<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>NORTHERN BLUEFIN IN THE ATLANTIC-A HISTORY OF MISMANAGEMENT</B>
</font><P>


Atlantic tunas have been under the management jurisdiction of the International Commission for the conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)since it was established in 1966. ICCAT's 21 member countries include the major fishing nations with their powerful 
vested interests, so perhaps it is not surprising that the commission's efforts to manage bluefin have been largely unsuccessful. Conservationists have accused ICCAT of procrastination at best, and malign neglect due to conflicts of interest at worst. Although ICCAT has recommended specific quotas for western Atlantic bluefin, it has never adopted a recovery target or schedule for bluefin tuna or any species.
<P>

	As far back as 1981, ICCAT's scientists were recommending drastically reduced catches of western Atlantic bluefin, but the commission chose instead to set quotas which have proved completely unsustainable. A catch of 2,660 metric tonnes imposed  in 1983 

remained in force until 1991, but bluefin populations continued their inexorable decline with no recovery in sight. A proposal by Sweden in 1991 to list the western Atlantic bluefin population on Appendix 1 of CITES, and thereby shut down international 
trade, was fiercely opposed at the 1992 CITES meeting by Japan, the USA, and Canada, together with lobbyists from the  tuna industry. Similarly, intense pressure led to the bluefin issue being completely withdrawn form the agenda of the 1994 CITES meeting.
<P>

	Under growing international criticism, ICCAT has recently agreed to some modest conservation measures, including a Statistical Document Programme that requires the monitoring of international trade in bluefin. In 1995, ICCAT asked its scientific 
committee for a new stock assessment and recovery options that could be taken for bluefin. These will be considered at the ICCAT annual meeting in late 1996.
<P>

	Today, ICCAT views the western and eastern Atlantic populations of bluefin as entirely separate and distinct. But recent studies suggest that there may be some mixing of the two - perhaps a 3 per cent west to east exchange across the Atlantic. However, 
it is still unclear whether individuals always return to their original spawning area to breed. This uncertainty has profound implications for conservation of bluefin in the western Atlantic. If some of the adults found in the western Atlantic are from the

 eastern population which return to the Mediterranean to spawn, then the actual breeding stock in the western Atlantic may be even lower than feared. ICCAT scientists will address this issue as part of the scheduled stock assessment and recovery planning 

exercise in 1996.

<dl>


Almost since its founding in 1961, WWF has been involved in the conservation of marine fishes and their associated ecosystems around the world. Some of WWF's earliest field projects involved working with coastal communities to promote sustainable use of 
fisheries in developing countries like the Philippines, Mexico, and Haiti. WWF helped establish marine reserves including El Nido in the Philippines and Sian Ka'an on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to help counter the effects of destructive fishing with 
explosives and provide nursery areas for lobsters and other marine life.
<P>


Overfishing, habitat destruction, bycatch or incidental killing of non-targeted fish species, and pollution are the major threats to fisheries and marine habitats in all regions in which WWF works. WWF supports a variety of projects that address marine 
and coastal conservation issues. These involve fisheries management, integrated coastal zone management, marine protected areas, coastal community development, the creation of regional strategies for marine and coastal conservation, the prevention of marine
pollution, and investigating illegal trade in marine species through the TRAFFIC Network.
<P>


The scale of WWF's activities in each of the regions varies and the following descriptions provide a brief overview of WWF's fisheries-related marine conservation work.

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Latin America and the Caribbean</B>
</font><P>


The marine conservation problems that beset Latin America and the Caribbean are vast and include every threat described above. WWF has chosen several focal countries in which to concentrate its activities. In the Greater Caribbean these are Mexico, Belize

, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, and Brazil.
<P>


WWF has been involved in conservation in the Greater Caribbean for more than 30 years. The region accounts for 13 per cent of the world's coral reefs, with many of its islands fringed by extensive underwater seagrass beds and mangrove forests. But 
development projects in the region threaten its fragile ecosystems and wildlife, and the local communities that rely on these natural resources for a living. In coastal regions, uncontrolled tourism is destroying key natural habitats. Poor waste treatment 
facilities from homes and hotels stunt, and sometimes kill coral reefs, causing beach erosion. Pollution is also threatening fisheries and tourism, the two most important foreign- exchange earners. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 
the Caribbean Sea now ranks among the world's most polluted and endangered seas. In the Eastern Caribbean, unregulated sand mining has damaged coastal areas.
<P>


WWF's activities in the Greater Caribbean include helping set up the Hol Chan Marine Reserve in Belize, promoting sustainable fishing activities at the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve and a maritime protected area project at Les Arcadins in Haiti. In
addition, to counter the effects of destructive fishing methods including dynamite fishing and the use of chemicals such as cyanide and bleach in collecting ornamental fish, WWF has launched a Coral Reef Conservation initiative throughout the Greater Caribbean 
region.
<P>


WWF was also closely involved in setting up the Miskito Cays Protected Area in Nicaragua - 1.3 million-hectares of coastline, lagoons, bays, and cays. WWF and other NGOs helped support the establishment of an indigenous community-based conservation 
organization, MIKUPIA (an acronym for Miskito heart). The Miskito Cays Protected Area Management Plan is being developed to 
create a community-supported and community-run protected area that will provide the Miskito people with diverse economic benefits.
<P>


WWF has a number of marine and coastal projects in Mexico, including the ongoing People-Centred Conservation and Development in the Yucatan Peninsula. The peninsula is comprised of two Biosphere Reserves, Calakmul and Sian Ka'an, the corridor of forest 
land between them, and the marine systems along the east coast of the peninsula. The greatest threat to Sian Ka'an is the expansion of tourism originating in the famous resort area of Cancun. WWF's partners in marine and coastal conservation in this project
are the Amigos of Sian Ka'an and another NGO, GEMA. WWF has helped these groups to create a reserve that will include an environmental education programme, sustainable fisheries and agriculture practices, and environmentally-friendly ecotourism. A 
portion of the world's second largest coral reef also reaches into the peninsula.
<P>


WWF's efforts to establish a Nature Conservation Fund in Mexico have received wide support. The Fund hopes to attract assets of US$100 million and plans to address overfishing among other conservation problems.
<P>

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Hispanic South America</B>
</font><P>
In neighbouring Hispanic South America, WWF has marine and coastal projects in eight countries including Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. One of the most challenging areas in which WWF has been working since 1987, is the
Choco biogeographic region of Colombia. This entire region is under threat by large-scale development, including extension of existing roads, establishment of a new Pacific Coast port, dam construction, and industrial fishing operations. The project's 
main goal is to promote conservation and sustainable development of the Utria Sound National Park and its buffer zone by strengthening and facilitating greater participation of local communities in the development of the region. The project will help 
establish the necessary infrastructure, train personnel, and develop park management systems to promote the sustainable management of the park and its fisheries. This 54,300-hectare protected area is considered one of the highest conservation priorities for the 
Pacific coast of Latin America, one of the richest areas of biodiversity on the planet.

<h1> <font color="#3333ff">6. The WWF Endangered Seas Campaign</font></h1>
</center>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>

<dl>

In late 1994, WWF recognized that much more needed to be done to reverse the global fisheries crisis. Accordingly, in mid-1995, WWF committed nearly US$1 million per year to a new, three-year campaign to promote the conservation and sustainable use of mar

ine fishes worldwide. The goal of WWF's Endangered Seas Campaign is to halt and reverse the effects of overfishing on marine fishes and the ocean ecosystems on which they depend. WWF is working to build the necessary political will around the world to end

 chronic overfishing, restore devastated fisheries, improve management regimes, and reduce the use of destructive fishing gear and practices. The campaign has three principal targets:

<p>
	
<ul type=circle>

<LI>To establish effective recovery plans for key threatened species-tunas, swordfish, marlins, and sharks-by the year 2000.
<P>

<LI>	To create social and economic incentives for sustainable fishing by the year 2000.
<P>

<LI>	To reduce or eliminate the bycatch of marine wildlife in commercial fishing operations by at least 50 per cent in each region by the year 2005.
<P>
<BR>

</UL>
</dl>

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Early Successes</B></font><P>


In late 1995, WWF's Endangered Seas Campaign scored its first major victory when the United Nations opened for signature a new treaty that will govern world fisheries. WWF staff worked hard for three years to strengthen the text of this new agreement 
before it was adopted. The agreement paves the way for more sustainable fisheries, especially those on the high seas. For example, it embodies the precautionary approach, which requires fishery managers facing uncertainty to err on the side of the fish rather
than the fishing industry. The new agreement also requires states to reduce bycatch, the wasteful killing of non-target species in commercial fisheries. WWF will be working to ensure that governments and regional organizations quickly ratify and 
implement the new treaty around the world.
<P>


In early 1996, WWF formed a conservation partnership with Unilever Corporation, a major buyer of frozen fish and manufacturer of the world's best known frozen fish products under such brands as Iglo, Birds Eye and Gorton's. The purpose of this partnership
is to create economic incentives for sustainable fishing by establishing an independent Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) (see box on page 28). WWF seeks a new approach to ensure more effective management of marine fisheries. Unilever is interested in 
long-term fish stock sustainability to secure a future for its successful fish business. The motivations are different, but the objective is shared: to ensure the long-term viability of global fish populations and the health of the marine ecosystems on which they depend.
<BR>
<BR>





<B>THE MARINE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL INITIATIVE</B><P>


Scheduled to be created sometime in 1997, the Marine Stewardship Council will be an independent, nonprofit, non-governmental membership body. The organization will establish a broad set of principles and criteria for sustainable fishing and set standards for 
individual fisheries. Only fisheries meeting these standards will be eligible for certification by independent, accredited certifying firms. Seafood companies will be encouraged to join  sustainable buyers' groups and make commitments to purchase 
fish products only from certified sources. Ultimately, products from MSC-certified fisheries will be marked with an on-pack 
logo. This will allow seafood consumers to select fish products that come from sustainable, well-managed sources.

	<P>


The MSC will be modeled on the successful Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), established by WWF, other conservation organizations, and the timber trade in 1993 to promote a market-led solution to the ongoing destruction of the world's forests. By the end 
of 1995, FSC-accredited companies had certified 20 forests comprising more than four million hectares as conforming to sustainable  forestry practices. Perhaps more important, more than 100 timber companies and retailers worldwide had made commitments to 
purchase only FSC-certified timber.
<P>


A detailed scoping exercise will be the first step in creating the MSC. The purpose of this study will be to explore how we can successfully adapt the FSC model to address the specific sustainability needs of marine fisheries. A team of consultants will 
undertake the initial effort, coordinated by an independent project manager. A steering committee, on which WWF, other conservation organizations, and seafood companies will serve, will oversee the activities of the project team. The team will combine 
expertise in certification (or "eco-labeling") schemes such as the FSC with intimate knowledge of the commercial fishing industry. Team members will consult with a broad range of experts representing all stakeholders in marine fisheries. Together, the team 
will draft the broad set of principles for sustainable fishing that will form the underpinning of the MSC. The team will draw on the standards and guidelines embodied in existing international agreements, such as the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fish
ing and the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. In addition, the team will enlist new information and expertise in the fields of conservation biology, economics, seafood marketing, and commercial viability to help move current thinking forward.
<P>


WWF and the steering group will circulate the results of the scooping exercise and draft principles to a broad spectrum of stakeholders in fisheries: conservationists, fishers, seafood industry officials, fishery managers, law-makers, etc. The steering 
group will then sponsor an open series of national and regional consultants and workshops around the world. The purpose of these workshops will be to refine and strengthen the principles and develop a process for international implementation.
<P>
The creation of the Marine Stewardship Council has the potential to significantly alter worldwide fishing practices in favour of more sustainable, less destructive fisheries. When leading seafood companies such as Unilever make commitments to buy their 
fish products only from well-managed and MSC-certified fisheries, they will compel the fishing industry to modify their current practices. Governments, laws, and treaties aside, market forces (corporate buying practices) will begin to determine the means 
of fish production.

<p>

<dl>


WWF is committed to reversing the crises in the world's fisheries. To acomplish this, we must develop long-term solutions that are environmentally necessary and then, through social and economic incentives, make them politically feasible. This will 
require harnessing public and industry support for a new paradigm of management. The foundation of this new model must be greater public involvement and corporate responsibility to foster better fishery management. Only concerted public interest and activism, 
together with market forces, have the power to stop overfishing and to shift the focus of fishery management from development and exploitation to conservation and sustainability.
<P>
<BR>

</UL>
</dl>
<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Priorities for Action</B></font><P>


WWF believes that the following steps will be essential and should be implemented immediately in order to speed up the transition to sustainable, well-managed, and ecologically-sound fisheries:<P>



<B>1. Strengthen national, regional, and international capacity to manage marine fishes</B>: Governments must allocate sufficient funds to develop the scientific and technical capabilities necessary to adequately manage their marine fisheries. Those 
nations suffering from a fishery management system rife with conflicts of interest must reform their laws. International commissions charged with managing shared fisheries and those on the high seas must immediately implement the provisions of the 1995 UN 
Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks & Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Among other things, this will require regional bodies to open their decision-making procedures to public scrutiny. Finally, fishery management at all levels must be relieved from sweeping political interference aimed at satisfying the short-term economic needs of fishers rather than the long-term requirements of fish populations and the marine ecosystem. To help ensure that these reforms are carried out, the United Nations should create a 
high-profile Global Oceans Forum to elevate fishery conservation and other ocean issues higher on the international political agenda.<P>



<B>2. Focus management programmes on limiting effort and restricting access to fisheries</B>: Past efforts at fishery management have been characterized by ineffective measures such as mesh-size restrictions and trip limits that simply attempt to 
legislate inefficiency. These techniques should be abandoned in favour of management schemes that limit fishing effort, especially in fisheries that are overfished or depleted. Effort should be reduced to levels consistent with sustainable fishing and the 
recovery of depleted species. Limited-access programmes should prevent new entry into fisheries that are fully subscribed and 
form a part of comprehensive management plans for each fishery. However, they should not be allowed to create private property rights in any fishery.
<P>



<B>3. Enact and implement recovery plans for depleted species:</B> Most overfished species, even those that have been severely depleted, are not subject to any kind of recovery plans. Fishery managers should as a matter of priority develop and implement 
effective recovery plans, including target population sizes and timetables for achieving them. The targets and pace of these plans should be driven primarily by the biological requirements of the fish populations involved, not the short-term demands of the
local fishing industry. Well-managed fisheries that are allowed to recover from past overfishing would help restore the vitality of the marine ecosystem and concurrently yield far more to fishers.
<P>


<B>4.Reduce and eliminate the subsidies that sustain commercial fisheries:</B>The US$54 billion in subsidies that are propping up unsustainable fisheries should be eliminated immediately, including those for shipbuilding and construction, refitting of 
fishing vessels, market research and development, industry bailouts, low-cost industry loans, and development of fisheries for so-called `underutilized' species. Where subsidies are provided, they should be part of a comprehensive plan for the future of the 
fishing industry, including decommissioning of fishing vessels and retraining of fishers, where necessary.
<P>


<B>5. Accelerate programmes for decommissioning excess fishing fleet capacity:</B> Overcapacity due to unbridled growth of the world's fishing fleets is one of the most serious problems facing marine fisheries today. At a minimum, funds for vessel 
buyback and decommissioning programmes should be increased as quickly as possible in order to expand these programmes to achieve an immediate reduction in fishing effort. Funding of future decommissioning programmes should be dictated by capacity-reduction 
targets specific to each fishery. Governments should make the appropriation of these funds a top priority in drawing up their annual fisheries budgets.
<P>


<B>6. Expand programmes for retraining fishers displaced by overfishing and effort limitation:</B> The legacy of past open-access fisheries is a population of fishers that far exceeds the number required to catch what fish are available. Many of these 
people have few skills or professional abilities other than fishing or fish processing. Retraining programmes are urgently needed in order to move displaced fishers into productive employment in other sectors as quickly as possible and prevent unnecessary 
social upheaval. Funds for retraining fishers should be a priority and should go hand-in-hand with those for decommissioning programmes.
<P>


<B>7. Develop social and economic incentives for sustainable, well-managed fisheries:</B> Today's social and economic forces mostly provide an incentive for unsustainable, destructive fishing. Positive incentives for sustainable, well-managed fishing are 
urgently required. Market forces and consumer power must be harnessed in order to create such incentives. Governments should 
take the lead in developing and enacting economic incentives for sustainable fishing, thus providing a `carrot' rather than merely
the `stick' of prescriptive regulations. In addition, an independent Marine Stewardship Council should be established as soon as possible to create voluntary, market-led incentives for sustainable fishing and swing consumer power behind efforts to 
recover and sustain clean, well-managed fisheries. This will require conservation organizations and progressive businesses to educate seafood consumers about the enormous potential effect of their purchasing decisions.
<P>


<B>8. Reduce the `footprint' of developed countries on third-world fisheries:</B> Northern states pay huge amounts to secure access to the fisheries of other nations, notably in the developing world. International standards for distant-water fishing should 
be developed as a matter of priority and enforced by UN mandate. No country should be permitted to purchase fishing rights from a foreign government without a full assessment of the impacts of such fishing on the specific fisheries involved, their 
associated marine ecosystem, and indigenous fishers that have relied on the same resources for generations.
<P>


9.<B> Eliminate destructive fishing practices such as the use of poisons and explosives:</B> Destructive fishing practices should be phased out immediately in favour of more sustainable, less destructive alternatives. Enforcement of laws that proscribe 
activities such as cyanide fishing, bleach fishing, and the use of dynamite should be strengthened. Funding should be provided for programmes that train fishers to use techniques other than poisons and explosives. Where practicable, governments and industry should ban supplies of
poisons and explosives intended for fishers. Where specific fisheries have traditionally used poisons, such as cyanide in the `live fish' trade of East Asia, simple tests should be devised that allow inspectors and customers to 
determine when poisons have been used and to act accordingly.
<P>


<B>10. Reduce and eliminate the bycatch of marine wildlife in commercial fisheries: </B>Commercial fisheries currently kill and waste 18 to 40 million metric tonnes of fishes and other marine wildlife annually. To add insult to injury, modern fishing practices have a devastating effect on marine biological diversity and the physical environment of the oceans. The enormous destruction and waste of marine life should be prevented by the use of bycatch reduction devices on fishing gear. Mandatory programmes 
should be imposed immediately to require the use of such devices wherever they are available. Incentives such as bycatch quotas should be imposed or made available to encourage the use of the least destructive fishing gear and practices. When implementing
 programmes to reduce waste by allowing the landing of bycatch, governments should use extreme caution to ensure that these programmes do not impede bycatch reduction efforts. The reduction of waste should go hand-in-hand with the elimination of bycatch.
<P>

<center>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</center>
Fisheries are the last major world industry exploiting wild natural resources for food. If we are to save marine fishes-both as an important source of food and a vital component of ocean ecosystems-we must somehow bring to bear the same worldwide public 
concern that banned the trade in elephant ivory and outlawed commercial whaling. We must use this support to create social, economic, and political incentives for fishing that is both sustainable and clean. That won't be easy: fish neither sing like whales
nor look like pandas. But the stakes are high: the future of world fisheries, their associated marine ecosystems, and the millions of people that depend on them for food and employment.

<b><tt>Executive Summary</tt></b>


<p>

<br>


<img align=left src="T.gif">


<p>

<br>


he tragic decimation of the world's great whales by the whalers of many nations  which reached its worst excesses in the middle years of this century  has at last been curbed. But because of decades of overhunting, some species of whales and dolphins ha
ve been driven to critically low levels. Some are still being killed, and they all face a wide range of new and increasing threats. Today, seven out of the eleven great whale species are considered to be endangered or vulnerable even after 30 or more year
s of "protection" from whaling. At least three small cetaceans  the Indus and Yangtze river dolphins and the little Mexican porpoise, the vaquita  are on the edge of extinction.<BR>

<BR>

Despite a number of conservation victories for the whales  including the indefinite moratorium on commercial whaling and the declaration of virtually the whole of the Southern Ocean as a whale sanctuary in 1994  some whales are still dying. Since the mo
ratorium came into effect in 1985-1986, Japan has killed over 2,400 minke whales for so-called scientific purposes, including 330 in 1995 in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Norway, which lodged an objection to the moratorium, has killed 287 whales und
er the guise of science, and hunted for commercial purposes 1,117 whales from a badly depleted population.<BR>

<BR>

As a result of centuries of unregulated whaling, the North Atlantic population of gray whales has become extinct, and another is endangered in the North Pacific. The northern right whale is now the most endangered of the large whales, with no evidence of 
recovery. The blue whale, the largest mammal to have ever lived on earth, shows no recovery at all in the Southern Hemisphere. Scientists estimate its original numbers in the Southern Hemisphere to be around 250,000, down to as few as 500 today.<BR>

<BR>

The beluga whales of the St Lawrence river are critically endangered, with fewer than 500 remaining. Originally, they were the target of whalers; today, like many other whales and dolphins they are the victims of shipping disturbance including collisions,
 noise pollution, habitat degradation, and above all toxic contaminants. The beluga is so contaminated by DDT and PCBs that dead carcasses have to be disposed of as toxic waste. For over 20 years, WWF-Canada has been supporting  against enormous odds  p
rotection and recovery efforts for the St Lawrence beluga and is co-chairing a government recovery team for the whales.

<BR>

<BR>

<CENTER><img align=middle src="p.1img.jpg" alt="Folklore image of whales"></CENTER>

<BR>

Latest research also reveals that baleen whales, including gray whales and humpbacks, are also affected by chemical pollution. Until recently, it was thought that only the toothed cetaceans such as belugas, sperm whales, and dolphins, were affected. The c
hemicals accumulate in the whales' blubber and are then released into their milk when they migrate to winter calving grounds.<BR>

What will happen to the next generation is unknown. But evidence is growing that the effects of industrial chemicals and pesticide run-offs on whales and dolphins are potentially the gravest threats to their survival. Even low levels of contaminants could
 increase susceptibility to disease and decreasing fertility. If this continues, it is possible that some apparently stable populations of long-lived animals, including whales and dolphins, could crash suddenly with little warning.<BR>

<BR>

During the past 25 years, the fishery bycatch problem of driftnets and gillnets, has caused the death of thousands, if not millions, of cetaceans. However, in some countries today, fishing communities struggle to keep alive the centuries-old tradition of 
giving whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals, which are accidentally killed in fishing nets or which happen to wash ashore, a human burial. In Japan and Vietnam, temples and shrines built to commemorate the souls of whales drowned in fishing nets are
 still maintained.<BR>

<BR>

Global concern over ongoing whaling by Japan and Norway continues, and WWF and other NGOs are pressuring these nations to abide by the IWC decisions. They are calling on Japan to stop scientific whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and for Norwa
y and Russia to withdraw their objections to the moratorium.<BR>

<BR>

WWF is encouraging carefully controlled whale-watching which in 1992 attracted four million enthusiasts worldwide and generated over US$300 million in revenue. Through support to TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring programme of WWF and IUCN, WWF is clo
sely investigating and monitoring the illegal trade in whale meat.<BR>

<BR>

In order to secure the future of the world's whales, WWF believes that the indefinite moratorium on commercial whaling should be upheld, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary strengthened, more whale sanctuaries and marine protected areas created, and marine
 pollution reduced significantly.<BR>

<BR>

Since WWF's founding in 1961, which coincided with the highest number of whales reported killed  66,090  it has fought together with other NGOs to keep whales at the forefront of conservation as one if its highest priorities.

<b><tt>The Whale in History and Culture</tt></b>

<p>

<br>

<img align=left src="F.gif">

<p>

<BR>

rom the Arctic to the Antipodes, people have celebrated and sung of whales and dolphins for centuries, but the first person to write about them was the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who lived from 384 to 322 BC. He described whales, dolphins, and porpoises as cetaceans and distinguished them from fish: "The dolphin, the whale and all the rest of the cetacea, all that is to say, that are provided with a blow-hole instead of gills, are viviparous...The dolphin has been asleep with his nose above water and when asleep he snores...".  Aristotle also described how fishermen who caught dolphins would "nick their tails and set them adrift again and by this expedient their ages are ascertained". Thus, it could be said that the Greeks carried out the first non-lethal or benign research on marine mammals. Greek poets and artists celebrated the sea, thalassa, as the source of life, as it is in many creation myths. Apollo, Greek god of the sun (who turned into a giant dolphin), and Poseidon, god of the sea, protected marine mammals. The oldest images of whales are found carved into rocks in Scandinavia and date from the Stone Age, around 5000 BC. The colourful dolphin frieze at Knossos Palace on the island of Crete is the earliest known picture of a dolphin, painted around 2000 BC.<BR>

<BR>

Whales and dolphins were revered not only by early inhabitants of the Mediterranean, but also by a number of coastal communities on every part of the globe. Upon finding a whale washed ashore, the Kwakiutl Indians of the Pacific Northwest mourned its death. They "prayed" or chanted over the body.<BR>

<BR>

At the opposite end of the world, in what is now New Zealand, one Maori legend describes how the original settlers followed the migratory paths of the whales as they travelled across the great water from the mythical Pacific island of Hawaiiki. Some say they descended from a man who rode in from Hawaiiki on the back of a whale, to the "Land of the Long White Cloud" around 1,500 years ago. At the landing place of the pair, a Maori meeting house has been built in their honour. A large wooden carving of a man riding a whale adorns the house's gabled roof.<BR>

<BR>

In Asia, other types of temples and shrines have been built to commemorate the souls of whales killed in the nets of fishermen, most notably in Japan and in Vietnam. On a small island in the Sea of Japan, an annual requiem is held in spring at a Buddhist temple to honour the souls of dead whales. In the 17th century, whales were caught in nets near the island. During butchering, the fishermen collected whale embryos from female whales, wrapped them in straw mats, then took them to a temple where the monks gave them a human burial. Every time a whale was hunted and killed, it was given a Buddhist name, and its exact date of capture (and death) recorded in the temple. Not far away, on the coast and on islands in the South China Sea, similar temples and shrines were also built, beginning in the 18th century. In Vietnam, a fisherman who accidentally drowns a marine mammal in a fishing net, or finds one washed ashore, follows a centuries-old tradition and gives it an elaborate human burial. He honours the whale or dolphin as if it were his own father. Three years to the day after a cetacean dies, its bones are dug up, carefully washed by fishermen's wives, and the skeleton reassembled. These are then transported on an elaborate wooden litter  one used for human burials  by a group of pallbearers to the Temple of the Whale. Only two temples of this type remain in Vietnam today, but they are considered to harbour sacred souls, "the mandarins of the sea" who, when they die, ascend to heaven, where they become "Angels of the Sea in the Sky".<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Factory ships and exploding grenades</STRONG><BR><BR>

While some cultures and countries were celebrating whales, others were developing methods that would begin to decimate them. In Europe, the Basques began whaling in the 11th century, soon followed by the Dutch and the English. The first target of commercial whaling was the northern right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, which is now the most endangered of all the great whales with some stocks near extinction. The profitable and unregulated business of commercial whaling spread to the American colonies, with right, humpback, Megaptera novaeangliae, and sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, being the next targets. In the 19th century, steam-powered catcher boats and the exploding grenade attached to a harpoon revolutionized whaling. Factory ships added to the toll on the whales: more were killed in four decades than in the previous four centuries. This technological leap allowed the whalers to kill fast-moving species such as the blue, Balaenoptera musculus, and fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus.<BR>

 <BR>

By the early 20th century some whale stocks were showing signs of overexploitation. In 1925, the League of Nations recommended that the whaling industry be regulated in order to protect whales from overhunting. As a result, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea established the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics in 1930. A year later the first international regulatory treaty, the Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, was signed by 22 nations in Geneva. This treaty gave full protection to right whales, immature whales, and females with calves. Unfortunately, Japan, Chile, Argentina, the USSR, and Germany, important whaling nations, were not party to the agreement.<BR>

<BR>

The same year the treaty came into force, over 43,000 whales were hunted. Since blue, fin, and sperm whales were among those killed, meat and oil production from these animals was at its highest peak ever. In a little over 10 years, since 1920, whale oil production had increased 20-fold. In an attempt to limit whale oil production, the whaling nations initiated the Blue Whale Unit system as a means of regulating the market. But as a conservation measure it failed miserably. For example, whales were hunted according to their whale oil potential, while their age, size, population dynamics, and distribution were unknown or ignored. One blue whale was equal to two fin, two-and-a half humpbacks, or six sei whales. During the 1930s regular meetings were held in an attempt to restrict whaling even further. Finally, in 1937, eight years after the first whaling treaty came into force, total protection was conferred on gray whales, and minimum size limits were set for fin, blue, humpback, and sperm whales. In addition, the 1937 convention acknowledged the differences between factory-ship whaling and coastal whale hunting and established separate seasons for each.<BR>

<BR>

In 1946, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling came into effect, and in 1949 it established the International Whaling Commission (IWC), with 14 member nations. The IWC revived the Blue Whale Unit catch quota, consistently adopted the highest estimate for whale quotas recommended by the IWC scientists, and re-opened whaling of Antarctic stocks of humpback whales, protected since 1939. Some whaling nations exceeded quotas set by the IWC, failed to report also the number of whales actually killed (as WWF and other NGOs have learned and reported on over the years), objected officially to hunting bans on blue whales and killed them anyway. In short, they ridiculed the convention, until the treaty nearly collapsed. In 1961, the whaling nations hunted more whales than ever and killed over 66,000.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Gray whale extinct in the Atlantic</STRONG><BR><BR>

In the following years, catches began to decline because the whalers could not find enough whales to kill. By the time the blue whale was given full protection in 1965, it was virtually gone from the Antarctic. At up to 30m long, the blue whale is the largest animal ever to have lived on earth, and is scattered throughout all oceans. In 1989, scientists estimated that the blue whale, whose numbers could have been as high as 250,000 in Antarctic waters before commercial whaling began there, could be as low as 210 to 1,000. The fin whale, second in size to the blue, was severely reduced in numbers in all oceans, especially in the Southern Ocean.<BR>

<BR>

 Probably the most well-known whale, immortalized by Herman Melville in the novel Moby Dick, is the sperm whale. It was heavily exploited, mainly for its oil, right up until 1988. Unlike edible baleen whale oil, sperm whale oil was used for lighting fuel and various industrial purposes. Over the centuries, the gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus, was the first to suffer extinction of a stock. Of the original three populations, one was probably wiped out by early whalers in the North Atlantic. A second stock was nearly eradicated in the mid 20th century in the western North Pacific. However, the eastern North Pacific population  has recovered from very low levels after being heavily exploited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When WWF was founded in 1961, it accepted the challenge of working with governments and other NGOs to help reverse the drastic population declines in the world's great whales.<BR>

</FONT></B>

he plight of the great whales was so desperate by the early 1960s that it was among the reasons for the foundation of WWF. Sir Peter Scott, one of the founders of WWF, wrote in his 1962 "Conservation Creed": "What man did to the Dodo, and has since been doing to the Blue Whale and about 1,000 other kinds of animals, may or may not be morally wrong. But the conservation of nature is most important because of what nature does for man". In fact, the foundation of WWF in October 1961 coincided with the highest ever number of whales reported killed: 66,090 in the 1961-1962 Antarctic whaling season  mostly fin and sperm whales, since the blue whales had by then been hunted close to extinction.<BR>

<BR>

Sir Peter Scott was also chairman of IUCN's Species Survival Commission (SSC). In 1963 he set up its Cetacean Specialist Group to investigate what was happening to the great whales. The SSC's very first List of Rare Mammals and Birds (precursor of the IUCN Red Data Books), drawn up in 1964, included six species of great whales: blue  which it named as the most endangered of all the large whales  fin, humpback, bowhead, and the northern and southern right whales.<BR>

<BR>



From 1965 to 1987, Sir Peter Scott was WWF's spokesman at the yearly meetings of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). He reported that "what is going on is a world scandal of considerable magnitude". For nearly a quarter of a century he helped expose this scandal and then  step by step  to put an end to it. Vigorous advocacy of reducing, and if possible, stopping, the appalling depletion of whale populations was one of the first steps taken by WWF. Diplomacy and promotion of whale conservation by WWF helped to convince the IWC to reduce catch quotas by a modest amount and to impose a ban on the hunting of blue and humpback whales in the Antarctic. But by this time, the ban was much too late to halt the decline in blue whale numbers. In the previous season, whalers had been able to find only 20 blue whales in the whole of the Southern Ocean. In another initiative in 1966, world-renowned aviator and WWF Trustee General Charles Lindburgh convinced Peru's largest whaling company to stop killing blue and humpback whales in the Pacific for at least two years.

<BR>

 <BR>

Meanwhile IUCN kept up pressure on the IWC's Scientific Committee, many of whose members blatantly put short-term political interests ahead of scientific conservation and sound management. Until 1972 the IWC did not set catch limits by individual species of whales, but by the commercially important species of baleen whales as a group, and even then only for the Antarctic. Quotas were given in "blue whale units". For example, one blue whale, or two fin whales, or 2.5 humpback whales, or six sei whales. As a basis for trying to make whaling sustainable, this system was totally unworkable.<BR>

<BR>



In spite of the efforts of WWF and IUCN and some modest success in reducing IWC quotas, they made little headway in the IWC during the 1960s. The lower quotas in part reflected the fact that the whalers were no longer able to find whales so easily, so that there was less economic sacrifice in agreeing to lower catch limits.<BR>

<BR>



<STRONG>The UN calls for a moratorium</STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>

Even though the true extent of the killing was not known at the time, public concern and anger at what was happening to the great whales was building up rapidly in many countries around the world, especially among WWF supporters. "Saving the whales" came to symbolize the fast-growing concern for saving the whole planet from overexploitation by humans. As Sir Peter Scott said in 1972: "If we cannot save the whales from extinction we have little chance of saving mankind and the life-supplying biosphere".<BR>

<BR>

WWF helped channel this public concern into action at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. A symbolic whale-sized balloon led a procession through the streets of Stockholm, and whales were the focus of much discussion. With the help of vigorous lobbying of the delegates, a recommendation calling for a 10-year moratorium on commercial whaling was adopted  including Norway, the only nation still conducting commercial whaling 23 years later. One abstention was Japan, the most important whaling country. Japan recorded its technical reasons for abstaining, but also declared that "it was favourable to a moratorium on commercial whaling". <BR>

<BR>



Although this landmark recommendation was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, and was later reaffirmed several times by the UNEP Governing Council, the IWC rejected it. At the IWC meeting only two weeks after the Stockholm Conference, Peter Scott again appealed in vain to the delegates to heed world opinion and to stop defying "the collective conscience of mankind". Only four members (USA, UK, Argentina, and Mexico) out of the 14 members of the Commission present at the meeting voted for a moratorium. <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>The struggle for the moratorium </STRONG><BR>

<BR>

During the next few months international support for a 10-year moratorium on commercial whaling reached an all time high: On the opening day of the 1973 meeting of the IWC in London, conservationists published in the form of an advertisement in the Times of London an open letter to the Commission under the headline, "One is killed every 20 minutes: Is this carnage necessary?"<BR>

<BR>

Signatories of this open letter to the IWC  which urged the IWC to uphold the Stockholm recommendation  were WWF President and Chairman, HRH Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Sir Peter Scott, WWF National Organizations in the UK and the US, and the IUCN President and Director General.<BR>

<BR>

As of 1973, the USSR and Japan were hunting around 80 per cent of the world's whales. Dr Sidney Holt, then Advisor on Marine Affairs with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nation's Department of Fisheries, and other scientists questioned the principles and methods used by the IWC to regulate whaling and set catch quotas. A proposal for the 10-year moratorium was put forward by the US at the meeting and was defeated. WWF kept the pressure on the world's whalers to stop the unregulated slaughter and in October of that year renewed the call for a moratorium on the hunting of whales at its 3rd International Congress in Bonn, Germany.

<BR>

<BR>

In order to alleviate the growing global concern over the fate of the world's whales, a compromise was struck. In 1974, a new management procedure for whales (NMP) was adopted by the IWC. This strategy was an attempt  for the first time ever  to manage whales on a "sustainable basis". Catch quotas were set on a stock by stock and species by species basis. The NMP also aimed at fully protecting severely depleted whale populations in order to maximize their chances of recovery. The responsibility for developing the NMP was placed on the IWC's Scientific Committee.<BR>

<BR>

Within a few years it became obvious that the NMP had failed. Whale populations were continuing to decline. The whalers were not providing the data to the IWC which the Scientific Committee could use to assess more realistically the status of whale stocks. Under the NMP, whalers could kill the same number of whales as they had previously done, until evidence showed that these whale stocks were declining. This did not motivate whaling nations to provide information or data to the IWC which would lower the number of whales they could hunt.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>A sea change in the IWC</STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>

In 1976, WWF launched The Seas Must Live Campaign. The fate of the world's whales and other cetaceans was the centrepiece of WWF's special three-year marine programme. The campaign aimed at safeguarding marine mammals and their critical habitats and to stimulate governments and intergovernmental agencies to act on a wider scale. The humpback whale was chosen as the symbol for the campaign which included a review of the NMP by an impartial body of whale scientists, putting forward proposals for an international network of whale sanctuaries, developing non-lethal (benign) methods of research for counting whales, and pressing national and international authorities for action to save whales.

<BR>

<BR>

<CENTER><img align=middle src="p.7img.jpg" alt="Picture of a demonstration for whales"></CENTER>

<BR>

<BR>

This campaign aimed at raising funds for the establishment of an international system of whale sanctuaries. It inspired creation of marine reserves around the world including the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary, Ecuador's whale and marine mammal sanctuary in the Galpagos Islands, and Brazil's Abrolhos Marine National Park.

<BR>

<BR>

By 1978, the atmosphere of the IWC had undergone a sea change. It had acquired new members, many of them conservation-minded. People around the globe were listening to "whale songs", first recorded by scientists Dr Roger Payne and Katy Payne, and television viewers were spellbound by underwater images of Survival Anglia's Gentle Giants of the Pacific, filmed by world-renowned underwater cameraman, Al Giddings. Whale enthusiasts flocked to Hawaii, Mexico's Gulf of California, and Cape Cod to witness firsthand the mystery of the world's whales. They swam with them, photographed them leaping from the water, and listened to their voices vibrate the boats from which they beheld these wonders of nature.

<BR>

<BR>

Scientists and environmentalists joined forces. Massive demonstrations were held protesting against the whaling nations. In London, in 1979, just before the opening of the annual IWC meeting, thousands of people rallied at Trafalgar Square where Sir Peter Scott announced that a million signatures had been presented to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by WWF's junior unit, the Wildlife Youth Service. The petition pressed all Members of Parliament to support a ban on whaling.

<BR>

<BR>

During the 1979 meeting, a moratorium on all deep sea whaling using factory ships for whales other than minkes was carried by a vote of 18 to two, with Japan and the USSR the only nations to vote against it. At the same meeting, the IWC accepted evidence that Japan's Taiyo Fisheries Company, the largest privately-owned fisheries company in the world, had been involved in setting up and dealing with illegal pirate whaling operations. <BR>

<BR>



 Also in 1979, a news item in the London Sunday Times reported that a prominent British scientist had received a letter from a Soviet scientific worker aboard a factory ship alleging that the USSR was breaking the laws of the whaling industry. His fleet alone had taken 1,916 whales more than its quota. In 1993, the world learned that this letter was not a hoax: Soviet fleets had been killing massive numbers of the world's most endangered whales right through the 1960s and 1970s and selling the meat to Japan. In 1993, a letter sent to WWF from a leading Russian scientist, Dr AV Yablokov, revealed the "enormous scale of the Soviet falsifications of the official data for IWC". Between 1949 and 1980, the USSR killed over 3,200 right whales (protected since 1935) and over 48,450 humpback whales (protected by the IWC in 1963). The new data also shows that 1,433 highly endangered blue whales, (protected by the IWC in 1965) were also slaughtered. The Soviet fleet reported that they had killed only 156. Further deceptions involved large catches of Bryde's whales and sei whales in the Indian Ocean in 1972, and of sperm whales north of Hawaii up to 1975 when that population was wiped out. All this happened despite the presence of national observers on the ships, and continued even after an international observer scheme was in force, with Japanese observers.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>The Indian Ocean Sanctuary </STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>However, some hope for the whales was on the horizon. In 1979, the IWC declared the entire Indian Ocean  from the coast of Africa west to Australia, and from the Red and Arabian Seas and the Gulf of Oman south to 55oS latitude  as a whale sanctuary. Development of the proposal grew out of discussions during a joint IUCN/WWF/UNEP Workshop on Cetacean Sanctuaries in Mexico in 1978.

<BR>

<BR>

At the 1979 meeting of the IWC, the government of the Seychelles successfully promoted the proposal for the Indian Ocean Sanctuary (IOS), ensuring that commercial whaling would be prohibited there for at least ten years. In 1989 the IOS was extended for a further three years, and then in 1992 the IWC agreed by consensus that it should remain a sanctuary for an indefinite period. As soon as the sanctuary was declared, WWF-Netherlands began to raise funds to help finance research. In 1980, HRH Prince Bernard, President of WWF-Netherlands launched an appeal which raised 400,000 Guilders (US$250,000) dedicated to the study of living whales in the new sanctuary.

<BR>

<BR>

Public outcry over IWC-sanctioned whale hunting and pirate whaling reached a crescendo in 1980: the IWC set quotas for the killing of some 14,000 whales, rejected a moratorium on commercial whaling, ignored the Scientific Committee's recommendation for a zero quota for sperm whales in the Western North Pacific, and slated Japan for involvement in pirate whaling activities. Japan promised to tighten whale meat import controls, after admitting that in 1979-1980, more than 850 tonnes of whale meat had been imported from Taiwan via South Korea. In 1979, its total import of whale meat was 27,000 tonnes.

<BR>

<BR>

Conservation-minded delegates went to the 1981 meeting of the IWC in the UK armed with new ammunition to halt the whales' steady plunge to extinction. Many IWC member nations cited and actively supported the 1980 World Conservation Strategy (WCS), prepared by IUCN with the support of UNEP, WWF, FAO, and Unesco. The WCS, recognized globally as a benchmark for conservation, calls for a moratorium on all commercial whaling to last until certain conditions can be fulfilled.

<BR>

<BR>

At the July 1981 meeting of the IWC, three separate proposals for a global moratorium on commercial whaling were made  and defeated. The IWC declared a zero quota on sperm whale hunting in all sectors except the Western North Pacific  a stock exploited by Japan's coastal stations. The majority of members of the Scientific Committee had recommended protection for that stock as well. The Commission agreed to hold a special meeting of the IWC and the Scientific Committee in March 1982. The IWC also set quotas for 13,356 whales, down slightly from the previous year's quota. The special meeting convened by the IWC in March to set a quota on sperm whales in the Western Pacific ended in confusion and deadlock. The commission deferred its decision until its annual meeting in July. Astonished NGOs and many conservation-minded IWC Commissioners strengthened their resolve to bring about a moratorium on commercial whaling at the July meeting.

<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>The Tulip project</STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>

Meanwhile, WWF was already using the money raised by WWF-Netherlands to fund studies of live sperm whales and other cetaceans in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary.

<BR>

<BR>

In September 1981, WWF and the IWC co-funded a workshop convened under the auspices of the governments of the Seychelles and the Netherlands. At the workshop, 36 leading whale experts from 14 countries reviewed the state of benign whale research, and prepared a programme of projects for investigating population levels, ecology, and behaviour of the 43 cetacean species in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary.

<BR>

 <BR>

One of the most important outcomes of this workshop was WWF's "Tulip" project, funded by WWF-Netherlands. The Tulip was a 10-metre ocean-going yacht, which carried out innovative research into sperm whales and other cetaceans in the Indian Ocean between 1981 and 1984. Before this project there had been little attempt to study living sperm whales, even though their social system was known to be very different from the other large whales.

<BR>

<BR>

Much of Tulip's work was conducted off Sri Lanka, from the port of Trincomalee. Family groups of 1020 sperm whales were followed for days on end, tracking them from their underwater clicking sounds. Many new benign techniques were developed, including photographic identification and measurement, studying particular groups for long periods using snorkellers and video, faecal analysis of diet, studying their feeding behaviour from depth sounder traces, and estimating populations from acoustic censuses. Tulip scientists also recorded the first Indian Ocean humpback whale songs off Oman and Sri Lanka, and discovered and studied a population of blue whales off Trincomalee.

<BR>

<BR>



Soon after the Tulip set sail in the Indian Ocean, images of blue and sperm whales and the Tulip crew were beamed around the globe. They drew dramatic attention to the plight of the world's whales, and the fact that they could be studied without killing them. <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Jubilation over whale ban</STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>

For months leading up to the meeting and immediately beforehand  largely under the inspired leadership of WWF's Chairman, Sir Peter Scott, and Greenpeace Chairman, David McTaggart  NGOs representing all the diverse elements of the conservation and animal welfare movement united, perhaps for the first time. They held joint press conferences, lobbied governments, and staged rallies in pursuit of their common goal: to save the world's whales from extinction.<BR>

<BR>

At the IWC annual meeting in July 1982, in the late hours of an extended session, the government of the Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, tabled a resolution for a moratorium on commercial whaling, beginning in 1985-1986. Solidarity among conservation groups was as it had never been. A vote was called, and one by one the nations revealed their governments' positions. The room was deathly quiet until the chairman of the IWC read out the results of the vote: The indefinite moratorium on commercial whaling had been passed by a majority of 25 to 7, with 5 abstentions. A round of applause rang out. The winning moment for the whales symbolized a shared commitment which had brought about one of the most dramatic victories in the history of conservation.<BR>

<BR>

"I don't think any species will have gone in three year's time. The danger of extinction has disappeared!", Sir Peter Scott told a jubilant crowd who embraced and cheered in the lobby outside the conference room. According to the vote, the moratorium was to begin in 1982 and be completed by the 1985-1986 season. Although conservationists were able to reduce whale quotas overall by 1,733 whales, over 12,577 whales would still die for commercial and aboriginal purposes. The quota for the North Pacific sperm whale was 450 for 1982 and 400 for 1983.<BR>

<BR>

Within 90 days, Japan, Norway, USSR, and Peru lodged official objections to the moratorium, thus ensuring their right to continue whaling after 1986. In 1984, Japan announced that it intended to continue to hunt sperm whales in its coastal waters until 1988  two years after the commercial whaling moratorium was to come into place.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Defending the moratorium</STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>

With the moratorium decision, WWF's campaign in the IWC entered a new phase. In 1983, the first global gathering on the benign use of cetaceans, the IWC Whales Alive Conference, called for the IWC to change its direction from killing whales to conserving and studying them. A wide variety of NGOs continued to send representatives as observers to the annual IWC meetings. By working together, and backed up by the force of the public opinion they represented, they were able to exert considerable influence on the proceedings. Year by year, they helped drive  on scientific grounds  the quotas on the number of whales to lower and lower levels. Most notably, the work of a small group of very able scientists was supported by WWF and some other NGOs. These scientists worked in the IWC's Scientific Committee on a replacement for the discredited 1974 New Management Procedure.<BR>

<BR>

In the face of continuing uncertainty about whale population levels, this replacement for the NMP would give the benefit of the doubt to the whales and not to the whalers. WWF's aims were both to perpetuate the moratorium by showing how difficult it would be in practice ever to achieve truly "sustainable" whaling, and to ensure that if the IWC ever voted to remove the moratorium, the adverse consequences to whales would be minimized.<BR>

<BR>

The independent scientists soon established that under the NMP, whale population declines could not be detected until long after they had occurred, so that warnings of depletion came far too late. Some progress had been made in estimating whale population levels, such as the number of minke whales in the Southern Hemisphere, but the figures were not nearly precise enough to be able to monitor changes in stocks in periods shorter than decades; and the boundaries between different stocks used by the IWC for management purposes had very little scientific justification, although they had played an important part in the NMP.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Whaling during the moratorium</STRONG>

<BR><BR>

Some of the whaling countries which opposed the 1982 moratorium were convinced of the need to halt commercial whaling before the 1986 deadline. But others including Japan and Iceland slipped through a loophole in the convention and continued to kill whales for so-called scientific purposes. WWF exposed this loophole and other attempts to skirt the whaling ban at an international symposium held in Oslo on the eve of the annual 1985 IWC meeting. World renowned Norwegian biologist and anthropologist, Dr Thor Heyerdahl, denounced Norway's attempts to continue whaling. At the symposium, WWF discredited Norway and Japan's attempt to declare a new category of coastal whaling.<BR>

<BR>

In the US, NGOs including Greenpeace boycotted Icelandic fish products and Japan Airlines and called on the US government to impose sanctions on IWC members who did not comply with IWC recommendations. Environmentalists took the US government to court because of an unorthodox agreement between the US Secretary of Commerce and Japan which would allow Japan to take 1,200 sperm whales up to 1988, if Japan agreed to stop commercial whaling by that time.<BR>

<BR>



Japan withdrew its objection to the whaling ban, but it has side-stepped the moratorium on commercial whaling until this day. Its whaling boats hunted sperm whales until 1988 and its factory ships have carried out "scientific" whaling for around 300 minke whales every year in the Southern Ocean. Under Article VIII of the 1946 Whaling Convention, members of the IWC are given the right to grant their nationals special permits allowing whales to be killed for "purposes of scientific research". These permits, and the results of the research, have to be reported to the IWC and its Scientific Committee, but these bodies can only comment on them, not veto the research. Before the moratorium came into effect, this loophole in the convention was rarely abused by IWC members. WWF and other NGOs have kept the heat on Japan and Norway to stop their lethal whale research, which is clearly for commercial purposes. Year after year, the NGOs have encouraged the IWC to pass resolutions "requesting" the countries involved to refrain from this whaling. <BR>

<BR>

Since the moratorium came into effect in 1985-1986, Japan has killed more than 2,400 whales under the guise of science. Iceland and South Korea also conducted scientific whaling programmes. WWF scientists have repeatedly stated that there is practically nothing more that we can learn by killing whales than we already know.<BR>

<BR>

The USSR and Norway have maintained their official objections to the moratorium which means that they are not legally bound by it. The USSR stopped all commercial whaling after the 1986-87 Antarctic season, but Norway has killed whales every year except 1991. Since the moratorium came into force, Norway has killed 287 whales for so-called science, and 1,117 for commercial purposes in 1986, 1987, 1993, and 1994.<BR>

<b><tt>What WWF is doing for whale conservation</tt></b>


<p>

<br>

<img align=left src="W.gif">

<p>

<BR>



WF remains closely involved in making sure that the IWC operates as much as possible as a whale conservation body. Without the IWC there would be no control on whaling, no moratorium, and no sanctuaries where whaling was prohibited. Although it has to operate within the partly outdated bounds of the nearly 50 year-old International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, the IWC is the only international organization with the authority to regulate for whale conservation worldwide. It is recognized as such in both UNCLOS (implicitly) and UNCED's Agenda 21 (explicitly).<BR>

<BR>

With the moratorium and the whale sanctuaries in place, the IWC is turning its attention increasingly to other aspects of whale conservation, and WWF is active in promoting this. Among the issues being addressed by the IWC and its Scientific Committee are conservation measures for small cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises, and small whales), the relative humaneness of different whale-killing methods, the growth of whale-watching, and environmental threats to whales.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary</STRONG><BR><BR>

The campaign to help achieve the IWC's declaration of virtually the whole of the Southern Ocean as a whale sanctuary in 1994 is one of WWF's greatest success stories. The new sanctuary's boundary joins the Indian Ocean Sanctuary's southern boundary, each sanctuary covering some 50 million square kilometres. Together they protect the whales of about one-third of the world's oceans from whaling. The sanctuary effectively ends any possibility of the resumption of large-scale whaling anywhere in the world.<BR>

<BR>

<CENTER><img align=middle src="p.11img.gif" alt="Map of the world"></CENTER>

<BR>

 

The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was first proposed by the government of France at the 1992 IWC meeting, and with the help of a few other governments and a number of NGOs including WWF it rapidly gained support among the IWC member countries. For example, in 1993, 71,800 New Zealanders signed up to WWF's "Say No to Whaling" campaign within six weeks of its launch. The sanctuary was adopted only two years after its initial proposal by an overwhelming vote of 23 in favour, six abstentions, and only one (Japan) against. It finally came into force on 7 December 1994, after Russia had first lodged an official objection which would have seriously undermined the sanctuary, and then been persuaded to withdraw its protest under strong pressure from outside, including WWF.<BR>

<BR>

The declaration of the Southern Ocean as a whale sanctuary was crucial for allowing the recovery of the whale populations that were originally the most abundant in the world, and had suffered the most from the whalers. The sperm whales and all the Southern Hemisphere baleen whales, with the exception of the tropical Bryde's whale, migrate to the Southern Ocean around Antarctica in summer to feed.<BR>

<BR>

Exploitation of the smallest species, the 10-metre minke whale, had begun in the early 1970s. Nearly 100,000 were taken there in the next 15 years. Today the minke is the only species remaining on the Antarctic feeding grounds in relatively large numbers. Without the sanctuary  if the moratorium were ever lifted  the only possible large-scale whaling left in the world could have reopened on these Antarctic minke populations. It is to be hoped that through creation of the sanctuary, this will be prevented forever.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Sanctuary research workshop</STRONG><BR><BR>

One of the important benefits of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary will be the opportunity to undertake benign research on the gradually recovering whale populations. In 1995, WWF co-sponsored a scientific workshop with Greenpeace International and the International Fund For Animal Welfare. The workshop brought together a group of highly experienced whale scientists from 12 different countries who drew up a framework of long-term non-lethal research in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Investigation of illegal whale-meat trade</STRONG><BR><BR>

Whale meat still commands very high prices in Japanese shops and restaurants  in December 1994, one kilogram retailed for about US$200 (Yomiuri Shimbun, 10 December 1994). These prices fuel an illegal trade in whale meat in several countries. In 1993, TRAFFIC investigators found baleen whale meat on sale in the markets of Pusan, South Korea, even though all baleen whales are protected under Appendix 1 of CITES. Pusan was also the destination of an illegal shipment of 3.5 tonnes of whale meat labelled as "shrimps" confiscated at Oslo airport in October 1993; although there is a domestic market for baleen whale meat in Norway, the prices are much higher in Korea and Japan. TRAFFIC is continuing its monitoring of East Asian markets in 1995, with WWF funding. It is possible to use DNA analysis to indicate the origin of whale meat, showing which species and which ocean it came from.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>The RMP and RMS</STRONG><BR><BR>

The work on producing a replacement to the NMP continued in the Scientific Committee for several years, with extensive computer simulations being undertaken of all the possible alternatives to see what effect they would have on whale populations. The replacement for the NMP is known as the Revised Management Procedure (RMP), and the version that the IWC finally accepted in 1994 to be as safe as it could be had benefited greatly from the involvement of independent scientists. There is no question of actually applying the RMP and setting whale catch limits so long as the moratorium is in place. Important spin-offs are likely as the approach used in the RMP should provide the basis for sustainable exploitation regimes for other species, including many types of fish.<BR>

<BR>

The RMP is just one part of the Revised Management Scheme (RMS) that has been under discussion in the IWC for several years. The RMS must include not only the RMP, but also stringent standards for population surveys and for data on past catches, and the thorny question of supervision and control of any whaling  the issue that has been highlighted again by the Russian disclosures of large Soviet catches of nominally protected whales. For several IWC members the question of finding more humane killing methods is also critical. The IWC will not be able to discuss reviewing the moratorium until they have agreed and voted on all the elements of the RMS.<BR>

 <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>WWF in action around the globe</STRONG>

<BR>

<BR>

As well as working on cetacean conservation at the international level, WWF is continuing with a variety of local initiatives around the world designed to find out more about whales, dolphins, and porpoises and to address the threats they are facing, but much more needs to be done. With some WWF marine projects, the whales or dolphins serve as "flagship" species and by helping them the whole marine ecosystem benefits. In other projects, such as marine protected areas, the focus is on protecting the ecosystem, which in turn brings benefits for the cetaceans found there. In almost all cases, enhancing local awareness and understanding of the need for marine conservation is an important component of these projects.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Canada</STRONG><BR><BR>

"Whales Beneath the Ice": WWF-Canada undertook a major three-year programme from 1983 to 1986, with funding of over CAN$2 million (US$1.4 million). Seven projects were undertaken in close co-operation with northern communities, researching the conservation needs of the three species of Arctic whales, belugas, narwhals, and bowheads. The methods used included surveys and observation, tagging, acoustic studies, and research into the history of native whaling for bowheads.<BR>

<BR>

One far-reaching development from this programme has been WWF-Canada's work in helping to establish a sanctuary for bowhead whales at Isabella Bay, Baffin Island. Only a few hundred of the eastern population of bowhead whales remain after the depredations first of Inuit hunters and then of the European whalers. Protecting critical parts of their habitat is vital in helping their recovery. The sanctuary proposal was discussed extensively with the local Inuit community at Clyde River (population 500), and approved unanimously by them. Formal designation of the area, both as a National Wildlife Area and as a Biosphere Reserve, is expected before the end of 1995. WWF is funding research into the feeding patterns of the bowheads in Isabella Bay.<BR>

<BR>

Another recent Canadian WWF project has used photographic methods and behavioural research to investigate the little-known northern bottlenose whale in the "Gully", a submarine canyon near Sable Island, Nova Scotia.<BR>

<BR>

The beluga whales of the St Lawrence River are critically endangered. While thousands once plied the St Lawrence, fewer than 500 remain today. Whaling caused the initial decline, but disturbances from commercial and recreational shipping, and above all toxic contaminants, have impeded the whale's recovery. This species is so polluted by DDT and PCBs that dead carcasses have to be disposed of as toxic waste. WWF-Canada has been supporting protection and recovery efforts for the St Lawrence belugas for over 20 years, and has spent nearly half a million dollars. A healthy population of belugas would also signal the start of a recovery in the St Lawrence/Great Lakes ecosystem on which many other species and millions of people depend. WWF has secured the establishment by the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans of a recovery team for the whales, and are co-chairing the team which is working on a recovery plan addressing the critical problems affecting the belugas. The plan is due for completion by June 1995. A sharp reduction in the level of toxic discharges entering the St Lawrence is seen as the number one priority.<BR>

<BR>

In parallel to the St Lawrence project, WWF-US's Wildlife and Contaminants Programme is investigating the potential effects of man-made chemicals in the environment on whales. In particular, the effects of toxic chemicals on the reproduction and health of right whales and belugas. <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Dominican Republic</STRONG><BR> <BR>

Some 3,000 whales, representing about 90 per cent of the entire western North Atlantic humpback whale population, congregate each year from January to March at the Silver Bank off the Atlantic coast of the Dominican Republic for breeding and calving. Silver Bank was designated as a marine sanctuary for humpbacks in 1986, and WWF-US began supporting humpback whale and other marine research in Dominican waters in 1988. In 1991, WWF worked in collaboration with the Centre for Marine Biological Research (CIBIMA) to strengthen the Silver Bank Commission which implements the management plan for the Silver Bank Humpback Whale Sanctuary. By 1993, over 15,000 people were going whale-watching in the Dominican Republic, mostly in Samana Bay, bringing in a total revenue of over US$3 million. WWF is now assisting the local NGO FUNDEMAR with education and public awareness, and with strengthening guidelines for whale-watching and national laws to protect the whales, dolphins, and other marine species.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Europe</STRONG><BR><BR>

WWF participated in a public awareness campaign on the issue of dolphins and whales caught in driftnets and tuna purse-setting fisheries from 1991 to 1993. The Swiss tuna marketing industry was persuaded to commit itself to a highly effective dolphin-safe statement and purchase policy. A monitoring programme in the canneries of Spain, and campaigns in Belgium, France, Italy, and the UK, were organized.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Japan </STRONG><BR><BR>

About 20,000 people went whale-watching in Japan in 1994, inspired by WWF research. WWF-Japan ran a very successful research project on Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), and Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) from 1988 to 1994, which produced important new information about the status, behaviour, and migration patterns of the western North Pacific population of humpback whales on their winter calving grounds. The project became involved with the fast growing whale-watching enterprise, which reflects the rapidly changing attitude of Japanese people to whales, and has attracted much local press interest. Promotional materials and basic guidelines for whale-watching were produced with the help of Dr Jim Darling, the project's Canadian scientific adviser. The tourists' photographs were added to the researchers' in building up information on the whales and producing an identification catalogue. WWF input into the survey was scaled down in 1994 as the Ogasawara Marine Centre decided to carry on by themselves, and WWF is now funding a local researcher in Okinawa only. A further survey to cover the entire Nansei Shoto region is planned. <BR>

<BR>

The interest in whale- and dolphin-watching aroused by this project has stimulated several other whale-watching ventures around the coast of Japan. In 1994, Japanese people spent over 100 million yen (US$1 million) watching whales. WWF Japan has helped them with advice and information, and has produced a widely distributed informational film for the three main whale-watching locations.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>New Zealand</STRONG><BR><BR>

WWF is supporting a three-year study, from 1993, of the sperm whales off Kaikoura, on the South Island of New Zealand. Kaikoura, a former whaling station, is one of the few places in the world where a group of sperm whales can be studied close to the shore. Acoustic techniques, listening to the clicks made by the whales, will be used as well as photographic and visual methods. Samples of sloughed skin are being used for DNA analysis to determine relationships between the Kaikoura stock and those elsewhere. This is the only detailed research programme in the world focusing on male sperm whales in high latitudes. Between 60 and 200 whales visit Kaikoura each year. The results are being used to advise on the management of the rapidly expanding whale-watching activities. This three-year project is funded through WWF-NZ and Telecom Fundraising Partnership.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Norway</STRONG><BR><BR>

Since 1987, WWF Sweden has helped fund a long-term project to examine the seasonal distribution and abundance of orcas off Norway's northern coasts. Scientists are examining the structure and stability of the orca groups, their feeding behaviour, and vocalizations. The work will help clarify the relationship between the orcas and one of their principle food species, the herring. The concentration of orcas following the herring stocks in a few fjords each autumn has started to attract whale-watching tourists, to the benefit of the local economy.<BR>

<BR>

WWF-Norway has funded a project examining the findings from sightings of sperm, orca, and minke whales on the Andenes Whale Safari tours in Norway, as well as conducting other research on sperm whales in that area. In addition, it sponsors educational exhibits to promote public awareness in the Andenes Whale Centre, including information for the whale-watching tourists.<BR>

 <BR>

<STRONG>South Africa</STRONG><BR><BR>

With the help of strict conservation measures, the threatened southern right whale population off the South African coast has been making a good recovery from extremely low numbers, although the population is still only around 10 per cent of its original abundance. When whaling stopped, it is estimated that this population had only 25 adult females left, which probably led to a loss of genetic diversity. WWF-South Africa, in conjunction with the South African Marine Corporation, the IWC, and the Wildlife Society of Southern Africa, has helped fund a long-term monitoring programme which started in 1969, studying the whales' population dynamics and genetic variation using aerial surveys and DNA analysis of skin samples.<BR>

 <BR>

WWF-South Africa has also supported research into humpback whales off the western Cape coast; humpback and bottlenose dolphins off East Cape and Natal; and the endemic Heaviside's dolphin off the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. Total funding for these projects from WWF has amounted to nearly 625,000 South African rand (US$170,000).<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>USA</STRONG><BR><BR>

WWF-US is leading worldwide efforts to assess threats posed to whales by man-made toxic chemicals in the marine ecosystem. WWF-US scientist Dr Theo Colborn has in recent years identified entire classes of pervasive chemicals that mimic natural hormones in animal embryos (including human) thereby disrupting the embryo's normal development. Among the phenomena associated with exposure to these so-called "endocrine disruptors" is reduced fertility or, in some cases, complete reproductive failure.<BR>

<BR>

Research by Dr Colborn and others has found extremely high oceanic concentrations of some of these chemicals and has found toxins in whale blubber at levels that are cause for serious concern. Based on work done so far, it is now clear that the well-being of whale populations can no longer be based just on the number of animals in a given population. Follow-up research is aimed at understanding better the impacts of present exposure levels, identifying at-risk whale populations, and exploring mitigation options.<BR>

<b><tt>The Threats Facing Whales</tt></b>


<p>

<br>

<img align=left src="U.gif">

<p>

<BR>



ntil recently whaling has been by far the greatest danger for whales. Even following full protection from whaling, when whale populations have been reduced to very low levels, they do not begin to recover for a number of decades, if ever.<BR>

 <BR>

In some cases, recovery may be slowed by the continuing annual kills allowed by the IWC for "aboriginal subsistence need", which in 1995 include around 65 bowheads off Alaska, 165 minkes from the depleted population off West Greenland, 19 fins off Greenland, and 2 humpbacks off St Vincent. Norway's commercial hunt for 301 minkes from the depleted Northeastern Atlantic population is also slowing recovery there.<BR>

<STRONG><BR>

Other threats to cetaceans</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Even when the prohibitions on whaling are fully enforced, or hunting of smaller cetaceans is controlled, whales and dolphins are vulnerable to the more recent threats to marine species now resulting from increasing human activities described below. Many cetacean species migrate annually between pelagic and coastal areas, and so are subject to different threats at different times of the year. There can be very few populations left of any cetacean anywhere in the world that are not affected by at least one of these threats, and most are facing a range of hazards. <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Bycatches in fisheries</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

During the past 25 years, the fishery bycatch problem has become one of the most serious threats worldwide to cetaceans, as well as to non-target fish, turtles, and seabirds. This period coincided with the rapid expansion of many fisheries, and in particular with the development of synthetic driftnets and gillnets.

<P>

<BR>

<BR>


Large-scale high seas driftnets have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of cetaceans of many species. In 1990, for example, the IWC estimated the mortality of cetaceans in driftnets (mostly of Japanese and Taiwanese origin) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Mediterranean to be between 315,600 and 1,060,200. There was no estimate for the Atlantic. At the start of 1993, the UN established a global moratorium on large-scale driftnets outside 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), but implementation of this ban needs to be closely monitored. Driftnetting continues with large cetacean bycatches, for example in the Italian swordfish fishery in the Mediterranean, in the French tuna fishery in the northeastern Atlantic, and within the EEZs of Russia and Japan.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Habitat degradation</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

River and coastal wildlife often suffers from habitat degradation in the same way as terrestrial species. Amongst cetaceans, the river dolphins are especially vulnerable, and have been seriously depleted because of vessel traffic, riverbank development, damming, and irrigation projects. The Yangtze and Indus river dolphins are both in danger of extinction. In addition, coastal development such as the widespread draining of mangrove swamps has reduced the food supply of young fish for cetaceans. Major engineering work, of which the construction of the new Hong Kong airport is a prime example, can seriously threaten resident coastal dolphins.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Chemical pollution</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

There has been a series of mass die-offs of marine mammals since the 1980s, including bottlenose dolphins along the Atlantic coast of the US in 1987 and 1988, striped dolphins in the Mediterranean in the early 1990s, harbour porpoises in the Black Sea, humpback whales in the western North Atlantic, and dolphins on the Texas coast in 1994. Most of these have been linked to high levels of PCBs found in the dead animals. The endangered beluga whales of the St Lawrence estuary are now among the most contaminated animals on earth, with tumours, reproductive problems, and heavy metal poisoning.<BR>

<BR>

The effects of industrial chemicals and pesticide run-off on whales and dolphins are subtle and insidious, but are potentially amongst the gravest threats to their survival. The evidence is growing that even low levels of contaminants, especially PCBs, DDT, and other persistent organochlorine chemicals, are increasing susceptibility to disease and decreasing fertility by interfering with the hormonal systems of many animals. If this continues, it is possible that some apparently stable populations of long-lived animals including whales could suddenly crash with very little warning. <BR>

<BR>

Chemicals such as the organochlorines become more and more concentrated in the bodies of animals the higher they are in the food chain. Until recently it was thought that the baleen whales were not so much at risk from pollutants as the toothed cetaceans such as belugas, sperm whales, and dolphins, since baleen whales feed on krill, plankton, and small fish at the top of a much shorter food chain. However, the most recent research suggests that baleen whales including grays and humpbacks are also affected. The chemicals accumulate in the whales' blubber while they feed heavily during the summer months, and are then released into their milk when they migrate to the winter calving grounds where there is little food.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Noise pollution</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Many whales and dolphins depend on sound for navigation and communication, and all the toothed species use echolocation ("seeing" by sending out sounds and receiving echoes from the objects around) for finding their food. If the underwater noise levels from boat traffic and industrial activity are too intense they may seriously affect the ability of cetaceans to communicate or to echolocate. Both oil drilling ships and seismic surveys are strongly suspected of having particularly severe effects on cetaceans. For example, in 1992, humpback whales off Newfoundland, Canada, were found with damaged ear structures after underwater blasting was used in constructing oil installations.<BR>

<STRONG><BR>

Global climate change</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

As the evidence accumulates of severe perturbations in ocean currents caused by global warming, whales cannot be expected to be immune from the consequences. For example, recent research shows increases in surface water temperature off the Californian coast linked to a significant decline in zooplankton, which is likely to affect all the species (fish and whales) dependent on it. There are also indications that the higher levels of solar radiation caused by the dramatic reduction in stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic has already led to significant declines in phytoplankton production. Phytoplankton is the basis of the entire food chain in the oceans.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Accidents and disturbance</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Many of the few remaining northern right whales in the North Atlantic have scars from boat propellers. Collisions with ships are a serious threat to them and other depleted whale populations. Another area in which caution is needed is the fast-growing whale- and dolphin-watching industry. Whale watching can provide valuable economic, scientific, and educational benefits, but care is needed to make sure that the additional boat traffic is regulated and the whales protected from harassment. In practice, whale-watching is mostly well managed, but in a few places much tighter regulation is needed, such as the dolphin- and pilot whale-watching in the Canary Islands.<BR>

even out of the 11 great whale species are considered endangered or vulnerable even after decades of protection from whaling. At least three of the small cetaceans are on the edge of extinction: the Indus and Yangtze river dolphins, and the little Mexican coastal porpoise, the vaquita. The status of almost all the rest of the world's 79 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises remains uncertain at best. They all face a variety of threats, which need a wide range of measures to combat them. Underlying all these measures are two essentials:

<p>

<BR>

<BR>

<dd>* the need for more research to provide a clearer picture of their status<BR>

<BR>

<dd>* the need for public education and involvement.


<p>

<BR>

<BR>

In order to secure the future of the world's whales, WWF believes the following actions must be undertaken:<BR>

<BR>

Give whales strong legal protection through laws and treaties<BR>

<BR>

One of the essential tools for conserving cetaceans is the use of national, regional, and international laws and conventions.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Control whaling through the IWC</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

The IWC, established under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, is the only international organization with the authority to regulate for whale conservation worldwide. Without the IWC there would be no international control of the whaling industry, no moratorium on commercial whaling, and no high seas whale sanctuaries. The moratorium must remain in place, and Norway and Russia's objections to it should be withdrawn. Given the complete failure throughout history of the whaling industry to operate sustainably, and its deplorable record of flouting of controls, extreme doubt will always remain as to whether regulations could ever be fully enforced if whaling reopened.  Further, WWF sees no benefit to the conservation of whales from commercial whaling, and no justification for its resumption.<BR>

<BR>

The IWC is continuing its work on the Revised Management Scheme (RMS), which includes the Revised Management Procedure (RMP) to replace the discredited 1974 "New Management Procedure". Any future RMS would have to include amongst other elements: (a) rigorous provisions for conducting the whale population surveys producing data for the RMP, with the surveys conducted under IWC auspices and with international inspection; (b) rigorous standards for catch data accuracy and analysis; (c) a stringent observation and international inspection scheme, with, for example, more than one inspector on each whaling vessel if it is at sea for longer than 12 hours; and (d) provisions to ensure that any scientific whaling catches are included in the total of RMP catch limits. An RMS which included at least all these elements would provide a framework for considering an RMS for aboriginal/subsistence whaling, which needs to be developed by the IWC. In addition, it would serve as a useful insurance to underpin the moratorium.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Strengthen the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

The IWC's 50 million km2 Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was established primarily to protect the southern hemisphere whales on their summer feeding grounds. It also provides an important opportunity for non-lethal scientific research and monitoring on undisturbed and recovering whale populations and the ecosystems of which they are part. Large-scale scientific whaling should not be conducted inside the sanctuary.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Control international trade in whale products</STRONG> <BR>

<BR>

CITES' controls on international trade are a crucial weapon in the effective enforcement of the moratorium. All whale species whose catching is regulated by the IWC have been listed in CITES' Appendix I since 1986, so international trade in all whale products is prohibited for states that are parties to CITES. "Importation from the sea", which covers killing whales beyond the 200-mile EEZ and bringing then into the country, is also prohibited when it is for commercial purposes. However, Japan and Russia both have six reservations, and Norway four, to the Appendix I listings. These reservations should be withdrawn. <BR>

<BR>

In spite of the efforts of CITES, there have been recent examples of smuggling and illegal trade in whalemeat involving Norway, Russia, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, and Japan, some of them brought to light by TRAFFIC investigations. The IWC has urged its members to clamp down on the trade, but further measures are necessary. In the meantime, NGO monitoring will continue.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Conserve smaller cetaceans through regional agreements</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

There is a long-standing disagreement as to whether the IWC has the legal authority to regulate the conservation of the smaller whales, dolphins, and porpoises as well as the larger whales. At present, the IWC can collect information about the status and threats to small cetaceans and request range states to take appropriate action. The necessary follow-up to these requests needs to be monitored and encouraged by other bodies, including NGOs. In addition, there are a number of regional agreements which provide a framework for addressing the threats to the smaller cetaceans, but more are needed and effective implementation and enforcement of the existing agreements are priorities.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Create more sanctuaries and marine protected areas</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Giving special legal protection to certain marine areas is an important tool in achieving the conservation of marine biodiversity, including the reduction of threats to whales and dolphins. As top predators, healthy populations of cetaceans will indicate healthy populations of their prey species, so that their conservation is important for people living and working in coastal areas. Many Marine Protected Areas will protect cetaceans that happen to be resident in them or migrate through them, but some reserves and sanctuaries have been established specifically to protect cetaceans, and many more need to be. <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Encourage well managed whale-watching</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Whale- and dolphin- watching is growing dramatically in many parts of the world, with over four million people taking part each year. The total annual revenue generated was estimated at over US$300 million in 1992. Providing it is well regulated so that there are no harmful effects on whale populations, its development should be encouraged both as a valuable non-consumptive sustainable replacement for whaling, and as a means of raising public interest and knowledge of whales and dolphins. <BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Reduce bycatches in wasteful fisheries</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Reduction of fisheries bycatch is essential not only for cetaceans and other non-target species, but also for the conservation of fish stocks and the human communities that depend on them. The use of long driftnets on the high seas is already the subject of a UN moratorium, but this needs to be strictly enforced, as does the European Union ban on driftnets.<BR>

 <BR>

Codes of practice, technical management measures, selective fishing gear, and practices that will minimize the bycatch of non-target species are all necessary. In some cases, relatively minor changes in fishing techniques can bring about a large reduction in cetacean bycatch, as has happened in the eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery. Such changes need rigorous observation and effective sanctions if they are to work. In other cases, the only solution will be closing fisheries in certain areas or certain seasons, or a return to less intensive fishing methods. If these measures are used, fishing communities will need government or aid agency help in making the necessary adjustments.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Reduce marine pollution</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

More research is needed into recent human-induced changes in the marine environment and their effects on the health and population dynamics of whales. Chemical pollution may well be one of the most serious long-term threats to cetaceans, and strict measures to limit contaminants such as DDT and PCBs entering the sea are necessary for their survival. Such measures are essential for conserving all marine life, as well as ensuring the health of fish-eating human communities.<BR>

Control and reduction of high-intensity undersea noises is also necessary, including precautionary guidelines for conducting seismic surveys in areas important for cetaceans.<BR>

<font size="+2"><b>  The Asian
		 Elephant
		 -- Wanted Alive!</b></font><p>
<IMG SRC="/images/help/alerts_elephants.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>



Although the plight of the African elephant has long captured public attention, its forgotten cousin in Asia is gravely endangered.<p>

Once herds of this majestic creature roamed freely in a habitat that stretched from what is now Syria and Iraq, to the Yellow River in China. Today, that habitat is vanishing at an unprecedented rated in a part of the world where more than half the entire human population lives--well over 3 billion people.<p>

Scientists estimate that no more than 50,000 Asian elephants survive in the wild today, hiding in scattered wilderness areas from India to Vietnam--with a tiny besieged population in China's Yunnan province.<p>

	If we don't act now, the Asian elephant could vanish forever. YOU CAN HELP. Right now. With a special wildlife rescue contribution to WWF of $15, $50--even $100. <p>

With your support, WWF will work with elephant range states to ensure that development projects do not needlessly fragment or destroy what habitat remains. We will also work to link wildlife sanctuaries with new corridors of protected land to provide safe migration routes for the wide-ranging Asian elephant.  <p>

So much is possible--if World Wildlife Fund has your support.<p>

<font size=+2><b>Poaching Outbreak Threatens Rhinos!</b></font><p>

<IMG SRC="/images/help/alerts_rhino.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>

Last spring, Garamba National Park was the site of two brutal poaching incidents--the first to hit this region of Zaire since 1984. Two rhinos--an adult male and a pregnant female--were slaughtered for private gain, their horns to be traded on the black market like so many commodities.<p>

Local park guards are worried. "We need more guards," they say.  "The poaching has become very intense. Sometimes we find there are only 10 of us against 40 poachers."  <p>

	YOU CAN HELP TURN THESE DEADLY ODDS AROUND. Right now.  With a special wildlife rescue contribution to WWF of $15, $50--even $100.<p>

Scientists estimate that 90 percent of Africa's rhinos have been lost to poachers in the past two decades alone! The cause is not hopeless, however, and today there is even some good news.<p>
  
In certain parts of Africa, including several wildife reserves in Kenya, rhino populations are more stable today than they've been in years--thanks in part to WWF's two-pronged approach to the crisis: (1) new and improved rhino sanctuaries on the ground and (2) new trade controls in Asian markets where much of the black market rhino horn is destined. 
<p>
These programs are effective. They are also costly. Won't you help WWF protect Africa's rhinos against the poachers who would drive them to extinction?

<b><font size=+2 color="#">Jaguars In Jeopardy!</font></b>
<p><IMG SRC="/images/help/alerts_jaguar.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>

Time is running out for the last jaguars on Earth! Once this big cat could be found in both North and South America. In fact, not too long ago, jaguars might have been seen in the southwestern United States.
<p>
But today, its range has shrunk dramatically. Even some of its last tropical forest strongholds in Latin America are at risk.
<p>
Careless habitat destruction and the black market trade in illegal wildlife and wildlife products both threaten the jaguar's survival.
<p>
	YOU CAN HELP TURN THIS PICTURE AROUND. Right now.  Your special wildlife rescue contribution of $15, $25--even $100 can help World Wildlife Fund protect the jaguar and its tropical forest home in places like Belize's Cockscomb Reserve and Manu National Park in Peru.
<p>
Like so many animals you have seen on nature programs or read about in natural history magazines, jaguars need a lot of space to roam. Won't you help us protect the forest habitat they need to survive?
<p>
So much is possible--if World Wildlife Fund has your support.

<TABLE border=0 cellpadding=4><TR><TD><font size=+1><B>Compost Those Leaves</B></font></TR></TD>

<TR><TD>Americans throw away approximately 24 million tons of leaves and grass a year; so much that leaves alone account for 75% of the solid waste in the fall. For a green alternative to throwing away your leaves and organic kitchen garbage, try composting. </TR></TD>
<P>
<TR><TD>70% of the lawn and kitchen garbage Americans create is compostable. Why not put this waste to work for you? By composting, you'll help the environment by reducing solid waste and help yourself by producing a compost for you garden. In fact, compost beds both inhibit weed growth and improve soil, so you'll also be keeping your yard and soil healthy.</TR></TD>
<P>
<TR><TD><B>How to Compost:</B> </TR></TD>
<TR><TD><OL>
<LI>Start with a six inch layer of sticks and twigs to circulate air beneath the pile.
<LI>Add a layer of dry organic materials (leaves, grass clippings).
<LI>Add a layer of organic kitchen waste.
<LI>Continue steps 2 and 3 until pile is at least 3 feet high.
<LI> After 6-12 months, the compost is ready to be used in the garden.</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>Another garden tip: plant indigenous grass, trees, and shrubs. Since they are used to the local environment, they require less care (meaning less water and pesticides).</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>For more information about composting: write the Seattle Tilth Association, 4649 Sunnyside Avenue, No., Seattle, Washington, 98103.  They produce a guide entitled "Home Composting" for $3 (US).</TR></TD></TABLE>

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2><p>



With cooler temperatures just around the corner, now's the time to look for ways your windows can help you stay warm and reduce heating bills both at home and in the office.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep windows near your thermostat tightly closed.</b> Otherwise, your thermostat will keep working even after the rest of the room has reached a comfortable temperature.

<li><b>Insulate windows with thick curtains or blinds to reduce heat loss.</b> Thermal draperies, made with a thick, fiber-filled backing to fit snugly against the entire window frame, can reduce heat loss by as much as 50 percent and save you $15 per window.

<li><b>Install storm windows for an extra layer of insulation.</b> If you can't install storm windows, apply a sheet of heavy-duty clear plastic over each window. Easy-to-install window insulation kits are available at most hardware stores.

<li><b>Replace leaky windows with energy-efficient ones.</b> Because energy-efficient windows save energy, they also help reduce global warming and air pollution. A variety of double- and triple-paned energy-saving windows are available from hardware stores and window suppliers.

</ul>
<b><i>Did you know. . .</i></b>
<blockquote>
	For the $25 it might cost to insulate the average 12-window, two-door house, you could save 10 percent or more of your yearly heating bill.<p>

	If every gas-heated home were properly caulked and weather-stripped, enough natural gas would be saved each year to heat another 4 million homes.<p>

	Simple heavy drapes attached to windows with a valance could save about $10 per window in heating costs each winter.<p></blockquote>

This cool tip of the week is brought to you by <a href="http://www.earthshare.org">EarthShare</a>, a federation of America's leading nonprofit environmental and conservation charities. EarthShare promotes environmental education and charitable giving in workplace and payroll charity campaigns.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2><p>

Americans use approximately 2.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year. Research shows that target pests will eventually develop resistance to these pesticides anyway.<p>

<ul>
<li>	Seventy-three different kinds of pesticides have been found in groundwater, which is potential drinking water.</li>

<li>	More than 100 active pesticide ingredients are suspected of causing cancer, birth defects, and gene mutation.</li>
	
<li>	A growing list of pesticides have the potential to disrupt the immune and endocrine systems and of having long term impacts on the offspring of exposed humans and animals.</li>
</ul><p>
<b>Learn about alternatives.</b><p>
<ul>
<li>	Grow wildflowers and herbs that encourage beneficial insects.</li>

<li>	Buy organic food. It's healthier and safer, and your purchases encourage farmers to grow organically.</li>

<li>	Use organic methods of pest control. For example, put a mixture of soap and water on plants to fight garden insects). If every lawn owner did this, 2.5 to 5 million pounds of toxic chemicals would be removed from the environment every year.</li></ul><p>

Rogue River Conservation</font></B>

<BR><BR>
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A $25,000 grant from World Wildlife Fund will
help the Curry Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) restore the
beauty and natural resources of Lobster Creek, along Oregon's Lower
Rogue River. 	
<BR><BR>
William M. Eichbaum, WWF U.S. Program Vice President, will present the
award at 10 a.m., Wednesday, Jan. 8, at the Medford Fabrication
Conference Room, 1109 Court St., Medford, OR.
<BR><BR>
The award is the first of 10 annual awards funded by Joseph F.
Cullman 3rd, in memory of the late Walter A. Haas, Jr., of San Francisco.
 Haas, former chairman and CEO of Levi Strauss Company, often
vacationed and fished along the Rogue River.  His family owns the
famed Zane Grey fishing camp on the Lower Rogue.
<BR><BR>
Cullman will give WWF $300,000 to fund organizations dedicated to
conserving or restoring the fisheries resources of the Rogue River
basin, which is being degraded by human activities.   
<BR><BR>
Using data collection, monitoring and adaptive management techniques,
Curry SWCD and Watershed Initiatives, a private organization, will
coordinate a restoration strategy between the U.S. Forest Service,
which manages lands in the upper basin of Lobster Creek, and private
land owners in the lower basin.  The project is designed to provide
better habitat and productivity to remnant native salmonid populations,
including coho salmon, winter steelhead, fall chinook salmon, and
sea-run cutthroat trout populations.
<BR><BR>
"The Curry Soil and Water Conservation District and Watershed
Initiatives are doing vital work to protect the natural resources of the
Rogue River watershed," Eichbaum said.  "We hope that the Walter A.
Haas, Jr. Conservation Award will help them in their efforts to preserve
the biodiversity and natural beauty of this spectacular region of
Southwestern Oregon." 	
<BR><BR>
WWF works in more than 100 countries worldwide to preserve the
abundance and diversity of life on earth.  In recent years, WWF has
taken on more projects in the United States focusing on fisheries
management and habitat improvement, including projects in the
Everglades, the upper Mississippi River Basin, and on both coasts.    
<BR><BR>
WWF manages the award program in collaboration with the Rogue
Valley Council of Governments (RVCG) and a local advisory committee
that will assist WWF in determining criteria for award selection, and the
types of organizations, projects, and expenses that will be eligible for
the award program.
<BR><BR>
WWF received eight applications for the 1996 Haas Award, covering a
variety of projects including landscape level planning, environmental
education, community consensus-building, promotion of
environmentally-sound economic development, and inventory and data
collection.
<BR><BR>
Two organizations received honorable mentions for their grant
applications.  The Ashland Parks and Recreation Department was
recognized for its project entitled "Bear Creek Watershed Education and
Action Program," and the Applegate River Watershed Council was
honored for "Little Applegate Landscape Design:  The Private Land
Component."
<BR><BR>
WWF will award $25,000 Haas Awards each year for nine more years. 
To be placed on a mailing list to receive information about next year's
program, contact Marc Prevost, Rogue Valley Council of Governments,
Water Resources Department, 155 South Second Street, P.O. Box 3275,
Central Point, Oregon 97502. 

<BR><BR><HR><BR>

WWF, known worldwide by its panda logo, leads international efforts to
save life on earth. Now in its fourth decade, WWF works in more than
100 countries around the globe.

<B><font size=+1>Just in Time for the Holidays, Two Panda Births in the
Wild
</font>
<BR>Baby Giant Pandas Bring Glad Tidings of Great Joy
</B>

<BR><BR>
World Wildlife Fund scientists report the addition of two panda babies in
the wilds of China's Qinling Mountains.  The radio-collared giant panda
mothers, Jiao Jiao and Nu Xia, have given birth to a cub each.  The
possibility exists of a third birth, but field researchers have been unable
to confirm it without disturbing the would-be mother.

<BR><BR>"We are thrilled at the news," said Ginette Hemley, WWFs
director of international wildlife policy.  "Giant pandas in the wild are so
endangered every newborn gives us renewed hope that we will
eventually succeed in increasing the wild population."

<BR><BR>At birth, these baby pandas could fit in a teaspoon, weighing
between 90 and 130 grams.  Sometimes, a giant panda mother can
accidentally crush its newborn.

<BR><BR>Numbering as few as 1000 in the wild in China, the giant
panda is one of the most critically endangered animals on earth.  Habitat
loss and poaching have been major reasons for the species' decline,
but pandas are also in big demand by zoos around the world.  In the
past, loans from China have created incentives for removing pandas
from the wild, and although they are more carefully regulated today, the
loans must be closely monitored to ensure they do not threaten the
panda's survival in the wild.

<B><font size=+1>WWF Report Indicates Arctic Species Under Serious
Threat from Global Warming 
</font>
<BR>
Unusual Weather in Russia, Alaska Keeps Reindeer From Food
Supply</B>

<BR><BR>
WASHINGTON, DC  -- If current global warming models hold true, Santa
may soon have to find alternative transportation -- such as a
solar-powered sleigh -- to deliver the gifts this Christmas.  
<BR><BR>
A new report from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says that Arctic wildlife
such as reindeer (known as caribou in North America), polar bears,
ringed seals, and a host of plant species and migratory birds are all
threatened by global warming and its effects -- earlier springs, loss of
pack ice, and dwindling/shifting food supplies.
<BR><BR>
The report findings have been underlined by reports that thousands of
reindeer in the Russian Northeast may starve to death due to unusual
weather events (4,500 have already died).  Warmer than usual
temperatures earlier this year caused large-scale melting that has now
frozen and covered the animals' food supply with a concrete-like layer
of ice.  Also, two herds of reindeer in Alaska are being forced south
from their regular wintering area due to the same situation.  Half of the
Central Arctic herd is now missing, including 25 reindeer wearing radio
collars.  Scientists say extreme weather events like this are occurring
more frequently due to climate change.
 <BR><BR>
"Global warming is threatening Arctic ecosystems and their peoples
from all sides as never before in history, said Jay R. Malcolm of the
University of Toronto's Forestry Faculty.  "Unless urgent actions are
taken to control fossil fuel burning, we may witness the end of an
ecosystem in the next few generations."
<BR><BR>
The situation is serious considering that many of the world's most
distinctive mammals, such as walruses, certain seals, arctic foxes,
polar bears, bowhead whales and narwhals are only found in the
arctic.  Additionally, 15 percent of the world's bird species breed in the
arctic.  Among the report's findings:
<UL><LI>detailed climate models suggest that a doubling of greenhouse
gas concentrations will lead to a 30 percent reduction in the tundra
available to Arctic species;</LI>

<LI>the climate is changing at a faster rate than anything in the recent
past, including the ice ages, and the majority of arctic organisms have
never witnessed changes of this sort;</LI>

<LI>warmer weather will cause more seal snow caves to collapse,
exposing seal pups to the bitter cold.  Faced with fewer seal prey, polar
bear populations would also decline; </LI>

<LI>polar bears, which are entirely dependent on pack ice, could
become extinct if the Arctic Ocean were to become ice free for long
enough;</LI>

<LI>thinning sea ice allows increasing numbers of non-indigenous
grizzly bears, hunters, tourists and ships, to threaten the lifestyle,
culture and ecosystem of the indigenous Inuit populations. </LI></UL>

"Arctic organisms from the smallest plant to the largest mammal are
reliant on each other for survival," said Adam Markham, director of
WWF's Climate Change Campaign.  "Global warming could cause a
domino effect, resulting in massive loss of species diversity."
<BR><BR>
Arctic reindeer herds best illustrate the dilemma.  Reindeer populations
depend on a delicate balance of climate, food supplies and predators (or
lack thereof) to maintain their numbers, and a slight deviation in any of
these factors can have dire consequences.  
<BR><BR>
An example is the porcupine caribou herd, whose numbers are
currently stable at 150,000.  The herd's traditional calving grounds are a
good mix of strong food supply, lack of predators such as wolves and
grizzlies, and sanctuary from biting flies and mosquitos.  
<BR><BR>
However, consensus of the Porcupine Caribou Management Board
(PCMB), a monitoring group, is that eviction from the calving grounds
would have dire consequences for the herd.  Global warming appears
to be doing just that.  Earlier and earlier springs are moving the herd's
food supply further north, pushing the animals away from their
traditional feeding grounds, and placing them on a collision course with
new oil development -- development that ironically is being made easier
by the global warming-induced breakup of sea ice.
<BR><BR>
Further east in the Canadian arctic, other caribou herds are also having
difficulties handling the climate.  Field data suggest that the predicted 2-4
degree temperature increase in the coming decades would 
result in a linear increase in the level of insect harassment, and a 
corresponding loss of energy reserves.  Add this to a predicted 30-50
percent increase in winter snowfall and the associated increase in
energy needed to dig for food, and we could see anywhere from a 40
percent decline to a complete reproductive failure among the herds.

<B><font size=+1> Conservation Plans Must Accompany Economic Development, Says WWF</B></font>
<BR><BR>
<B>Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia</B> -- On the eve of the hemispheric-wide environment summit, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) calls on participating heads of state to incorporate natural resource conservation into their countries' economic development plans.
<BR><BR>
"Without governmental intervention through regulation or market incentives that promote sustainable use of natural resources, private sector firms will eventually weaken financial and social stability in the region because they are driven by a profit motive and will not compromise maximization of profits for social or environmental well being," said Pamela Hathaway, Senior Program Officer at WWF. "In the long-term, lack of attention to the environment will lead to impoverishment rather than the desired development and viability." 
<BR><BR>
According to Hathaway, foreign direct investment in Latin America reached nearly $21 billion in 1994 and portfolio investment has risen from practically nothing in the 1980s to almost one third of net resource flows in Latin America.
<BR><BR>
WWF believes the great strides made toward democratization in the region and the opening of national markets offers an unprecedented opportunity to establish mechanisms that lead to protection of the environment and natural resources that sustain us all.
<BR><BR>
Such successful mechanisms supported by WWF include:
<UL><LI> encouraging responsible business practices;
<LI> working for wide-ranging support of international conservation treaties, such as the Biological Diversity Convention, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES);
<LI>creating markets for sustainably produced products and equitably distributing the profits from such ventures.</UL>

Some regional examples point the way towards collaboration among national, public and private sectors in natural resource management. For example, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico have made advances toward sustainable use of water by transferring the management of certain water services to the private sector while the state maintains its responsibility to monitor and ensure water quality.
<BR><BR>
WWF will promote the transfer of management responsibility of energy resources such as electricity and gas from the public to the private sector as a way to help protect resources.
<BR><BR>
Said Gonzalo Castro, WWF Program Director for Latin America and the Caribbean: "Privatization offers the opportunity to reform management systems and to set conditions for investment that ensure that natural resource sustainability remain a priority. Privatization must go hand in hand with state efforts to ensure the health and security of citizens."
<BR><BR>
According to WWF, the region's governments must encourage sustainable resource use through responsible policy incentives that encourage adequate and transparent management of natural resources and promote private sector investment in the countries' institutional, environmental and physical infrastructure.

<B><font size=+1>Latin America & Caribbean Fresh Water Ecosystems In Peril</B></font>

<BR><BR>

<B>Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia</B> -- Nearly all of Latin America and the Caribbean's freshwater ecosystems are threatened, according to findings of an analysis released today by World Wildlife Fund.
<BR><BR>
The analysis, supported by the Biodiversity Support Program and the US Agency for International Development, reveals that 97 of Latin America and the Caribbean's 111 freshwater ecoregions are at risk.
<BR><BR>
"On the eve of this historic, hemispheric-wide environment summit, it is vitally important for participating leaders to be aware of this serious threat and use this opportunity to establish programs to combat the problem," said Gonzalo Castro, WWF's Program Director for Latin America and the Caribbean.  
<BR><BR>
Some of the main problems leading to the deterioration of freshwater ecosystems identified in the study are:
<UL><LI>Deforestation, erosion and massive sedimentation within drainage basins; (This is largely due to excessive grazing and agricultural activities on lands ill-suited or requiring environmentally unsound techniques.)
<LI>Damming and channelization of rivers and wetlands;
<LI>Urban and rural pollution from residential and industrial sewage treatment plants.</UL> 

WWF believes governments' responses to destruction of freshwater habitats in Latin America -- which are some of the most diverse on earth -- have been inadequate.  
<BR><BR>
"These habitats are truly spectacular and contain, for example, more fish species than anywhere on earth, yet planning and environmental education have been left by the wayside and rarely have the topics of development and water been focused on in the context of a global vision," Castro said, calling on government leaders to develop action plans that incorporate the protection of water systems.
<BR><BR>
Castro said particular attention should be paid to:
<UL><LI>the management and integrated planning of watersheds as natural entities, with particular emphasis on conserving distinctive freshwater biodiversity;
<LI> the development of production and distribution systems for potable water;
<LI>the investment in treatment systems for drinking water;
<LI>the establishment and implementation of laws protecting bodies of water from contamination.</UL>

Water and drainage infrastructure will require millions of dollars worth of investment over the next 20 years and WWF believes the private sector and governments have a critical role to play in incorporating protection of freshwater ecosystems into development plans for the health and enjoyment of future generations.

<B><font size=+1>WWF Calls on Governments to Reform UN General Assembly Oceans Debate</B></font>


<BR><BR>
<B>NEW YORK CITY</B> -- Governments should seize next week's UN General Assembly debate on oceans and fisheries as an opportunity to deal with urgent problems and bring some sense of direction to the many international agreements, agencies and programs that deal with marine issues, according to World Wildlife Fund (WWF)*.
<BR><BR>
WWF, the world's largest private conservation organization, will unveil proposed reforms to the annual marine discussion during a press briefing at 1:30 p.m. Dec. 5 in the UN Correspondents Association Club.
<BR><BR>
"Governments have agreed to undertake an annual review and evaluation of oceans issues in the General Assembly," said Joy Hyvarinen, WWF's International Treaties Coordinator. "If they are going to continue wasting this much-needed opportunity to agree on common directions for international cooperation on oceans issues, the oceans debate should be abolished."
<BR><BR>
WWF believes the oceans debate is a good example of why UN reform efforts will not succeed unless governments are willing to reform their own actions at the UN. 
<BR><BR>
With nearly 100 legally binding multi-lateral treaties that deal with the marine environment, WWF finds it extremely important to have one place where the international community can set broad global priorities and policy directions to avoid overlap and ensure the best use of scarce resources. The UN General Assembly oceans debate is the perfect forum.
<BR><BR>
Sadly, past debates have lacked substantive discussion and there are few signs that this year will be any different.
<BR><BR>
The General Assembly is the oversight body for such marine agreements as the new UN Fish Stocks Agreement.
<BR><BR>
"The unwillingness of regional fisheries bodies to begin implementing the UN Fish Stocks Agreement should be discussed as an emergency by the UN General Assembly this year," said Indrani Lutchman, WWF's Fisheries Officer.
<BR><BR>
WWF also believes the UN General Assembly should alert international agencies and governments to new priorities, such as the threat to marine life from endocrine disruptors.
<BR><BR>
"Endocrine disruptors are synthetic chemicals which mimic hormones found in both humans and wildlife, with effects such as reduced fertility," said Barbara Rutherford, WWF's Policy Coordinator on Water Pollution & Toxics. "They have emerged as a serious threat to endangered marine life and we need urgent action."
<BR><BR>
For example, beluga whales of the St. Lawrence River are among the most contaminated animals on earth. They have such high levels of toxic chemicals in their bodies that they could qualify as toxic waste under Canadian law. 
<BR><BR>
Also disturbing are increasing mass marine mammal die-offs. Since the 1980s they include:
<UL><LI>10,000 seals that died in 1987 at Lake Baikal in the former Soviet Union;
<LI>20,000 harbour seals that died in 1988 in the North Sea;
<LI>1,000 striped dolphins that died between 1990 and 1993 in the Mediterranean sea;
<LI>700 bottlenose dolphins that died in 1987 along the Atlantic coast of the United States. </UL>

Said Hyvarinen: "It's truly tragic to see governments squandering an opportunity for serious debate. It's particularly disturbing since the health of our marine ecosystems is rapidly deteriorating."

<B><font size=+1>New Study Reports 30 to 70 Million Sharks Killed Each Year:</font><BR>
First Comprehensive Report on International Shark Trade Finds
Shark Fishing Vast, Growing & Largely Unregulated</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>WASHINGTON, DC </B>-- Every year an estimated 30 to 70 million sharks are killed to support a growing worldwide trade in their fins and other products.
<BR><BR>
A new report released today, <I>An Overview of World Trade in Sharks</I>, warns that widespread, unmanaged, and wasteful catches of global shark populations may result in commercial fisheries collapses, local species extinction, and depletion of highly migratory stocks.  Unless action is taken by national and international fisheries agencies, many shark fisheries, which have become economic alternatives to other crashing fisheries throughout the world, will rapidly share the same fate.
<BR><BR>
The three-year research effort, produced by World Wildlife Fund's wildlife trade monitoring program, TRAFFIC, highlights the expanding trade networks and increasing availability of a variety of shark products in markets and marketplaces throughout the world.  Shark fin, meat, livers and other parts are used for food or as ingredients in health and beauty aids.  
<BR><BR>
According to the report, the annual world catch of sharks has been increasing since the early 1940s, with the total catch reaching over 730,000 metric tons in 1994.  To date, more than 19 countries and territories reported catches of 10,000 metric tons or more.  An additional 250,000 tons are reportedly discarded when caught.
<BR><BR>
"We are truly tempting fate.  Sharks are the top ocean predator and we have no idea if we're past the point of no return for some species," said Andrea Gaski, TRAFFIC director of research and an author of the report.  "As sharks decline, the balance of their marine ecosystems may be irreversibly affected and impact other important fish populations in those same areas."
<BR><BR>
Sharks, of which there are at least 350 species, inhabit all oceans of the world from the Arctic to the Antarctic.
<BR><BR>
Unlike other fish like tuna which rapidly reproduce, sharks are particularly susceptible to overfishing because they have long life cycles (many can live up to 30 years) and reproduce slowly (some of the more exploited species do not reach sexual maturity until their teens and produce only a small number of offspring in their lifetime).  As a result, sharks occur in lower numbers, and are unable to rebound when populations are reduced further when targeted by commercial fishers.
<BR><BR>
Many sharks are caught in fisheries for other species but some vessels target sharks in addition to or as an alternative to species such as tuna or swordfish.  Longliner vessels catch perhaps the largest number of sharks each year.  More than 100 sharks can be caught each day by a single ship, commonly setting lines over 20 miles long with thousands of hooks.
<BR><BR>
Indonesia is the world's leading shark fishing nation in terms of reported catches, which more than doubled from 42,900 metric tons in 1980 to 92,900 in 1994.
<BR><BR>
The United States is a major supplier and consumer of shark meat and fin as well as an importing, exporting and reexporting nation for shark products.  Total shark catches in the United States rose from 2,554 metric tons in 1985 to 7,436 metric tons in 1994 despite a federal management plan and restrictions.
<BR><BR>
Shark fins are the most sought after commodity.  Fins are used in Asian cuisine.  Because most shark meat has a low value, when many sharks are caught, their fins are cut off and the carcass tossed back into the ocean.  At least 125 countries are involved in the shark fin trade, with Hong Kong at its center.
<BR><BR>
Increasing Asian demand for shark fin, including the opening of China as a seemingly unlimited market for fin in the mid-1980s, have contributed to a significant increase in world shark fin prices.  Fins are now the world's most expensive fisheries products.  Value varies according to color, size, and thickness.  	In Hong Kong, the world capital of shark fin cuisine, retail prices generally range from US$40 per kilo to US$564 per kilo, while a bowl of shark fin soup can sell for up to US$90.
<BR><BR>
"Evaluating the damage that we are inflicting on sharks presents a huge challenge," said Scott Burns, WWF director of Fish Conservation.  "The rapid growth in the shark fishery will be disastrous in the absence of improved basic fisheries management based on essential research and data collection."
<BR><BR>
Presently, virtually no international controls exist on shark fisheries.  Only a few countries place limits on fishing for sharks in their coastal waters.  In 1993, the United States implemented a Fisheries Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean that applies to 73 species, although only 39 shark species are actively managed through a quota system.
<BR><BR>
The TRAFFIC report recommends:
<UL>
<LI>Adopting universal principles & codes of ethical fisheries that address shark research and data collection needs;

<LI>International, state and regional fisheries agencies should initiate and/or improve data collection to determine the species of sharks caught in commercial, subsistence, and recreational fisheries;

<LI>All relevant agencies should work cooperatively to eliminate the common, but wasteful bycatch from many commercial fisheries by improving fishing techniques and gear types for greater selectivity for target species, reducing mortality of bycatch, and utilizing dead catch; and,

<LI>Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) should monitor the work of relevant agencies in improving data collection on shark fisheries and trade.</UL>

<B><font size=+1>New Tiger Count Gives Hope</font></B>
<BR><BR>
<B>WASHINGTON, DC </B> --  In a new survey released today, World Wildlife Fund announced that the critically endangered Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East has grown over the past few years, due to improved antipoaching and protection efforts.
<BR><BR>
The last complete tiger survey in 1985 identified only about 250 animals.  The recently-concluded analysis of a survey undertaken during the winter of 1995-96 indicates that tiger numbers are now around 430.  Siberian tiger surveys are conducted in winter months when biologists can follow tiger tracks in the snow.
<BR><BR>
"This is extremely important news from a conservation perspective," said Ginette Hemley, WWF director of international wildlife policy.  "It shows that, with focused and concerted efforts, we can reverse the decline of tiger populations.  It is critical to continue building on this progress to ensure a full recovery of Russia's tigers."
<BR><BR>
The Siberian tiger population was hit by disastrous poaching in the early 1990s.  Prompted by the lucrative trade in tiger parts used in traditional Asian medicines, at least 180 tigers were poached between 1991 and 1994.  Practitioners grind up the bones and use them for a variety of cures in countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan.
<BR><BR>
Trade experts note that the sale of one tiger skeleton can yield profits equivalent to more than what some Asians can earn in 10 years.
<BR><BR>
"Saving the tiger will require both on-the-ground antipoaching efforts and more effective enforcement of trade prohibitions from the consumer countries," said Hemley.  
<BR><BR>
"Every positive step forward is a huge leap toward saving this top predator.  With this welcome news WWF plans to step up its trade monitoring and conservation activities in the Russian Far East."

<B><font size=+1>This Holiday Season, If you like Caviar, Those Eggs You Eat May be Poached:</B></font>
<BR><B>Sturgeon, dubbed "Swimming Currency," for Precious Caviar</B>

<BR><BR>
WASHINGTON, DC -- As party-throwing season fast approaches, hosts and hostesses pull out all the stops for their holiday bashes.  Platters are heavy with delicate sashimi, extravagant truffles, and luxurious caviar.
<BR><BR>
According to a newly released study, however, caviar-producing sturgeons the world over are experiencing rapid decline, and as they disappear the lucrative gourmet market for their eggs will collapse.  
<BR><BR>
The study, published by TRAFFIC, World Wildlife Fund's wildlife trade monitoring program, is entitled, <U>Sturgeons of the Caspian Sea and the International Trade in Caviar</U>.  It reports that almost all of the world's caviar comes from the Caspian Sea and from three sturgeon species:  Beluga or giant sturgeon (Huso huso), Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedti), and stellate sturgeon (A. stellatus).  The number of adult sturgeons living in the Caspian Sea is estimated to have declined from 142 million in 1978 to 43.5 million in 1994, mostly as a result of overfishing.
<BR><BR>
Russia and Iran are the main caviar suppliers, and, investigators believe illegal harvest may involve 90 percent of the total trade, valued at around US$125 million.
<BR><BR>
"The dissolution of the USSR led to dramatic changes in the Caspian sturgeon fishery," said Andrea Gaski, director of research for TRAFFIC.  "With significant illegal trade, little regulation, tremendous profits and increasing demand, sturgeon species are perched precariously on the edge of extinction."
<BR><BR>
While sturgeon management plans exist, they are not enforced, and are ignored by fishers and industry. Of the 29 known sturgeon species, nine occur in North America.  However, experts consider the best tasting caviar to be from the Caspian Sea.
<BR><BR>
According to US Customs records, the United States imports the bulk of its domestic consumption of caviar, including 60 metric tons in 1995.  This caviar, imported primarily from Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, was declared at US$11.9 million, but if sold at a rough average price of US$25 an ounce would have a retail value of about $32.9 million.
<BR><BR>
In the United States, caviar is found in upscale food and department stores for prices ranging from US$10 an ounce for Tennessee river sturgeon to US$80 an ounce for Russia beluga.  Caviar is only considered caviar if it comes from the sturgeon species.  All other is regarded as roe or eggs.
<BR><BR>
The study found that the city of Astrakhan in Russia and the state of Azerbaijan may be the two major suppliers of illegal Caspian caviar.  Caviar is illegally exported from Russia, or may be repacked and falsely labelled in Eastern Europe before reappearing in retail markets.
<BR><BR>
"The supply of superior caviar is so low, traders are now mislabelling lower quality eggs and charging superior prices," said Gaski.  "Buyers may not be getting what they're paying for."
<BR><BR>
Investigators reported covert sales of caviar in destination countries, suggesting equally covert importation.  In the United States, recent Russian immigrants in New York sold caviar from suitcases in the early 1990s; students who have visited Russia sold caviar to restaurants in Paris; and, in France east Europeans at an international bridge tournament offered caviar at suspiciously low prices.
<BR><BR>
The threat to sturgeon is heightened by the indiscriminate methods used by poachers.  While fishing for the egg-carrying females (about seven percent of the catch), poachers kill all fish they catch, including males and juveniles.  In addition, the practice of trawling in the Caspian--banned by the USSR in 1959 and still banned by Russia as well as Iran--is in use once again.
<BR><BR>
Sturgeons are one of the oldest types of living vertebrates on earth.  Considered "living fossils," they evolved 250 million years ago, surviving the disappearance of the dinosaur.  Although the species is well-protected from attack by non-human predators by their bony exterior, sturgeon populations are vulnerable to overfishing because of their late sexual maturity (between six and 25 years), and a limited number of spawning grounds.
<BR><BR>
In the 19th century, the United States led the world in caviar production, providing 90 percent of the global caviar trade, including 60,000 pounds annually from Lake Michigan alone.
<BR><BR>
Then, sturgeons were so abundant the meat was sold for a penny a pound and barkeepers gave away the overly salty caviar to keep the beer taps flowing.  In 1910, however, sturgeon in the United States were nearly extinct and US production stopped.  Since then, caviar production shifted to Caspian Sea fisheries.
<BR><BR>
Though traditionally considered a luxury item of the wealthy, caviar is featured prominently in Russian restaurants that are opening up all over the country.  Caviar bars in trendy eating and drinking establishments are becoming increasingly popular in major cities.  Cruise lines are also major purchasers of caviar.  One line spends about US$900,000 a year on caviar, with each ship using about 900kg.
<BR><BR>
To combat sturgeon decline, the report recommends:
<UL><LI>a common fisheries policy by all Caspian states concerned with development of clear legislation and a ban on open-sea trawling;

<LI>an evaluation to determine whether Caspian sturgeon species would meet criteria for trade bans or quotas on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES);

<LI>adoption of sturgeon species that meet the above criteria onto CITES listings.

<LI>a certification and labelling scheme be developed for caviar produced from legal sturgeon fisheries.

<LI>United States form an interagency taskforce to examine and strengthen US import controls to stop the illegal trade.

<B><font size=+1>Japan Dispatches Whaling Fleet to Antarctic; Ignores US Entreaties</font><BR>Administration's Diplomatic Efforts Rebuffed</B>

<BR><BR>WASHINGTON -- Ignoring U.S. requests, Japan will launch its whaling fleet this week to begin a slaughter of 440 minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean.  Japan's whale hunt will take place within the Southern Ocean Sanctuary, a global wildlife preserve the U.S. helped create, and is Japan's deepest trespass into the Sanctuary to date.
<BR><BR>
"Japan's pirate whale hunt makes a mockery of the Antarctic Sanctuary and offends world norms on wildlife conservation," said Richard Mott, vice president of World Wildlife Fund.  "Despite a commitment by the Clinton Administration to end Japan's whaling, insufficient pressure was brought to bear, and the hunt goes forward."
<BR><BR>
In a report to Congress last February, President Clinton refrained from imposing trade sanctions on Japan, pledging instead to "vigorously pursue high-level efforts" aimed at curbing Japan's whaling before the beginning of the current Antarctic season.  Administration efforts, however, have been sporadic and entirely rebuffed by the Japanese.  
<BR><BR>
Japan's whale kill is carried out under a "scientific whaling" loophole in an 11-year global moratorium on commercial whaling.  Japan claims not to recognize the Antarctic Sanctuary and sells as sushi the meat of whales it kills there ostensibly for "science."  In the past four years the number of whales killed annually has more than tripled.
<BR><BR>
"President Clinton must personally take up the issue of Japan's whaling when he meets with Prime Minister Hashimoto next month," Mott said.  "Japan has made it clear that anything short of the highest level of intervention will be ignored."  The two leaders are slated to meet Nov. 20 at an Asia-Pacific trade conference in the Philippines.

<B><font size=+1>As Marine Ecosystems Grow More Threatened, Environmental Groups Call for Eight Key Actions</B></font>

<p>
The world's oceans cover 70 percent of the planet's surface and account for 99 percent of the volume known to sustain life on Earth.   An estimated 200 million people depend on fish for their protein and 20 million people derive their living from the sea--whether through fisheries or ecotourism.  
<p>
With increasing humankind pressures endangering ocean and coastal resources, three leading international environmental organizations have identified policy and legal reforms needed to protect marine biodiversity.
<p>
Released on the eve of the World Conservation Congress in Montreal (14-18 October), Biodiversity in the Seas was published by the Center of International Environmental Law (CIEL), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the World Conservation Union (IUCN).  The report recommends eight action items and five general principles for carrying out those international reforms.
<p>
"Marine and coastal ecosystems have tremendous practical value for humans," said Tundi Agardy, WWF senior marine scientist and one of the authors of the report.  "Many societies still operate on the assumption that the ocean offers a wealth of limitless resources, but if we don't change the way we treat the seas, we will lose much of this resource in a few decades."
<p>
Some of the eight action steps include:  establishing and maintaining marine protected areas for conservation and sustainable use;  prevention or eradication of harmful alien species; capacity building to use and share benefits from marine genetic resources and, ensuring protection of indigenous communities rights.  The action items were developed to assist in implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity in Marine and Coastal Habitats.
<p>
"One important step toward recognizing the value of marine biodiversity is for each country to sign the relevant international agreements," said David Downes, a study author and CIEL senior attorney.  "Some countries, particularly the United States, must ratify the Biodiversity Convention and the Law of the Sea Convention for these treaties to be most encompassing and effective."
<p>
The groups are also calling for reform of shrimp and farming operations that are destroying mangrove forests in many tropical countries like Sri Lanka, India, and the Philippines.
<p>
"Once countries have ratified the Convention and other international agreements, implementation and enforcement is the next step," said A. Charlotte de Fontaubert, principal author and CIEL marine consultant.  "All over the world people are successfully protecting their marine resources through conservation projects supported by improved laws and policies.  We can and should learn from their practical experience."

<B><font size=+1>Unique Exchange Program Breathes New Life into Mississippi and Rhine:</B></font>
<BR><B>European and U.S. River Managers Share Know-How in Bid to Restore Ecological Balance and Avoid Flood Disasters</B>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</B> -- Though thousands of miles apart, the Rhine and the Mississippi Rivers share similar histories long celebrated in literature and song.  They also share something not quite so romantic -- polluted water, frequent flooding, loss of biodiversity, and millions of people who rely on them to sustain their lives. 
<p>
In an effort to alleviate some of those all-to-familiar pressures of the modern industrial age, World Wildlife Fund has begun a bold project modeled after something that Americans and Europeans have been doing for decades -- the student exchange.  But this one comes with a twist -- when they return to their native countries, these "students" will bring back vital information that will not only help prevent floods, but also restore the ecological balance to rivers that are stretched to the limit by traffic, people and pollution.
<p>
WWF's Rhine/Mississippi Exchange program will allow key river managers and decision makers in Germany, the Netherlands and the United States to share the latest information and technological know-how on integrating environmental and economic objectives into the day-to-day management of these two majestic rivers.  Their goal is to meet water quality objectives and restore plant and animal communities while reducing flood damage and improving commercial transporation.
<p>
Funded by WWF and the McKnight Foundation, river managers and government experts from the U.S. will travel to the Rhine River Basin this September, followed by a trip to the Mississippi River Basin in Summer 1997 by a group from the Netherlands and Germany.
<p>
While in Europe, the U.S. experts will take river tours, visit harbors and exhibition centers, study recreation areas and nature reserves, and learn about challenges and solutions to river quality ranging from climate change to clay brickmaking.  They will place the river under a microscope, examining every angle -- scientific, environmental, historic, social/political and economic.
<p>
During the trip, the participants will:
<UL><LI>visit a brick factory that produces clay bricks as a byproduct of restoration efforts;

<LI>study the relationship between flood control, navigation and river system restoration;

<LI>tour the last hydropower dam on the Rhine;

<LI>see how a hardwood forest in the northern upper Rhine is recovering after intensive agricultural use;

<LI>learn how floodplain ecologists are managing a former Rhine meander that was intensively used and then reconnected to the river;

<LI>discuss the problems and opportunities of a harbor in the delta during a boat tour of the Rotterdam harbor.</UL>
<p>
Participants, who include local, state and federal government representatives, conservationists, policy analysts and agricultural representatives from  Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Washington D.C., and Wisconsin, will be urged to talk directly to those who are most affected by problems along the river.  The aim is to help them gain support for restoration-based approaches to river management when they return to the U.S.
<p>
"Every American and every European is touched in some way by the Rhine and Mississippi Rivers -- and everybody has a stake in how well they are taken care of ," said Constance Hunt, director of WWF's Freshwater Ecosystem Conservation Program.  "Witness the devastating Mississippi floods of 1993, which not only uprooted families and cost millions of federal disaster dollars, but also held many businesses hostage as barges were trapped by the raging river.
<p>
"We want to see restoration of these watersheds as part of the solution to flood damage, in addition to water quality enhancement and biodiversity conservation," Hunt added.

<B><font size=+1>Vietnamese Scientist "Reels In" a New Fish Species</B></font>

<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. -- A fish that Vietnamese villagers have been calling "dinner" for years is in fact a brand new species, say scientists from a World Wildlife Fund-sponsored mission in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve.

<p>The fish measures between 8-10 inches and weighs about 3.3 lbs.  It has a golden stripe on its back and a silver belly.  It appears to be abundant, as 18 specimens were caught within 15 minutes of making the discovery.  The local Kinh people, who catch the fish for food, call it Co.  

<p>The new fish belongs to the Crossocheilus genus, and will add to the 62 freshwater fish species recorded so far in Vu Quang.  Vietnam has a total of about 500 freshwater fish species.

<p>"The scales of the fish are different from the other known Crossocheilus species," said  Dr. Nguyen Thai Tu of the Vu Quang Conservation Project, who is preparing a scientific paper describing the fish in greater detail.  "They are more rounded and bigger."  Dr. Tu, who is also the National Northern Truong Son Biodiversity Project Chairman, has been discovering fish species new to science since 1983 when he found the Cobilis yeni, a type of loach.  In 1987, he discovered two carp species--Opsarichthys hieni and Opsarichthys bea.  All finds were made in Vietnam.
<p>This is the second time that Tu has found a fish species new to science in Vu Quang.  In 1992 he discovered a river carp--the Parazacco vuquangensis--during a survey with scientists from WWF and Vietnam's then Ministry of Forestry.  That survey also yielded the sao la (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis).
<p>"Vu Quang is fast becoming a treasure trove of new species," said David Hulse, WWF's Vietnam Program Director.  "It's vital that we conserve this spectacular region because there's no telling how many other species we will find." 

<p>WWF and Ha Tinh Province's Forestry Department launched the Vu Quang Conservation Project last year, to provide a balance between conservation and development.  The five-year project recognizes that protecting the reserve also means addressing the needs of the 30,000 people living in and around the reserve.

<p>"Our major concern is to guard against overexploitation of the reserve's resources," said Mr. Pham Van Ngoan, Vu Quang Nature Reserve Director.  "We have to create job opportunities and develop economic alternatives to resource exploitation as these are key to conserving Vu Quang."

<p>Northern Vietnam's Vu Quang Reserve has one of the country's richest and most pristine forests.  Scientists have described the reserve as a "lost world seemingly untouched by the war," and possibly teeming with new species.  Two years after discovering the sao la, scientists found the giant muntjac (Megamuntiacus vuquangensis).  Since the scientific discovery of the saola, the Vietnamese Government has enlarged the reserve and imposed logging and hunting bans.  WWF has been helping to protect the reserve by setting up guard posts, training protection staff, and promoting conservation awareness among the local communities.  It has also helped develop a management plan for the reserve.

<B><font size=+1>Indian Rhino Threatened by Continuing Poaching:</B></font>
<BR><B>Study Highlights New Methods of Killing</B>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</B> -- The Indian or greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) faces continued threats in India, where investigators have discovered that poachers are employing new killing methods--including electrocution.  This is according to a new report, <I>Under Siege: Poaching and Protection of Greater One-horned Rhinoceroses in India</I>, released today. 
<p>
Published by TRAFFIC, World Wildlife Fund's wildlife trade monitoring program, this 5-year investigation revealed that while shooting remains the method of choice, poachers dangle wires connected to high tension powerlines across rhino paths.  Pit traps, lined with sharp bamboo and no larger than the rhino, are also dug into well-worn rhino paths.  A rhino falls into the pit and, since it just fits into the hole, it has no room to maneuver and starves to death. 
<p>
"Across their range, most Indian rhino populations are still threatened though some impressive success stories exist, such as that of the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, home of the world's largest single population of greater one-horned rhinos," said Tom Mathew, director of WWFs Asia and Pacific Program.  "That poachers still experiment with new ways of killing only underlines the fact that the management of these remaining populations must take into account these new challenges." 
<p>
Greater one-horned rhino numbers have steadily increased over the last 30 years, when only a handful remained.  But the species is still one of the most critically endangered on earth, with fewer than 2,000 surviving in India and Nepal. 
<p>
A resurgence of poaching in the 1980s saw the loss of almost 500 rhinos in India.  Poaching accelerated again in the early 1990s, resulting in another 200 rhinos killed.  Experts now estimate India's total rhino population at around 1,500. 
<p>
"With numbers this low, every rhinos death is a tragedy," Mathew said. 
<p>
Rhino horn is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat fever, delirium, and other ailments.  All rhinos, including the two species in Africa and the three in Asia, have been hit hard by poaching for illegal trade over the past 20 years.  While key consumer countries such as Taiwan have recently cracked down on smuggling, illegal commerce continues to pose a threat. 
<p>
Horn from Asian rhinos is believed to be more potent and far more valuable than African rhino horn.  
<p>
The report identifies trade routes going from India through Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.  From there it is transported to markets in southeast Asia. 
<p>
"Security measures to protect India's rhinos must be reviewed and strengthened," said Ginette Hemley, WWF director of international wildlife policy.  "WWF calls for increased, organized intelligence networks to collect information on poaching and trade.  We are nowhere near the numbers we need to declare victory over poaching--although ultimately that's our goal."

First-Of-Its-Kind World Forest Map Reveals 94 Percent of 
Earth's Forests Have No Formal Protection<p></b>

     <b>WASHINGTON, DC</b> -- Only 6 percent of the 13 million square miles of forests left in the world today is formally protected, according to new data released by World Wildlife Fund. The WWF World Forests Map is the first digital overview showing the Earth's remaining forest cover and how little is set aside for conservation in protected areas such as national parks and nature reserves. <p>  
	Produced with 20 years of data from more than 80 countries, the map was released as delegates from 53 countries discuss ways of slowing the global decline in forests at the third session of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Forests in Geneva. The map was developed by WWF in collaboration with the World Conservation Monitoring Center. "The decline of the most biologically diverse forests, such as old-growth forests, is actually worse than depicted by the map in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Mexico," said Dr. Dominick DellaSala, director of WWF's Forest Conservation. "The reason is that the available databases do not distinguish native (relatively undisturbed by humans) forests from biologically depleted plantations or forests recovering from intensive logging," <p>
	The data analyzed by WWF show that in the Brazilian Amazon, an area equivalent to the size of Belgium, there has been a 34 percent increase in deforestation since 1992. Also, countries like Cambodia and Cameroon, where large areas of forest remain, have yet to establish representative networks of protected areas to prevent similar forest losses from sweeping across the globe. <p>
	Levels of forest protection are far below the internationally suggested minimum of 10 percent of the world's forests, DellaSala said. The United States, often viewed as a leader within the international community, is well below this baseline. <p>
	Surprisingly little information on the distribution of old-growth forests has been mapped across the U.S. However, data from WWF studies in progress reveal a striking decline in primary forests 
similar to that occurring in less-developed tropical countries. <p>
	For instance, in the lower 48 states, all but 2 percent of the forests present around the time of Columbus have been logged at least once. Logging in some areas has been so extensive that entire forest ecosystems are threatened with extinction, including the longleaf pine and bald cypress swamps of the southeastern United States, climax beech/maple forests of the northeastern and Great Lakes regions, low-elevation ponderosa pine forests of the Rockies, old-growth California redwoods, old-growth Douglas-firs of the Pacific Northwest, and low-elevation old-growth temperate rainforests of southeast Alaska. <p>
	Salvage logging in many of these areas continues to threaten remaining native forests as well as the ecological services they perform. Forests are home to at least 50 percent of the world's terrestrial species, with some regions, such as the tropics, supporting up to 80 percent of the world's terrestrial species. People rely on forests for clean air and water, healthy fish and wildlife, a stable climate, and a multitude of forest products.<p>
	In response to this impending global forest crisis, WWF has launched an international campaign that calls upon the world's governments to establish a representative network of protected areas, encompassing at least 10 percent of the world's forests. The campaign also promotes sustainable forestry that is socially responsible, economically sustainable, and ecologically sound. <p>
	In addition, WWF's campaign addresses the growing demand for forest products through the promotion of independent timber certification that meets internationally recognized social, economic, and environmental standards established by the Forest Stewardship Council (an independent timber certification accreditor), and by seeking reductions in timber trade in tropical areas that cannot sustain additional logging. In several countries, WWF has established "buyers groups" whose members are purchasing wood products primarily from forests that meet Forest Stewardship Council standards.<p> 
	"Our goals establish both a baseline protection standard for each country as well as a non-regulatory climate for forestry operations to voluntarily seek independent certification," DellaSala said.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Motorola Will Aid World Wildlife Fund's<BR>
International Wildlife Conservation Efforts
</CENTER></FONT>

<P><B>Schaumburg, Ill.</B> - Anti-poaching patrols in Bhutan will have a valuable new weapon to help defend critically endangered tigers; researchers in the dense forests of Brazil will have a new tool to communicate their finding about the golden lion tamarin; conservationists in the Gamba region of Gabon will be able to better protect the coastal tropical forest ecosystems critical to many species in this west-central African region; and, researchers will be better equipped to observe the nesting habits of endangered green turtles in Asiaall thanks to two-way radio technology.

<P>Motorola, Inc.'s Land Mobile Products Sector today announced a dynamic corporate alliance with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that will improve the effectiveness and productivity of wildlife conservation efforts by enhancing the organization's communications in remote areas around the world. The alliance will involve the donation of two-way radio equipment and systems as well as service and support for these radio systems which will be used to help protect diverse ecosystems around the globe. 

<P>Due to challenging and remote topography, Motorola is conducting primary equipment and system tests over the next several months in four locations around the world which include tropical rainforests, mountainous terrain, savannahs and marine habitats. Once the capabilities of the equipment and systems have been demonstrated and understood, Motorola will proceed with the first year's donation to these locations. Subsequent equipment and systems will be provided by Motorola and locations will be determined by WWF.

<P>The initial locations to be supported include Brazil's lush Poco das Antas Reserve, home to the world's only wild golden lion tamarin populations; Bhutan's Royal Manas National Park, home to endangered species of tigers, rhinos and leopards; the Gamba protected area complex on the southwestern coast of Gabon, which is home to incredibly diverse habitats, including tropical forests, seashores, lagoons, mangroves, swamps and savanna; and the Turtle Islands in Southeast Asia, the most important nesting ground for the endangered green turtle.

<P>With its inherent features of fast channel access and virtually instantaneous connectivity with the push of a button, two-way radio is an ideal conservation and anti-poaching tool that can allow communications with any or all members of a team.

<P>"The ability for field staff to communicate rapidly can make a critical difference in the field," said WWF-U.S. President Kathryn Fuller. "It can mean the difference between life and death for some of the Earth's most endangered creatures. This generous gift from Motorola will give our conservation staff an incredibly effective tool for communication quickly and effectively."

<P>Motorola's Paul Fowler, senior vice president and general manager of Motorola's Radio Products Group concurs.

<P>"This is a great arrangement for both organizations," said Fowler. "Motorola, as a company spanning the globe, has great concern for the world's environmental well-being. We're confident that Motorola's two-way radio technology will be an effective weapon in WWF's relentless efforts to preserve the world's natural habitats by affording the capability of teamwork over distanceanytime, anywhere."

<P>Motorola's Land Mobile Products Sector is one of the world's leading providers of analog and digital two-way voice and data radio products and systems for conventional, shared and private trunking applications worldwide. In addition, Motorola is one of the world's leading providers of wireless communications, semiconductors, and advanced electronic systems, components, and services. Other major equipment businesses include cellular telephone, paging and data communications, personal communications, automotive, defense and space electronics and computers. Motorola semiconductors power communication devices, computers and millions of other products. Motorola's 1995 sales were $27 billion. 

<P>World Wildlife Fund, known worldwide by its panda logo, leads international efforts to protect the diversity of life on earth. Now in its fourth decade, WWF works in more than 100 countries around the globe.

And Survival?<BR> -A Scientific Detective Story</H3>



<I>Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski, and John Peterson Myers<BR>

Foreword by Al Gore</I>

<P>

More than 30 years ago, Rachel Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I> first warned

that manmade chemicals had spread across the planet, permeating

virtually every living creature and the most distant wilderness.

 Her landmark book documented the deadly toll of these synthetic

chemicals on birds and wildlife.  Only now, however, are we recognizing

the full consequences of this insidious invasion, which is derailing

sexual development and reproduction, not only in a host of animal

populations but, it now appears, in humans as well.

<P>

<B>Our Stolen Future</B> is the first book to piece together the compelling

evidence from wildlife studies, laboratory experiments, and human

data and to lay out the emerging scientific case regarding this

largely unrecognized threat.  Building on decades of research,

the authors give a gripping account that traces birth defects,

sexual abnormalities, and reproductive failures in wildlife to

their source:  synthetic chemicals that mimic natural hormones,

thereby upsetting normal reproductive and developmental processes.

<I>Sylvia A. Earle</I>

<P>

&quot;<I>The courage of Sylvia Earle goes much deeper than she or

anyone else can dive. Challenging the devastating behavior of

modern society, she wakes up the reader to understand why this

marvelous planet will be uninhabitable if man, the global polluter,

can kill the world ocean.</I>&quot; &#160; &#160; -Thor Heyerdahl



<P>

<B>Sea Change</B> takes readers on a wide-ranging journey, from the massive

oil spills in Prince William Sound and the Persian Gulf, to whaling

stations and toxic waste sites, to the Tokyo Fish Market, where

thousands of tons of fish are sold daily. In the process, the

author makes it clear that we are currently in a time of pivotal

significance regarding the decisions we make for the world's oceans.

How we treat them now will determine the future health of the

planet-and of our species.

<P>

Sylvia Earle offers a blueprint for change that is needed to guarantee

the survival of the seas, including the establishment of marine

sanctuaries and protected areas and the development of global

policies recognizing the interdependence of life and the need

for nations to agree on measures to protect and maintain the oceans.

<I>Jason W. Clay</I>

<P>

Like environmentalists, producers living in fragile ecosystems

believe that the key to conserving the Earth's natural resources

lies in developing ways to use the resources without destroying

them. Although environmentalists have focused considerable attention

on the environmental sustainability of integrated conservation

and development programs, income-generation programs, and sustainable

development programs, to date little attention has been paid to

the economic viability of such efforts.

<P>

<B>Generating Income and Conserving Resources</B> shows local producers,

producer groups, and environmentalists how to evaluate the economic

potential of possible income-generation and conservation strategies.

Included are 20 lessons and case studies of palm heart extraction,

logging, Brazil nut harvesting, and other income-generating activities.

Lessons were drawn from the author's experiences inventing &quot;rain

forest marketing&quot; and working with hundreds of groups on

four continents during the past decade. The monograph offers invaluable

advice to communities about how to design and fund their own development

strategies, expand their understanding of value-added initiatives,

and market their products on local, national, and international

markets.

(Ursus americanus)</H3>



<I>Catherine McCracken, Debra A. Rose, Kurt A. Johnson</I>

<P>

&quot;<I>Bears are made of the same dust as we, and breathe the same

winds and drink of the same waters...and his life turns and ebbs

with heart-pulsings like ours, and was poured from the same First

Fountain.</I>&quot; &#160; &#160; -John Muir, 1871


<P>
The world's eight species of bears are increasingly affected by

the international trade of their valuable body parts. In Europe,

North America, and much of Russia, bears are hunted as a game

animal, and bear hides, claws, and teeth are traded domestically

and internationally. 

<P>

By 1991, it had become apparent that bear parts, especially gallbladders,

from protected Asian bear species were being purposely labeled

as American black bear-the only species not yet regulated by the

Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species-in order

to bypass trade controls and prevent detection by authorities.

Continuing reports of bear poaching and heightened public interest

in the issue of bear trade in 1992 prompted TRAFFIC USA, World

Wildlife Fund's trade monitoring unit, to survey the status, management,

and commercialization of American black bears in the United States,

Canada, and Mexico.

<P>

<B>Status, Management, and Commercialization of the American Black

Bear</B> compiles and analyzes available governmental information

about the management, harvest, and trade of American black bears

so as to document and better illuminate their commercialization

with emphasis on the illegal aspects of trade.

Medicinal Use</H3>



<I>Edited by Debra A. Rose and Andrea L. Gaski</I>

<P>

In recent decades, Asian bear species have suffered dramatic population

declines due to habitat loss and the frequent demand for bear

parts for medicinal use. Increased concern about possible threats

to the American black bear in North America occasioned the convening

of the first International Symposium on Trade of Bear Parts for

Medicinal Use. Wildlife managers, law enforcement personnel, policy

makers, and researchers gathered in Seattle, Washington, in September

1994 to discuss the trade, management, and conservation of the

American black bear.

<P>

Included in these proceedings are an overview of the symposium

plenary session, a discussion of the international aspects of

trade and law enforcement, papers presented at the symposium,

and summaries and recommendations of the working group regarding

the monitoring and control of the trade of bear parts in North

America.

<I>Eric Dinerstein, David M. Olson, Douglas J. Graham, Avis L. Webster,

Steven A. Primm, Marnie P. Bookbinder,<BR>

and George Ledec</I>

<P>

Amazonian rain forests, which have long been the focus of conservation

concerns, represent only a portion of the biological diversity

of Latin America and the Caribbean. Other less spectacular or

less species-rich ecosystems are often more threatened by habitat

loss and degradation but receive less attention in environmental

strategies. <B>A Conservation Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions

of Latin America and the Caribbean</B> spotlights the ecoregions that

are the most biologically valuable and in greatest jeopardy.

<P>

The authors propose a hierarchy of habitat types and define and

map 191 ecoregions, which form the basis for a priority-setting

approach that emphasizes representation of all distinct ecosystems.

Accompanying the text are 11 maps (9 in full color). A poster-size

full-color map is included with the book. The methodology, descriptions

of ecoregions, maps, and data provided in this book are of great

value to anyone concerned about conserving the biodiversity of

Latin America and the Caribbean.

Communities, conservation groups, governments, and business are

striving to stem the flow of toxic chemicals into the environment.

A major barrier to these efforts has been the lack of consistent

the local facility to the regional, national, and international

levels.

<P>

<B>A Benchmark for Reporting on Chemicals at Industrial Facilities</B>

streams and analyze the information consistently. The report compares

analyses that can be performed using the best current government

and business reporting.

<H3>A Brief History of Pollution</H3>



<I>Adam Markham</I>

<P>

The story of how we have polluted our planet is told in a way

that links the distant past with today's urgent problems. <B>A Brief

History of Pollution</B> takes the reader on a literary and scientific

tour of the world of pollution from prehistory to the postindustrial

age. The book explains how human progress has led to the soiling

of air, water, and land and records how seemingly mundane products-such

as ice cream, bicycles, hamburgers, clocks, and barbed wire-play

a part in the consumer revolutions that have swept the world during

the past five centuries. Markham brings together these seemingly

disparate strands of history into a highly readable account that

tells us as much about the future of pollution as it does about

the past.

many of these plants are collected from vulnerable wild populations

around the world. Published in association with the Garden Club

of America, <B>The Gardener's Guide to Plant Conservation,</B> provides

purchasing guidelines for species in each of several plant groups

(with an emphasis on outdoor garden plants) whose wild populations

are under pressure from commercial trade. Specific chapters cover

bulbs, terrestrial orchids, North American wildflowers, and insectivorous

plants.

The land-based societies of the indigenous peoples of the world

are founded on the principle of caring for nature rather than

exploiting it. Lavishly illustrated with 64 color photographs,

the nearly three dozen thoughtful, vividly written accounts of

<B>The Law of the Mother</B> offer a comprehensive vision of how to design

and implement conservation projects to provide for the well-being

of local peoples, local wildlife, and the land itself. The essays

note areas of continuing conflict, such as issues of land ownership,

and identify potential flashpoints of tension between local peoples

and the &quot;outsiders&quot; who are often behind the efforts

to create protected areas.

<H3>The World Wildlife Fund Book of Orchids</H3>



<I>Jack Kramer</I>

<P>

Found on every continent except Antarctica, the world's nearly

35,000 species of orchids cover an astonishing range of sizes-from

as small as one-quarter of an inch to as tall as 16 feet-and come

in a variety of colors and shapes designed to attract particular

insects crucial to pollination. A foreword by former WWF plant

conservation director Mark J. Plotkin discusses the threats posed

to orchid species in the wild by the destruction of rain forests

and other important habitats. This book-complete with 212 color

photographs-is a must for the orchid collector and for anyone

else captivated by the beauty of these wonders of nature.

Scientists estimate that 10-50 million species of organisms live

on Earth today. All these species interact to ensure that basic

functions continue to maintain life on the planet. But experts

conclude that a quarter of these species are at serious risk of

becoming extinct in the next 30 years. A copublication of WWF,

World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Conservation Union

(IUCN), Conservation International (CI), and the World Bank, <B>Conserving

the World's Biological Diversity</B> defines biodiversity and explains

why it is important and how it is threatened by development and

resource exploitation. An index, glossary, and 26-page bibliography

make this a complete reference on the subject of biological diversity.

<H3>Voices from Africa: Local Perspectives on Conservation </H3>



<I>edited by Dale Lewis </I>

<P>

Too often, Western conservationists have ignored the vital role

Africans must play in the decisions that affect the continent's

wild animals. <B>Voices from Africa</B> presents the attitudes and opinions

of traditional African tribal leaders, senior officers of African

wildlife departments and other officials, representatives of donor

agencies supporting conservation efforts in Africa, resource specialists,

health-care professionals, sociologists, and anthropologists.

The result is a powerful illustration of the creative ideas that

are beginning to drive wildlife conservation in a new direction.

Until publication of this encyclopedic set, detailed information

about these species was difficult to find in one place. This four-volume

set, consolidating information from WWF specialists and other

sources, lists each species separately and reviews its general

physical description, habitat, historic range, current distribution,

and efforts at conservation and recovery. Volumes 1 and 2 contain

species listed as of August 1989. Volume 3 contains species listed

between August 1989 and December 1991 with a cumulative index.

Volume 4 contains species listed between December 1991 and July

<H3>Prescription for Extinction: Endangered Species and Patented Oriental<BR>

Medicines in Trade</H3>



<I>Andrea L. Gaski and Kurt A. Johnson</I>

<P>

The use of endangered species in oriental medicines presents some

of the most challenging issues in wildlife conservation today.

This book presents results of a research study initiated by TRAFFIC

USA in the late 1980s to identify and analyze patented oriental

medicines for sale in the United States and other countries, with

a focus on the endangered and threatened species used in these

medicines.

<H3>International Wildlife Trade: A CITES Sourcebook</H3>



<I>Edited by Ginette Hemley<BR>

Foreword by Kathryn S. Fuller</I>

<P>

For more than two decades, the Convention on International Trade

in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as CITES,

has been one of the largest and most effective conservation agreements

in the world. The <B>CITES Sourcebook</B> explains how the treaty operates

and includes the full text of the CITES treaty as well as CITES

Appendices I, II, and III; a list of Parties as of April 1994;

and a list of reservations by Parties as of October 1993. Chapters

address the status of highly threatened species such as elephants,

rhinos, and tigers as well as other heavily exploited species

including parrots, primates, and bears.

<H3>The Right to Know: The Promise of Low-Cost Public Inventories of Toxic <BR>

Chemicals</H3>

<P>

Drawing largely on experience in the United States, this report

urges broad participation in international workshops convened

to prepare guidance for governments on public inventories called

for in Agenda 21 of the UN Conference for Environment and Development.

The report proposes key characteristics for a global network of

compatible national data bases about the use and release of chemicals.

It emphasizes the potential of toxic chemical inventories as tools

for cleaner production.

<H3>The Asian Trade in Bears and Bear Parts</H3>



<I>Judy A. Mills and Christopher Servheen</I>

<P>

Bears are valued almost exclusively in Asian cultures as a commodity-food,

medicine, adornment for home or body. In South Korea, for example,

a bear gallbladder is worth up to 18 times the price of gold.

Now, with Asian bear species endangered, poachers are looking

for bears in other areas of the world-namely, North America. This

volume is the first systematic overview of the trade in bears

and bear parts. Eleven Asian countries were examined to better

understand the scope of the trade, the incentives that drive it,

and potential ways of easing the pressure it now places on the

world's bear species.

Since the National Groundwater Policy Forum issued its report

Groundwater: Saving the Unseen Resource in 1988, many states have

developed plans, expanded monitoring, and enacted controls on

groundwater. To assist the states in continuing this trend, <B>Groundwater:

Managing the Unseen Resource</B> summarizes much of the most recent

work in this area and identifies recent publications that provide

additional information. Section one discusses six of the ten components

of a comprehensive groundwater protection program as outlined

by the forum. Section two explores individual sources of groundwater

contamination and focuses on successful approaches to dealing

with those sources.

<H3>Statewide Wetlands Strategies: A Guide to Protecting and Managing the <BR>

Resource</H3>

<P>

Wetlands regulation has recently emerged as one of the most controversial

environmental issues of our time. While many people claim that

regulatory programs are too restrictive and burdensome for landowners,

others assert that these programs are not tough enough to protect

wetlands adequately.

<P>

Offering a new approach to wetlands conservation through comprehensive

statewide wetlands strategies, this book draws on all levels of

government and the private sector to focus and coordinate efforts

to work toward the goal of no net loss of wetlands.

<P>

The strategies outlined are based on the recommendations of the

National Wetlands Policy Forum, a diverse group representing industry,

government, farming, ranching, and environmental concerns. The

guidance provided draws on World Wildlife Fund's work over the

past several years to develop practical solutions to the problem

of wetlands loss.

When the first edition of this guide was printed in 1991, natural

potential to contribute to the conservation of nature.  NRE provides

essential tools to demonstrate that nature conservation and economic

well-being are not in conflict but are mutually interdependent.

 This second edition, updated and expanded, provides a reference

that examines the latest developments in the field of NRE, lists

researchers both within the United States and abroad who are working

on related topics, and describes graduate-level training programs.

<H3>Identification Guide for Ivory and Ivory Substitutes</H3>

<P>

The word ivory traditionally was used to describe the tusks of

elephants. However, the chemical structure of the teeth and tusks

of mammals is the same regardless of the species of origin, so

it is very difficult to determine the species from which carved

ivory originated. The <B>Identification Guide for Ivory and Ivory

Substitutes</B> provides a visual and nondestructive means of distinguishing

legal ivory from illegal ivory. Developed by the U.S. National

Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory, this guide covers methods

that are simple to perform and that do not require the use of

sophisticated scientific instruments. Described in the book is

ivory from elephant tusks; the teeth and/or tusks of mammoths,

sperm and killer whales and narwhals, hippos, and wart hogs; as

well as natural ivory substitutes.

<P>High in the Ozark Mountains, you'll find caves with blind fish and 
salamanders, rivers with redfin darters and many other kinds of native 
fish, and forests with flocks of wild turkeys hiding in the underbrush. 
And in some spots, you might catch the light from a three-foot-long, 
glowing earthworm! The isolated hills, valleys, and springs of the Ozarks 
are home to several endemic species--those that are found nowhere else in 
the world.

<P>You may huff and puff if you climb the Rocky Mountains, but you'd 
probably agree that it's worth the effort. That's because a hike in these 
incredible mountains can reward you with the sight of bighorn sheep 
perched on rugged ridges, alpine meadows bursting with butterflies, or a 
pine marten resting on a tree limb.  This important forest and mountain 
corridor, which stretches between the United States and Canada, is one of 
the last large habitat areas available to grizzly bears and other large

<P>If you're lucky, you might see an endangered red-cockaded woodpecker 
tapping at the trunk of a longleaf pine tree as you hike in a Southern 
pine forest.  Or you might stumble across a murky cypress swamp complete 
with alligators. These Southern forests and the wetlands they harbor are 
home to many species that depend on large tracts of old-growth pine 
forests to survive. This area also depends on heat from natural forest 
fires to release the seeds of longleaf pines and allow the area to 
regenerate. </P>

<P>You'll wish you had fluffy, insulating feathers like this snowy owl if 
you visit Alaska's Arctic tundra in fall, winter, or spring. Cold 
temperatures and a near-permanent ice sheet make this a land where even 
hardy plants and animals struggle to survive.  When these fragile areas 
are disturbed, it can take centuries for them to bounce back.

Spend some time on the tropical island of Puerto Rico and you'll see how 
it got its name, which translates into "rich port." The natural riches

<td width=50% valign=top><font size=-1>Is this a scene from "Invasion of the Killer Dragonflies"? No. It's what's called a
species-scape--a landscape of different species that symbolize life on Earth. 
Each of the organisms pictured represents a different group of living things, and the size of each picture indicates the known number of species that are in that group, compared with the known numbers in other groups.
<p>
For example, the dragonfly represents all the insect species in the world, and the mushrooms represent all known species of fungi. (If you look at the key, you'll see that there are more than 750,000 known species of insects, but only 69,000 of fungi.) And people are represented by the giraffe, which symbolizes all the bats, bears, cats, mice, and other mammals that live on the planet.
<p>
Scientists have identified approximately 1.4 million species 
so far. But they predict that there are millions of other species that haven't been identified or described yet--especially "small stuff" like flies, beetles, bacteria, and fungi. And many of them are probably in places that scientists haven't really had 



a chance to study yet, like rain forest soils and the deep ocean floor. Who knows, in the next century we might find millions
of new species--right beneath our feet! </font></td><td width=50% valign=top> <IMG SRC="/windows/images/sizingspecies_key.gif"  border=0><br>

<b>Calaveras, CA</b>--Have you taken your frog slime today?  Probably not, since it isn't on the market yet. But before too long miraculous medicines, made from the slimy substance that oozes from frog skin, may be available at your local pharmacy. <p> 

Frogs "use" their ooze to keep their skin from drying out--and in the case of certain species, to repel predators. In a news statement released recently, frog fancier Polly Wogg said that the slime some frogs produce is poisonous enough to kill a human. 
Poison aside, medical researchers think frog-skin secretions could
be as useful for humans as they are for frogs, although in different ways. For example, certain substances in these secretions are proving to be effective in treating infections, mental disorders, and other ailments. The sticky slime might also be used to












 create a kind of glue that replaces stitches. And there may be other uses as well. When used as directed, frog slime might be able to keep all kinds of sick people from--well, croaking!

<FONT SIZE=-1>To help develop an educationally sound program, World Wildlife Fund 
assembled a national advisory board of classroom educators, university 
<IMG SRC="/windows/images/edu7.jpg" align=right>professors, scientists, industry representatives, environmental educators, and 
nonformal educators; conducted a national needs assessment to assess 

students' and educators' needs; and developed a biodiversity education 
framework that provides the foundation of the <i>Windows on the Wild</i> program.  
The framework identifies the key concepts, issues, and sample experiences that 
promote environmental literacy.
<p>
<i>Windows on the Wild</i> takes advantage of World Wildlife Fund's unique expertise 
in addressing biodiversity issues by incorporating current data from the hundreds 
of WWF-sponsored projects that are taking place in North America and around 
the world.  <i>WOW</i> also draws from the many science and conservation 
organizations, government agencies, and individuals that work closely with WWF 
to maintain and enhance biodiversity worldwide.

and student activity pages.  Each module focuses on a different theme and is 
designed to stand alone, but can work with others in the series to create an 
interdisciplinary unit or course focusing on biodiversity and current events.  
<p>Modules will address topics such as sustainable communities, consumer issues, 
wildlife trade, marine diversity, conservation biology, economics, global change, 
and futures education.
<p>
The first module, <i>Biodiversity Basics--An Educator's Guide to Exploring 
Biodiversity,</i> will feature an overview of biodiversity and an introduction to the 
curriculum program.  The module is scheduled for completion in 1997.

<H2><I></I>Tip Of the Week</H2>

For 35 years, World Wildlife fund has worked throughout the world to protect endangered species and endangered spaces. Most often, we face direct threats like land clearing and poaching, but wildlife populations and habitats are also threatened by more insidious factors, such as the contamination of the environment with toxic chemicals, including pesticides.<BR>



<UL><LI>Americans use approximately 2.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year. Research shows that target pests will eventually develop resistance to these pesticides anyway.</LI>



<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>73 different kinds of pesticides have been found in groundwater (potential drinking water).</LI>



<LI>more than 100 active pesticide ingredients are suspected of causing cancer, birth defects, and gene mutation.</LI>



<LI>a growing list of pesticides have the potential to disrupt the immune and endocrine systems and of having long-term impacts on the offspring of exposed humans and animals.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>



<H2>Learn about alternatives:</H2>



<UL>

<LI>Grow wildflowers and herbs that encourage beneficial insects.</LI>



<LI>Buy organic food. It's healthier and safer, and it encourages farmers to grow organically.</LI>

</UL>



<H2>The 10 Percent Solution ...</H2>

If 10 percent of lawnowners began using organic methods (for example, soap and water on plants to fight garden insects), 2.5 to 5 million pounds of toxic chemicals would be removed from the environment every year.<BR>

<TR><TD valign=top>For 35 years, World Wildlife Fund has worked throughout the world to

protect endangered species and endangered spaces. Most often, we face

direct threats like land clearing and poaching, but wildlife populations

and habitats are also threatened by more insidious factors, such as the

contamination of the environment with toxic chemicals.<BR><BR>

Ground-breaking research on toxic chemicals by WWF Senior Scientist Theo

Colborn points to mounting scientific evidence that some of the chemicals

in our air and water may endanger wildlife and people thousands of miles

from the chemicals' origin. Chemicals used in pesticides, industrial

processes, and many plastics have been shown to "mimic" or interfere with

the natural hormone secretions of the endocrine system and disrupt the

basic chemical messages that control brain development, sexual

differentiation, and immune system functions.<BR><BR>

In "A Warning from Wildlife," this edition of <I>Conservation Issues</I> provides

an overview of research by Dr. Colborn and other scientists that has just

been published in <I>Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility,

Intelligence, and Survival?-A Scientific Detective Story</I>. In the book,

Colborn and her colleagues describe a disturbing array of abnormalities

observed in fish, birds, and mammals. Similarities between wildlife and

human systems are sufficient to suggest that effects identified in wildlife

and laboratory animals may also be occurring in people. These effects may

account for the 50 percent drop in sperm counts worldwide and a steady rise

in testicular, prostate, and breast cancers.<BR><BR>

In the book's foreword, Vice President Al Gore writes that "the body of

scientific research underlying <I>Our Stolen Future</I> raises compelling and

urgent questions that must be addressed." These questions are especially

urgent because we cannot reverse the effects that toxic chemicals have

already had on the environment. Because we cannot go back and start over

again, what we must do is heed the warning from wildlife for the sake of

their future and that of our children.<BR><BR>

The endocrine glands of the human body secrete hormones- potent chemicals that, in concert with the brain, regulate growth, development, reproduction, and many other functions. These glands-- for example, the thyroid, the pituitary, in females the ovaries, and in males the testes- make up the endocrine system. This system-<BR>

Biologists have long attributed the decline of wildlife populations, including marine mammals, to habitat disturbances, excessive hunting or harvesting, sometimes on the introduction of competitive species. Now scientists are pondering another explanation of why some threatened or overly exploited species are failing to rebound even after they are protected. Are hormone-disrupting chemicals, which are capable of impairing reproduction and weakening the immune system, causing wildlife populations to fall?<BR><BR>

In 1987 at Russia's Lake Baikal, a virus killed an estimated 10,000 seals. That same year along the U.S. Atlantic coast, 700 bottlenose dolphins perished. In 1988, 20,000 harbor seals died in the North Sea. From 1990 to 1993 in the Mediterranean, more than a thousand striped dolphins washed ashore dead. <BR><BR>

Were these accidents of nature, coincidences, or evidence of something more ominous? Even as researchers pegged the immediate cause of death in these and other incidents- typically an infection- they were left with a nagging question: Why have so many marine mammals in different places become so vulnerable? The autopsies provided a few clues, including high levels of man-made chemicals like PCBs, which are known to suppress normal functioning of the immune system.<BR><BR>

Two studies- one by the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, the other by a U.S. team from the University of Maryland and the Environmental Protection Agency- recently investigated further the connection between hormone disrupting chemicals and the immune systems of marine mammals. Dutch scientists fed one group of seals relatively clean North Atlantic fish. A second group was fed fish from the heavily polluted Baltic Sea. This fish contained roughly 10 times more organochlorine chemicals than the herring eaten by the first group. Both batches of fish were purchased on the commercial market and were headed for the consumer.<BR><BR>

After being fed the Baltic fish for nearly two years, the seals in the second group showed signs of suppressed immune functions and weakened ability to fight off infections, including T cell responses significantly below normal. (T cells are a crucial part of the immune system's defense.) The U.S. study found that the immune response in a group of dolphins dropped as levels of PCBs and DDT increased in their blood.<BR><BR>

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be implicated in reproductive problems, too. Off the coasts of Denmark, Holland, and Germany, studies from the 1970s show that populations of harbor, ringed, and gray seals, which carry high burdens of PCBs, were declining even after hunting ended. In 1989, 30 years after commercial whaling ceased in the St. Lawrence River, the beluga whale population has not recovered. Female belugas show a lower rate of pregnancy and produce fewer offspring than their Arctic sisters. Although pollution levels in the St. Lawrence River have dropped dramatically since the 1960s, the St. Lawrence belugas still carry heavy burdens of toxic metals and man-made chemicals.

Lab experiments provide another source of evidence supporting the endocrine disruption hypothesis. Medical doctors Ana Soto and Carlos Sonnenschein spent months tracing the source of the problem when their experiment on multiplication of breast cancer cells went awry. The cells were multiplying beyond reason. Ultimately, the two determined that an estrogenic chemical was leaching into the contents of the plastic container from the plastic itself. This substance had induced the cells' proliferation.<BR><BR>

By accident, Stanford University researchers found that bisphenol-A, an estrogen mimic, leached from lab flasks made of polycarbonate plastic, which is the same kind that is used in many consumer products such as bottled water jugs. A research team at University of Granada in Spain found this estrogen mimic in a variety of canned foods, including corn, artichokes, and peas. The likely source: biologically active plastic coatings inside the cans, used to prevent contamination of food by the metal container.<BR><BR>

Other lab researchers, looking at the exposure of rats and mice to endocrine disruptors, are finding plenty to ponder. A University of Wisconsin team reported in 1990 that a single, tiny dose of dioxin given to a female rat during a critical point in pregnancy damaged her male offspring's reproductive system. EPA toxicologists conducted experiments exposing female rats during pregnancy to vinclozolin, a synthetic fungicide used on fruit. The rats' offspring that were genetically male were born with female traits, including vaginal sacs, no penises, and nipples. This fungicide was acting as a male hormone-blocker. It bound to the testosterone receptor and prevented the natural male hormone from directing normal development. The same team of toxicologists discovered only recently that DDE, a persistent breakdown product of DDT found in almost all living tissue, behaves in the same manner.

Whether or not they accept the hypothesis that man-made chemicals interfere with development, scientists and public policy makers agree that more research is needed to develop the techniques to understand the problem of endocrine disruption better. Large gaps exist in understanding how chemicals, both natural and synthetic, affect the body at all levels of organization, from the cell to various systems. Moreover, mixtures of chemicals to which people and wildlife are exposed are little understood, and the methodologies for assessing mixtures are rudimentary.<BR><BR>

One priority is testing high volume, widely used chemicals with the potential to act as endocrine disruptors. Better methods are also needed for tracking chemicals and their breakdown products through the environment. New screening tests are needed to evaluate old and new chemicals for endocrine, reproductive, nervous, and immune system disruption. Existing tests tend to rely on high doses to establish effects in animals, with results extrapolated for humans. But the effects of high-dose exposure to hormone disruptors are not the same as those that can be caused by very small doses.<BR><BR>

Cause-effect relationships are difficult to establish when the period between exposure and observation of effects is prolonged. However, it has been demonstrated that wildlife are good indicators of the effects of environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors. Consequently, field work involving wildlife, coupled with replication of the effects in the lab, serves to confirm these relationships.

<I><B>Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility,. Intelligence and Survival?- A Scientific Detective Story. Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski, and John Peterson Myers. 1996.</B></I><BR><BR>

More than 30 years ago, Rachael Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I> first warned that man-made chemicals had spread across the planet, permeating virtually every living creature and the most distant wilderness. Her landmark book documented the deadly toll of th
ese synthetic chemicals on birds and wildlife.  Only now, however, are we recognizing the full consequences of this insidious invasion, which is derailing sexual development and reproduction, not only in a host of animal populations but, it now appears, i
n humans as well.<BR><BR>

<I>Our Stolen Future</I> is the first book to piece together the compelling evidence from wildlife studies, laboratory experiments, and human data and to lay out the emerging scientific case regarding this largely unrecognized threat.  Building on decades
 of research, the authors give a gripping account that traces birth defects, sexual abnormalities, and reproductive failures in wildlife to their source: synthetic chemicals that mimic natural hormones, thereby upsetting normal reproductive and developmen
tal processes.<BR><BR>

<I><B>Generating Income and Conserving Resources: Twenty Lessons from the Field. Jason W. Clay. 1996.</B></I><BR><BR>

Like environmentalists, producers living in fragile ecosystems believe that the key to conserving the Earth's natural resources lies in developing ways to use the resources without destorying them.  This monograph shows local producers, producer groups an
d environmentalists how to evaluate the economic potential of possible income-generation and conservation strategies.  Included are 20 lessons and case studies of palm heart extraction, logging, Brazil nut harvesting, and other income-generating activitie
s.  Lessons were drawn from the author's experiences inventing "rain forest marketing" and working with hundreds of groups on four continents during the past decade.  The monograph offers invalauble advice to communities about how to design and fund their
 own development strategies and market their products on local, national, and international markets.<BR><BR><BR>

Does saving wild animals and plants depend on finding ways for people to exploit these species to meet human needs? To some conservationists, the answer is yes - under the right conditions. For some wild species to survive, the argument goes, they must have economic value.<p>

Although exploiting some species for economic gain is problematic to many conservationists, the practice has existed since the first twig was sharpened into a spear. Because use is inevitable, the challenge for conservationists is to see that using wild species can be sustained over the long term without deleterious effects to the ecosystem from which the species are taken.<p>

In 1993, World Wildlife Fund asked biologist Curtis Freese to study how the consumption and sale of wild species affects biological diversity. The results of that study are reported in this issue by WWF Senior Fellow Gordon Binder and former staff writer Jonathan S. Adams in "Is Sustainable Use Sustainable?"<p> 

In his study, Freese and a team of researchers examined whether the use of commercially valuable wild species leads to their conservation or merely encourages
excessive exploitation. The researchers also investigated whether conservation biologists know enough about ecosystems and wild species to design management regimes that guarantee the species' survival and whether entrepreneurs know enough about markets to assure that the natural capital on which their businesses depend remains productive and available.<p>

What Freese learned is that sustainable resource use-a key principle of the relatively recent alliance between conservation and economic development-rests on largely untested tenets. People do live and work in forest settings without cutting down trees or causing obvious damage.  Yet nearly all the evidence suggests that once people begin exploiting an ecosystem, it loses a part of its natural diversity.<p>

When does a use become too intensive? How much of a loss in ecosystem diversity is too much? The challenge for conservationists is to find answers that protect wildlife while also sustaining human life.<p>

<P>They are called <I>ribere&ntilde;os</I> because they live along the rivers of Peru's Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo (RCTT). Like Amazon Indians, the ribere&ntilde;os know a great deal about forest plants, agriculture, hunting, and fishing. They are also shrewd businessmen who operate in regional and international markets. The spices, rubber, and furs that they traditionally have sold in Europe and North America come from Peru's northeastern tropical forests, which sustain a wide variety of wildlife, including tapirs, marsupials, armadillos, anteaters, deer, peccaries, sloths, and 14 species of primates-among them the red uakari (<I>Cacajao rubicundus</I>), a rare and potentially endangered primate species.

human beings) in the New World. (WWF)</B></FONT></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>The ribere&ntilde;os have a problem: how to protect the resources they harvest so that they can continue to have resources to harvest. The problem began in 1969 when Peru's agrarian land reforms, which provided open access to natural areas and sparked uncontrolled extraction of natural resources in the region. Local residents and small business operations from the nearby city of Iquitos harvested timber, game animals, palm fruits, and fish to an alarming degree. By the mid-1980s, these natural resources, which met both subsistence and economic needs of local inhabitants, were in short supply. Knowing that their livelihoods depended on doing something to halt degradation of the area's natural resources, in 1991, the ribere&ntilde;os joined forces with their neighbors and the government to create the RCTT. Although this was an important step forward in gaining control over the ribere&ntilde;os' land, in itself it was not enough to stem the tide of resource loss.

<P>The ribere&ntilde;os now are grappling with the idea of sustainable management, a concept that includes setting limits on hunting deer, peccary, and large rodents at or below their current levels. And, because most of the commercially valuable trees were cut in the 1950s and 60s, sustainable management would also involve decreased logging, an emphasis on agroforestry or plantation plots near villages, and forest management practices that use selective logging over a period of 20 to 35 years to thin the forest and give young trees room to grow. These actions, in turn, would affect some of the most economically important forest products, the hearts and fruits of palm trees, which are rapidly being cut. The loss of these trees would reverberate by reducing the numbers of fruit-eating animals, including the red brocket deer, the collared peccary, and the lowland tapir.

</TABLE></TD><TD width="3%"> </TD></TR></TABLE>

If the ribere&ntilde;os shift to sustainable resource management, prospects could improve that this biologically diverse and productive ecosystem can continue to meet their needs. Yet, because most residents of the 32 villages in the reserve subsist on and derive small cash incomes from wild species, such a shift would mean 
that their already low incomes would drop further during the time it would take for populations of exploited species to rebound to adequate levels.*

<P>--------

<P>*Information about the ribere&ntilde;os comes from &quot;Linking Conservation and Local People through Sustainable Use of Natural Resources: Community-Based Management in the Peruvian Amazon.&quot; <a href="case2.html">See WWF Case Studies</a>.

<P>The ribere&ntilde;os' experience exemplifies a paradox faced by conservationists everywhere as they intensify the struggle to safeguard wildlands: Saving animals and plants in the wild may depend on finding ways for people to exploit these very species to meet human needs. 

<P>For wild species to survive, the rationale goes, local people need an economic stake in protecting the resource base, which nurtures the species they use. These species must help pay their way. When wildlands gain sufficient overall value, economic incentives to keep them wild will head off their conversion to other land uses.

<P>A successful marriage between economic use and conservation of wildlands requires finding answers to some difficult questions. Does the commercial use of wild species lead to their conservation or to excessive exploitation? Do biologists know enough about ecosystems and wild species to design management regimes that can guarantee the species' survival? Do entrepreneurs know enough about ecology to ensure that wildlife and other natural resources from which they obtain products remain sufficiently abundant? 

<P>The shortage of definitive experiences is not surprising. Conservationists and development proponents are still exploring practical, workable approaches to integrating the economic aspirations of people, especially the rural poor, and the needs of wild species, and to alleviating the human pressures that put wildlands in harm's way in the first place.

<P>Most commercial and consumptive use of wild species currently is unsustainable. Making these uses less damaging to the ecosystems that are exploited, before biological impoverishment takes too steep a toll, has become a conservation priority. 

<P><B>Consuming While Conserving</B>

<P>In 1993, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched a study of how commercial and consumptive use of wild species affects biological diversity. Principal investigator, biologist Curtis Freese, was tasked with distilling what science now says about the sustainability of species use. Because science guides WWF field projects and because subsistence use of wild species by indigenous people or artisan fishers, for example, is a given, Freese was asked to delineate how species use could be managed for the benefit of nature conservation. Findings from more than a dozen case studies (listed on pages 00-00), which will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press, suggest that the goal of sustainable use is far from at hand. Nevertheless, the few relatively successful examples provide important lessons for the conservation community.


<P>Commercial and consumptive use of wild species is hardly new. Their exploitation for food, fiber, fuelwood, shelter, and medicine has a long history wherever humans have roamed or settled. Today, revenues from the sale of wild species are significant at various levels, from the local to the national economy, and provide income for many households the world over (see <a href="commercial2.html">Commercial and Consumptive Wildlife Use</a>).

<P>Proponents of commercial use can point to some success in putting economic and ecological objectives together:

<UL>

<LI>In Indonesia, for example, because the right to harvest fruits, nuts, resins, oils, chinchona bark (quinine), and similar products other than timber passes from generation to generation, local people have a stake in forest conservation.

<LI>In Zimbabwe and other parts of southern Africa game ranchers have succeeded financially by promoting safari hunting, but they have also reintroduced elephants and commercially valuable ungulates. Lions and hyenas are also making a comeback. Indeed, the assemblage of large mammals that were absent for 30 years has now returned, along with other native plant and animal species, as landscapes once domesticated for cattle are restored to their natural state to support game ranching.

<LI>In the United States, populations of the American alligator and the striped bass have rebounded although viable plans for their commercial use emerged only after excessive exploitation decimated these resources.
</UL>

<P>A few successes do not prove the larger point that commercial and consumptive use <I>per se</I> is an effective tool for saving wild species. Freese recommends that development strategies relying on the use of wild species only be considered where such use benefits conservation, and he offers guidance for making such strategies more sustainable. 	For one, Freese's report affirms the importance of protecting life in the wild. Wild species have intrinsic value, value beyond that of human use. Cultural, spiritual, scientific, and other values vary from culture to culture but help to balance the considerable economic forces that prompt the commercial use of these species.

<P>Education and awareness campaigns can bring noneconomic values to light and can help dampen consumer demand by letting buyers know when a species is overexploited. Education can help build local support for sustainable management by encouraging resource users to exercise responsible stewardship. Education also can heighten sensitivity to the fate of wild species and wildlands in such international bodies as the World Trade Organization, where conservationists are pressing to incorporate environmental measures in new rules governing trade.

<P><B>The Ecology of Consumptive Use</B>

<P>Among Freese's most important findings is the need to improve the scientific underpinnings for wildland management. Resource managers must take to heart what ecologists are saying as they learn more about maintaining species in the wild and the roles of natural disturbances and population fluctuations. 

<P>The deeply rooted metaphor of &quot;the balance of nature&quot; notwithstanding, natural systems are far less stable than once thought. Generations of scientists had hypothesized a model in which ecological systems tended toward self-regulated equilibrium, called the &quot;climax state.&quot; A forest or other ecosystem free from human disturbance would maintain itself in a stable state. The model is no longer convincing. A new ecological understanding is shifting the emphasis from the endpoint of ecological processes-the singular, stable, or climax state-to the processes themselves. Rather than the &quot;balance of nature,&quot; some ecologists now talk about the &quot;flux of nature&quot; in which change is a constant. They increasingly analyze the roles that such natural processes as fire, parasites, floods, and even human disturbances play in shaping an ecosystem. In some cases, turbulence may be crucial to maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Suppression of natural disturbances in forests managed for wood production, for example, tends to reduce species diversity and may diminish productivity overall. 

<P>Change not only is constant, it is variable. Scientists cannot anticipate when, why, how, or at what rate changes in ecosystems or populations of wild species occur. A variety of economically important wild species, from seeds produced by tropical trees to fisheries, go through boom-and-bust cycles. What looks today like an abundant fishery may vanish a few years hence. The uncertainty is compounded in tropical countries where resource managers have less information and funding than their counterparts in industrialized countries. 

<P>This emerging knowledge about ecological uncertainty and variability  will require continual appraisal and adaptation of management regimes and more serious attention to blending the fruits of scientific research with the traditional knowledge of local people. Freese also argues for a scale of management sufficiently large-a regional or landscape focus-in order to encompass a natural system's essential ecological processes, the flows of nutrients, energy, organisms, and the like. 

<P><B>Managing for Which Species?</B>

<P>The use of wild species comes at a cost. Human choices, no less than nature's disturbances, induce ecological change. Low-level use does not necessarily degrade an ecosystem. People live and work in forest settings without cutting down trees or causing obvious damage. Low-impact logging, in fact, can increase a forest's diversity. As wildlife use intensifies, however, ecological changes start to occur. Excessive exploitation may cause the loss of a species. Nearly all the evidence suggests that once human beings begin exploiting an ecosystem, that system loses part of its natural diversity. The extinction of large mammals and flightless birds in North America and New Zealand, for example, coincided with the arrival of humans. The spread of Polynesians across the Pacific islands 8,000 years ago led to the loss of half or more of the endemic species they encountered. 

<P>Intensive management of ecosystems simplifies complex systems-biologically, a tree plantation is simpler than an uncut forest, a corn field simpler than a prairie-and diminishes the ecological redundancy built in by nature. A high degree of biological diversity may be especially important in stabilizing some ecosystems, ensuring their long-term productivity, and making them resilient when buffeted by natural disturbances. A challenge facing intensive management of species for commercial production is how much can the ecosystem be simplified before it loses its stability, resilience, and productivity? 

<P>In a given ecosystem-for example, a reserve managed for big game or ducks, or a forest managed for a particular tree species-only a few species have economic value to humans, who manage these species at the expense of others. Rather than harvest the valued resource to extinction, people begin to manage the land to benefit that resource. When a valued species becomes a more prominent part of the ecosystem, it may push out or harm other species filling important ecological niches that scientists may have only begun to comprehend. A study of the widely marketed fruits and heart of one palm species in Brazil, <I>Eurterpe oleracea</I>, concluded that management for this species on islands in the Amazon River led to a loss of roughly half the native tree species. In Malaysia's Mangrove Forest Reserve, which is managed for mangroves of high commercial value, the multicanopied structure of the primary forest-a diverse, resilient ecosystem-has been lost.

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The technology introduced by specialization can diminish biological diversity, too. Getting timber to market may mean building roads, disturbing riparian habitat, and the like. Although new devices can reduce incidental damage-the turtle-excluder device in shrimping, for example-current shrimp harvesting methods still mean that globally for every ton landed, more than five tons of bycatch are discarded. 

<P>Sometimes specialization backfires: With disastrous results, the Nile perch was introduced into Africa's Lake Victoria around 1960 to bolster the fishery and encourage sport fishing. The productivity of the lake's fishery dropped dramatically. It is now projected that at least half of the 300 or more endemic species of cichlids may disappear. Fisheries-dependent communities along the coast have suffered.

<P>Should resource managers manage an ecosystem primarily for the use of a particular wild species so as to boost income and enlist the support of local people while attempting to minimize the consequent effects on biological diversity? Or should managers protect biological diversity, with consumptive use of wild species managed within that framework? 

<P>Recognizing that management for commercial and consumptive uses has its place, Freese recommends a bias in favor of safeguarding an ecosytem's biological diversity, in order to protect the system's vital ecological functions and services, rather than managing for only the more obvious and marketable commercial products of the ecosystem. Part of the task, he advises, is to make commercial and consumptive use strategies reversible. Another part of the task is to set aside a portion of the ecosystem in its natural state and rigorously protect it against commercial exploitation to assure that the system's functions are fully maintained and a reservoir exists for overexploited species. Freese cautions against introducing exotic, nonnative species, which can undermine ecological processes or jeopardize long-term productivity.

<P><B>The Economics of Consumptive Use</B>

<P>In addition to incorporating emerging ecological principles, Freese emphasizes the importance of getting economic incentives right. In an ideal world, people would pay a premium for goods produced in ways that did not harm biodiversity, and sufficient resources would filter back to rural communities and help them raise their standards of living and manage their lands wisely (see <a href="business2.html">The Business Side of Biodiversity</a>). Because a price premium for such goods is by no means a sure bet, knowing the market is imperative. Does a product already have commercial value, or must a market be created? Are there transportation, storage, and other facilities to distribute the product, or must they be located? Will the product's price yield a return sufficient to cover costs? The answers to these and related questions may make the difference between a profitable and an unprofitable enterprise.

<P>Timber harvesting has emerged as the highest and best economic use of forest resources because it is easier to calculate the commercial value of timber than of nontimber products. Thus, some conservationists advocate sustainable harvesting practices and promote the idea of certifying wood products from sustainably managed forests as a marketing advantage among environmentally conscious consumers.

<P>Other conservationists have turned their attention to the market potential for harvesting nontimber forest products-nuts, fruits, mushrooms, or honey, for example-or for nature tourism. But hard realities, including the seasonality of the harvest, make some of the economic prospects less than rosy.

<P>Incentives for sustainable use are reduced if wildlife-derived revenues meant to be shared with local communities are intercepted by government bureaucracies, as happens in some countries. Incentives are reduced, too, if corrupt officials with a say in harvest levels raise the take to reward their supporters. 

<P>Understanding markets is only part of the economic challenge. If local people are to benefit from sustainable resource use, then they must have rights to the resources. Clarifying the tenure and property rights of local and indigenous people is especially important. In many places, settlement of common or tribal land claims, coupled with communal management, is providing local people a new economic stake in managing wild species sustainably.

<P>Freese recommends earmarking revenues from commercial and consumptive use strategies to cover management and mitigation costs and to create incentives for wildland conservation. And he concludes that sustainable-use strategies will not be able to pay their way, at least at the start. Often, too little is understood about the ecosystem to manage it well. Depleted wildlife populations may need recovery time. Subsidies may be required at first to facilitate the transition to sustainable resource use.

</TR>
</TABLE></TD><TD width="3%"> </TD></TR></TABLE>


Ultimately, the best incentive for managing wildlands for diversity, Freese counsels, may lie in capturing for the local community more of the economic value provided by the ecosystem's diversity. Part of this challenge is making sure that the calculus of wildlife and ecosystem use takes a sufficiently broad and long-term view, that it accounts explicitly for nonconsumptive values-for example, watershed protection downstream, soil conservation, scientific research, carbon sequestration, spiritual uses, ecosystem resiliency and adaptability in the face of long-term environmental change. Explicitly recognizing these nonconsumptive values, even if they cannot be fully quantified, augments the total value of a wildland. Even though unquantified nonconsumptive values may suffer in comparison to the obvious financial benefits accruing from resource extraction, these values may still help people fend off alternative economic activities that compete for use of the land.

<P><B>Vindication for Sustainable Use?</B>

<P>The fate of much of the Earth's biological riches depends increasingly on how unprotected wildlands, including communally and privately owned lands, are used and managed. No one is suggesting a lower priority for the world's parks and other preserves, which remain at the core of any intelligent strategy for saving species in the wild. But in an era of rapidly growing human population and resource consumption, with poverty still a pernicious problem for too many people who live in places of high ecological value, protected areas are hardly sufficient by themselves to harbor nature's bounty.  

<P>As the ribere&ntilde;os of the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo in Peru ponder their choices, they are fortunate to have options. They live in communities recognized by the government. These communities set the rules governing land use and extraction of natural resources from communal lands, nearby forests, and fisheries. In part because of strong community-based management, the fisheries seem to be run on a more or less sustainable basis.  So, too, is agriculture. After flirting with monocultures spurred by government credit programs, in recent years local farmers are returning to a more sustainable and reliable mix of crops including cassava, watermelons, bananas, rice, corn, and other staples.

<P>Yet more is demanded of the ribere&ntilde;os. Hunting of primates, tapirs, marsupials, edentates, and carnivores must cease until populations rebound. Harvests of deer, peccary, and large rodents, as well as palms and other forest products will not rebound for several years as palm and fuelwood plantations, longer harvesting rotations, and other management practices intended to secure nature's bounty are allowed to take effect. 

<P>Sustainable practices are being phased in slowly so that local people can absorb the economic shock gradually. Still, outside assistance will be needed in the short term. Such aid, which is not yet forthcoming, could take the form of subsidizing health, education, or transportation costs, which by one estimate account for about a third of the average household budget.

<P>In northeastern Peru and elsewhere, the transition to sustainable management must go well if the idea is to realize its promise: giving local people who live off the forest's resources an economic stake in wildlands conservation while protecting the wildlife and the productivity of the land on which they depend. Commercial and consumptive uses of wild species are taking their place in development strategies across the world. Well managed, such uses can help nature conservation. Poorly done, they can devastate an ecosystem and the wildlife within.

<P><I><B>A Guide to the Field of Environmental Natural Resource Economics, 2nd Edition.</FONT></B></I> Carollyne Hutter, 1996.

<P>When the first edition of this guide was printed in 1991, natural resource economics (NRE) was an emerging discipline with great potential to contribute to the conservation of nature. NRE provides essential tools to demonstrate that nature conservation and economic well-being are not in conflict but are mutually interdependent. This second edition, updated and expanded, provides a reference that examines the latest developments in the field of NRE, lists researchers both within the United States and abroad who are working on related topics, and describes graduate level-training programs.

<P><U><I><B>Lending Credibility: New Mandates and Partnerships for the World Bank</FONT></B></I></U>. Peter Bosshard, Carlos Heredia, David Hunter, and Frances Seymour, 1996.

<P>The occasion of the World Bank's fiftieth anniversary in 1994 sparked a lively popular and scholarly debate about the continuing relevance of the bank in a world that has changed dramatically since the founding of the Breton Woods Institutions. James Wolfensohn stepped into the middle of these debates when he was appointed president of the bank in mid-1995 and has encountered a lack of consensus both inside and outside the bank regarding the appropriate role of the institution in a post-Cold War world.

<P>The papers in this volume address the mandate and effectiveness of the bank as an instrument for promoting sustainable development objectives: poverty reduction and social equity, environmental sustainability, good governance, strong civil societies, and protection of human rights. The volume concludes with suggested criteria for collaboration between the bank and independent organizations.

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Fish Crises in the 1990s</B>
</font><P>

In the 1990s, fishing reached the point of diminishing returns. Many fish populations have fallen to levels at which they can no longer recover without significant reductions in catches or a moratorium on fishing. There are simply too many boats catching too many fish. The first surge in numbers of fishing vessels occurred during the Industrial Revolution. This upswell tapered off during the two World Wars, but boomed again in the 1950s through to the 1970s. The world's fishing fleet doubled between 1970 and 1990, with around 1.2 million commercial vessels scouring the world's oceans today. In 1974, the Soviet fleet alone had 710 factory trawlers, 103 factory or mother ships, more than 2,800 smaller trawlers, and more than 510 support vessels. The latter were comprised of sea-going repair shops and refrigerated fish carriers as well as fuel tankers, supply ships, and research and scouting boats. Roving fleets like this depleted one fish population after the other, leaving small-scale fishers with emptier nets and catches so small that many of them have lost not only their jobs but an important source of food as well. Today, Russia and five other countries account for 90 per cent of the high-seas catches.
<P>

More than 100 million people in developing countries are dependent on fisheries for their livelihoods. For most of them, fishing is a way of life, not just a source of income. FAO reports that fish provide 29 per cent of the total animal protein consumed by Asians, 19 per cent by Africans, and 8 per cent by Latin Americans. More than five million people in Southeast Asia derive their livelihoods from fishing, out of some 20 million fishers worldwide. Traditionally, small-scale or artisanal fishers have provided fish for local consumption but as fish become more scarce and their value increases, they enter the global market and thus become unaffordable for poor people. Fishers living on subsistence incomes will soon no longer be able to afford to feed fish to their families.
<BR>
<BR>


<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Overfishing</B></font><P>

 
<P>

The main cause of the world's fisheries crisis is chronic overfishing, subsidized by governments attempting to prop up an unsustainable industry. According to the FAO, every year governments worldwide pay US$54 billion to catch just US$70 billion worth of fish. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) has around 40 per cent more vessels than necessary to catch fish on a sustainable basis. Worldwide, there are more than one million large "industrial" fishing vessels, and two million smaller fishing boats. These fleets must be cut to fit the dwindling resource, and fish populations allowed to recover.
<P>


Developed nations which have overfished their own waters have headed into the territorial waters of developing countries, clashing frequently with small-scale local fishers. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which entered into force in 1994, maritime countries can extend a 200-mile (320km) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) seaward from their coastlines. Because of the EEZs, the vast majority of the ocean's remaining fish stocks fall under the jurisdiction of developing countries, many of which grant licences to foreign vessels to exploit marine resources in their waters. Most developing countries lack the means to police these zones. Thus, foreign vessels frequently fish illegally in EEZs, particularly off the coast of Africa. Even foreign vessels with licences are being excluded from coastal waters by indigenous fishers who resent the taking of fish stocks by large trawlers and factory ships, which they claim are not only overfishing but depriving local people of the benefits of the catch.
<P>


Volatile `fish wars' are now commonplace. In India's Kerala state, for example, in 1993, local fishermen burnt 14 trawlers, seized four others, and held hostage a vessel operator. Trawler skippers retaliated by taking fishers hostage. Traditional fishers in other Indian states have also organized strikes in protest against foreign vessels operating inside India's 200-mile zone. Naturally, the government wants to earn foreign exchange by granting licences to vessels from countries such as Japan, South Korea, China, and the United States. But the local fishers demanded that all licences be cancelled and continued to protest against the presence of foreign boats. One example they cited to support their case was that one foreign vessel docked in Kochin, Kerala contained 2,000 metric tonnes of fish, equivalent to the catch that could have provided earnings to the operators of 1,500 traditional boats. In 1996, the Indian government agreed to stop issuing new licences to foreign vessels.
<P>


A Sierra Leone patrol boat recently caught a French trawler operating without a licence in its territorial waters and in possession of US$465,000 worth of illegally caught tuna. Vietnam regularly takes into custody operators of Thai fishing vessels operating illegally in its waters in the South China Sea. In the Gal&sdot;pagos, immigrant fishers from the Ecuadorian mainland occupied a scientific research station and the headquarters of the Gal&sdot;pagos Marine Reserve in protest against proposed limits on the catch of sea cucumbers and sharks. The fishers demanded the 1992 Presidential Decree which restricted fishing for these species be lifted, and won some concessions. Catching of sea cucumbers was resumed under a quota which was dramatically exceeded within weeks. The battle over the Gal&sdot;pagos sea cucumber fishery rages on, and the `finning' of sharks to supply the Asian seafood market continues. This illegal deliberate slaughter is carried out by large foreign vessels, which also take sharks as bycatch in other fisheries. The death toll is reported to be high.
<P>


Fish wars are by no means restricted to developing countries; they have erupted among developed countries as well. The 1995 dispute between Canada and Spain was one of the most volatile to date. After a high seas chase, Canadian fisheries officials seized a Spanish trawler that was catching undersized Greenland halibut (turbot) on the Grand Banks. Although the Spanish vessel was outside Canada's 200-mile zone, unemployed fishermen and the government claimed the Spaniards were destroying Canada's turbot fishery by illegally taking juvenile fish, using nets with undersized mesh. Canada claimed that only two per cent of the fish in the vessel's hold had reached spawning age. Elsewhere in the North Atlantic, Norway's coast guard fired warning shots and slashed the nets of Icelandic trawlers fishing too close to an island in the Barents Sea over which Norway claims jurisdiction. The United States and Canada are locked in a dispute over fishing for Pacific salmon species that shows no sign of resolution.
<P>


Drastic declines in fish stocks in waters of the EU have led fishers from these countries to cast their nets elsewhere, particularly in waters of African, Caribbean, and Pacific  nations. Currently, more than 25 per cent of fish caught by the EU are caught outside its waters. In 1994, the EU spent more than one-third of its fisheries budget to subsidize access to foreign fisheries by the EU distant-water fleet. Local Senegalese fishers have complained bitterly about EU vessels, mainly from Spain, running through their nets at night, killing fishers, and destroying their fragile boats. The National Collective of Senegalese Artisanal Fishermen is urging the government to extend the zone reserved for local fishermen from 10 to 20km and to invest in fisheries surveillance equipment. The fishers also warn that certain species of fish are disappearing because of overexploitation. The Senegalese Collective is also severely critical of the huge quantities of dead fish that are discarded by EU trawlers, sometimes as much as 90 per cent of the catch.
<P>


Overfishing has an enormous impact on fish populations themselves and on the maintenance of marine biological diversity and the health of marine ecosystems. Well-managed fisheries are therefore not only beneficial to those who would exploit them, but also to the ocean ecosystem on which they depend.

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Northern Bluefin Fisheries
</B>
</font><P>

<P>

Big bluefin are now so profitable it has become common practice to use spotter planes to locate them. Some fishing boats may spend weeks hunting down just a few individuals. Although high-tech fishing methods mean that catches remain high for a handful of the best fishers, bluefin populations are dwindling alarmingly. In 1993, the estimated population size of northern bluefin in the western Atlantic was less than 25 per cent of the 1970 level, and the breeding population has plummeted by nearly 90 per cent since 1975, from an estimated 250,000 individuals to just over 20,000. Spawning activity (calculated from observations of larval abundance) in the Gulf of Mexico is at an all-time low. These trends are further supported by a recent discovery that juvenile bluefin migrating out of the Gulf have all but disappeared from the diet of Florida's sooty terns (<I>Sterna fuscata</I>).
<P>


Northern bluefin in the eastern Atlantic are also under serious threat. There appears to be a decline in all but the youngest age groups. According to ICCAT, numbers of fish over eight years old decreased by 87 per cent between 1983 and 1993. Nevertheless, the fishing frenzy for bluefin continues. In the Mediterranean, the number of longliners has soared, doubling the bluefin catch - of mostly small fish - between 1992 and 1993. In some parts of the Mediterranean, however, catches of adult bluefin in traditional coastal fish traps has plummeted.
<P>


Annual catches of northern bluefin in the Atlantic fluctuated between 15-25,000 metric tonnes during the 1960s, but fell to about 6,000 metric tonnes thereafter. Bigger hauls taken with surface gear such as purse seines are usually frozen at sea, but giant individuals caught by harpoon, traps, or rod-and-reel are transported by air fresh to the Japanese market.
<P>


The status of northern bluefin in the Pacific is uncertain. Most are taken in the western part of the ocean where Japan has by far the major fishery. Catches since 1960 in the Pacific have shown large fluctuations between 8,000 metric tonnes and 29,000 metric tonnes annually, but there has been a downward trend since the early 1980s, especially in the eastern Pacific.
<P>

A mature female bluefin releases more than 34 million eggs in a season. Although few eggs survive to develop into adult fish, the potential for recovery of depleted bluefin populations is considerable, given sound management. A substantial cut in existing quotas could result in recovery of bluefin. However, true to the goldrush mentality seen in other fisheries, efforts to strip-mine the seas of giant bluefin have persisted in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence of their decline.
<P>


<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Southern Bluefin Tuna (<I>Thunnus maccoyi</I>)
</B>
</font><P>

Somewhat smaller than the northern bluefin, southern bluefin tuna grow to 2.3 metres in length and weigh up to 150kg. Southern bluefin are distributed throughout the cooler waters of the Southern Ocean between 30oS and 50oS, and make circumpolar migrations covering great distances. Like all tunas, however, southern bluefin require warmth to spawn and they move north to breed in the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean between northwest Australia and Java.
<P>


Global stocks of southern bluefin are at an all-time low. Catches declined from a high of over 80,000 metric tonnes in 1961 to less than 15,000 metric tonnes in 1990. This was partly due to voluntary restrictions on fishing by Australia, Japan, and New Zealand-the three main nations fishing for southern bluefin. In 1993, as a result of heightened concern over northern bluefin and pressure from CITES, these three countries signed the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). But long-term management strategies for recovery of southern bluefin have yet to be enacted, and fishing by non-CCSBT nations, such as Indonesia, on the spawning grounds may be far more significant than previously thought. The quotas for CCSBT countries have remained essentially the same since 1993. Concerned with the record low level of the spawning population and in keeping with the precautionary approach, Australia and New Zealand have pressed for modest reductions in the catch quotas. But in 1995, the third signatory to CCSBT, Japan, pushed for an increase in the global quota. This resulted in a stalemate in the negotiations, and Japanese tuna vessels began to avoid Australian ports and boycott Australian products. Several meetings of the Commission in 1995 and early 1996 ended with no agreement on the global catch, and many fear that like the species it manages, CCSBT itself may be near collapse.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Asia and the Pacific
</B>
</font><P>

People living in the Asia/Pacific region are the world's greatest fish eaters. According to the FAO, fish provide an average of 29 per cent of the animal protein in the Asian diet. In Indonesia, a country with more than 17,000 islands and the second longest coastline in the world, fish provide as much as 60 per cent of the average diet. In Southeast Asia alone there are some five million fishers, all of whose livelihoods are threatened by industrial overfishing, cyanide poisoning of the live fish trade, dynamite fishing that destroys coral reefs, mangrove destruction, shrimp farming, pollution and toxic waste, and the incidental killing of sharks and other valuable fish species. WWF has begun to address some of these problems in several countries.
<P>


WWF has been working with the Indonesian government to secure 10 million hectares of the most important natural areas as national parks or marine reserves. WWF's Indonesia Programme has created a special marine conservation unit. In addition, a coral reef campaign coordinator will soon be recruited to work closely with governments in the region to help deter cyanide and dynamite fishing. Investigation and monitoring of the live fish trade, much of which goes to Hong Kong, will also be undertaken by TRAFFIC.
<P>


Until recently, marine work in Indonesia has focused on dugongs and marine turtles and two main field projects in the Take Bone Rate in Sulawesi and Teluk Cenderawasih in Irian Jaya. WWF has helped Take Bone Rate develop its management plan and assess the priorities identified by the local communities, including the establishment of "regeneration zones", the formation of credit and marketing cooperatives, the development of value-added marine products, mariculture, and ecotourism.
<P>


Villagers in Thailand, the world's largest fish exporter due to shrimp farming, have put in place barriers or buoys off their coast to prevent commercial trawlers from fishing within the three-kilometre inshore coastal conservation zone. WWF's project for the enhancement of the community potential to manage wetlands and coastal resources works regularly with 13 villages in three of the four coastal districts of Pattani Province. This project has spawned the formation of the Small-Scale Fisher's Council of southern Thailand which presently includes 7 of the 10 southern provinces. The major goals of this project are to lobby for better enforcement of the law forbidding trawlers from working inside the three-kilometre inshore zone and to establish the council as a strong, independent group which can represent the interests of small-scale fishers and coastal resources. The effects of the project have also been felt in the neighbouring province of Pang Na, where more than 40 fishers on two islands gave up environmentally destructive trawling for non-destructive, traditional floating shrimp seines and squid traps. The project also aims to establish more community forest and sea-grass conservation areas, and is aiding fishers to create artificial reefs constructed out of traditional materials such as coconut trees and bamboo. 
<P>


Neighbouring Vietnam's S-shaped coastline stretches over 1,000km. Spectacularly beautiful islands dot the South China Sea from Ha Long Bay in the north, just off the coast of Hai Phong, to the famed Con Dao archipelago in the south, not far from the oil rich province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau. Con Dao National Park is slated for oil exploration, major harbour and port construction, and development of a major tourist resort including a golf course.
<P>


Exploitation of fish, prawns, coral, giant clams turtles and their eggs, seaweeds, bird's nests, and shark fins is largely unregulated. At night the coastline of offshore islands in the Con Dao and the island of Phu Quoc are ringed with the lights of squid fishers' boats. By day the harbours are filled with foreign vessels that dwarf the small traditional boats that have fished these waters for centuries. In 1992, WWF began to support a coastal survey that will continue into 1997, but progress has been limited since the Ministry of Forestry, the authority responsible for protected areas, has at present no clear mandate to protect marine areas. In 1996/97, WWF will continue to train marine survey teams. When sufficient funds are secured, WWF's Hanoi programme office will station one marine expert in Vietnam for several months. WWF will work with relevant government authorities and institutions, continue to help establish a marine reserve system, attempt to stem the trade in coral and other species listed on Appendix I of CITES, provide technical and financial assistance for building nature reserve infrastructure at, initially, one or two sites, and install basic equipment and promote local awareness of the need for and benefits of marine conservation.

In the Solomon Islands, WWF has been working with a community association of three customary land-holding groups of more than 250 people, with tenureship of natural resources spread over 110km2 of land and sea. With WWF's help over the past three years, the association has undertaken a conservation planning process - and has banned the catching of selected species of fish and suspended all fishing in a large area of inshore reef and around several outer island reefs. This voluntary reduction in fish catch has already resulted in a significant increase in populations of a number of species. This broad-based project is designed to aid traditional community organizations to continue ongoing resource conservation programmes, and assist land-holding groups to use and manage their natural resources sustainably.

<P>

In the Southern Oceans, WWF-Australia, WWF-New Zealand, and TRAFFIC Oceania have joined forces to study the environmental impact of tuna fisheries. They are working to establish recovery plans for the southern bluefin tuna and to reduce as quickly and sharply as possible the deaths of non-target marine species in longline fishing gear. In 1991, a study of incidental bycatch in the Southern Ocean tuna fisheries revealed that an estimated 44,000 albatross were killed by Japanese longliners alone. More recent studies have shown that an estimated 6,500 albatross were killed in Australian waters in 1994; an estimated 4,500 black-footed albatross are taken in the Hawaii-based swordfish longline fisheries each year and that up to 14,000 seabirds are estimated to be taken in the Patagonian fishery of the south Atlantic. The evidence strongly suggests that most, if not all the world's albatross are threatened with extinction as a result of fisheries bycatch. In addition to the depletion of southern bluefin tuna stocks and the massive bycatch of seabirds, small cetaceans, seals, sharks and other pelagic species continue to be caught in both longline and other fishing methods.

<font size=+1 font color="#3333ff"><B>Key elements of the WWF and TRAFFIC work to date includes:

</B>
</font><P>


<UL type=circle>
<LI>An ongoing involvement in the official negotiations surrounding the Convention on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCALMR).

<LI>	WWF's and other NGOs' policy and advocacy work contributed towards the listing of longline tuna fishing as a `key threatening process' under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Act in 1992.

<LI>	WWF assisted in developing community support for national and international public awareness about the albatross and shark bycatch in commercial fisheries.

<LI>	TRAFFIC Oceania is working with TRAFFIC USA and TRAFFIC International in a worldwide investigation of the trade in sharks' parts and products. A global overview, undertaken by the TRAFFIC Network at the request of IUCN's SSC's Shark Specialist Group, will be published in late 1996 as part of TRAFFIC's Species in Danger series.

<IMG SRC="/images/alpha_m.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="M" ALIGN=LEFT>any American Indians and conservationists share a philosophy that respects the Earth and recognizes people's responsibility to be stewards of the land.
Conservation organizations and tribes are often concerned about the same natural resource management issues.
Some examples of these overlapping concerns are reducing pollution from gold mining near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, reintroducing gray wolves in central Idaho, and dealing with the impact of rapid development in the northern Rockies.
These shared concerns demonstrate that American Indians and conservation organizations could benefit from working together to achieve mutual goals of protecting the environment. 

<br>



<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">Despite some cases of successful collaboration between tribes and conservation groups, however, the potential for joint efforts is not being reached. The two communities have not worked together as often as might be expected and, at times, have even been at odds with one another.
<table width=100%>
<td width=30%>

<td width=70%>          
<BR><IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Believing that a face-to-face meeting would lead to greater understanding and catalyze joint conservation projects, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society (a nonprofit organization of tribes and American Indian natural resource professionals) co-hosted a workshop at the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana in December 1995 to seek common ground and build bridges between tribes and conservation organizations. For four cold, windy days at KwaTaqNuk, a Flathead-operated resort and conference center on Flathead Lake, representatives of tribes and conservation organizations that work in Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana discussed conservation perspectives and priorities. <A NAME="textA">(See</A> <A HREF="#appA">Appendix A</A> for a list of the tribes and conservation organizations represented at the workshop.)</td></table>
<BR><IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Case studies of cooperative efforts between tribes and conservation organizations helped the participants gain an understanding of the tribes' legal rights and authority, identify ways to collaborate more effectively in the future, and forge new alliances to protect natural resources. Although the workshop focused on the northern Rockies, the themes and lessons that emerged can help American Indians and conservation groups across the country improve relations with one another. 
<BR><IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
This report provides background about American Indians' roles in natural resource management, describes the status of collaboration between tribes and conservation organizations, and presents several reasons for increased collaboration that emerged from the workshop.

<BR><B>Tribes as Natural Resource Managers and Users</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="20">
American Indians currently occupy and control only a small fraction of their original territories. In the 19th century, many tribes were relegated to reservations that were perceived to have little economic value, although valuable natural resources have subsequently been found on some of these lands. Tremendously reduced in size from their aboriginal extent, tribal lands still constitute an enormous land base. Approximately 52 million acres, roughly the size of Kansas, are held by tribes and individual Indians in the contiguous United States, with another 45 million acres held by Alaska Natives.
<BR>

Although in previous decades natural resources on tribal lands had been managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), many tribes are now becoming self-governing and are taking control of management responsibilities within reservation boundaries. In addition, some tribes are pushing to reassume management over some federally managed lands that were part of their aboriginal territories. For example, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes of the Flathead Reservation are taking steps to assume management of the National Bison Range, which lies within the reservation's boundaries and is currently managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. At present, federal policies are generally supportive of tribal self-governance and support tribes having a voice in management of federal lands that affect aboriginal rights and interests. Most tribes are eager to take advantage of this opportunity.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Pointing to their treaties and other agreements with the federal government, many tribes assert that they have reserved rights to use natural resources on portions of public land. For example, in the northern Rocky Mountains, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai, Blackfeet, Coeur d'Alene, and Nez Perce tribes assert the right to hunt, fish, and gather natural resources on large areas of federal land outside their reservation boundaries. The Salish and Kootenai cooperate with Montana state game managers by reporting their members' take of wildlife on public lands west of the Continental Divide. The state recognizes the tribes' right to hunt in this area.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
As a by-product of their reserved treaty rights, tribes assert the right to co-manage natural resources. For example, tribes in the Pacific Northwest co-manage the fisheries of the Columbia River Basin, and the Salish-Kootenai and Coeur d'Alene tribes are actively involved in Superfund cleanup efforts on the Clark Fork and Coeur d'Alene Rivers, respectively, which have been devastated by a century of mining pollution.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
There are legal precedents to support Indian rights to water, which is a critical commodity in the arid West. Generally, the establishment of a reservation carried with it the implication of reserved rights to water that is within or bordering the reservation. In areas where tribes exercise ancestral fishing rights, the priority date on these reserved rights is time immemorial and thus provides a basis for maintaining instream flows to protect reservation and off-reservation fisheries. As tribes increasingly exercise their rights to use water and to hunt, fish, and gather, their roles in natural resource debates will increase.
 <BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
More and more tribes are establishing their own natural resource management and environmental quality protection programs. Tribes have established fisheries, wildlife, forestry, water quality, waste management, and planning departments. Some tribes have prepared comprehensive resource management plans for their reservations. Many tribes have become active in the protection of particular species. Because of the central role that bison played and continue to play in American Indian culture, plains region tribes have been extensively involved in efforts to reintroduce bison. The Blackfeet and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes both have long-standing endangered species protection programs. The Blackfeet's showcase is its grizzly bear research and management program, one of the longest running efforts in Montana. For some time, the Salish and Kootenai have been working to reintroduce peregrine falcons. They are also starting a program to reintroduce trumpeter swans.

In some cases, tribes are more stringent than states in administering their programs. For example, although the state of Montana has allowed grizzly hunting in the past, the Salish and Kootenai tribes have chosen not to permit grizzly hunting on their lands. In Idaho, the state legislature voted to withdraw the state from involvement in the wolf reintroduction program. However, the Nez Perce tribe, working in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has remained active and is now the lead entity for wolf reintroduction in central Idaho. The Salish-Kootenai's water quality standards, recently affirmed by the federal court, are more stringent than state water quality standards, which were lowered by the legislature in 1995 at the behest of Montana's mining industry.

Natural resource management is sometimes complicated for tribes because they use their natural resources for multiple purposes that are sometimes conflicting. Conflict may arise when natural resources are both a component of the tribe's culture and a potential source of economic development. For example, a tribal government may wish to generate revenue and create jobs by logging certain areas that some tribal members view as sacred.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Complicating natural resource management even further, the BIA, which still plays a major role in the management of some tribal lands, may have different goals than the tribal community. For example, a 1993 assessment of Indian forest management found that tribal members value resource protection more highly than other benefits their forests provide, while BIA forest employees place more emphasis on the forest's economic benefits.  </td><td width=25%><a href="/new/bridges/bbcollab.html"><img src="/images/issues/mine.gif" border=0></a></td></table>

Environmental problems are often complex and wide-ranging. To address the loss of species or to clean up pollution often requires working on a large scale, such as throughout a watershed or ecosystem. The far-ranging carnivores of the northern Rockies-the grizzly, wolf, lynx, wolverine, and mountain lion-have territories that include tribal, private, federal, and state lands. In the northern Rockies, the ranges of the remaining carnivore populations are becoming increasingly restricted to those high elevations like Glacier National Park that have been less disturbed by humans. Yet, these high elevation habitats may be less productive for some species than are lower elevations. Adjacent to Glacier, the Blackfeet Reservation has large chunks of this important lower elevation habitat. In a case such as this, only a multi-party, cooperative approach to conservation, with American Indians playing a key role, can be successful.

Collaboration between tribes and conservation organizations has many mutual benefits and practical advantages. Given the urgency of the threats facing natural resources in the area, neither community can afford to pass up opportunities to increase its strength through cooperation. Alliances can broaden the base of support and political clout of each community. Tribes have a long history of lobbying Congress and can bring an important political presence to environmental issues. Conservation groups have their own history of advocacy and their own set of political contacts. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
With their different world views and experiences, American Indians and conservationists can learn from and enrich one another's work. One conservationist who has collaborated with several tribes on fisheries issues observed that, although his training in fisheries management was based on knowledge and techniques dating back about 100 years, the tribes were using techniques and knowledge generated over thousands of years.

Although the approaches to resource management promoted by conservation organizations are of more recent vintage, they can be equally useful. Some conservation organizations, for example, are promoting use of computer technology to integrate layers of data as an aid to making land management decisions. Even though they may use different terms or technologies, both tribes and conservation groups often advocate the same holistic approach to resource management. As they work toward common goals, American Indians' and conservationists' diverse cultural contexts can balance and enhance each other.

<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Conservation organizations might also find working with tribal governments liberating. Although tribal governments can be as bureaucratic as other governments, they can sometimes be more flexible and creative in their natural resource management strategies. Tribal sovereignty frees tribes from federal multiple-use mandates that sometimes force public land managers to accommodate extractive land uses. (In the case of timber, however, the federal government has a clear role because it has a trust responsibility for managing Indian forests.) Tribes can set more stringent standards, such as for air and water quality and hunting and fishing codes, than states or the federal government.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Some conservation organizations choose to collaborate with American Indian grass-roots organizations. Although in theory American Indian grass-roots groups tend to be similar to conservation groups because both are nongovernmental, there may still be significant differences between these organizations. American Indian nongovernmental groups usually are newer, are less well funded, and have different agendas than conservation groups. Conservation organizations need to understand American Indian grass-roots groups' priorities and agendas and how these groups relate to tribal governments. To be effective, conservation groups that collaborate with American Indian grass-roots groups may also need to interact with the tribal government. According to several tribal representatives who participated in the workshop, whenever conservation organizations become involved in an issue affecting Indians, they should work with both the formal tribal government and the grass-roots American Indian organizations.</td></table>

<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="20">
Jon Roush, who was president of The Wilderness Society at the time the workshop was held, contrasted the perspectives of American Indians with those of the dominant American culture. The dominant culture often views land as a commodity to be bought and sold, engages in linear thinking, values the logical approach, and projects a  we know best  attitude. In contrast, American Indians often feel less pressured by time and view events and issues as cyclical.
 <BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
In addition to general cultural differences between American Indians and non-American Indians, cultural differences also exist among tribes and among conservation groups. There are more than 500 legally recognized tribal nations, each with its own customs and history. Similarly, conservation groups have a range of philosophies and approaches. Some are opposed to hunting; others consider hunting to be a useful wildlife management technique and, in the case of fee hunting, a way for local communities to derive economic benefits from natural resources. Some conservation groups use political advocacy to achieve their goals; others work at the grass roots to provide, for example, money and technical assistance for habitat restoration.

<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="20">
Although there have been a number of cases of tribes and conservation organizations forging successful relationships, these are exceptions and have tended to be short-term political alliances rather than long-term joint ventures. Participants at the  Building Bridges  workshop identified cultural differences and limited knowledge and understanding of each other as key reasons for the current lack of teamwork. In many cases, tribes and conservation organizations have simply moved in their own circles and have not had much interaction. In some cases, tribes have hesitated to seek outside allies and have preferred to manage their own lands with whatever funds and personnel they could develop. In other cases, tribes and conservation organizations have clashed over perceived or real differences. At times, conservation organizations have tried to interfere with a tribe's ability to manage its lands or have overlooked a tribe's role in the management of public lands. 
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Because the current political and economic climate gives tribes and conservation organizations increased incentives for collaborating with one another, prospects for working together have improved. Federal law allows tribes to assume responsibility for management of their natural resources. At the same time, federal funding for tribal budgets is being dramatically reduced, and thus collaborating with conservation organizations may seem more attractive now. An example is the Blackfeet Tribal Council, which recently asked its fish and wildlife program director to solicit technical assistance from, and form partnerships with, conservation groups as well as federal and state agencies.

Conservation organizations today face a political climate that is less than sympathetic to their concerns, and public funding for conservation programs is being cut. For the last two and a half decades, the conservation community has often relied on confrontation to achieve conservation. Although litigation and confrontation are still useful tools, many conservationists also realize that economic interests need to be factored into efforts to conserve natural resources and are exploring creative partnerships with businesses and private landowners for achieving conservation goals. Some conservation groups are trying to create economic incentives for private landowners to conserve natural resources on their property. Other conservation organizations are seeking ways to help local communities balance environmental protection with economic development. Collaborating with tribes is a logical extension of the conservation community's efforts to broaden its approach.</td>

Influenced by the environmental justice movement, conservation organizations have begun to recognize that they have a moral obligation to work with minority communities and other members of society that have been disproportionately burdened by environmental degradation. In addition, some conservation groups take a broader view of the term environment and interpret it to include protecting a diversity of cultures as well as a diversity of species and habitats. Because people act as agents of environmental change based on their cultural values, cultural protection and environmental protection are linked.

<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">The workshop focused on Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana-an area rich in wildlife, including bison, grizzly bears, gray wolves, and salmon, and graced by high mountain peaks, old growth forests, and wide open prairies. Several of our nation's greatest rivers-the Missouri, Snake, and Green rivers-spring from this rugged territory. The foothills and mountain valleys of the Rocky Mountains have become the easternmost ranges of many carnivores that were formerly found over much of North America. Also found here are immense reserves of coal, oil, gas, and various minerals. In addition to facing threats from industries intent on harvesting its bounty, parts of the region risk being loved to death by the masses of people migrating to it to escape congestion and environmental degradation elsewhere.

Covering significant portions of the region, Indian lands are home to the Salish, Kootenai, Blackfeet, Nez Perce, Shoshone, Bannock, Chippewa, Cree, Paiute, Arapahoe, Sioux, Coeur d'Alene, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Crow, and Northern Cheyenne tribes. In Montana, land owned by tribes or tribal members encompasses 5.6 million acres; in Wyoming, roughly 2 million acres; and in Idaho, nearly 940,000 acres. In this three-state region, critical spawning grounds for salmon, prime waterfowl habitat, and prairie grasslands are found on tribal lands, as are endangered or threatened species like grizzly bears, gray wolves, piping plovers, peregrine falcons, bald eagles, and least terns. The Blackfeet Reservation alone has more than 80,000 acres of pristine wetlands.  Many reservations are large blocks of land that have been buffered from the hyper-development that has affected other parts of the region, the most well-known example being Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The tribes in this region use their natural resources in a variety of ways, including coal mining, oil production, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric power production.

Jon Roush, then president of The Wilderness Society, conveyed the sense of urgency felt by many environmental organizations as a result of current congressional attacks on federal environmental protection laws. This sense of being under attack has increased the environmental groups' receptiveness to forming alliances with tribes. At a more basic level, said Roush,  environmentalists and tribes must work together. If environmentalists can't work with tribes, they're not doing [conservation] right.

<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">Sovereignty and self-determination are of fundamental importance to many American Indians, yet most conservationists have only a limited understanding of these concepts. Charles Wilkinson, a law professor, and Daniel Decker, a lawyer and an American Indian, provided overviews of these concepts.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Sovereignty is of extreme importance to tribes because it is the basis of their governmental power. A series of Supreme Court decisions over the past 175 years declared that, generally, tribes possess inherent governmental power over all internal affairs and that states are precluded from interfering with the tribes in their self-governance. Congress, however, has power to limit tribal sovereignty. Beginning in the early 1970s, Congress began to reverse earlier attempts (1953-1968) to end the special relationship tribes had with the federal government by subjecting them to state laws and converting their lands to private ownership. Laws were passed that encouraged and enabled tribes to govern themselves. Recent federal policies that advocate further strengthening of tribal self-governance have been enthusiastically welcomed by the American Indian community.

Some of the issues mentioned most frequently were mining, water allocation, water quality, wildlife management, riparian zone protection, bison reintroduction, wetlands conservation, and fisheries management. The amount of overlap among issues identified by tribes and by conservation groups indicated that perhaps the differences between the two groups were more perceived than real.

<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
As sovereign nations, tribes have a strong desire to strengthen self-governance. Conservation organizations that wish to work with Indian tribes must understand tribal sovereignty and appreciate the central importance it has for Indian people.</td></table>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Most tribes face huge unemployment with a nationwide average unemployment rate for tribes of 46 percent, and with some rates as high as 85 percent.2  Because of past bad experiences and a desire to chart their own futures, many tribes hesitate to work with outsiders. Tribal governments can be inefficient and bureaucratic. In their modern incarnation, they are relatively new entities, still feeling their way but growing at rapid rates. Moreover, smaller tribes may not have the tools for political action that many conservation organizations take for granted, such as electronic mail and travel funds.

<B><LI>Infrequent Interaction</B>. All too often, tribal representatives and staff of conservation groups from the same geographic region are working on the same environmental issues, yet do not know one another. There are few opportunities for the two communities to meet, except at times of crisis when emotions run high. The workshop provided a rare forum for safe, noncontentious interaction. 

<B><LI>Myths and Stereotypes.</B> Because tribes and conservation organization staff do not know one another very well, myths and stereotypes have taken seed in both camps. And, as is often the case with stereotypes, there are some strange contradictions: Although some conservation groups view tribes as allies (sometimes referring to them as  the first environmentalists), others see the tribes as resource exploiters. The resource exploiter stereotype has been particularly irritating to some tribal representatives because it underestimates their resource management capabilities.

<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">An example is the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes' bid to manage the National Bison Range, which is located within reservation boundaries and currently operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That bid is meeting with some resistance from the federal government and is not being supported by all conservation groups, even though the government had previously transferred health care responsibility to the tribes. This prompted one tribal attorney to ask why the tribes were allowed to provide health care for 11,000 human beings but questioned about their abilities to manage 350 bison.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Stereotypical images of conservation organizations also exist among American Indians. Two examples are seeing conservationists as extreme  tree-huggers  and as insensitive to Indian culture.

<B><LI>Cultural Differences. </B>Cultural differences-philosophies, perspectives, and communication styles-pose some of the largest obstacles to successful collaboration. To work together effectively, tribes and conservation groups need to learn about one another's cultures, and this means they must spend time listening to each other, both in meetings and in one-on-one exchanges. 

<B><LI>Organizational Differences.</B> Tribal governments and conservation organizations differ greatly in terms of style, motivation, and the pressures they face. Pressures on The Wilderness Society, for example, include fending off attempts on Capitol Hill to weaken key environmental laws or keeping members and raising funds. Pressures on tribal governments more often are economic and social in nature and have to do with the need to provide jobs, health care, education, and housing for tribal members.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
While conservation groups focus primarily on environmental protection, tribes face a broader range of challenges. Because tribal governments are often the reservations' largest employers and may own businesses like gaming operations, timber mills, manufacturing facilities, and stores, they function as both governors and leaders in economic development. Tribal council leader Rhonda Swaney talked of the myriad obligations of the Salish and Kootenai tribes as they struggle to balance environmental protection with economic and social concerns while striving to protect their cultural legacy at the same time.</OL>


<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">Workshop participants suggested a variety of ways to overcome these challenges:

<UL>
<LI>Invest the time needed to understand each other's concerns and cultures. 

<LI>Make a long-term commitment to work together. 

<LI>Share information with each other.

<LI>Be honest and respectful so as to earn the trust of the other party.

<LI>Learn from each other and avoid reinventing the wheel. By not underestimating the other party or being too proud to learn from one another, conservation organizations and tribes can provide each other with valuable information and skills.

<LI>Differentiate tribes and conservation groups one from another. Do not assume that one tribe can speak for another. For example, an umbrella organization like the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society cannot speak for its member tribes. Likewise, do not assume all conservation groups are similar.</UL>

<LI>
Several participants agreed to work together to establish a computer network to link all the workshop attendees and continue the workshop discussions on-line.

<LI>The Montana tribes made plans to establish a commission comprising all their tribal fish and game department directors. The conservation organizations suggested ways that this commission could serve as a forum for conservation groups and tribal fish and game staff to communicate about issues of mutual interest. The commission is now up and running.

<LI>The participants endorsed holding subsequent meetings that provide similar noncontentious environments in which to get to know and trust each other. These meetings should include participants from a smaller geographic area, such as one state, ecoregion, or watershed. WWF is in the process of organizing a follow-up meeting with Rocky Mountain American Indian tribes and Canadian indigenous groups that focuses on carnivore conservation.

<LI>Several participants proposed exploring opportunities for conservation organizations to assist tribes with developing strategies for ecosystem management and determining how wildlife conservation can provide benefits to local people, such as through ecotourism.

<LI>The Native American Fish and Wildlife Society is planning a meeting to build bridges between tribes and conservation organizations from the southwestern United States as part of an upcoming meeting of its southwest chapter.</UL>


<B>Conclusion</B>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">
Because they often have overlapping goals and similar underlying philosophies regarding the need to protect natural resources, tribes and conservation organizations are logical allies. Conser-vation organizations and tribes can effectively work together in a range of ways, and both communities are showing more receptivity and interest in collaborating.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="dot_clea.gif" width="25" height="15">However, these partnerships are not without challenges. Conser-vation organizations and tribes must be careful to be respectful of each other and must take into account each other's histories, priorities, and concerns. Partnerships will work only if they are built on solid relationships, and building relationships takes a considerable investment of time. But the investment is worth the effort. By teaming up, tribes and conservation groups can enhance their abilities to protect for future generations the natural resources that they both value so highly.

<HR>

Our governments had been asleep. Now we are awake,  said Daniel Decker, an attorney for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation and a tribal member. He was referring to the explosion since the 1970s in numbers of tribes who are beginning to exercise fully their right to govern themselves and their territories.
<BR><BR>
Decker went on to explain his views that, now that tribal governments have awakened, they have a right to grow and make mistakes. At stake is everything: tribal culture, religion, government. In all of the tribes endeavors, they feel pressured to do twice as well as the state government and twice as well as the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He pointed out that the tribes failures of 30 years ago are still talked about.
<BR><BR>   
Many who come to work with tribes fail to get to know them or learn about them, he said. They do not understand that American Indians live on their aboriginal territory, that Indian tribes ceded land and reserved certain rights both inside and outside reservation boundaries. These rights are somewhat analogous to easements in property law. The tribes struck a bargain, part of which was to retain interests.
<BR><BR>   
There must be individual trust before there can be relationships, said Decker. Tribes and conservation groups must build relationships before they can work well together. Those who wish to work with Indian tribes must take the time to learn about tribal governments and culture and tribal members as individuals. American Indians remember bad faith and bad treatment for a long time, and that information gets passed along to others in Indian country.

<table width=100%><td width=25%><font color="#cc9900">"We have an inherent duty and obligation to stewardship of the environment that goes beyond cultural and racial
boundaries." <br>--Ira Newbreast, tribal member and director of fish and wildlife department,Blackfeet tribe, Montana </td><td width=25></td><td width=70%>
<BR><BR>   
Tribes often have interests in common with conservation organizations; however, because of the many interests tribes must balance, they may not always agree with all of the conservationists agendas. Tribes must seek sound economic development for the good of their members and also follow traditions that protect the environment. For example, Flathead has turned down money for hydroelectric dams because the dams would have negatively affected its traditions and culture. 
 <BR><BR>  
There are times when American Indians want to take advantage of working with conservation groups to gain their support to help the tribes cause, just as conservation groups do with tribes. Conservation groups are invited to participate in tribal government through public meetings and through nontribal membership on governing boards. The two communities can work together only if conservation groups recognize and respect tribal authority and seek alliances that are mutually beneficial.

There is gold in the Little Rocky Mountains, which rise out of the grasslands of north central Montana. Home to bighorn sheep, elk, and golden eagles, these mountains are also sacred to the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribes of the adjacent Fort Belknap Reservation. Low concentrations of gold are being extracted at the Zortman and Landusky mines by leaching cyanide through large piles of gold-bearing ore. Mining on private land near the reservation has disturbed approximately 1,300 acres, and the mine operators are hoping to expand operations significantly.</td><td align=right width=40%><img src="/images/issues/mine.jpg"><br><font size=-1><b>Zortman and Landusky mines</b></font> </td></table>
<BR>
Since the mine was first proposed in the 1970s, the Fort Belknap community has voiced concern about groundwater and surface water contamination and the possible effects on human health of cyanide, acids, and heavy metals used at the mine. Several outside groups became involved. The Mineral Policy Center (MPC), a national nonprofit conservation organization, encouraged more media attention to the pollution caused by the mine and urged local people to get involved in the regulatory process. Two nonprofit legal support and conservation organizations, the Western Environmental Center and the Indian Law Resource Center, have litigated pollution issues on behalf of the tribes.
<BR><BR>
At the workshop, representatives of MPC and the Fort Belknap tribal government discussed the relationships among the MPC, the tribes, and a local citizens group. From this discussion emerged some important lessons about collaboration. According to Rose Main, former environmental protection manager for the Fort Belknap Reservation, the collaboration was successful because the issue was so important to both MPC and the Fort Belknap community. Overcoming their tendency to be suspicious of outside help, the tribes welcomed the assistance offered them by a non-Indian organization. MPC played a useful role in educating the community about the mine and how to influence the regulatory process, in providing copies of MPC comments on the environmental impact statement to the tribal government and the citizens group, and in helping the community get in touch with regulatory agencies, policy makers, and organizations that could be potential allies.
<BR><BR>
Although it is expected that the proposed mine expansion will soon be approved, opponents successfully reached an out-of-court settlement of litigation brought against the mine operators several years ago for violations of the federal Clean Water Act. The settlement, finalized in July 1996, requires the mine operator to pay up to $32 million to upgrade and expand mine wastewater management and treatment facilities and eventually to eliminate toxic discharges. The mine operators also agreed to study the possible impacts of contaminants on residents of the Fort Belknap Reservation, to provide water supplies to several communities, and to evaluate the quality of the reservations groundwater. The mine operators will also pay the tribe $1 million in partial settlement of claims against the mines.

Will Murray, then director of The Nature Conservancys conservation programs for its western regional office, reflected on his experiences working with American Indians. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) works to preserve plants, animals, and natural communities by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive. Over the past few years, TNC has been searching for ways to be more effective in local communities and is currently working with American Indians in various capacities in about 30 states. Somewhat disappointed by its past efforts in working with tribes and unclear about what approach to take, in the summer of 1995 TNC convened a meeting of advisers from around the country to address two questions: Does it make sense for TNC to work with tribes? And, if so, is the current approach the right one?
<BR><BR>
Murray explained that cooperating with tribes has moved TNC out of its  comfort zone buying land, managing land, relying on Western science, working with the dominant cultureand into a  discomfort zone.  Within that zone, TNC must play an advocacy role, tread carefully when working with tribes who are sometimes distrustful of outsiders, determine how to incorporate traditional American Indian knowledge into conservation strategies, and deal sensitively with unfamiliar cultures. Despite the awkwardness of the  discomfort zone,  TNC still sees value in working with American Indian communities to manage their resources sustainably.  We have so much to learn about sustainable land use,  Murray said.  Working with native Americans might change the way The Nature Conservancy works in other places. 
<BR><BR>
The upshot of the meeting was that TNC could indeed be of service to some tribes at some times but that its approach could be improved. TNC identified several principles of operation that guide its work with American Indians:
<UL><LI>Out of respect for their authority, always work through the tribal government. 
<LI>Become involved in a project only if the tribe is a willing partner. Ideally, a tribe will invite a conservation organization to work with it. If a conservation organization makes overtures to a tribe, learn how to take  no  for an answer.
<LI>Work according to the terms of the American Indian partner so as to achieve success. Undertake the project in ways that work for the tribepolitically, socially, culturally, economically, technologically, and spiritually.
<LI>Create capacity within the tribal community to take over the project. For example, although TNC has technical expertise that tribes currently need (only a small percentage of tribes have biologists on staff and TNC has 300 biologists), over time TNC hopes to work itself out of its joint projects as the tribes develop their own capacities.</UL>

Charles Wilkinson, a law professor at the University of Colorado who has taught Indian law and natural resources law for 20 years and published several books on these subjects, provided the workshop participants with a historical overview of tribal sovereignty. 
<BR><BR>
Tribal sovereignty is often overlooked by history and government teachers, who generally instruct their pupils that the United States has only federal, state, and local governments. American Indians have an intensely emotional commitment to tribal sovereignty that is not felt by most non-Indians about their own government and often not understood in dealings with tribal governments. Part of this passion comes from Indian peoples very precise sense of the past. Because of their strong oral tradition, they know more about their ancestors than most non-Indians know about theirs and are acutely aware that the high point of their civilization occurred sometime around the mid-1800s.
<BR><BR>  
During the long period of time that American Indians have inhabited North America, their close-knit societies were governed by systems for adjudicating wrong and meting out punishment. Their laws were often stricter than the laws of todays majority American culture.
<BR><BR></td></table>
<table width=100%><tr><td colspan=3>
In his 19th-century Supreme Court decisions on Indian sovereignty, which many people believe mark the beginnings of the modern-day concept of tribal sovereignty, Justice John Marshall conveyed his understanding and acknowledgment that tribal governments were indeed real governments. These rulings put the concept of American Indian sovereignty into the formal structure of federal law. The legal precedent established by these decisions lay largely dormant until 1978 when another court used the concept in reference to a tribal government. Since then, tribes have used legal and political mechanisms to greatly strengthen their sovereignty under the U.S. legal systemmore than might ever have been imagined possible. Were it not for the commitment of American Indians to full sovereignty, tribes might not have their current government-to-government relationship with the federal government in which tribal sovereignty is considered a serious legal issue and force.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=75%>   
For tribes of the Rocky Mountains and Plains areas, the beginning to middle of the 19th century was probably the time of their greatest vitality following the arrival of Europeans. However, the year 1887 marked the beginning of a precipitous loss of Indian land across the nation caused by the federal General Allotment Act, which allowed the president to allot 160 acres of reservation land to every tribal member, with the hope that private land ownership would enhance the assimilation of Indians into the dominant culture. American Indians had already sustained large land losses through treaties signed (sometimes under duress) earlier. The Allotment Act resulted in the loss of an additional 90 million acres of Indian reservation lands as the lands beyond those allotted were sold. Many individual allotments were lost because tribal members could not afford to pay the taxes or were swindled out of their land by disingenuous non-Indian buyers. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 ended the federal allotment policy and stemmed this rapid loss of land.
<BR><BR>   
In the 1950s, federal lawmakers enacted further policies aimed at assimilating Indians, including a policy of dissolving Indian reservations and, along with them, tribal sovereignty. During this period, tribal religion, culture, and sovereignty went underground.</td><td width=10></td>
<td valign=center width=25%>
<font size=-1 color="#cc9900">"We have to protect
nature for our future generations. More of our Indian people need to get involved in natural resource management on each of our
reservations. In the long run, natural resources will be our bread and butter by our developing them through tourism and
recreation and just by the opportunity they provide for us to enjoy the outdoor world." <br>--Robert Belcourt, Chippewa-Cree tribal
member, director of natural resources department, Rocky Boy Reservation, Montana</td></tr></table>
American Indian tribes began to fight back in the 1970s, as epitomized by such events as the founding of the Native American Rights Fund and the organization and activities of the American Indian Movement. Tribal courts were reborn, and the tribes began to hire their own staff to protect natural resources on and off reservations. As more Indians became lawyers, tribes began seeking redress and power through litigation. (As recently as 1965, however, there were only 12 Indian lawyers in the entire country, and none of them represented tribes.)  
<BR><BR>   
In the modern era, the U.S. Supreme Court has both helped and hindered Indian sovereignty. Tribes suffered serious losses in cases involving religious freedom, land-use planning, water rights, and criminal jurisdiction. But there were significant victories in the areas of regulation of hunting and fishing, taxation, and the jurisdictional reach of tribal courts over Indians and non-Indians.
<BR><BR>   
Today, by exercising their sovereignty through active governing of their members and their landsa role long held by the Bureau of Indian Affairstribes have taken control of their destinies. A gathering like the  Building Bridges  workshop would not have been possible 10 years ago because, even that recently, the Bureau of Indian Affairs maintained control over most Indian reservations. With tribes assuming responsibility for more and more programs that were historically administered by the BIA, they have regained control over their reservations with only limited restrictions.

A cornerstone of World Wildlife Fund's global conservation efforts for the past 35 years, parks and protected areas are the backbone of large-scale efforts to conserve wild places and the species they support. To be effective in conserving biological diversity for the long term, however, parks must serve the social and economic needs of people around them while, at the same time, preserving populations of wild species in an increasingly fragmented and isolated landscape.
<BR><BR>
To put it simply, people often need to get into parks, and wildlife often need to get out. People living in and around protected areas need to have access to the natural resources that sustain their daily lives. Wildlife, especially mammals whose ranges are vast, need to roam beyond park boundaries.
<BR><BR>
In this edition of Conservation Issues, Jonathan S. Adams looks at what protected-area 
conservation has traditionally involved and what it needs to become to meet today's complex challenges. 
In "National Parks: New Uses for Old Tools," Adams suggests that, far from abandoning the tried-and-true tool of setting aside parks and protected areas, we need only change how we use the tool. Conservationists must recognize a park's ecological value, as well as its value in an economic, spiritual, cultural, and historical sense.
<BR><BR>
We at World Wildlife Fund recognize that protected areas can no longer survive as islands of rich biological diversity surrounded by degraded habitats. We have therefore added new conservation tools that include scientific mapping techniques, income-generation strategies, and approaches to giving local communities better access to natural resources.
<BR><BR>
Over the course of WWF's 35 years in global conservation, we have helped to create 450 parks and reserves around the world. Learning how to use this tool in new ways may be difficult at times, but the payoff in terms of increased species protection could be dramatic.

When World Wildlife Fund began its conservation efforts 35 years ago, equipping and training park rangers meant giving them shoes and teaching them how to enforce antipoaching laws. Although those same rangers may still need shoes, backpacks, and other equipment, their training needs have grown exponentially to encompass the skills required to use satellite global positioning systems and the ability to enlist local community support for wildlife conservation.
<BR><BR><table width=100%><td width=75%>
How can national parks be both symbols of the traditional way to conserve wildlife and the linchpins of 21st century approaches to saving species and their habitats? The answer lies in the emergence over the past 15 years of two equally important yet profoundly different conservation strategies: one that focuses on meeting the needs of people and another that uses the tools of ecology and related sciences to preserve intact ecosystems. Conservationists do not divide neatly into two camps along these lines, and nearly all recognize the importance and utility of both approaches. Yet the tension between the two is readily apparent by looking at where national parks have come from and where they may be going.</td><td width=10></td><td valign=middle><b><font color="#000066">"Without secure parks, efforts to integrate conservation and development would be built on quicksand."</b></font></td></table>
<BR><BR>
A case in point is Nepal's Royal Chitwan National Park, which once harbored a large population of greater one-horned rhinos. Heavy pressure from poaching for the rhinos' increasingly valuable horns--a staple in traditional Asian medicines--plus a growing human population outside the park began to cause rhino populations to plummet. They reached a low of roughly 60 in the late 1960s. Chitwan no longer provided a safe haven for rhinos, and the survival of both the animal and the park seemed in doubt. 
<BR><BR>
Today nearly 500 rhinos live in Chitwan--so many that the government of Nepal ships some of the enormous beasts to Bardia National Park, farther to the west, where all of its rhinos had been wiped out in the 19th century. The newfound success of rhino conservation in Chitwan stems in part from improved antipoaching activities. More fundamentally, however, the stability of the park and its animal populations can be traced to a deeper understanding of the role of local people in the conservation and use of natural resources surrounding the park. 
<BR><BR>
From the perspective of a rural community, the story of rhinos in Chitwan reinforces the growing notion that national parks no longer dominate the changing landscape of conservation. Although a focus on national parks remains the foundation of most conservation efforts, in recent years, some governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have added new and sophisticated approaches to bringing together conservation and human development. These new approaches may create the impression that traditional national parks are outdated, even quaint. From an ecological perspective, however, the Chitwan story demonstrates quite the opposite.
<BR><BR>
Far from being unnecessary, national parks are more important than ever. Parks and other protected areas not only safeguard the last stretches of intact habitat for countless wild species, they also serve as crucial reservoirs of biological diversity. Without secure parks, efforts to integrate conservation and development would be built on quicksand.
<BR><BR>
When managing protected areas was essentially a policing task, park managers tended to see local people as the major obstacle. Today, the park community affairs officer joins the park guard and park naturalist in understanding that earning the support of local people is a conservation imperative.
<BR><BR>

<B>Taking a Fresh Look</B>
<table width=100%><td width=63%>
<BR><BR>
Some conservationists argue that it is time to start thinking in terms of customers and markets and constituencies for protected areas; that it is time to recognize that social, cultural, spiritual, economic, and political issues are not peripheral, but central, to the business of conservation. These changes mark an enormously important evolution in the role of national parks in the conservation of the Earth's biological diversity. National parks and other types of protected areas are the backbone of large-scale efforts to conserve wild habitats and the species they support. Conservationists, however, see these areas as part of both the broad ecological landscape and the human and economic landscape.
</td><td width=10></td><td width=35%><img src="/images/issues/chitwan.jpg"><br><b><font size=-1>Few areas in the world contain the abundance of wildlife found in Nepal's Royal Chitwan National Park, a haven for the greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis)</b></font></td></table>
<BR><BR>
Protected areas cannot fulfill their role as reservoirs of biological diversity unless conservationists, scientists, governments, and local communities can integrate them into this complex "bioeconomic" landscape. More often than not, the human and ecological perspectives do not mesh, and many conservation efforts stand or fall on the extent to which they can resolve the conflicts that ensue.
<BR><BR>
The challenge is particularly relevant to World Wildlife Fund. Since 1961, WWF has helped to establish, fund, or manage nearly 450 parks and reserves worldwide, from the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico to the Jigme Dorji National Park in Bhutan. The protected areas WWF has supported cover more than 260 million acres of wildlife habitat--an area more than twice the size of California. WWF also works to safeguard protected areas from threats beyond their boundaries. WWF's efforts have helped save thousands of irreplaceable plant and animal species, including lobelias and groundsels in Uganda's Rwenzori National Park, the greater one-horned rhino in Chitwan, golden lion tamarins in Brazil's Poco das Antas Federal Biological Reserve, and African elephants in reserves throughout Africa like Chobe National Park in Botswana and the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park of the Central African Republic.
<BR><BR>
This impressive list of achievements does not begin to tell the whole story. None of these areas can survive as islands surrounded by degraded habitats that limit gene dispersal, alter ecosystem processes, and produce regional and global climate change that may lead to the final disappearance of the habitats and species the parks were designed to protect. Protected areas must be part of broader approaches to land management built on the best available science, farsighted economic strategies, and the participation of local communities. 
<BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td width=80%>
<B>The History and Current Status of National Parks</B>
<BR><BR>
The cultural roots of parks and reserves run deep in human history.  Assyrian noblemen set aside wild areas for hunting and riding as far back as 700 B.C., and the ruling classes of ancient Rome and Medieval Europe claimed open spaces for their exclusive use. Some kings set aside small areas for specific species, like Lithuania's Bialowieza forest, established in 1541 as a reserve for the European bison, or the Swiss reserve created in 1569 to protect the chamois. For the most part, people labeled as wilderness any area that had not yet been tamed and had no particular value for development or other uses.	
<BR><BR>
The idea of national parks did not find widespread favor until the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. Yellowstone and the other "crown jewel" parks of the American west were intended, for the most part, to preserve spectacular scenery. These parks also fit an attitude toward conservation summed up in Aldo Leopold's oft-quoted maxim that "to save every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering." Although to some people this "tinkering" seemed a relatively straightforward task of creating and managing protected natural areas to be safe from human intrusion, Leopold himself saw the deeper problems inherent in this effort. He recognized the need not just for new legal and administrative structures but for a reformed relationship between humanity and the land. For most people, however, the comfortable, familiar national parks symbolized the means by which Americans fulfilled a commitment to nature.
<BR><BR>
By mid-century, the Yellowstone model had spread to Latin America, Africa, and Asia, although in many cases creation of these national parks represented a thinly disguised extension of the colonialist expropriation of land. Since the mid-1970s, most of the new national parks have been in developing countries, and more than a third of all protected areas are less than 10 years old.
<BR><BR>
The World Conservation Union (IUCN) now counts roughly 8,500 protected areas around the world that meet the organization's criteria (see <A HREF="cicrit.html">IUCN Criteria for Protected Areas</A>). These areas cover 5 percent of the Earth's land surface--an area twice the size of India. Another 40,000 protected areas that do not meet IUCN standards would bring the total coverage to almost 10 percent of the terrestrial surface of the Earth. These areas often play enormously valuable ecological and economic roles by safeguarding outstanding places of living richness, natural beauty, and cultural significance. Protected areas provide inspiration, maintain diversity, and protect genetic varieties and species. Many protected areas are home to people and provide direct and indirect benefits to local and national economies. Many more protected areas have scientific, educational, cultural, recreational, and spiritual value.
<BR><BR></td></tr>
<tr><td width=80%>
<B>The Ecology of Protected Areas</B>
<BR><BR>
Protected areas can fulfill none of these roles if they cannot survive in a modern landscape that becomes more fragmented every day. The traditional model of parks and protected areas has numerous ecological shortcomings. First, national parks were originally intended to protect scenic wonders, like the geysers of Yellowstone or the vistas of Yosemite valley. From the park manager's perspective, a landscape has one enormous attraction: It does not move. When Teddy Roosevelt created a series of protected areas in the early 20th century, he knew that, barring geological catastrophe, their physical attributes would remain more or less the same for millennia.
<BR><BR>
Although a focus on scenic values seems ill-suited for conserving ecological processes and biological diversity, it has been applied, broad brush, across complex ecosystems and land long used by human communities. The park-as-landscape model seems as inappropriate for the dry rangelands of the American southwest, where American Indians were excluded from culturally significant sites, as it is for the African savanna with its migrating herds of wildebeest and zebra and its ancient mutualism with human activity. Yet for many people the Serengeti has become the exemplar of what a national park should be.
<BR><BR>
Until recently, park planners seldom designed protected areas with ecological functions in mind. Politicians gave no thought to the ecology of an area before they declared it a park. This is hardly surprising, given that most parks were created before ecology gained credibility even within the scientific community. Parks fulfilled their role in large part because agriculture, ranching, grazing, logging, or mining were not permitted. Parks have also tended to be located in places where the terrain is poor, rocky, or infertile. The high altitude, unforgiving "rock and snow" parks of the American west, for example, dwarf the few tiny remnants of pre-settlement landscape in the fertile midwest. Worldwide, however, such tiny "island" parks far outnumber the giants.
<BR><BR>
Conservation biologists now recognize that a viable protected area must be large enough to allow vital ecological processes--evolution, natural disturbances like fire and floods--to proceed. Put in more practical terms, protected areas in many parts of the world must provide enough habitat for large mammals. Protection of these so-called "umbrella" species, such as tigers and elephants, ensures that myriad other species from birds to beetles, which attract less attention but are no less (and perhaps even more) ecologically important, are also protected. 
<BR><BR>
Rapid human population growth means there are few remaining large and unspoiled wilderness areas on Earth. Where such areas exist, there are enormous economic pressures to use the land for human benefit. Even when the economic resources are available to support setting aside large protected areas, the land is already fragmented and degraded. In Florida, for example, only two preserves provide enough habitat for a single adult Florida panther, and 85 percent of the state's new preserves cannot even support a single otter. 
<BR><BR>
Although national parks in the United States were created to protect scenic wonders, parks in Africa, Asia, and Latin America often began as efforts to save particularly charismatic species like elephants, tigers, or jaguars. That focus may have been too narrow, and the scale too small. Ecological analysis of far larger and more complex regions may hold the keys to a conservation approach that recognizes the role of national parks while at the same time looking beyond them to ensure biodiversity conservation. Such an approach requires landscape-level conservation areas, such as the Tri-National Reserve in the Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Congo. The landscape approach drives WWF's efforts to identify real and potential tiger habitats that can form the basis of tiger conservation units (see <A HREF="citiger.html">WWF'S Tiger Conservation Strategy</A>). These units need not be unbroken, dense habitats, but rather broadly contiguous areas with core habitats surrounded by other areas in the broader bioeconomic landscape that allow human habitation and use.
<BR><BR>
The distribution of protected areas around the world is neither balanced nor comprehensive. Some key ecosystems such as tropical dry forests, marine and fresh waters, temperate rain forests and grasslands, and oceanic islands are under-represented. An internationally recognized set of guidelines for evaluation of the present coverage of protected areas could help conservationists identify major gaps in this coverage and set targets to fill these gaps. Most conservationists today agree that protected areas should include all species, ecosystems, communities, and habitats, including varieties and genotypes of economic value. Parks also must be able to sustain essential ecological processes, such as watersheds or migration, and should protect a variety of both geological and historical landscapes.
<BR><BR>
In deciding where to put a park or protected area, governments and conservationists also should consider the degrees of endemism, irreplaceability, and natural rarity, as well as the presence of threatened species, habitats, or formations. Finally, park planners should consider whether the park will attract local and international tourists, how the park will effect local communities, and how those communities will benefit from the existence of the park. 
<BR><BR>
Criteria such as these would no doubt strengthen both existing and planned national park systems. They do not, however, address the larger problem of how the general public perceives national parks. For some conservationists, establishing a national park is just one part of a long and arduous process of managing and protecting it, as well as the often more difficult task of working to save species outside of protected areas. For many supporters of conservation, however, the park represents the end of the process, and suggests that the battle to save a species or a landscape has been won. As Aldo Leopold said: "We console ourselves with the comfortable fallacy that a single museum-piece will do, ignoring the clear dictum of history that a species must be saved in many places if it is to be saved at all."  
<BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td width=80%>
<B>The Economics of Protected Areas</B>
<BR><BR>
Parks and protected areas face numerous economic challenges. In many cash-starved countries, funding for parks is nonexistent, and the parks exist only on paper. Yet, because tourism or resource use in the parks only rarely has the earning potential of agriculture or settlement, few parks can earn their keep in economic terms alone. Much of this problem stems from inappropriate or shortsighted economic analysis. An economic value can be placed on many but not all of the benefits of protected areas. Benefits like maintenance and conservation of environmental resources and ecological processes; protection of cultural and historical sites and objects; and provision of educational and research opportunities are particularly difficult to measure in economic terms. More tractable benefits, such as those from watershed protection, are often dispersed over the landscape and not confined to the protected area itself.
<BR><BR>
Economic valuation of protected areas naturally focuses on the most readily quantifiable aspects, particularly production of natural resources like timber and wildlife, and services like recreation and tourism. Because the market is unable to incorporate nonmonetary values, however, economists and policy makers seldom recognize the total benefits of protected areas, and the often obvious costs of the protected areas outweigh the unseen and unappreciated benefits. Traditional economic analysis also does not adequately address the question of distribution of benefits, which remains a key issue for the future of protected areas. 
<BR><BR>
Because governments find it difficult to capture the benefits of protected areas, budget allocations for management of protected areas are frequently inadequate, and funding becomes a chronic problem (see <A HREF="cibelize.html">Funding for Protected Areas in Belize</A>). Users of protected areas usually pay only a nominal fee and the true valuation of the area's benefits in the marketplace is never fully expressed.
<BR><BR>
Perhaps the most significant cost of a protected area is the loss to people living nearby of opportunities to use the park's resources. The benefits of the protected area may not be readily apparent to the local community. When costs loom large and benefits are seen as either small, distant, or received by others, the incentives for illegal use increase.
<BR><BR>
Economic development may relieve some of this pressure on protected areas, but some conservationists believe that promoting economic development conflicts with conservation objectives. Sound, conservation-minded development requires a firm grasp of national and international policies. In Laos, for example, the government wants to build more than 50 dams, nearly all of which require international funding. Many of these proposed dams are potentially harmful to biologically important areas, including parks.  Conservationists would do well to participate in the analysis of the country's energy needs and to work with the government and international donors to place the type of dams that are required to meet these needs where they will cause the least damage to biological diversity. 
<BR><table width=100%><td width=75%>
With one-half of the world's population and some of its fastest growing economies, Asia presents the most immediate test of the relationship between conservation and development. In the most optimistic 
scenario, development leads to better education, which leads to greater demand for conservation. Given that research into the complex interaction between economic development and conservation has barely begun, conservationists may, indeed, be conducting a series of immense, uncontrolled experiments, with a high price to be paid for failure. Under these conditions, national parks and other protected areas could serve as the last line of defense by maintaining intact vital areas of biodiversity while rural communities, ecologists, economists, and politicians search for innovative ways of balancing ecological and human needs. One attempt, now under way in Nepal's Royal Chitwan National Park, is based on the premise that when national policies direct that a portion of ecotourism revenues be returned to local communities for park protection and community services, both wildlife and people benefit (see <A HREF="citour.html">Tourism That Pays for Conservation</A>).
<BR><BR></td><td valign=middle><b><font color="#000066">"With one-half of the world's population and some of its fastest growing economies, Asia presents the most immediate test of the relationship between
conservation and development." </b></font></td></table>
<B>The Bioeconomic Landscape</B>
<BR><BR>
Parks must provide tangible benefits to society. Nearly every culture reveres some wild places, will do whatever it takes to manage them wisely, and will pay whatever cost to protect them, regardless of whether they earn an economic return. Those highly valued protected areas, however, make up a relatively small percentage of the total area protected, at least on paper. Everywhere else, wilderness as a land useas habitat, as a source of forest resources, as a tourist attractioncompetes politically and economically with agriculture, logging, and other uses.
<BR><table width=100%><td width=75%>
Understanding and acting on the economic implications of protected areas and their potential to improve sustainable rural production poses a significant challenge to park managers. This entails integrating protected areas into larger planning and policy frameworks, linking protected areas to biodiversity and climate change, and promoting greater financial support for protected areas by better understanding the economic benefits that flow from such areas. </td>
<td valign=middle><b><font color="#000066">"Resolving conflicts over resource use in and around national parks and other protected areas requires good science, inclusive politics, and innovative economics."</font></b></td></table>
<BR><BR>
National parks are also unlikely to survive without some degree of local control of natural resources. Human communities living in and around protected areas often have important and long-standing relationships with these areas. Local and indigenous communities may depend on the resources of these areas for their livelihood and cultural survival. These relationships have too often been ignored and even destroyed by management initiatives that permit exploitation in nonsustainable ways. Protected areas cannot coexist with local communities that are hostile to them, but they can achieve significant social and economic objectives when placed in a proper context. 
<BR><BR>
Yet the problems facing protected areas cannot be summed up in terms of the relationship between people and the environment, nor even in terms of the dynamics of ecosystems and the details of ecological science. Rather, the current challenges result from competition among people over resourcesa competition often abetted by development policies that encourage unsound development practices. Resolving conflicts over resource use in and around national parks and other protected areas requires good science, inclusive politics, and innovative economics.
<BR><BR>
Conservationists, governments, and communities also need to find a new definition of a national park. Governments can no longer create parks by relocating the people who have for generations lived in ecologically sensitive areas. Erecting legal barriers to the use of resources those communities once took for granted only creates hostility. Inviolate, core areas vital to the conservation of biological diversity form the backbone of a comprehensive protected areas system, but these areas can survive only by changing the legal framework within which protected areas exist so that local communities can have access to multiple-use areas and the resources they need. 
<BR><BR>
Such changes do not reflect a shift in conservation priorities, but rather a recognition of changing opportunities. Conservation organizations like WWF cannot function as government. They can neither create nor patrol national parks. Conservationists can, however, strengthen management practices and can help ensure that parks and protected areas fit into an ecologically and economically rational system.
<BR><BR>

<B>Moving Beyond Parks </B>
<BR><BR>
National parks have always been simply a tool for conservation. Once the only tool, today national parks have been joined by other, equally important categories of protected areas. In Latin America, for example, some communities have created their own protected areas. In Ecuador, the Aw have created a protected area on land the community has traditionally owned, while in Chimalapas, Mexico, communities have created a protected area on land they had long used but to which they had no legal rights. In addition, some municipal governments, recognizing the importance of watershed protection and forestry to urban communities, are taking on management of protected areas.
<BR><BR>
More generally, many conservationists, communities, and governments have endorsed integrated conservation and development projects, or ICDPs, as a means of reconciling the need for protected areas with the needs of people living nearby. Although the initial enthusiasm for ICDPs might have been excessive and few have yet proved successful, the idea of meeting human needs through the environmentally sound use of resources remains an important addition to the conservation tool kit. The success or failure of an ICDP will turn partly on local circumstancesthe capacity of local nongovernmental organizations, the type of resources in the protected area, the structure of the local communitiesand partly on the effectiveness of regional and national policy frameworks, such as those pouring tourism revenues back into parks, rather than into national treasuries. In some cases, ICDPs may be too limited, and a better solution would be to promote larger-scale development further away from the protected area. 
<BR><BR>
Parks and protected areas will vanish unless they fit into the bioeconomic landscape. ICDPs for the most part represent  small-scale attempts to establish links between protected areas and the livelihood of local communities. Large efforts will also be needed. In the Kikori River basin of Papua New Guinea, for example, WWF and local communities within a 6 million-acre region are exploring timber-cutting alternatives for local landowners, such as one by Hope Forests, a local community company, which is selectively cutting timber according to a plan that minimizes the impact on forests and wildlife.  
<BR><BR>
The Kikori project and others like it are experiments for a new era of conservation. In many cases, conservationists would be unwilling to conduct such experiments without the security provided by national parks, the reservoirs of biological diversity and the last line of defense for the Earth's natural riches. At the same time, conservationists are reinventing the language of national parks to incorporate the lessons of conservation biology and environmental economics. National parks thus stand at a unique moment in their history: both symbols of the past and foundations for the future.

For most people, saving a tiger means exactly that. But not all tigers are the same. A tiger living in the northern forests of the Russian Far East may be quite differentbehaviorally, genetically, demographicallyfrom a tiger living in the grasslands of Nepal. Conservation scientists have come to realize that saving the tiger means focusing not just on the animal itself but on the ecological conditions that must be there for the tiger to survive.
<BR><BR>
Tigers face extinction in the wild across their historic range, from the Russian Far East to the southern tip of Sumatra. Numerous protected areas for tigers exist, on paper at least, but the combination of habitat loss and poaching for the Chinese medicinal market has already exterminated some tigers, and all remaining populations are at risk. 
<BR><BR>
With limited success, governments and conservationists have spent enormous sums of money to stem the decline in tiger populations with most efforts focused on a few prominent protected areas. The failure of this approach to stem the decline in tiger populations highlights the need to look beyond the national parks when setting priorities for conservation. 
<BR><BR>
In 1996, WWF developed a tiger conservation strategy that addresses four goals:

<OL><LI>Identifying areas across the tiger range where conservation action and funds would give tigers the greatest chance of persistence.

<LI>Developing general approaches appropriate for these high priority areas.

<LI>Mapping, for the first time, tiger areas across five distinct bioregionsthe Indian subcontinent, Indochina, Southeast Asia, Central and southern China, and the Russian Far Eastat a scale suitable for conservation planning.

<LI>Selecting priority countries and activities for building enforcement and trade control capacity and for reducing the demand for tiger products.</OL>

<BR>
WWF's strategy seeks to achieve one of the fundamental goals of conservation biology, called "maintaining representation." Essentially a scientific term for Aldo Leopold's notion of saving every cog and wheel, maintaining representation simply means ensuring the survival of all distinct habitat types and ecological communities. For the tiger conservation strategy, WWF divided the five bioregions into eight tiger habitat types, among them, tropical dry forest, alluvial grasslands, and mangroves. WWF then identified approximately 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) or clusters of habitats that support, or have the potential to support, tiger populations.
<BR><BR>
WWF then ranked the TCUs according to whether they contained intact or degraded habitat, the extent of poaching pressure, and the status of the tiger population. WWF scientists also considered the reversibility of these threats, with habitat degradation the most difficult to reverse and population decline the easiest. Tiger populations can rebound quickly if they and their habitat and prey are protected over sufficiently large areas.
<BR><BR>
This elaborate process enabled WWF to categorize TCUs into four categories, or levels, according to their priority for conservation. Traditional protected areas cover only a fraction of the TCUs. Although tigers may survive outside of reserves and sanctuaries, their reproduction may be low or nonexistent. The TCU approach thus points to the need to change the way people use the land outside of the parksa difficult proposition that will rely heavily on a broader landscape approach to both conservation and development.  
<BR><BR>
Therein lies the crux of the problem. Conservationists argue that planning should be around TCUs, not traditional protected areas, but TCUs are not yet, nor are they likely to become, legal entities. And, because they contain farms, villages, and roads, changing the way people use land will require bringing together various jurisdictions and various government ministries. Rural communities and government agencies alike will want to see an economic return from the proposed TCUs before they fully embrace the concept.

<p>
Five years ago, WWF began working with the government of Belize and local conservation groups to discuss new ways of generating long-term funding for protected areas. These efforts came to fruition in December 1995, when Belize's parliament passed legislation establishing the Protected Areas Conservation Trust (PACT). The PACT will generate at least half a million dollars a year for conservation, based on a $3.75 "conservation fee" which is added on to the airport departure tax for all foreign tourists. Other countries are now looking to the PACT as an example of how to raise funds for conservation in an era of government budget shortfalls and declining international aid. 
<BR><BR>
Thirty-six percent of Belize is under some form of protected-area status, including forest reserves, national parks, and wildlife sanctuaries. However, the government lacks the financial capacity to manage these protected areas adequately. Because tourism is Belize's largest industry, a WWF-supported researcher  proposed the idea of charging a $20 conservation fee to the 125,000 foreign tourists who visit Belize each year. This fee would raise $2.5 million a year for conservation. A marketing survey showed that most tourists would be willing to pay such a fee as long as they knew it would be used solely to conserve Belize's protected areas and not go into general government coffers. The proposal suggested that the fees collected should go directly to the PACT, governed by a board of directors composed of representatives from government, nongovernmental organizations, and the tourist industry.
<BR><BR>
Because the tourism industry feared that $20 was too high and would cause foreign tourists to go elsewhere, the fee was reduced to $3.75, which WWF believes is too low. Even this amount, however, is expected to generate half a million dollars annually. 
<BR><BR>
In addition to the $3.75 conservation fee, the PACT will also be funded by 20 percent of all recreation-related license fees such as fishing and diving fees and by what WWF hopes will be matching contributions from international aid agencies. Finally, funds raised from individual donors will go into a tax-exempt private foundation that will complement PACT.
<BR><BR>
According to the PACT legislation, the PACT can be used for ten categories of activities, including training, research, protected-area management plans, institutional support to NGOs, environmental education, and small loans to community-based ecotourism ventures. In addition, each year 5 percent of all revenues will be set aside for an endowment fund to be used in case of emergencies or unexpected revenue shortfalls. The PACT cannot be used to pay the salaries of government employees or the recurrent expenses of any government agency.
<BR><BR>
The idea of using a tourist tax earmarked for a conservation fund is now being considered by other countries. WWF is currently working with the government of Namibia to draft legislation to create a similar conservation trust fund based on a tourist tax, and WWF has recently been asked to develop a proposal for a multi-country Mediterranean conservation fund based on a tourist tax. Because tourism is now the world's largest industry, charging tourists a relatively modest conservation fee has the potential to generate large sums for conservation. The PACT example illustrates that establishing these new funding mechanisms, while neither quick nor easy, can have a major impact on conservation.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Medicine From the Wild: Traffic Examines Impact on 
North American Wildlife
</FONT></CENTER> 





<P>Most people in western developed countries, such as the United States, 
receive their medicines in encapsulated form, packaged inside tiny 
pristine boxes sold from shop shelves. The origin of these medicines is 
generally obscure and the general public probably believes their 
medicines were derived from a formulation of inorganic chemicals devised 
by a sterile pharmaceutical laboratory. In fact, however, the active 
ingredient or essence of many western medicines is based on or obtained 
from wild animal and plant derivatives-wildlife medicines. Western 
pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to search for new wildlife 
medicinal cures in the forests, meadows, wetlands, rivers, and oceans of 
the world.</P>





<P>People have used medicines derived from wildlife for thousands of 
years and the dependence on wildlife for medicinal purposes continues 
today through the commercial demands of western pharmaceutical companies 
and traditional systems of health care. The World Health Organization has 
estimated that perhaps 80 percent of the world's population rely on 
animal and plant-based medicines. Conservationists are concerned that 
while human populations and demand for wildlife medicines continue to 
increase, many wild medicinal species are being forced into shrinking 
habitats. A few taxa occurring in isolated and declining numbers, such as 
rhinos (Rhinocerotidae spp.) and tigers (Panthera tigris), are in 
immediate danger of extinction because of the medicinal trade in their 
parts.</P>





<P>In response to the potential trade threat to some wild animals and 
plants used in medicines, the 18-office global TRAFFIC Network-working 
with its parent organizations, World Wildlife Fund and the World 
Conservation Union (IUCN), and in conjunction with other conservation and 
intergovernmental agencies-is continuing to document and investigate the 
medicinal trade in imperiled species. These investigations include not 
only the high-profile species, such as rhinos and tigers, but also the 
lesser known but medicinally valuable species such as bears (Ursidae 
spp.), saiga antelope (Saiga spp.), seahorses (Hippocampus spp.), and 
agarwood (Aquilaria malaccensis).
</P>




<P>TRAFFIC USA has recently completed a review of the trade in North 
American deer (Cervidae spp.) antler. This review was initiated after 
research suggested that deer antler appeared to be one of the most, if 
not the most, widely used animal ingredient in traditional Chinese 
medicine, and that the trade in North American deer antler comprises a 
growing portion of the world antler trade. The following article 
summarizes the results of TRAFFIC's analysis of the global commerce of 
cervid antler. </P>





<P>Deer (Cervidae spp.) are among the most popular game species in the 
world; they are exploited for meat, hides, antlers, and other body parts. 
Deer antler, which is traded extensively for medicinal and ornamental 
purposes, is harvested from wild and farmed deer in Russia, the 
People&iquest;  &iquest;s Republic of China (PRC), New Zealand, the 
United States, Canada, and a growing number of other countries. </P>





<P>The importance of the deer antler trade to traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM), the knowledge that North American trade is a significant 
part of the global trade, and the growth in the  commercial deer antler 
industry in North America, prompted TRAFFIC USA to undertake a review of 
the antler trade. The review seeks to gain a better understanding of the 
trade and its conservation implications for North American deer by 
reviewing the scope and dynamics of the domestic and international deer 
antler trade. With a few possible exceptions, TRAFFIC's initial regional 
review concludes that in North America the collection of antler, a 
naturally shed and renewable deer by-product, has not posed a trade 
threat to wild deer populations, but should be periodically monitored to 
ensure that deer populations remain healthy.</P>





<P>Unique to species of the cervid family, antlers are morphological 
appendages composed primarily of minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and 
limited fatty acids that grow from the base of the skull (Sunwoo et al. 
1995). Musk deer (Moschus spp.) and water deer (Hydroptes spp.) are the 
only two deer groups that do not produce antlers. Antler growth is 
controlled by hormones and generally occurs only in male deer. However, 
in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and in rare instances among other species, 
the females also produce antlers. New antlers are called "velvet"  
because of the numerous short, fine hairs adorning the outer layer of 
skin. As maturing antlers calcify, they lose their velvety skin, and 
yield hard, spiked racks, which are used by males in establishing 
dominance during the mating season, or rut. After the rut, which occurs 
during the fall in North America, antlers become obsolete and are shed in 
late winter or spring (Goss 1985).</P>





<P>There are more than 40 living species of deer. Natural populations of 
deer occur throughout North America, South America, Eurasia, and northern 
Africa, while introduced populations have been established in New 
Zealand, among other places (Nowak 1991). The five species of deer native 
to North America are North American elk, or wapiti, (Cervus elaphus 
spp.); moose (Alces alces); caribou; whitetail deer (Odocoileus 
virginianus); and mule deer (O. hemionus). All of these species are 
legally harvested for subsistence and recreation in the United States and 
Canada. </P>





<P>Internationally, the heaviest demand for deer antler is generated by 
Asian medicinal markets. Considered a tonic in TCM, deer antler (also 
known as  "deer horn" in oriental medicine) is consumed to restore the 
body and reduce the symptoms of aging. TCM recognizes the use of deer 
antler in the treatment of impotence, weakness in the lower back and 
knees, and blood abnormalities linked to physical or mental development 
disorders in children (Bensky and Gamble 1986). As a general rule in TCM, 
antler with the least amount of calcification - i.e., velvet antler - is 
the most efficacious. Antler is ingested in several forms, but it is 
usually sliced, boiled in water, and prepared as tea or broth.</P>




<P>South Korea is the largest antler-importing country. As much as 80 
percent of all shed and velvet antler traded globally is consumed in 
South Korea, and between 60 and 90 percent of antler traded 
internationally transits through Hong Kong (Barrie 1996; Isaacs 1996). 
Together, New Zealand, Russia, and the PRC account for about 80 percent 
of velvet antler produced annually. North American exports represent 
about 5 percent of all global velvet antler in trade, while its share of 
hard, or shed, antler trade hovers around 20 percent (Korean Customs 
Service 1996). Increasing domestic trade and high tariffs on antler 
imports in consumer countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, combined 
with a saturated global market, have resulted in a decrease in antler 
trade and prices in recent years.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>North American Antler Trade<FONT></CENTER> 






<P>Deer antler was traditionally used by American Indians for spiritual, 
religious, and medicinal purposes as well as in weaponry and decoration. 
Today, native North American deer antler is utilized by artisans, jewelry 
and furniture makers, taxidermists, tourists, traders, and the Asian 
community. In the United States and Canada, deer antlers are procured in 
the form of wild-collected shed antler, velvet antler harvested from 
farmed deer, and trophies obtained from hunted deer. </P>





<P>Shed deer antlers, used by artisans in jewelry and furniture making, 
are typically collected by  "pickers," who sell them to brokers. A 
significant portion of antler exported from the United States is shed elk 
antler, most of which is collected in the Rocky Mountain states and 
provinces. South Korea is the largest consumer of North American shed 
antler, importing at least 50,000 kg from Canada and the United States 
annually, worth over $2 million.</P>





<P>Over 30,000 kg of dried velvet antler, worth at least $12 million, are 
commercially produced and processed annually on a growing number of deer 
farms in North America (Hudson 1996). It is estimated that 60 percent of 
North American velvet antler is produced by Canadian farms, while the 
remainder is generated in the United States. Most of this farmed velvet 
antler is from elk and is destined for foreign and domestic Asian 
medicinal markets. U.S. and Canadian companies also manufacture antler 
products for the North American health food market.</P>





<P>The main source of trophy antlers in the United States and Canada is 
wild deer harvested by sport hunters on private and public land during 
designated hunting seasons. Most states and provinces control the harvest 
of wild deer by issuing hunting licenses and setting seasonal bag 
limits.</P>





<P>According to computerized trade data compiled by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS), cross-border trade in deer antler between the 
United States and Canada consists primarily of caribou, moose, whitetail 
deer, and mule deer specimens. For instance, in 1994, nearly half of  the 
caribou horn products and over two-thirds of the caribou trophies 
reportedly exported from the United States were destined for Canada. 
Similarly, nearly all U.S. exports of moose horn products and trophies 
were exported to Canada in 1994, while over three-fourths of U.S. imports 
of moose horn products and trophies originated in Canada. A total of 567 
deer trophies with a declared value of $157,000 were traded between the 
United States and Canada in 1994. A large but unquantified number of 
trophies are also traded domestically. 
</P>




<P>According to the same FWS data, the United States and Canada also 
trade with a number of other nations. East Asia, particularly South Korea 
and Hong Kong, is the largest importer of caribou and elk antler exported 
or reexported from the United States. A smattering of European and Asian 
nations, including France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, 
and Singapore, import whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose antler from 
the United States. Most U.S. antler imports, particularly caribou and 
elk, originate or are reexported from Russia, New Zealand, the PRC, and 
to a lesser extent, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, and Germany. Some elk 
antler exported from the United States to Hong Kong and South Korea is 
reexported from these countries to the United States, probably in 
processed form, primarily for sale in Asian medicinal markets. </P>





<P>The North American trade in shed deer antler involves several species, 
most of which are native to North America; however, only a select few, 
including native elk and nonnative red deer (C. elaphus), are farmed for 
the harvest of their velvet antler. The deer farming industry in the 
United States and Canada is still relatively small, producing only a tiny 
portion of velvet antler currently entering international trade. The flow 
of farmed antler into the United States and Canada from New Zealand and 
Russia, combined with the collection of North American shed antler 
accounts for most of the antler in U.S. and Canadian trade. The number of 
deer farms and the volume of antler production in the United States and 
Canada are expected to grow in spite of concerns raised by some wildlife 
officials and biologists over disease transmission from farmed deer to 
wildlife, genetic contamination of native deer through crossbreeding with 
nonnative deer, and humane removal of antler from animals (Geist 
1988).</P>





<P>Globally, several species of deer are protected from international 
trade by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES): 13 taxa are listed in CITES Appendix I and two in Appendix II. 
Of those taxa protected by CITES, none are native to North America. Even 
though three native North American subspecies are listed as endangered 
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and a few Canadian populations of 
caribou are deemed threatened in Canada, deer populations are generally 
healthy in both countries. 
</P>




<P>Most wild populations of native North American deer whose antler is 
exploited for trade are stable or increasing. TRAFFIC USA's forthcoming 
report concludes that it does not appear that the legal take of shed, 
velvet, or trophy antlers is impacting wild deer populations in the 
United States and Canada for the following reasons: (a) antlers are 
produced each season and naturally shed by deer; they are subsequently 
collected with no biological impact on the deer; (b) it is assumed that 
virtually all velvet antler harvested in the United States and Canada is 
taken from farmed deer, i.e., deer are not poached solely for their 
velvet antler; (c) trophies harvested in the United States and Canada are 
generally obtained from well-managed deer populations in accordance with 
state and provincial hunting regulations. </P>



Most cases of poaching for deer antler in the United States and Canada 
involve deer that are taken for primarily noncommercial purposes by 
individuals who violate state or provincial regulations by hunting out of 
season or exceeding game bag limits. Of potentially greater concern, 
however, is the unknown number of violators who intentionally take deer 
illegally for commercial gain. This practice is assumed to be for meat or 
for illegal hunts for trophy-size animals.



<P>Evidence does not currently indicate that illegal deer antler trade in 
North America exists on a widespread or large scale. However, as a 
precautionary measure, state and provincial wildlife agencies should 
monitor patterns of illegal antler harvest and trade, as well as the 
value and volume of the North American trade. 
 </P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Border Shakedown at San Ysidro
</FONT></CENTER> 



<P>Over a two-day period in March 1996, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, U.S. Customs, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
joined forces at the port-of-entry border town of San Ysidro, California, 
to crack down on illegal imports of protected wildlife from Mexico. Eagle 
feathers, sea turtle products,  stuffed birds, ocelot skins, and a 
commercial shipment of snake, lizard, and eel-skin boots were seized. 
Violations cited during the seizures included the Endangered Species Act, 
CITES, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Act, and 
the Lacey Act. San Ysidro is the world's largest land-border port. In 
1995, more than 13 million vehicles and seven million pedestrians entered 
the United States from Mexico at San Ysidro. During the two-day 
crackdown, authorities, assisted by special agents from San Diego and Los 
Angeles law enforcement offices and by staff from the Carlsbad Ecological 
Services Office and Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge, inspected 
112 vehicles and 175 pedestrians. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has 
three wildlife inspectors and two special agents assigned to handle the 
140 miles and five ports of entry along the California-Mexico border.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Nile and Saltwater Crocs Rules Changed
</FONT></CENTER> 



<P>Rebounding from the effects of habitat loss and past commercial 
exploitation, Australia's population of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus 
porosus) is being reclassified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS) from "endangered" to "threatened," a less restrictive designation 
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Successful protective 
management strategies by the Australian government, coupled with CITES 
monitoring, are in large part responsible for the crocodile&iquest;  
&iquest;s recovery over the last two decades. A special rule issued by 
FWS will also allow the importation into the United States of skins from 
certain populations of saltwater and Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus 
niloticus) currently listed as threatened under the ESA, providing 
certain requirements are met. The reclassification and the adoption of 
the special rule allowing commercial trade under certain conditions 
ensures that trade will still be monitored in these species. The affected 
saltwater and Nile crocodile populations remain listed on Appendix II of 
CITES, which requires issuance of export permits by the country of 
origin. Also, U.S. trade in Nile and saltwater crocodilian skins will be 
prohibited from any country that does not comply with the crocodilian 
skin-tagging and tracking requirements adopted at the Ninth Meeting of 
the Conference of the

Parties to CITES in November 1994.</P>

</FONT></CENTER>





<P>On August 22, 1996, a federal grand jury in Orlando, Florida, charged 
six people with a multi-year conspiracy to smuggle into the United States 
and Canada hundreds of rare snakes and tortoises from Madagascar 
including 51 radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata), CITES Appendix I 
and classified as endangered under the ESA; 94 Madagascan tree boas 
(Sanzinia madagascarensis), CITES Appendix I; and 25 spider tortoises 
(Pyxis arachnoides), CITES Appendix II. The indictments stem in part from 
the seizure of 61 Madagascan tree boas and 4 spider tortoises on August 
13, 1996, at Orlando International Airport, and result directly from a 
three-year U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigation. </P>




<P>According to Don Boyer, associate reptile curator at the San Diego 
Zoo, the value of the tree boas is estimated at $700 to $1,200 each, and 
the spider tortoises, which are six inches long and extremely rare in the 
reptile trade, could potentially sell for thousands of dollars each.
</P>




<P>Those charged with conspiracy, smuggling and related violations are 
Frank H. Lehmeyer, Wolfgang Michael Kloe, Olaf Strohmann, and Roland 
Werner of Germany, Enrico Joseph Truant of Canada, and Simon David Harris 
of South Africa. According to a source with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the investigation is continuing and more indictments are 
expected.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Boa Constrictor Conviction
</FONT></CENTER> 




<P>On 30 July 1996, Tim Eaton of Tequesta, Florida, was found guilty by a 
Miami federal jury on one count of conspiring to smuggle more than 100 
Peruvian red tail boa constrictors into Miami International Airport in 
violation of the Endangered Species Act; two counts of smuggling boa 
constrictors; and two counts of receipt, sale, and facilitating the 
transportation of smuggled boas in violation of the smuggling statute 
(see TRAFFIC USA Vol. 15, No. 1, January 1996). Eaton is scheduled to be 
sentenced on 10 October 1996 and faces a maximum penalty of five years in 
jail and up to $250,000 in fines on each of the five counts. </P>





<P>According to evidence presented at the trial, Eaton conspired to 
smuggle approximately 110 red tail boa constrictors (Boa constrictor), 
one rainbow boa constrictor (Epicrates cenchris), and three green 
anacondas (Eunectes murinus) into the United States from Peru between 
February and November 1993. All three reptile species are banned from 
commercial trade by Peru and are listed in Appendix II of CITES, which 
prohibits their import into the United States without a valid CITES 
permit from the exporting country. </P>





<P>The Peruvian red tail boa constrictor originates in the Peruvian 
Amazon rainforest and is a highly desired reptile within the U.S. pet 
trade. Because of its distinctive red coloring and rarity, the Peruvian 
red tail commands a much higher price on the U.S. pet market than the 
common boa constrictor. Based on the 1993 wholesale market price of $200 
to $300 for each healthy Peruvian red tail boa, the wholesale value of 
the smuggled wildlife in this case would be $22,000 to $33,000, and the 
retail value would, of course, be significantly higher. Eaton, the 
president of Peruvian Imports Unlimited, is also an importer and 
distributor of the herbal remedy "Cat's Claw." </P>





<P>Eaton testified at his trial that his company grossed $3.5 million in 
sales in 1995. </P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Bahamian Fish Smuggler Pleads Guilty<FONT></CENTER> 




<P>
On 18 July 1996, Kenneth E. Hawkins of Hollywood, Florida, pleaded guilty 
to charges of illegally importing commercial quantities of 
Bahamian-origin fish into Florida, a violation of the federal Lacey Act, 
which prohibits importing fish taken or possessed in violation of foreign 
law. The case was prosecuted in Fort Lauderdale by Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Thomas A. Watts-Fitzgerald. According to court documents, 
between 1 January 1993 and 23 October 1993, Hawkins imported more than 
$70,000 worth of fish aboard his vessel. He made the illegal entries into 
Hollywood from Bahamian waters and sold the fish to a commercial 
establishment in the Fort Lauderdale area. He operated his boat, the Sea 
Legs IV, as a &iquest;  &iquest;head boat,&iquest;- &iquest; carrying 
sport fisherman to the Bahamas for several days at a time to fish in 
Bahamian waters. A sport fishing permit was issued to the vessel by 
Bahamian authorities; however, the catch was limited to 20 pounds of fish 
per person. According to court records, the vessel made over 70 such 
trips during the 10-month period in 1993 and regularly returned with 
amounts of fish far exceeding the legal limit. In addition, the 
Bahamian-origin fish were not inspected as required by Bahamian 
conservation laws and were not cleared by Bahamian officials for export. 
Hawkins violated Florida law as well by not possessing a Salt Water 
Products License required for commercial transactions.

<P>
The investigation was handled by undercover agents of the National Marine 
Fisheries Service and the Florida Marine Patrol, who made two trips 
aboard Sea Legs IV to observe the fishing activities. The Coast Guard 
assisted the investigation by providing personnel and facilities in Fort 
Lauderdale to intercept and inspect Sea Legs IV upon its return from one 
of the trips. Coast Guard members discovered three times the legal amount 
of demersal fish species on board at that time. 

<P>
Hawkins faces a possible maximum penalty of five years incarceration and 
a fine of $250,000.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Moratorium Lifted - ESA Listings Resume
</FONT></CENTER> 




<P>On 10 May 1996, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) announced 
that a moratorium, imposed by Congress in April 1995 to shut down the FWS 
endangered species listing program, has been lifted and normal funding 
levels restored. The year-long moratorium prevented final listings of 
endangered and threatened animal and plant species and final designations 
of critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). 
</P>




<P>A total of 243 species currently await final decisions for listing 
under the ESA-182 candidate species await proposals for listing, 7 
species have court orders pending to designate critical habitat, and 57 
species are involved in unresolved petitions. To deal with this backlog, 
FWS has established the following priorities:</P>



<ul>
<P>1.	Emergency listings of species in imminent danger of extinction;</P>





<P>2. Processing final decisions on species already proposed for listing, 
with highest 	priority given to species facing high magnitude threats; 
and</P>




<P>3.	All other listing actions, including processing reclassifications 
and delistings, new 	proposed listings, petition findings, and critical 
habitat designations.</P>
</ul>

	

<P>Approximately 100 biologists have been reassigned by FWS to the 
endangered 	species listing program to review proposed listings.

<P>Notice of Information No. 26 (NOI 26) published by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS) in the 10 July 1996 Federal Register removes the 
U.S. import prohibition on CITES-listed species and their products from 
Thailand, which was put into effect by NOI 22 of 15 July 1991. Imports 
from Thailand were prohibited five years ago when FWS determined that 
Thailand had not been satisfactorily implementing CITES and was therefore 
posing a serous risk to many threatened and endangered species. In 
particular, Thailand had become a center of illegal trade in Indochina, 
exporting or re-exporting live cheetahs, tigers, bears, orangutans, 
gibbons, and siamangs. Illegal imports from Thailand into the United 
States were sizeable as well, including ivory jewelry, sea turtle 
products, leopard and tiger parts and products, and a large variety of 
reptile products. In November 1995, FWS received assurances from the 
government of Thailand that CITES would be effectively implemented within 
that country, and has therefore lifted the import prohibition.</P>




<P>Notice of Information No. 26 also removes the prohibition on imports 
of Greek tortoises 
(Testudo graeca) from Turkey identified in NOI 25, published on 23 
January 1996.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Endangered Butterfly Makes a Comeback
</FONT></CENTER> 








<P>In the early part of the 20th century, the wild Schaus swallowtail 
butterfly (Heraclides aristodemus ponceanus) was found in abundance from 
the South Miami area to the Florida Keys. The Schaus swallowtail has a 
wing span of four and one-half inches and can be identified by its unique 
color pattern of brown and yellow, speckled with dots of blue and red. 
Collectors reportedly paid top prices - as much as $400 per specimen - 
for the prized Schaus butterfly. </P>





<P>In the 1970s, the species was nearly wiped out by habitat destruction, 
overcollecting, and the use of pesticides. The range of the insect was 
reduced to a small population limited to the Florida Keys. Because of its 
declining status, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) designated the 
Schaus swallowtail as a threatened species in 1976 and reclassified it in 
1984 as endangered. A recent intensive investigation of the international 
trade in endangered butterfly species revealed that the Schaus 
swallowtail is still extremely popular among collectors despite its 
protected status. </P>





<P>In June 1991, when the use of Baytex, a pesticide used to control 
mosquitoes, was banned and a similar pesticide known as Dibrom was 
regulated, the Schaus population began to rebound. </P>





<P>In June 1992, zoologist Thomas Emmel of Gainesville, Florida, 
initiated a captive breeding program for the Schaus butterfly. He began 
in a small laboratory and kitchen with only 100 Schaus eggs, not knowing 
that his program would be directly responsible for the future breeding 
stock of the entire species. </P>





<P>Hurricane Andrew tore across southern Florida in August 1992, 
devastating the state and destroying almost the entire Schaus butterfly 
population. In 1993, only 73 adult Schaus swallowtails were known to be 
alive in the wild; most of them were found on Elliot Key in Biscayne Bay, 
the rest on other Florida Keys. 
</P>




<P>Emmel's successful captive breeding endeavor yielded thousands of 
Schaus swallowtails and saved the species from certain extinction. It was 
possible in 1995 to begin introducing hundreds of Schaus butterflies back 
into their native southern Florida habitat. According to an FWS 
biologist, the species may be reclassified as threatened or even removed 
from the endangered species list by 1998. </P>

</FONT></CENTER> 






<P>A massive haul of exotic medicines suspected to contain parts and 
products of endangered wildlife took place on 11 June 1996 at 14 stores 
in Calgary, Alberta. The confiscated medicinal products are purported to 
contain such ingredients as tiger bone, elephant hide, rhino horn, saiga 
antelope horn, dried orchids, and bear gallbladder. Constable Dale 
Duchesne of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated that most people 
whose businesses were served with search warrants were very cooperative, 
and many claimed they did not know they were in violation of the law. 
During this first-ever sweep of Calgary businesses, officers distributed 
pamphlets to educate store owners about the laws prohibiting the sale of 
endangered wildlife derivatives. The 80 boxes of seized items will be 
sent to a forensics laboratory and, if charged under the provincial Wildl
ife Act, the Calgary store owners could face fines of up to C$100,000 
(US$73,000) and/or six months in jail. Under the federal Customs Act, 
maximum fines are C$15,000 (US$11,000) and/or up to five years in jail. 
Importers could face additional penalties.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Medical Seizure In Vancouver
</FONT></CENTER>






<P>On 28 June 1996, Canadian Customs inspectors in Vancouver, together 
with Canadian Wildlife Service authorities, seized almost 20,000 items of 
illegally imported Asian medicine products containing or purporting to 
contain parts and derivatives of endangered wildlife. The shipment was 
sent from Hong Kong and is believed to have been destined for Canada's 
growing ethnic Chinese communities in Vancouver and Toronto. </P>





<P>Reportedly, more than 211,000 illicit items, whose ingredients 
contained or were purported to contain endangered species derivatives, 
were seized at Canada's west coast port in 1995, compared to only 1,200 
items seized in 1987.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Hong Kong Medicine Traders Under Scrutiny
</FONT></CENTER> 






<P>On 23 April 1996, medicine traders in Hong Kong were advised by the 
Hong Kong Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) that the sale of 
medicines containing or purporting to contain tiger or rhino ingredients 
without a license is now subject to stiff penalties. Under the Animals 
and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance, any person found 
guilty of importing, exporting, or  possession of a highly endangered 
wildlife species for commercial purposes without a license may receive a 
maximum penalty of HK$5 million in fines (the equivalent of US$650,500) 
and two years in prison. Recently, two traders were convicted and fined 
HK$250,000 (US$32,500) and HK $150,000 (US$19,500) for possessing 
medicines claiming to contain tiger or rhino ingredients. </P>





<P>Cheung Chi-sun, a conservation officer of the AFD in Hong Kong, 
believes that the heavier fines will serve as an effective deterrent for 
similar offenses, and he called on members of the public to refrain from 
buying medicines containing or claiming to contain tiger or rhino 
ingredients. Cheung also announced the production by AFD's Information 
Services Department of an updated information leaflet entitled "Protect 
Endangered Species," which can be obtained by contacting AFD's Fauna 
Conservation Unit, Canton Road Government Offices, 393 Canton Road, 6th 
Fl., Kowloon, Hong Kong.

</FONT></CENTER> 



<P>In accordance with Korea's amended Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, the 
sale, storage, or display of medicines made from tiger bone and its 
derivatives is strictly prohibited. On 11 June 1996, the Korean 
government destroyed more than 793 kilograms (1,745 pounds) of tiger bone 
and over 10 million capsules containing tiger medicine seized from IKSU 
Pharmacy, a medicinal trading company. The bone was broken into pieces 
and incinerated at a high temperature. Small amounts of tiger bone and 
powdered tiger bone were sent to the Korea Food and Drug Administration 
for research purposes.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Major Ivory Bust In Taiwan
</FONT></CENTER>




<P>Acting on information received from a caller reporting a suspected 
elephant ivory smuggling operation, Taiwanese law enforcement authorities 
on 25 April 1996 arrested two men - Huang Chung-hsien and Huang Hung-lung 
- at a warehouse in suburban Taipei. After initially denying their 
involvement in the illegal sale of ivory, the two men led police to a 
second location that served as a processing factory for smuggled ivory. 
Police seized 1,200 kilograms of ivory products, including 51 whole 
elephant tusks weighing 270 kgs, various carved and semi-finished ivory 
pieces, and four Buddhist statues. Huang Chung-hsien and Huang Hung-lung 
told police they purchased the tusks from a man identified as Lin 
Sheng-li for $110-$147 per kilogram. Sheng-li is currently wanted by 
authorities on charges of swindling. The confiscated ivory tusks and 
products are valued at approximately $3.7 million and constitute one of 
the largest ivory seizures in Taiwan's history. The maximum penalty for 
engaging in illegal trade of protected species in Taiwan is five years in 
jail and a fine equivalent to US$55,350. </P>

</FONT></CENTER>







<P>Chinese police have arrested four people in a hotel in Shenzhen on the 
border of Hong Kong who were attempting to sell a giant panda pelt to a 
Hong Kong businessman. The four reportedly bought the 3.3-foot-long pelt 
for $7,229 and intended to sell it for $30,120. The pelt was brown and 
gray in color, which, according to experts, is extremely rare for a 
panda. The date of the arrests and names of the persons charged in 
connection with the crime are not yet available.
</P>




<P>Another case of panda poaching occurred in Huizhou City in south 
China's Guangdong province, where five people were arrested by undercover 
police for attempting to sell two panda pelts for approximately $58,000. 
Four of the accused admitted to purchasing the panda pelts from Xi Hu, a 
local resident of Huizhou City. Hu claimed that he purchased the pelts in 
1994 for about $800 from a man in southwestern Sichuan province, where 
pandas still live in the wild.</P>





<P>The giant panda tops China's list of protected species with only an 
estimated 1,000 remaining in the wild. Punishment for poaching of the 
species is very severe. In June 1995, a Chinese farmer found guilty of 
killing a giant panda in 1993 was sentenced to life imprisonment</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Turkish Village Produces Bulbs For Trade
</FONT></CENTER>



<P>For the first time, Turkey has successfully exported two threatened 
species of artificially propagated flower bulbs grown by the same village 
that had previously been paid to dig millions of bulbs from the wild. The 
remote village of Dumlugoze in the Toros Mountains of 
southern Turkey produced more than 50,000 artificially propagated 
snowdrops (Galanthus elwesii) and winter aconites (Eranthis hyemalis) 
from local gardens for export in May 1996. 
</P>




<P>Turkey's rich flora combined with its close proximity to western 
European markets has attracted plant collectors and traders for 
centuries. Of particular interest to traders are Turkey's many species of 
geophyte flora, or flower bulbs, whose wild populations have been heavily 
exploited to supply western bulb markets in recent decades. Historically, 
the Netherlands has been the center of the bulb trade, importing the 
greatest volume and variety of wild bulbs from Turkey and subsequently 
sorting, packing, and reexporting them to the United Kingdom, the United 
States, Canada, and Japan.
</P>




<P>The Dumlugoze initiative is being carried out under the "Indigenous 
Propagation of Threatened Turkish Bulbs Project" or IPP, a joint project 
of the Society for the Protection of Nature (DHKD), Fauna Flora 
International (FFI), and WWF. Since 1993, WWF, DHKD, and FFI have 
assisted Dumlugoze villagers with growing their own bulbs, a portion of 
which were harvested and exported to two bulb dealers in the United 
Kingdom in May. The aim of the IPP is to reduce the pressure of 
collection on wild populations of threatened bulb species in Turkey by 
encouraging families in local communities to cultivate bulbs in their 
gardens for export. In addition, the IPP provides Turkish villagers with 
supplemental income through the propagation of previously wild-collected 
bulbs.  </P>




<P>Stricter controls on Turkish exports of bulbs, coupled with the 
progress of IPP, have led to a reduction in the number of exports of wild 
bulbs from an estimated 70 million in 1989 to 23 million in 1996. </P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Dutch Taxidermist Jailed
</FONT></CENTER> 



<P>On 9 May 1996, a court in Chester, England, sentenced Nicholaas 
Peters, a Dutch wildlife dealer, to two years in jail for smuggling the 
skulls and skins of some of the world&iquest;  &iquest;s most endangered 
species. This is the most severe penalty ever imposed in the United 
Kingdom for wildlife offenses. 
</P>




<P>In August 1995, a joint undercover investigation into illegal trade in 
wild animals across the Far East and Europe, undertaken by the Royal 
Society for the Protection of Birds and TRAFFIC International, led to a 
raid of Peters&iquest;  &iquest; remote home in Wales. Customs officials 
and wildlife investigators confiscated more than 500 specimens, including 
the skull of a CITES Appendix I Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) 
and a Philippine monkey-eating eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), from deep 
freezes, an attic, and two barns on Peters&iquest;  &iquest; property. 
This seizure of endangered wildlife specimens was the largest ever in the 
United Kingdom. </P>





<P>The Philippine monkey-eating eagle is one of the world's most 
endangered birds. Forest destruction, hunting, and trapping reduced its 
population to an estimated 200 birds in the 1980s, and today only an 
estimated 50 pairs of the eagles remain in the world.
</P>


<P>Other confiscated species included a babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), 
an endangered wild pig listed in CITES Appendix I and found only on the 
Indonesian island of Sulawesi; monkeys; macaques; marmosets; a bushbaby; 
a ring-tailed lemur; a Humboldt penguin; lesser flamingos; and 15 species 
of Philippine birds, including the Appendix I Palawan peacock pheasant 
(Polyplectron emphanum) and the Appendix II blue-naped parrot (Tanygnatus 
lucionensis), Peters, who admitted to illegally exporting and importing 
CITES-listed specimens for sale to black market collectors, pleaded 
guilty to eight of ten charges brought against him. Reportedly, Peters 
had business interests in the Netherlands and Belgium and has been fined 
for similar wildlife offenses in Australia, Germany, and France over the 
last ten years. </P>



<P>Also implicated in the smuggling operation are the following 
associates of Nicholaas Peters:  Peter Cua of Manila, the Philippines; 
Paul Micallef, trading wildlife in Texas under the title of "The American 
Headhunter"; and Jay Villemarette, trading from Oklahoma as   "Skulls 
Unlimited." </P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Italy Agrees to End Illegal Driftnet Fishing 
</FONT></CENTER> 



<P>Consultations over the past several months between the U.S. government 
and the government of Italy have resulted in an agreement, reached on 26 
July 1996, which outlines measures to end illegal driftnet fishing by 
Italian nationals and vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. In reaching such 
an agreement, the  nations have avoided imposition by the Clinton 
administration of a trade embargo on imports of Italian fish, fish 
products, and sport fishing equipment into the United States as 
authorized under the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 
1992. The agreement upholds a United Nations moratorium on the high seas 
use of driftnets longer than 2.5 kilometers, which was adopted to prevent 
the indiscriminate killing of sea life, such as dolphins and sperm 
whales, in driftnets around the world. Italy was identified as a 
"large-scale high seas driftnet nation" by the U.S. secretary of commerce 
on 28 March 1996. 
</P>




<P>According to the U.S. Department of State, to end illegal driftnet 
fishing the government of Italy has agreed to:</P>


<ul>

<P>1)	significantly step up enforcement efforts, both at sea and in 
port;</P>




<P>2)	begin using expanded authority, flowing from a recent Italian court 
decision, to 	seize illegal driftnets;</P>




<P>3)	issue a decree, effective immediately, prohibiting all Italian 
driftnet vessels based 	outside of Sardinia from using Sardinian ports, 
thereby sharply curtailing driftnet 	fishing in the Western 
Mediterranean;</P>




<P>4)	submit two laws for parliamentary approval:  one to significantly 
increase penalties 	for illegal driftnet fishing; the second to allow 
Italy to ratify the International 	Convention for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Pending ratification, 	the government of Italy 
will apply ICCAT conservation measures provisionally by 	operation of 
European Union law and Italian regulations.
</P></ul>




<P>The Italian government has also presented a long-term "conversion" 
plan for ending illegal driftnet fishing entirely, which is expected to 
be approved by the European Union. Under the plan, Italian driftnet 
vessels will either be destroyed or converted for other fishing methods. 
The plan would take three years to implement fully and would require a 
commitment of at least $130 million, to be shared by the European Union 
and the government of Italy. 
</P>




<P>Furthermore, the government of Italy has officially proclaimed its 
"full adherence" to the United Nations driftnet moratorium and agreed to 
report to the United Nations on its compliance with the moratorium. It 
has also promised to provide annual data to the European Union and the 
United States on its driftnet enforcement efforts. Finally, the Italian 
government has stated its intention to press for a complete ban on all 
driftnet fishing in the Mediterranean.
</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Rare Tortoise Species Threatened By Thieves
</FONT></CENTER>




<P>On the night of 6 May 1996, in Ampijoroa, Madagascar, two holes were 
cut in a chain-link fence surrounding a captive breeding facility for 
plowshare tortoises (Geochelone yniphora), and 2 adult females and 73 
hatchlings were stolen. The captive breeding farm in Ampijoroa is run by 
Don Reid, an Englishman who has spent the last 10 years propagating the 
species; the theft constituted half of the entire stock. The plowshare 
tortoise, listed in Appendix I of CITES, is one of the world's rarest and 
most valuable tortoises:  only 400 to 1,000 exist. Highly prized by 
collectors, especially in the United States, Spain, Germany, and Japan, 
plowshares sell for several thousand dollars each. The plowshare tortoise 
is found in only two zoological institutions worldwide - the Honolulu Zoo 
and the Wildlife Conservation Society's St. Catherine's Wildlife Survival 
Center in Georgia. 
</P>




<P>An international manhunt is now on as reports of "plowshares for sale" 
come in; however, no arrests have been made so far in connection with the 
carefully planned theft. It is believed that the tortoises were for sale 
even before they were stolen. Experts suspect that the surviving 
hatchlings have been split up and are being sold everywhere from Canada 
to Holland to Tokyo. </P>





<P>Because the plowshare tortoise takes 15-20 years to reach sexual 
maturity, captive breeding of the species is a difficult and slow 
business, which, so far, has been successful only in Ampijoroa. The small 
homeland of the species near the Bay of Baly in Madagascar is also in 
jeopardy. Bush fires set by local peasants to sprout new grass for zebu 
cattle herds destroy the plowshare's habitat, and it has been reported 
that feral pigs eat plowshare eggs and fragile young tortoises. </P>





<P>Plowshare hatchlings range in size from ping-pong balls to softballs 
and are the color of bamboo with hexagons burned into them. It is not 
until the tortoises are about five years old that they develop the 
distinctive "plowshare" prow on their underside. This strange 
protuberance of the shell under the head is the male animal's fighting 
gear. It is used to flip a foe on his back to gain victory in the 
apparently essential duels between male plowshares that take place before 
they become aroused enough to mate with a female. </P>





<P>Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, is the native 
habitat of many of the world's rare reptiles, including 144 species of 
frogs, two-thirds of the world's chameleons, and many tortoises and 
geckos. Eighty percent of its species occur nowhere else. All Malagasy 
tortoises are endangered and protected; the plowshare has been protected 
by a government decree since 1931.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Norway - Japan Whale Smuggling Attepmt Foiled
</FONT></CENTER>




 



<P>A Norwegian smuggling ring conspiracy to export and sell to Japanese 
buyers more than 60 tons of illegally taken whale meat from Norway has 
been uncovered by Japanese customs officials. On 6 April 1996, the 
group's first shipment of six metric tons of Norwegian whale meat and 
blubber was intercepted and confiscated by customs authorities in 
Yokohama, Japan. The container of whale meat, falsely labeled "frozen 
mackerel," was sent via freighter on 6 January 1996 from Oslo, Norway, to 
Haiphong, Vietnam. On 20 March, the container was shipped from Vietnam to 
Taiwan, where it was transferred to yet another freighter for its final 
trip to Tokyo. The smugglers reportedly used bribes, false freight 
papers, and false declaration documents to transport the illegal 
shipment. Transport was organized through Vortex Shipping & Trading in 
Toensberg, Norway. A Norwegian shipbroker, Lars Andersen, was hired by 
Vortex to get the shipment from Vietnam to its final destination in 
Japan. When told by Japanese authorities that the shipment had been 
intercepted and confiscated, Terje Torgersen, agent for the shipment and 
chairman of the board of Vortex Shipping & Trading, stated that he was 
unaware of the container's illegal contents. Andersen admitted only to 
knowing that the container was shipped under false documentation. </P>





<P>World Food is the firm that exported the whale meat (undercover as 
mackerel) to Japan. World Food is an unregistered company operating from 
a house in Aalesund, Norway, and run by Tor Sindre Refsnes. When Japanese 
customs confiscated the whale meat shipment, Refsnes was sent to Japan as 
a representative of the freight firm to try to obtain the release of the 
whale meat and blubber. </P>





<P>Whale meat, known to the Japanese as "red ruby," sells for as much as 
$464 per kilogram, and whale blubber is regarded as an exclusive and 
expensive delicacy in Japan. Had the smuggling operation been successful, 
the Norwegians could have realized a profit of up to $19-24 million.
</P>




<P>The case is currently under investigation by the Japanese Department 
for Agriculture. Imports of whale products into Japan have been 
prohibited since 1992; however, potential Japanese buyers have reported 
that some Norwegian firms claim to be able to obtain and deliver as much 
as 200 metric tons of illicit whale products upon demand. Four hundred 
metric tons of whale meat and blubber have reportedly been stored in 
Norway since export of whale products was banned in 1986. </P>





<P>Norway's whaling activities continue in defiance of the international 
moratorium on whaling adopted by the International Whaling Commission in 
1986. Norway raised its commercial whaling quota to 425 minke whales for 
the 1996 season, which began 1 May 1996, based on new calculations by 
Norwegian scientists of the size of the North Atlantic minke whale 
population. The quota, up from 232 last season, is based on an estimated 
North Atlantic minke whale population of 110,000 to 120,000 animals. 
Norway originally set a quota of 301 animals for the 1995 season; 
however, after the government admitted overestimating the minke whale 
population at 87,000 animals and reduced the estimate to 76,000, the 
quota was lowered to 232. The total number of whales killed in Norwegian 
waters in 1995 was reportedly 217.
</P>




<P>A number of conservation organizations, including World Wildlife Fund, 
have asked President Clinton to invoke the Pelly Amendment, which 
authorizes trade sanctions against Norway unless its whaling activities 
cease. </P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>IWC Calls For Crackdown On Illegal Whale Trade
</FONT></CENTER> 







<P>The recent whale smuggling incident (see p.12) refueled criticism by 
environmental groups of Norway's whaling practices and generated heated 
discussion at the 48th annual meeting of the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) in Aberdeen, Scotland, in June 1996. The IWC faces a 
growing crisis over the continued whaling activities of Norway and Japan 
in defiance of the international whaling moratorium passed by the IWC in 
1986. The Norwegian IWC delegation walked out of the meeting to avoid 
listening to discussion of a resolution calling on that country to halt 
its whaling immediately. There was agreement at the IWC meeting that the 
surveys used to make population estimates for future whaling quotas 
should undergo broader international scrutiny. </P>





<P>The IWC adopted a resolution calling on countries to be more vigilant 
in their efforts to detect and stop illegal whale meat trade and to 
report on the status of existing whale meat stockpiles and national laws 
governing the possession and sale of whale meat. This resolution was 
prompted in part by the apparent large-scale stockpiling of whale meat in 
Norway, as whalers mount efforts to open international trade in whale 
meat products.</P>




<P>Norwegian news reported in June 1996 that only 56 of 202 whales caught 
this year had been sold. Meat from last year's hunt, equivalent to at 
least 30 whales, was still in cold storage when the 1996 hunt began. 
According to Norway's Fish Sales Association, the purchase of whale meat 
is subsidized in order to keep the hunt alive. The association has 
announced a one million kroner marketing drive (equal to approximately 
US$158,000) to increase domestic acceptance of whale meat. Norway's 
whalers are reportedly demanding to be allowed to export whale meat to 
the lucrative Japanese market and insisting on further increases in their 
quota, to as many as 1,800 whales a year. 
</P>




<P>Japan has once again been called on by the IWC to halt its scientific 
whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, where in the last 
Antarctic season, 440 minke whales were killed. Although Japan's request, 
made for the ninth year, for an "interim quota" of 50 minke whales from 
the Northern Pacific minke whale population was defeated by a stronger 
vote than in previous years, the issue was kept alive by an agreement to 
hold a workshop before the next IWC meeting in 1997.</P>

</FONT></CENTER> 






<P>In accordance with Resolution Conf. 9.12 on illegal trade in whale 
meat, the government of Japan has submitted three documents to the CITES 
Secretariat. The following documents were also presented to the 47th 
meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Dublin, Ireland, 
in May 1995:</P>




<UL>
<P>(a) Japan's records of known attempts to smuggle whale meat from 1987 
to 1993;
</P>




<P>(b) minutes of the April 1995 meeting of the Fisheries Agency of Japan 
relating to the control of trade in whale products; and
</P>





<P>(c) results of research by the Fishery Agency of Japan on 
mitochondrial D-loop DNA sequencing of whale products sold in retail 
markets.</P></Ul>





<P>The government of Japan has asked the CITES Secretariat to distribute 
copies of these documents to all parties. All parties are encouraged to 
provide the Secretariat with any available information regarding illegal 
trade in whale meat. </P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Update On Whale Meat Trade In East Asia
</FONT></CENTER>








<P>Widespread trade in whale meat continues in East Asia, with South 
Korea's domestic trade now so overt that restaurants feel free to 
advertise whale meat on their exterior signs. In a survey undertaken in 
March 1996, TRAFFIC East Asia found nearly a dozen whale meat restaurants 
in the southern port city of Ulsan, and vendors continue to sell whale 
meat in the port city of Pusan. Sale prices in Pusan ranged from $25 to 
$64 per kilogram in 1996 compared to $130 per kilogram in 1995 for "high 
quality whale meat."  TRAFFIC East Asia interviewed a retired Ulsan 
whaler who claimed that Russian vessels smuggle whale meat caught in 
eastern European waters, along with traditional medicine products such as 
seal penis, into Korea. He said dolphin meat found in Ulsan is mostly 
from by-catch. In June 1996, the Korean National Fisheries Administration 
(NFA) reported that whale meat has also been spotted in Namdaemun Market 
in Seoul, though the main consumers are said to be Japanese. When asked 
by TRAFFIC about the open domestic sales, staff at the NFA's 
International Cooperation Department said that South Korea does not allow 
whaling by its fishing fleet and no International Whaling Commission 
regulations have been violated. NFA officials confirmed that there are no 
whale meat stockpiles in South Korea and insisted that the whale meat 
sold on the domestic market is from by-catch or beached whales only. 
Local consumption of cetacean meat from these sources is allowed in 
Korea. Although at least seven cases of whale by-catch were documented by 
the NFA in 1995, the agency has refused to release details of these 
incidents.</P>

</FONT></CENTER>





<P>The CITES Management Authority of Argentina has informed the 
Secretariat that 20 security stamps bearing serial numbers AR 9131081 to 
AR 9131100 have disappeared. To prevent possible fraud, parties are asked 
to check the serial numbers of security stamps affixed to Argentine CITES 
permits and to immediately confiscate any shipment covered by a CITES 
document carrying one of the missing security stamps.</P>





<P>The CITES Secretariat has updated its list of parties using CITES  
security stamps and, if known, the date from which such use started. The 
list contains new information about Ethiopia and Paraguay and replaces 
Notification to the Parties No. 902 of 28 February 1996. 
Security stamps are affixed to export or reexport permits and should be 
validated with the signature of the issuing officer and the seal of the 
competent authority placed across the face of the stamp and the document. 
When stamps disappear, are abused, or are suspected of being used 
illegally, the CITES Secretariat should be informed immediately. The 
Secretariat urges parties to order security stamps one year in advance. 
</P>




<P>The list of parties using CITES security stamps and the dates such use 
started can be obtained by writing to the CITES Secretariat or TRAFFIC 
USA. A complete list was published in TRAFFIC USA, Vol. 14, No. 2, August 
1995.</P>

terrestrial fauna has been prohibited since 15 February 1994. Only 
specimens bred in captivity by breeders authorized and registered by the 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the CITES 
Management Authority for terrestrial wildlife, may be exported. 
Coral exports, except finished products from black coral (Antipatharia 
spp.), have been banned under Presidential Decrees Nos. 1219 and 1698 
since 1977. The ban has been suspended during certain periods, the last 
one in 1992, to allow for the export of stockpiled specimens; however, 
these suspensions were used to export illegally acquired specimens and 
raised serious concerns within CITES. </P>




<p>
Export of all molluscs listed in the CITES appendices (e.g., Tridacnidae 
spp.) is prohibited by Fisheries Administrative Order No. 168, series of 
1990. However, under Fisheries Administrative Order No. 168-1, the export 
of specimens of the giant clam species Tridacna crocea had been permitted 
since September 1991. On 25 March 1996, the Bureau of Fisheries and 
Aquatic Resources, which serves as the Management Authority of the 
Philippines for marine species, informed the CITES Secretariat that 
Fisheries Administrative Order No. 168-1 is suspended indefinitely. 
Therefore, effective 4 April 1996, all exports of specimens of giant 
clams from the Philippines are prohibited.  
 </P>




<P>All parties are urged to assist the Philippines in the implementation 
of these bans and to inform the Secretariat of any attempt to import such 
specimens into their territories.</P>
