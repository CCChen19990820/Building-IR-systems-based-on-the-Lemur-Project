<b>UPDATED JULY 25TH</b> (Reuter) - More than one million Bosnian refugees abroad will have an extra week to register to vote in the former Yugoslav republic's first postwar election, international organisers said on Thursday. In a statement by its Bosnia office, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said it had extended the deadline for registration by refugees from July 31 to August 5.
<p>
The elections are scheduled for September 14. Around 1.4 million refugees from 43 months of nationalist fighting in Bosnia are dispersed through more than 35 countries, said the OSCE statement issued in Sarajevo.
<p>
"The Provisional Election Committee has decided on the extension because refugees in a number of countries were not fully aware of the procedure involved in registering for upcoming elections," it said.
<p>
Bosnian state television said the foreign ministry had asked the OSCE for an extension after finding that only seven percent of eligible refugee voters had signed up as of July 22. Most refugees are believed to be Moslems evicted from areas of Bosnia seized by separatist Bosnian Serb or Croat forces in the war and retained by them despite a 1995 peace treaty that mandates a reunification of Bosnia.
<p>
"The OSCE mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina is asking Internet users around the world who may know refugees from (Bosnia) in their community to contact them and assist them in registering or applying for an absentee ballot," an OSCE spokesman said. "Refugees may submit an electronic request to obtain an official application for an absentee ballot."
<p>
It said details about eligibility and an e-mail request for an application form could found on the Internet at this OSCE Homepage address: http:/www-osce.austria.eu.net.
<p>
The OSCE is anxious to maximise turnout for the elections to heighten their legitimacy among estranged Moslem, Croat and Serb ethnic factions who are supposed to set up joint governing institutions after the vote.

‘We face the political process leading to elections and therefore the establishment of common political institutions.’</b><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>
—NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana

TUZLA, Bosnia, July 25 (Reuter) - NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said on Thursday post-war elections in Bosnia will pose a difficult test for the alliance-led mission enforcing the Dayton peace treaty.
<p>
"Without a doubt the phase now is the most difficult," Solana told reporters at Tuzla air base in northeast Bosnia. "We face the political process leading to elections and therefore the establishment of common political institutions." Solana and U.S. General George Joulwan, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, met American soldiers at the U.S. 1st Division headquarters less than two months before Bosnia holds elections meant to help reunify the country. 
<p>
<img src="election_sm_sm_r.gif" width=100 height=122 vspace=0 hspace=0 alt="Bosnia's Election" align=right border=0>Many may register to vote in person or as absentees in their pre-war towns but face obstacles from post-war power brokers there bent on preserving the results of "ethnic cleansing." "We're not talking "free and fair' elections. We're talking "reasonably democratic' elections. They won't be perfect," said Johanna van Vliet of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is organising the vote.
<p>
Solana warned that the international community had to guard against attempts by Bosnia's factions to obstruct or defy election results, citing a Croat boycott of the newly-elected city council in Mostar. "We have to fight against the situation like we have now in Mostar. Political parties must abide by the results of elections," Solana said. The Bosnian Croats have refused to accept the results of local elections in Mostar held last month, triggering a political impasse in the divided southern town.
<p>
Solana said the NATO-led peace implementation force (IFOR) in Bosnia would work closely with civilian agencies overseeing the country-wide vote scheduled for September 14.
<p>
Joulwan said the 60,000-strong IFOR contingent had enforced the military phase of its mission successfully, separating rival armies and overseeing the storage of big guns and tanks. "There have been the military tasks -- separate troops, transfer land, take heavy weapons back to cantonment areas and demobilise troops. That has gone fairly well," said the U.S. general. "The next phase is called transition to peace, where we maintain the military tasks but underpin and support where we can, within our capabilities, the civilian (aspect)."
<p>
The civilian side of the peace accord, which depends on the good will of Bosnia's rival leaders, presents IFOR with a complicated job, he said "It's not only extremely tricky but critical for (Dayton's) success," Joulwan said. Solana and Joulwan spoke after holding talks with U.S. Major General William Nash, commander of U.S. troops in the IFOR mission, and other officers and civilian officials.
<p>
NATO was dedicated to preserving Bosnia as a single state comprised of Serb and Moslem-Croat entities as set out by the peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio, Solana said. "Dayton means one country, two entities. We are going to continue to be committed to that. "From now until the end (of the one-year mandate) we will concentrate on the electoral process and work towards all that was agreed in Dayton," said Solana.

<p>
<b>By Davor Huic</b>
<p>
<font size=2>
ZAGREB, July 24 (Reuter) - Rebel Moslem leader Fikret Abdic, branded by the Sarajevo government as a traitor and based in neighbouring Croatia, said on Wednesday that he would run in Bosnia's post-war elections in September.
<p>
Portraying himself as the only candidate capable of restoring the country's war-ravaged economy, the businessman-turned-politician said he hoped international monitors supervising elections would ensure his campaign message reached voters.
<p>
<img src="election_sm_sm_r.gif" width=100 height=122 vspace=0 hspace=0 alt="Bosnia's Election" align=right border=0>"Even without their help, it won't be difficult to win the elections in the Una-Sana canton (of western Bosnia)," he told a press conference in a posh Zagreb hotel. The Bosnian state media label Abdic a "war criminal and arch-traitor" for leading the Bihac region's rebellion against the Sarajevo government during the Bosnia conflict.
<p>
He turned against Sarajevo and cooperated with separatist Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia to overwhelm the Bosnian army Fifth Corps in the Moslem enclave of Bihac in the northwest. The government Fifth Corps later defeated the rebellion and Abdic sought refuge in Croatia, leaving behind loyal but destitute refugees.
<p>
Abdic's wheeling and dealing with Serb and Croat forces made him a political enemy of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, who opposed attempts to partition the country. Abdic said his followers, working illegally in the area now under complete government control, had managed to collect 17,500 signatures for his candidacy -- well over the required 10,000. 
<p>
His Democratic People's Union (DNZ), recently registered in the Croat-held town of Mostar in the southwest, will run at both parliamentary and local levels, Abdic said. Their applications have yet to be confirmed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), charged with supervising the poll. An OSCE official, who asked not to be named, did not want to comment on any particular application, including Abdic's.
<p>
If his registration is confirmed Abdic would be in a unique position of running for public office in a country which he cannot enter without risk of arrest as the leader of an anti-government rebellion. Abdic accused the Sarajevo government of harassing his supporters. "We are the only serious opposition party in Bosnia, and that is why they (Bosnian government) are obstructing us so much."
<p>
Abdic said he was planning to run the election campaign from Croatia and Croat-held Bosnia. To that purpose he would set up his mouthpiece, Radio Velkaton, in exile. After the Croatian army broke the Serb siege of the Bihac pocket last August, Abdic was ousted from his stronghold of Velika Kladusa and fled to Croatia with 30,000 of his most devoted followers who call him "Babo," Daddy. He now lives in the Croatian port of Rijeka, where he has moved the offices of his food processing conglomerate Agrokomerc from Velika Kladusa. Many of his people have since returned to the Bihac pocket, and Abdic hopes their votes could help him return to power.
<p>
The short, pot-bellied tycoon has a long history of triumphs followed by disastrous defeats from which he somehow manages to recover to fight another day. In 1987 former Yugoslavia's communist authorities jailed him, charging him with issuing millions of U.S. dollars in unbacked promissory notes.
<p>
Four years later he won more votes in Bosnia's first democratic elections than Izetbegovic. A secret deal worked out inside Izetbegovic's party prevented Abdic from extending his rule from the tiny Bihac pocket to the whole of Bosnia. Earlier this year Croatian police arrested a group of five Bosnian citizens on suspicion of plotting to assassinate Abdic near Rijeka. Five were convicted.

THE HAGUE, July 24 (Reuter) - A Moslem survivor of the Omarska prison camp told a U.N. war crimes trial on Wednesday
that Bosnian Serb soldiers forced a prisoner to bite off a fellow inmate's genitals. Halid Mujkanovic, 31, giving evidence in the case of Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, told the court that he saw the accused among a group of around 10 soldiers present during the brutal assault.
<p>
Speaking from behind a screen in the Hague courtroom to conceal his face, Mujkanovic said the soldiers acted "as if
they were at a sports match." "I saw (prisoner) 'H' holding (another inmate) by the hands. 'G' had to bow down in his (unnamed inmate's) crotch and was ordered he must bite the genital," Mujkanovic said in a slow, deliberate voice. "The second time I looked, 'G' got up with his mouth full, he was all bloody." The indentities of the victims were withheld.
<p>
Tadic showed no emotion as Mujkanovic, who had known the accused since childhood, said he saw him, dressed in camouflage uniform, among the group which ordered the assault. "I saw him with my own eyes...I know him well," he stated adamantly when defence lawyer Stephen Kay suggested he had wrongly identified Tadic.
<p>
Questioned closely by presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, Mujkanovic said Tadic was facing him during the
mutilation but he did not see Tadic actively take part in it. Nor did he see him order others to commit the act, he said.

Mujkanovic, who told the court that he was beaten regularly during his detention at the camp in the Prijedor region of northwest Bosnia, said the soldiers cheered during the assault.  "They looked as if they were at a sports match -- as if they were supporting a team," he said calmly. He told the court that Serb soldiers fired their weapons in the air and played the song "Let Me Live" as one inmate was beaten with a metal bar.
<p>
Mujkanovic was the latest in a string of witnesses to place Tadic at the Serb-run camp in the summer of 1992 and to testify to the horrific conditions there. Tadic, 40, maintains he never went to the camp and is a
victim of mistaken identity. In jail since his arrest in Germany 29 months ago, he denies charges of killing and torturing non-Serbs in the Prijedor region.
<p>
The trial, in its tenth week, has heard 42 prosecution witnesses build a picture of a widespread and systematic Serb
campaign to "ethnically cleanse" areas of Bosnia of non-Serbs. Witness 'H' later took the stand in a closed session.

—Cross-examinaton of defence attorney Steven Kay 
<p>

THE HAGUE, July 26 (Reuter) - Defence lawyers suggested on Friday that prosecution witnesses had invented evidence about their client's involvement in Bosnian war crimes out of a desire for revenge.
<p>
British barrister Steven Kay, cross-examining a Moslem survivor of the Serb-run Omarska prison camp, accused him of fabricating evidence against the defendant, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic. "Isn't it the case here that after all that has happened to you, you're prepared to make up things to incriminate Dusko Tadic because you want some sort of revenge against him or the Serbian people?" he asked former camp inmate Armin Mujcic.
<p>
U.N. prosecutors have accused Tadic, 40, of murdering, torturing and raping Moslems during a Serb campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in northwest Bosnia in 1992. The former bar-owner, karate teacher and father of two girls
denies the charges and says he was never in the Omarska camp. His trial at the U.N. tribunal for former Yugoslavia began on May 7 and is expected to run for several more months.
<p>
Kay cast doubt on Mujic's ability to recognise Tadic at Omarska from a brief glimpse just before a notorious incident in which the prosecution alleges that Tadic and other Serbs forced a Moslem prisoner to bite off another inmate's testicles. But Mujic was adamant that he had correctly identified Tadic, who came from the same town of Kozarac.
<p>
Mujic said he had seen Tadic fleetingly among a group known as "the coloured ones" because of their camouflage uniforms who occasionally came to the camp to torture and kill prisoners. Previous witnesses have said that even the guards at Omarska feared this group to which Tadic allegedly belonged.
<p>
In his interrogation of some 50 witnesses to date, Kay has repeatedly suggested that Omarska inmates have persuaded each other that Tadic was at Omarska and committed atrocities there. Dutch defence lawyer Michail Wladimiroff told the tribunal in May that the camp inmates had thus developed a composite account of events in which Tadic was cast as the villain. "Rumour becomes truth. People convince themselves with ease that they have seen and heard things which they did not, and could not, have seen and heard," he said.
<p>
Many witnesses to date have said they saw Tadic only briefly and only a handful claim to have seen him committing crimes. Many of them appear to have trouble recalling details of traumatic events which occurred four years ago and the defence has pounced on apparent inconsistencies in their evidence.
<p>
Tadic is one of seven indicted war crimes suspects held at the tribunal's detention centre. So far the tribunal has indicted 75 suspects -- 54 Serbs, 18 Croats and three Moslems. Most of them remain at large including the two most prominent suspects: deposed Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander General Ratko Mladic.</td></table>

THE HAGUE, July 22 (Reuter) - The U.N. tribunal for former Yugoslavia said on Monday it would hear an application for the release of Bosnian Moslem Zejnil Delalic on Tuesday.
<p>
Delalic, accused of responsibility for murder, torture and rape at the Celebici camp at Konjic in central Bosnia in 1992, has been detained at the tribunal since early May. He was originally arrested in Germany on March 18. Delalic's defence lawyer, Edina Residovic, submitted the request for provisional release "bearing in mind that further detention of Zejnil Delalic may cause substantial damage and unforeseeable consequences."
<p>
Residovic said his indictment "exposed his children to great dangers and problems" and added that, as a resident of Austria, Germany and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he would always be accessible to the tribunal. The prosecutor said the defence motion failed to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying a provisional release and did not guarantee Delalic would not pose a threat to victims and witnesses.
<p>
Delalic is alleged to have coordinated the activities of Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces in the Konjic area and is one of only three Moslems to have been indicted by the tribunal. The tribunal has released three people from its custody to date. In March, Bosnian Serb officer Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic was returned to Bosnian custody, on the grounds of insufficient evidence against him.
<p>
The following month, Bosnian Serb General Djordje Djukic was released for humanitarian reasons and later died of cancer. In June, Bosnian Serb Goran Lajic was freed on the grounds of mistaken identity.</td>

LONDON, July 10 (Reuter) - The five-nation "Contact Group" agreed on Wednesday to redouble efforts to oust Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic from political life and put him before an international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
<p>
Senior officials from the governments of Britain, Germany, France, the United States and Russia reviewed various ways of stripping Karadzic of influence ahead of elections in Bosnia scheduled for September 14.

"They want to make sure that the different levers Karadzic might try to manipulate are removed from him," a British official said after the meeting.
<p>
Under international pressure, Karadzic, an indicted war criminal, transferred his powers last week to his deputy, Biljana Plavsic. But he hung on to his title and also retained the influential post of chairman of the ruling Serb Democratic Union (SDS) party for the next four years, thus cementing his influence over Serb police, media and the army. In a step seen by Contact Group officials as a means for Karadzic to entrench his power, the Bosnian Serb parliament voted on Tuesday to establish a 55-member senate appointed by the president who would also chair the authority.
<p>
"It is important to continue to marginalise Karadzic. The transfer of his state functions was a first step. But he must also be removed from power and influence. The meeting discussed proposals to bring this about," said a Foreign Office statement. One idea discussed was how to reduce Karadzic's access to the Bosnian Serb media, especially television. "There have been achievements, but there was very much a recognition that more needs to be done," the British official said. "It's a question of how to keep closing the vice until it's jammed tightly shut."
<p>
The Contact Group representatives, who were joined by mediator Carl Bildt, the international community's High Representative in Bosnia, will put their proposals to ministers.
<p>
Wednesday's meeting also discussed ways of forcing Bosnian Serb compliance with the requirement in last December's Dayton peace agreement, which ended 43 months of fighting in Bosnia, that all individuals indicted for war crimes be removed from public office and handed over to a U.N. tribunal at The Hague.
<p>
"All agreed that, as Karadzic has been indicted for war crimes, his place is in The Hague. The prime responsibility for getting him there rests with the parties. The Contact Group and the High Representative are continuing to press Pale (the Bosnian Serb stronghold) and Belgrade on this," the Foreign Office said. Bildt has the option, given him under the authority of the United Nations, to reimpose international sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs in the event of non-compliance with Dayton.
<p>
The Contact Group also discussed a British proposal for a less extreme, graduated response including a squeeze on international reconstruction aid, British officials said.</td>

Tribunal Calls on West<br>
To Arrest Karadzic, Mladic</b>

THE HAGUE (Reuter) - Prosecutors at a Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal urged major powers on Monday to arrest Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and hand them over to The Hague to stand trial for genocide. 
<p>
The call came as U.N. investigators began to unearth mass graves of massacre victims, starting with Muslims killed in the Bosnian Serb conquest of Srebrenica a year ago, believed to have been Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
<p>
Prosecutor Mark Harmon criticized the international community for failing to arrest the tribunal's two most wanted men, who were first charged last July, but remain in the Bosnian Serb stronghold at Pale, near Sarajevo. At the weekend, the U.S. commander of NATO peacekeeping troops in Bosnia said he would neither detain nor intimidate Karadzic, the separatists' political leader.
<p>
On the eighth day of public hearings against the two indicted war criminals, Harmon said: "We believe the evidence we have presented...is more than sufficient to demonstrate that there are reasonable grounds for believing that Dr Karadzic and General Mladic committed genocide..." Tribunal judge Claude Jorda is expected to reconfirm the
indictments and issue international arrest warrants against Karadzic and Mladic on Thursday, making them fugitives, unable to leave Bosnian Serb territory without risking capture and extradition to The Hague.
<p>
"Today, both Karadzic and Mladic remain fugitives from international justice," Harmon said. "As we approach the first anniversary of...tragic massacres...that annihilated a generation of Srebrenicians and
left thousands of widows and orphans, the resulting toll of human misery...will be felt for generations to come. In the Balkans... Karadzic's and Mladic's perfidious and cowardly deeds will long be remembered. What should not be remembered is that the world had the ability to bring these two alleged architects of genocide to justice and did nothing. It will haunt the victims and it will shame us all."
<p>
Harmon asked that the U.N. Security Council, which created the tribunal three years ago, be informed of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's failure to arrest the two accused. "Karadzic and Mladic remain at liberty today, in no small measure due to the failure of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to arrest them and transfer them to The Hague."
<p>
He said evidence showed that Karadzic and Mladic "instigated, planned and ordered the genocide and the "ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia...crimes which have shocked the conscience of the world." He cited 14 witnesses, ranging from historians, alleged victims and U.N. peacekeepers to the mayors of Sarajevo and Tuzla and a young Croat who said he was forced to shoot unarmed Muslims at Srebrenica. Listing a grisly catalogue of alleged atrocities, Harmon
said Serb targets, from Muslims and Croats to ethnic and cultural sites, "were systematically destroyed for no other reason than to eradicate traces of cultural identity.
<p>
"The fury and cruelty of...these attacks was limited only by the perpetrator's inability to imagine darker deeds."
<p>
Harmon charged that, as the political and military chiefs, Karadzic and Mladic controlled the 3½-year siege of Sarajevo, which killed some 12,000 civilians, and ordered the bloody Serb assault on the U.N. "safe area" of Srebrenica in July 1995. Karadzic "treated Sarajevo and the lives of its citizens as his personal plaything," he said, adding: "There can be no doubt that both Karadzic and Mladic could have stopped this killing whenever they wanted."
<p>
Describing the carnage following the attack on Srebrenica, Harmon said Mladic strutted around lying to thousands of refugees that nothing would happen to them.
<p>
"It is hard to imagine a more callous and calculated deception." As Mladic was speaking, his soldiers had already
started their "murderous binge," Harmon told the court. Pashaga Mesic, the mayor of Tuzla, testified on Friday that over 6,000 people were missing since the fall of Srebrenica.

BONN, July 20 (Reuter) - The president of the U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia was quoted by a German newspaper on Saturday as saying Serbian athletes should be banned from the Olympics to press Belgrade to hand over indicted war criminals.
<p>
Judge Antonio Cassese told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung exclusion of Serbian athletes could lead to the handing over of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko Mladic to the tribunal. "Pressure must be brought to bear on Belgrade and (the Bosnian Serb capital) Pale so that the chief war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are handed over before the Bosnian elections," Cassese said in an interview with the daily.
<p>
"If they are not handed over before the elections on September 14 then the whole process will be a farce. Even if they do not stand as candidates, they will remain in power through their front men and women," Cassese said. "An Olympic ban would be the best way for the international community to show its disapproval of the way the Bosnian Serb are behaving," Cassese said.
<p>
"Economic sanctions only hurt the poorest of the poor," he was quoted as telling the newspaper's Hague correspondent. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said in Belgrade on Friday that Karadzic had resigned after 10 hours of "acrimonious" talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Bosnian Serb leaders. Karadzic stepped down as president of the Bosnian Serb Republic and head of the ruling Serb Democratic Party.
<p>
Holbrooke, however, failed to get agreement on the arrest of Karadzic and his army commander General Ratko Mladic and their extradition to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</td>

UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Reuter) - Bosnia's U.N. envoy called on the Security Council on Tuesday to impose sanctions on those parties which failed to comply with the orders of the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
<p>
In a letter to Council President Alain Dejammet of France, ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey also said the council should call on the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) helping carry out the Bosnia peace accords to arrest and extradite indicted war criminals for trial by the tribunal at The Hague. Elections due to be held in Bosnia in September could not be considered legal while the tribunal's orders were ignored, he added.
<p>
"Unfortunately, it is abundantly clear that some of the parties to the Dayton/Paris accords are neither committed to the future of the tribunal nor to that of the peace agreement," Sacirbey wrote.
<p>
Over six months after the accords were initialled at Dayton, Ohio, and signed in Paris, only the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina had fully cooperated with the tribunal and its orders, as required by the agreements, he added. "Now it is up to the Security Council to decide how it will respond to the challenge of the future of the tribunal and peace," Sacirbey said, recalling that tribunal president Judge Antonio Cassese had called on the council to compel cooperation with the war crimes court.
<p>
"We call upon the Security Council to undertake the necessary steps, all within its purview, to safeguard the peace as well as the tribunal," Sacirbey said. "First, the council has to promptly... sanction those parties that do not comply with the orders of the tribunal. Second, in the absence of full compliance, the Security Council should call upon IFOR to arrest and extradite indicted war criminals to The Hague.
<p>
"Finally, it must be clear that elections while the tribunal's orders are ignored cannot be considered legal, nor free and fair," Sacirbey said.</td>

ATLANTA, July 22 (AP) -- Toni Kukoc, probably the best basketball player Croatia ever has produced, won’t suit up for the country again after these Olympics, his coach said. "We lost a lot of time with Toni Kukoc because he was injured and he was with the Chicago Bulls during our preparation time," coach Petar Skansi said Monday after Croatia’s 109-78 victory over China. "This is definitely the last time he will be on the team."
<p>
Skansi acknowledged that Kukoc probably still will be Croatia’s top player in four years, but that doesn’t mean the coach will want the 6-foot-11 forward for the 2000 Games at Sydney, Australia.
<p>
"He is everything for our team," Skansi said. "But we don’t have so much contact with him anymore. He is in Croatia 10 or 15 days a year. This fact is important. We will try, during the tournament, to get him adjusted to the other guys."
<p>
Despite playing with a broken thumb on his shooting hand, Kukoc has had two fine games for Croatia. He had 33 points Saturday in a triple-overtime loss to Lithuania, and had 12 assists Monday against China. It was for that kind of all-around ability that Kukoc was named the NBA’s top nonstarter after helping the Bulls to a record-setting season in 1995-96. 
<p>
Even after being coached by Phil Jackson for three years and playing alongside the likes of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, "he is the same player," Skansi said. "He is now stronger because he is playing stronger competition," the coach said. "But he learned everything he knows in Croatia."</td>

Injured Star and Dream Team Challenge 
Doesn’t Dim Croatia’s Olympic Dreams</b>

ATLANTA, July 20 (AP) - Don’t cry for Argentina. Or at least, save some tears for Croatia. The 1992 men’s basketball silver medalists’ hopes for a medal could be hurting, like Toni Kukoc’s broken left thumb, after their first game of the Olympics on Saturday.
<p>
Thanks to the unluck of the draw, Croatia faces a tough Lithuania team and was thrown into the same pool with the Dream Team, which loosens up Saturday night against Argentina. Croatia’s test comes less than two weeks after their best player fractured the top of his left, shooting thumb in an exhibition game.
<p>
"How important is Toni to us? That’s like asking what Michael Jordan brings to the Chicago Bulls," said Croatia’s Dino Radja, who plays forward for the Boston Celtics. Kukoc charged out onto the Morehouse College court for practice Friday afternoon and effortlessly swished his first shot from the top of the three-point circle. But as the workout proceeded, he at times appeared to have trouble receiving passes.
<p>
"So-so. If I play, I play," Kukoc said, thumb buried in a cup of ice after practice. "We’ll see tomorrow."
<p>
Lithuania, which practiced in a high school gym Friday, was prepared to face Kukoc. "Oh, he’ll play," Donnie Nelson, a Lithuania assistant coach, said without hesitation. "He’s not here for any other reason. He didn’t come to observe the Croatian badminton team."
<p>
Yugoslavia, another Big Three team (that is, after the Giant One from the United States), is in the opposite pool. "It’s going to have medal-round intensity to it," Nelson said. "It’s unfortunate that both teams have to get to thrown into that situation right from the get-go, but that’s the draw and we’ve got no control over it." 
<p>
"It’s a big game," agreed Radja. "I can’t change that we play them the first game. I don’t care, really. If you want to win a medal, you have to beat them sometime."
<p>
The three leading non-U.S. medal contenders, not coincidentally, each include at least two NBA players on their rosters. Besides Kukoc, the forward who filled the Bulls’ sixth man role last season, and Radja, who had the Celtics’ top scoring average at 19.7 points in an injury-shortened season, Croatia also has the Toronto Raptors’ 7-foot backup center, Zan Tabak. He’ll have to battle Lithuania’s 7-3 Arvydas Sabonis, coming off a strong rookie season for the Portland Trailblazers. Sabonis and guard Sarunas Marciulionis, who averaged 10.8 points for Sacramento and was recently traded to Denver, each averaged more than 23 points at Barcelona for the Lithuania’s bronze team.
<p>
<a href="http://www.nba.com/lakers/bios/vlade_divac.html"><img src="divac.gif" width=72 height=116 vspace=3 hspace=0 alt="Vlade Divac" align=left border=0></a><b>Yugoslavia, left out of the 1992 games because of United Nations sanctions, is led by 6-11 Vlade Divac,</b> traded from Los Angeles to the Charlotte Hornets as a key figure in the NBA’s trading and bidding frenzy, and a Miami Heat guard, Predrag Danilovic. Unlike most of the major sports, competitors in men’s basketball talk longingly of being satisfied with a silver or bronze. "Silver is gold," Nelson summarized.
<p>
Croatia, which lost Barcelona star and Nets player Drazen Petrovic to a tragic auto accident less than a year after the 1992 games, came the closest of anyone in their second meeting with the original Dream Team. The final score: 117-85.
<p>
No one expects any upsets against the third edition, which headed into play after a 66-point pounding of Greece, Yugoslavia’s first opponent Saturday. While the Dream Teamers will begin their roll to the gold, the U.S. women’s swim team will try Saturday to keep the heavily favored Chinese juggernaut from building too much steam.
<p>
"How you do on the first day is going to kind of tell what’s going to happen the rest of the meet," said Amy Van Dyken, probably the best U.S. hope in Saturday’s 100-meter freestyle. Favored is China’s Le Jingyi, who set the 100 free world record of 54.01 seconds at the 1994 world championships in Rome. And while many are still bleary-eyed after Friday night’s opening-cermony blowout, sharpshooters will be earning the Centennial Games’ first medals. Competition begins at 9 a.m. at the Wolf Creek Shooting Complex in the men’s 10-meter air pistol and the women’s 10-meter air rifle.</td></table>

Cotti Warns OSCE of Election Peril<br>

STOCKHOLM, July 5 (Reuter) - Bosnian elections will take
place as planned in September but the involvement of indicted
war criminals such as Radovan Karadzic threatens to legitimise
racial hatred and more ethnic cleansing, the head of Europe's
security forum said on Friday.
<p>
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, chairman-in-chief of
the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
made the remarks in a speech in Stockholm at the start of the
OSCE's fifth annual parliamentary assembly.
He said the 54-nation group, which is responsible for the
inter-ethnic elections on September 14, would go ahead with the
polling. But he repeated calls for indicted war criminals,
including Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb president, to be extradited
immediately to the war crimes tribunal in the Hague.
<p>
"If no actions are undertaken right now against them it can
be taken for granted that the elections will very quickly give
way to developments diametrically opposed to those which they
are expected to yield," Cotti said.
"There exists the most serious danger that they then
degenerate into a pseudo-democratic legitimisation of extreme
nationalist power structures and ethnic cleansing," he added.
<p>
The Dayton peace agreement signed last December and ending
43 months of war in the former Yugoslavia stated categorically
that Karadzic was to have no further part in the political arena
as it would prevent free, fair, democratic elections.
<p>
But Cotti said Karadzic's move last week to hand over power
to his deputy, Biljana Plavsic, was all a game and meant little.
"(It was) a further example of the game of cat and mouse
that the Serb leader Karadzic is playing with the international
community," he said.
<p>
Cotti said it was clear that Karadzic still had a strong
direct or indirect influence on political events in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. But he added that, despite Karadzic's involvement, the OSCE
had dismissed suggestions of postponing the elections and the
polling would go ahead as planned.
<p>
Cotti said the elections would mark the first stage in a
long process to try to build democracy and restore confidence to
war-torn Bosnia and needed to go ahead.
"The task that the OSCE has taken on in Bosnia and
Herzegovina will not be finished by the end of this year as you
do not build democracy on the ruins of war in 12 months," he
said.
<p>
"If you go into the region and you notice how much hate you
will find within the souls of the people living there, there is
no doubt the solution does not reside in the results of an
election in two months time.
<p>
"We need generations until the consequences of a cruel and
dramatic war will be eliminated," he said.</td>

Sarajevo Mayor Tells of<br>
City’s Plunge into Hell</b>

THE HAGUE, July 1 (Reuter) - The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo disintegrated from a modern European city into a vision of medieval hell during a 44-month siege by Bosnian Serb forces, the city's wartime mayor told a U.N. hearing on Monday. 
<p>
Tarik Kupusovic recalled how daily routines were shattered, with women and children forced to risk random sniper bullets in order to survive harsh winters without basic fuel and food.
<p>
Kupusovic, testifying on the third day of genocide hearings against separatist Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief General Ratko Mladic, said sustained and indiscriminate sniping and shelling cost 12,000 lives and untold psychological damage during the siege that began in the spring of 1992.
<p>
The tribunal's two most wanted men, accused of running a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing to purge areas of
Bosnia of non-Serbs, were not in court to hear the testimony. Karadzic, under intense pressure to stand down and face the charges, said on Sunday he had handed power to his deputy but would stay as titular president, while Bosnian Serb army sources denied reports that Mladic had had a stroke and was in hospital.
<p>
The two are charged with crimes ranging from the three-year siege of Sarajevo to the bloody Serb assault on the U.N. "safe area" of Srebrenica, where over 6,000 men are feared slaughtered in the worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War Two.
<p>
"Sarajevo was a modern European city. For over 400 years Moslems, Serbs, Croats and Jews lived together... in harmony and simply happy," Kupusovic told the Hague-based U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia. "All of a sudden... the hills (around Sarajevo) were filled with cannon and artillery shooting at the city. People couldn't believe war had begun. They thought this would be resolved... at the worst within two months. It was inconceivable how anyone could attack a city in which there was no military target. We considered this to be madness and only lunatics would do that," Kupusovic said.
<p>
He described how some days the shelling was like "hell let loose" as "Karadzic's Serbs" bombed the city in revenge for Bosnian army successes in the war.
<p>
Civilians endured freezing winters without electricity or water, forced to run the gauntlet of random sniping just to fetch wood or water from abandoned wells at the city's brewery. "The first purpose of the sniping was to kill...but also to keep the city hostage and hopeless...where everything would be controlled by Karadzic's Serbs and they would be lords of war and peace, of life and death, of an entire city," he said.
<p>
He told how Serbs razed buildings of historic and symbolic value, like mosques and catholic churches, municipal buildings, the national library -- all targets of "the barbarians destroying what makes a city a city."  Earlier, prosecution investigator Jan van Hecke described how Serb snipers, posted on hills around the city, picked off targets using rifles fitted with long-range sights.
<p>
"The population could never feel safe...even when indoors in their homes...people were killed and wounded sitting on their own couch, asleep or performing basic chores." 
<p>
Using video and television newsfilm and grisly photographs of dead and mutilated victims, Van Hecke described how Serb positions kept up a steady bombardment, raining improvised air bombs, which exploded at head height, on residential areas. Targets were shelled at random -- children sledging in the snow, people queuing for water, bread and humanitarian aid, schools, hospitals -- "people of all ages, all sexes."
<p>
The seven-day hearings -- not a trial in absentia, but a process allowing prosecutors to present evidence against those charged but not arrested -- are due to end on Friday. The tribunal is then expected to issue international arrest warrants against both men, making them international fugitives.
<p>
The first body to prosecute war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after World War Two, the tribunal has charged 75 men, primarily Serbs, with war crimes. It holds seven accused in its Hague cells.</td>

‘The livelihoods of around 20 members of his family --<br>

<p>

THE HAGUE, July 23 (Reuter) - Lawyers for a Bosnian Moslem accused of war crimes at the Celebici camp in central Bosnia told a public hearing on Tuesday he should be provisionally released to care for his family.
<p>
"The livelihoods of around 20 members of his family -- now in Austria and other places -- depend on him," Edina Residovic, defence counsel for Zejnil Delalic, told the U.N. war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia. "His children (in Belgrade) have no means of support and cannot move from Serbia," Residovic said, arguing that Delalic's release would allow him to take urgently needed measures to protect them by moving them to another country.
<p>
She said Delalic, accused of responsibility for the murder, torture and rape of Serb prisoners at Celebici in Konjic in 1992, would remain available to the tribunal. His lawyers argued that Delalic, arrested in Germany in March, had himself asked to be transferred to the Hague tribunal. One of three Moslems in the tribunal's custody, Delalic has been held in a U.N. cell at The Hague since May.
<p>
The prosecution objected to the move, saying the defence had failed to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying a provisional release and had not guaranteed that Delalic would not pose a threat to victims and witnesses. Presiding Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald said the court would meet in camera later on Tuesday to discuss various procedural aspects of the case.
<p>
She did not say when the court would rule on the motion.
<p>
The tribunal has to date released three people from its custody. In March, Serb Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic was returned to Bosnian custody on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence against him. The following month, Bosnian Serb General Djordje Djukic was released for humanitarian reasons and later died of cancer. In June, another Serb, Goran Lajic, was freed after the prosecutor admitted they had detained the wrong man.</td>

Bosnian Serb Mininster<br>
Holds Breakthrough<br> 
Talks with Tribunal</b>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<p>
<font size=2>
THE HAGUE, July 29 (Reuter) - Bosnian Serb Justice Minister Marko Arsovic held preliminary talks with the registry of the U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia on Monday, the first such official visit by the separatist Bosnian Serb entity.
<p>
The visit, seen as a breakthrough for the tribunal after prolonged non-cooperation from the Bosnian Serb authorities in tracking down indicted war criminals, is due to end on Wednesday with the release of a joint statement, the tribunal said.
<p>
Before leaving for The Hague, Arsovic said the Bosnian Serbs, headquartered in Pale, near Sarajevo, would not consider extraditing war crimes suspects until after Bosnian elections slated for mid-September. During the visit, which continues on Tuesday with talks between Arsovic and tribunal prosecutors, the Bosnian Serbs are former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
<p>
The tribunal last month issued international arrest warrants against Karadzic and Serb army chief General Ratko Mladic, both of whom have held out against international pressure to surrender. NATO peace troops in Bosnia have not hunted them down, fearing casualties and Serb civil unrest. A tribunal spokeswoman declined to say what had been discussed, but Arsovic was also expected to urge the tribunal to indict Bosnian Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic, although he has not said on what charges.
<p>
Izetbegovic's deputy Ejup Ganic has already been charged by a military court in federal Yugoslavia, from which Moslem-led Bosnia seceded in 1992. Ganic was alleged to have played a role in an attack on a Yugoslav army convoy.
<p>
The tribunal has indicted 75 people, more than half of them Serbs, for alleged atrocities against civilians and prisoners in the war which ended with the Dayton peace treaty in late 1995. The tribunal hopes this week's visit will lead to further exchanges, boosting cooperation between Pale, Belgrade and The Hague.</td></table>

70 Pregnant U.S. Soldiers<br>
Sent Home from Bosnia</b>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=3><b>
‘It's the first time that I can remember that we have had to deal with this particular issue on such a public basis. It's being taken seriously’</b><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>
—U.S. Army Major Fougere Gordon
<p>
<font size=2>
FRANKFURT, July 22 (Reuter) - U.S. soldiers on the Bosnia peace-keeping mission have been banned from drinking alcohol or from leaving their bases but they have apparently not overlooked the fact that sex was not put off-limits.
<p>
At least 70 female American soldiers have been sent home because of pregnancy since the mission began in late December, a U.S. European Command spokesman said Monday. That converts to one pregnancy on average every three days among the 1,500 female soldiers participating in the mission, which involves a total of about 20,000 U.S. soldiers.
<p>
"It's the first time that I can remember that we have had to deal with this particular issue on such a public basis. It's being taken seriously," said U.S. Army Major Fougere Gordon.
<p>
The military regularly sends home pregnant women because of the heavy equipment they must use during a mission and also the inherent danger of the work. Female soldiers who decide to stay in the military are given six weeks off to care for their baby after the child is born or can usually receive an honourable discharge.
<p>
Stars and Stripes, the newspaper which has chronicled U.S. military life for decades, said in a recent story on the topic that the unusually lengthy Bosnia mission -- 12 months -- and the strict rules had been a strain on some soldiers. The newspaper said the military had been doing its part to encourage safe sex, with stores at bases in Bosnia and staging grounds in Hungary doing a brisk business in condoms.

Gordon said no charges of adultery had yet been filed against any married female soldiers who have become pregnant or men who have claimed responsibility for a child. The U.S. military can decide to press charges under military law if at least one of the two people involved in the sexual act is married to someone else.

The newspaper also said in a weekend story that GIs had found way to beat the ban on booze -- but that seven soldiers have lost their jobs by defying the ban.</td>

AMSTERDAM, July 11 (Reuter) - Issuing international arrest warrants against suspected war criminals is unlikely to bring them to trial in The Hague but is expected to add to pressure on the parties in former Yugoslavia to surrender them. 
<p>
The U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia is widely expected to reconfirm genocide charges against Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic on Thursday and issue international warrants for the two men.
<p>
These will make Karadzic and Mladic international fugitives from justice. The tribunal, unable to arrest suspects itself, hopes they will add to the pressure mounting on the two men. Exactly a year after their most heinous alleged crime -- the "disappearance" of thousands of unarmed Moslems after a bloody Serb assault on the U.N. "safe area" of Srebrenica -- Karadzic and Mladic remain at large in the Bosnian Serb republic.
<p>
While tribunal prosecutors build a case against suspected war criminals, there is little they can do to get the accused into the dock. With no police of its own, the tribunal has to rely on the former Yugoslav republics or the reluctant NATO-led peace implementation force (IFOR) in Bosnia to make arrests. The tribunal has recently sharpened his criticism of IFOR which, though mandated to detain suspects if its troops encounter them in the course of duty, has avoided actively hunting them down.
<p>
International warrants would mean that Karadzic and Mladic could be arrested in any U.N. member country, effectively forcing them to stay within the Bosnian Serb republic. If they move beyond their stronghold of Pale, near Sarajevo, Karadzic and Mladic would risk capture and extradition to The Hague.
<p>
Prosecutors say the two men masterminded a brutal campaign of genocide and "ethnic cleansing" in the 43-month Bosnian war. The tribunal first indicted them in July 1995 and, again, last November. It sent warrants to the authorities in Bosnia, rump Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- and the Bosnian Serb republic. Britain, the United States, France and Switzerland subsequently asked for warrants to be sent to them, too. But, while U.N. investigators continue to dig mass grave sites around Srebrenica, amassing evidence that could be used in trials, Karadzic and Mladic play cat-and-mouse with the international community which is desperate to remove them before Bosnian elections in mid-September.
<p>
Frustrated by political inertia, the tribunal on Monday concluded two-week public hearings during which prosecutors
aired witnesses' testimony of the savagery of the war conducted by the Bosnian Serbs. In the event of a trial, this evidence evidence would be re-submitted to allow defence lawyers to cross-examine the witnesses. The tribunal has explained that issuing international arrest warrants will have definite consequences for those accused.
<p>
Responsibility for arresting them would be extended to the entire world community. Any place giving them shelter would become an "open-air prison." "Any protection he (an accused) enjoys today may transpire to be only temporary," the tribunal warned.</td>

THE HAGUE, July 4 (Reuter) - The Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal said on Thursday it had postponed indefinitely the
trial of a young Bosnian Croat who confessed to taking part in a massacre of Bosnian Moslems at Srebrenica in July 1995.
<p>
Drazen Erdemovic, 24, had been due to take part in a two-day pre-sentencing hearing next week, but the tribunal said this would not go ahead as experts had concluded he was suffering from post-traumatic stress and could not stand trial. Erdemovic broke down and wept as he pleaded guilty on May 31 to helping shoot dead hundreds of unarmed Moslem men after the U.N. protected safe area fell to Bosnian Serb forces.
<p>
He said officers of his unit in the Bosnian Serb army had told him he would be shot too if he refused to take part. Erdemovic was arrested in Serbia and transferred to the U.N. tribunal's detention centre after speaking to western media about his role in the Srebrenica killings.
<p>
A tribunal spokesman said Erdemovic's case would be postponed pending further psychiatric and pyschological examination to be completed by October 31. However he is expected to testify on Friday in hearings in the case of Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic who have been indicted on various counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
<p>
As Erdemovic had already pleaded guilty, next week's hearings would have been limited to a consideration of possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances, followed by sentencing. Judges might well take Erdemovic's cooperation with the prosecutor's office as a mitigating factor, the spokesman said.

SARAJEVO, July 29 (Reuter) - International organisers of Bosnia's first post-war elections said on Monday a Bosnian Serb move to ban parties from outside its entity would be illegal and is under investigation. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), staging the elections which are intended to help reunify Bosnia, is empowered to bar candidates or entire parties for non-compliance with rules set by the 1995 Dayton peace treaty.
<p>
A conference of political parties in the separatist Serb Republic, which covers half of Bosnia, agreed on Saturday to keep out parties from the Moslem-Croat federation because they were "aliens" with no right to field candidates there. Chaired by the Serb entity's ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the meeting also reaffirmed the Serb nationalist notion that their area is an independent sovereign state -- defying Dayton's writ.
<p>
OSCE spokeswoman Joanna van Vliet said the organisation had only seen press accounts of the conference and could not decide on action, pending an investigation into exactly what was said But van Vliet said political statements and policy repudiating Bosnia's Dayton-guaranteed status as a single state with two linked sectors were illegal and could be sanctioned.
<p>
<img src="election_sm_sm_r.gif" width=100 height=122 vspace=0 hspace=0 alt="Bosnia's Election" align=right border=0>
"There is the (state) of Bosnia with two entities. Every party that is registered and has enough signatures can run throughout the country if it submits candidates for certain areas. There is no question about it," she said. Apart from electing local municipal administrations, Bosnians will be voting for parliaments to run the two entities -- the Moslem-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic -- as well as a federal administration to run the country.
<p>
Seventeen parties from the federation side are running for election in the Serb Republic, van Vliet said. "All those parties signed statements that they would abide by the Dayton agreement. We do not accept Serb statements as have (reportedly) been made at the meeting." The message from the meeting was the latest chapter in a litany of Bosnian Serb transgressions against the letter and spirit of Dayton, which they signed only under duress after a series of battlefield defeats.
<p>
The OSCE may have difficulty clearing the way for federation candidates to campaign in the Serb Republic. NATO says its peace troops in Bosnia will not play bodyguard to candidates, and unarmed U.N. police only have a monitoring role. NATO says it will run patrols to foster "a secure environment" for the election, and U.N. and European Union
monitors will help escort voters to polls. But the OSCE says local police will be responsible for maintaining law and order.
<p>
Critics say local Serb police can hardly be trusted when many may have been involved in massacres and mass expulsions of Moslems and Croats during the 1992-95 war. Further, the police in the Serb entity are controlled by the ruling SDS. While some federation parties are running for seats in the Serb Republic assembly, no Serb Republic parties are seeking election to the federation assembly. However, both sides will campaign for posts in a Bosnia-wide presidency and parliament.
<p>
Forty-seven parties have been certified for the campaign, ranging from former communists to sectarian ultra-rightists. But the three dominant nationalist Moslem, Croat and Serb parties are likely to win in their respective bastions, a result which many analysts fear would extend de facto partition.

Karadzic’s Lawyers Want a<br>
‘Level Playing Field’ for Client</b>
<p>
<font size=3>
<b>‘You have this fever that has been created, this great antipathy towards Dr. Karadzic... but where’s the proof that he had anything to do with it?’</b><br>
<font size=2>—Edward Medvene, Attorney for Radovan Karadzic
<p>
<font size=2>
<img src="karadzic_c1.gif" width=160 height=199 vspace=5 hspace=0 alt="Radovan Karadzic" align=left border=0>
THE HAGUE, July 16 (AP) -- Lawyers for the world’s most wanted war crimes suspect say their client hasn’t gotten a fair deal from the U.N. tribunal -- and won’t surrender until he does. The Los Angeles lawyers claim that by spotlighting allegations against Radovan Karadzic, the war crimes tribunal has already convicted the fugitive Bosnian Serb kingpin in the court of international public opinion.
<p>
The strategy of attorneys Edward Medvene and Tom Hanley has been to challenge the rules of the U.N. court in motions that were disallowed this month -- along with the lawyers, who were told to sit with the spectators. The Hague-based court says the defense has no official role until the suspect surrenders, and his lawyers say he won’t do that until the rules change to provide a "level playing field."
<p>
Medvene and Hanley represent the most notorious war crimes suspect since former Nazi bigwig Adolph Eichmann sat in a Jerusalem court in 1961. Both Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, have been indicted twice for genocide and crimes against humanity.
<p>
"You have this fever that has been created, this great antipathy towards Dr. Karadzic... but where’s the proof that he had anything to do with it?" Medvene asked at a recent press conference in the Hague. Tribunal prosecutors say they have proof aplenty.
<p>
The U.N. court’s prosecutors have accused Karadzic and Mladic of designing and conducting a campaign of atrocities during the 3½-year conflict, ranging from the shelling of Sarajevo to mass murders after the Serbs overran the U.N. safe area of Srebrenica. This month, the court publicized some of its evidence at a public hearing in hopes of spurring a reluctant international community to arrest Karadzic and Mladic, who move freely in Serb-held Bosnian territory.
<p>
At the hearing, American prosecutor Mark Harmon said Karadzic and Mladic "instigated, planned and ordered the genocide and the ‘ethnic cleansing’ in Bosnia and Herzegovina." The prosecution played a videotape showing Karadzic with a Russian guest standing on a hilltop overlooking Sarajevo. Karadzic invited his guest to fire a high-powered gun into the besieged city. The guest obliged.
<p>
Karadzic’s lawyers say the evidentiary hearing was prejudicial, and that it set up a situation in which if there ever is a trial, they will have to prove his innocence. "Now when you hear the name Karadzic, you think of atrocities," Hanley said.
<p>
As far as strategy, the defense has kept it to questioning the fairness of a court they say does not provide the due process protection afforded by the nations who set up the tribunal. They accuse the court of allowing hearsay into evidence and filing politically motivated charges. And they maintain that the doctrines of collective guilt and command responsibility, under which Karadzic is charged, are contrary to international law.
<p>
"It’s unfair for rules to be set up ... that stack the deck," said Medvene, of the firm Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp. In separate telephone interviews from Los Angeles, neither of the lawyers would say what strategy they plan to use if Karadzic ever makes it to court. Hanley, a real estate lawyer with the firm Berger, Kahn, Safton, Moss, Figler, Simon and Gladstone, says he hooked up with Karadzic during a chance social encounter in June 1994 with a Serbian-American plastic surgeon, Borko Djordjevic.
<p>
Djordjevic introduced the two, and Hanley became Karadzic’s representative that year in cease-fire negotiations led by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter. Those talks led to a four-month Bosnian cease-fire. Hanley said Karadzic recently asked him to set up a defense team, and he enlisted Medvene. Hanley declined to comment on any meetings with Karadzic, but the Los Angeles Times reported that Medvene met with Karadzic in Bosnia for two days in early July before the hearing in the Hague.
<p>
Medvene is no stranger to controversial cases. His law firm is representing Fred Goldman in a civil lawsuit against O.J. Simpson for the wrongful death of his son Ronald Goldman, slain alongside Nicole Brown Simpson in June 1994.
Medvene is handling all matters dealing with the crime scene and the coroner. The former federal prosecutor once defended a Mexican businessman convicted for taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. Asked what it’s like to represent Karadzic, Hanley said it’s a conversation stopper.
<p>
"People would ask, ‘You’re doing what?’"

Unless you're Maj.

I'm fascinated about your articles regarding the captured Muslim terrorists outside Zvornik. According to your articles the seven men were yet 'more' survivors of the alleged Serbian massacre. Perhaps there are thousands more who survived your so-called massacre and are still in the woods. The credibility of Berserkistan is Zero. I wonder if Berserkistan is just like the other media outlets that rely on Muslim government releases for the basis of their information!

<blockquote>
<i><b>By 'more' survivors, we were referring to others who have come out of hiding in Bosnia since the Srebrenica Massacre last summer. Perhaps there are others still in hiding. Time will tell. Berserkistan is far from a propaganda outlet for any government. Our journalism speaks for itself, as do the thousands of bodies strewing the landscape around Srebrenica.<p>

I was in Bosnia for a few months, and one puppy in particular really affected me. So when I saw this paragraph in Berserkistan:
<blockquote>
<a href="dog.html"><img src="dogs1a.gif" 
width=152 height=168 border=0 align=left 
alt=Link to: Dogs of War></a>"For a while at Tuzla air base there was a shoot-on-sight order in effect for dogs seen within the perimeter. This caused quite a row, I was told when, the Americans first arrived. Seems that some Danish U.N. troops had been feeding one and had sort of adopted it when an American MP walked up and blew out it's brains with his Berretta. Quite the uproar, I was told, and the Americans chilled out after that. But that is Tuzla HQ and things tend to be tighter closer to the flag of command."
</blockquote>
...I had to forward the following letter from Stars & Stripes. I didn't write it, but the incident happened while I was still there. For all I know it could still be happening. I'm by no means a tree hugger, but it makes me sick to think about. I think more people need to know about it.
<blockquote>
<b>Cruelty to Animals</b><br> 
Stars & Stripes, March 18, 1996<br> 
Letter to the Editor<br> 
By CPL Harold L. Martin<p> 

When we arrived here at Camp Dallas about three weeks ago, there were animals residing in and around the building that I am now typing this letter in. I love cats and dogs so to me there was really no problem. I did, however, realize that they could possibly be infected and unclean. The next thing I know, I see cats and dogs that appeared to bleeding from the mouth and rectum. I began asking people why, and was very hurt when I found the answer. Hamburger meat had been laid out for them to eat and enjoy. Inside this meat, however, was poison. Suddenly there were no more animals around.
<p> 
I am not an animal activist, but I can discern right from wrong. It's too late now, for they are dead, but I wish I would have been given the chance to think of a way to resolve the problem. Anything would have been better than watching them die right in front of you, bleeding so sadly.
<p> 
I do not share the same views as many people in this camp, but that does not chgange my view. What's wrong is wrong. They are living, breathing, walking and eating creatures just as we are. I try not to think about it so as to ease the emotional pain, but I want my stand known, so that in the future if the story is told about the murderers of Camp Dallas, there will be at least one soldier that can dispute that challenge.

Camp Dallas is the U.S. base in Durdevik, just south of Zivinice,
about 30 minutes from Tuzla Main.

NEW YORK, July 23 (AP) -- Having pressured Radovan Karadzic into giving up his political powers, the United States will now work to force the Bosnian Serb leader from his headquarters in Pale, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke says.
<p>
"The next step in the process is that Karadzic should leave Pale, the mountain stronghold which he really created," Holbrooke said in an interview broadcast Monday by "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer." "As long as he’s in Pale, even if he’s invisible, even if he’s out of public and political life, I personally feel uncomfortable, and so do my colleagues."

<b>Karadzic, who has been charged with war crimes</b> by the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, agreed Friday to resign as leader of the Bosnian Serbs’ main political party and withdraw from all public political activities.
<p>
The agreement followed talks between Holbrooke and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. Holbrooke threatened to reimpose international sanctions against Serbia if Karadzic did not step down.
<p>
Holbrooke, architect of last year’s Bosnian peace accords, said John Kornblum, assistant secretary of state for European Affairs, would travel to Belgrade this weekend to "pursue the next step in the process."
Holbrooke said that step would be to force Karadzic to leave Pale, the mountain village near Sarajevo which served as his headquarters during the 3½-year Bosnian war.
<p>
In New York, Bosnia’s U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, said Monday that the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo would continue to press for the United Nations to reimpose sanctions against Serbia until Karadzic and Bosnian Serb military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic both are brought before the war crimes tribunal. Sacirbey said Karadzic’s resignation was a "partial success" in forcing compliance with the peace agreement. But he said full compliance would not be achieved until those indicted for war crimes were brought to justice.</td>

Outgoing NATO commander says there is no question Karadzic, Mladic and other indicted war criminals must eventually stand trial before the tribunal in The Hague</b><br>

SARAJEVO, July 30 (Reuter) - The outgoing NATO commander in Bosnia suggested on Tuesday that indicted war criminals were still free in part for political reasons, including fears of Serb unrest before crucial post-war elections in September.
<p>
U.S. Admiral Leighton Smith, speaking before flying out of Sarajevo on his way to retirement, recalled again that NATO's peace force had never had a mandate to hunt down and arrest people indicted by a U.N. tribunal. Smith was asked whether NATO was also restrained by political concerns that moves to detain indicted Serb leaders could damage NATO's image of impartiality towards Bosnia's factions and stoke Serb disturbances endangering elections.
<p>
"Those issues you mentioned are obviously of concern to a lot of people," he told a reporter at a farewell roundtable discussion with invited media at his Sarajevo headquarters. "I wouldn't argue with those reasons. Obviously there are going to be tremendous repercussions across the board," Smith said of any attempt by NATO to take Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and army chief General Ratko Mladic into custody. Both have been indicted twice by the war crimes tribunal.
<p>
"You have to look whether the net result is good or bad," he said.  "It's not a simple process when you start down that path. It's not like knocking on the door and handing someone a warrant and saying, 'Come with me'," he added. Karadzic and Mladic have kept largely out of sight in their heavily guarded compounds.
<p>
<img src="lsmith_phone_sm.gif" width=125 height=129 vspace=5 hspace=0 alt="Adm. Leighton Smith" align=left border=0><b>Smith, 57, will be succeeded on Wednesday </b>by U.S. Admiral Joseph Lopez as commander of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia as well as of NATO forces in southern Europe and of U.S. naval forces in Europe. 
<p>
IFOR succeeded with flying colours in separating and demobilising Bosnia's ethnic nationalist armies. But it has been criticised by Bosnia's Moslem-led central government and political analysts abroad for not hunting down those indicted for war crimes, most of them Serbs. Smith reiterated that IFOR, whose mission in Bosnia will expire in December, was authorised by NATO's civilian policymaking council to apprehend those indicted only if it encountered them in the course of routine patrolling.
<p>
He did not expect this policy to change in the near future, citing concerns by international civilian agencies involved in Bosnia's post-war reconstruction that manhunts for indicted war criminals could jeopardise their work. Smith, a 34-year veteran of the U.S. Navy, said there was no question Karadzic, Mladic and other indicted must eventually stand trial before the tribunal in The Hague.
<p>
"The entire Serb population is basically getting a bad rap because they are being painted with that black tar brush saying they are all guilty. They're not, there are good people in this country...," he said. "So it's to their benefit to get the people responsible for atrocities (removed) to remove this blight from the Serb population and get on with this peace.

‘Dule, how have I hurt you...why are you beating me?’</b><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>
—Testimony of Mehmed Alic
<p>
<b>By Lien van der Leij</b>
<p>
<font size=2>
<font size=2><a href="tadic.html"><img src="tadic_l.gif" alt="Dusan Tadic" align=left width=112 height=145 vspace=2 hspace=6 border=0></a>
THE HAGUE, July 23 (Reuter) - An elderly Bosnian Moslem survivor of the Omarska prison camp in Bosnia told the U.N. war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia on Tuesday how he had been forced to deliver his son up for the beating which killed him.
<p>
Mehmed Alic, a 73-year-old farmer, broke down and wept as he told a hearing into the case of Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic how he had fetched his son Enver from his cell and brought him to Serb soldiers waiting downstairs. "They grabbed him and he said to me "father, take care of my children, look after my children'...I never saw him again," he told the court, struggling to contain his emotions.
<p>
Alic, who earlier said his two sons used to drink with Tadic before the war, told the court in broken tones that as he was dragged away from the scene he heard shouting "Dule how have I hurt you...why are you beating me?" Tadic is also known by the nicknames of Dule and Dusko.
<p>
A native of Tadic's home region of Kozarac in northern Bosnia, Alic is one of a string of witnesses who have placed Tadic at the Serb-run Omarska camp in the summer of 1992. Tadic maintains he never went to the camp and is a victim of mistaken identity.
<p>
Alic was the second witness on Tuesday to link Tadic with a series of fatal beatings and sexual mutilation of Omarska prisoners. Earlier a former Bosnian police reservist told the court how he had seen Tadic just half an hour to an hour before his cell mate and friend was called out with several others and tortured to death on June 18, 1992. Asked whether he was sure it was Tadic he had seen, Armin Kenjar, a native of Kozarac who as a boy had "idolized" Tadic for his karate prowess, replied, "Absolutely I am certain."
<p>
Armin Kenjar told the hearing he had shared a cell with Jasmin (Jasko) Hrnic, summoned by Serb soldiers along with Emir Karabasic and Enver Alic, all of whom are named in the indictment as among Tadic's victims. Speaking through an interpreter, Kenjar told the court that after Hrnic was taken out he heard "screams, blows with some blunt instrument, cries of pain and horrible obscene expressions" that went on for "what seemed like an eternity."
<p>
Kenjar said he heard raised voices exhorting one of the participants to bite off someone's testicles. "It was like a nightmare," he said.
<p>
An early version of the indictment told how Tadic forced two unnamed prisoners at Omarska (H and G) to mutilate the genitals of a fellow prisoner who later died from his injuries. "H covered Fikret Harambasic's mouth to silence his screams and G bit off one of Fikret Harambasic's testicles." Kenjar said some time after the screaming had stopped he was told to go to the toilets with cleaning materials, where he found prisoner G and asked him what had happened.
<p>
"He answered, "don't ask', he was scared stiff, he looked terrible," Kenjar recalled.
<p>
Kenjar said conditions at the Omarska Camp had been "disastrous." "They were not for living -- they treated us like animals there...we did not have drinking water, there were lice, there was a lot of abuse...Not one day passed that someone was not taken out (for interrogation and beatings)."
<p>
Tadic, flanked by two U.N. security guards, sat stoney-faced throughout the grisly testimony, occasionally taking notes. Tadic, 40, denies charges of killing and torturing non-Serbs in the Prijedor region of northwest Bosnia. The trial has heard scores of prosecution witnesses build a picture of a widespread and systematic Serb campaign to "ethnically cleanse" areas of Bosnia of non-Serbs.</td></table>

ZAGREB, July 24 (Reuter) - Three Bosnian Croats have been arrested in connection with the shooting of a female U.S. embassy employee near Sarajevo earlier this month, police in central Bosnia said on Wednesday. <p>
Bosnian Croat police said in a statement three suspects were detained last Friday in Kiseljak where a woman from the U.S. embassy was shot and wounded on July 12 as she was leavng town in a car to return to Sarajevo. Earlier, a U.N. spokesman told reporters that Croat police had detained nine Croats linked to the incident. But Croat police in Kiseljak, outside Sarajevo, said other arrests were not related to the shooting.

The police statement alleged the three suspects, all in their twenties, drove from Kiseljak to attend a football tournament nearby after having "a few drinks." "They overtook a vehicle with Sarajevo plates, whose driver made a provocative and offensive motion directed at the Croats," the statement alleged. "Offended by that gesture the driver of the Croat car pulled over, took out his gun and fired two shots at the vehicle, one of which hit its rear right part," the statement said.
<p>
The American woman was struck in the back and underwent surgery in Sarajevo before being flown to a U.S. military hospital in Germany for further treatment. Alex Ivanko, spokesman for international police, said the suspects were taken by Croat helicopter to the western town of Livno where they were arraigned before a judge on Monday.
<p>
"They are expected to sent to a prison in west Mostar," he said, mentioning the capital of a self-proclaimed Croat separatist mini-state which extends to Kiseljak, 30 km (18 miles) west of Sarajevo. Ivanko did not know if formal charges had been laid.
<p>
A number of American government employees have been killed and injured in Bosnia, but all through road and air accidents rather than hostile fire.

UN: Bosnia Doing Nothing<br>
About Assaults on Serbs</b>

‘Families are being told they will be killed if they don't leave. We believe the Bosnian government is doing absolutely nothing to stop this harassment’</b><br>

SARAJEVO, July 17 (Reuter) - The United Nations on Wednesday described a fresh wave of assaults on minority Serbs in
Sarajevo's suburbs and said the mainly Moslem Bosnian government was "doing absolutely nothing" about it. 
<p>
More than 50,000 Serbs fled the suburbs when they reverted to government rule last winter under the Dayton peace treaty. Some 8,000 stayed on assurances they would not face reprisals for the bloody siege of the capital.
<p>
The central government promised remaining Serbs they would be welcome in a multi-ethnic, reunified Bosnia it hoped to restore with Western help, despite the resistance of radical Serbs awarded 50 percent of the country under Dayton. But Serbs who stayed in the suburbs were swiftly subjected to violence and intimidation by vengeful returning Moslems -- former neighbours or war refugees from Serb-held territory.
<p>
U.N. police monitors protested repeatedly to the Bosnian government but the problem, after an apparent lull, has flared anew, a spokesman said. Alexander Ivanko of the International Police Task Force (IPTF) said Serb farm buildings were being burned down, families threatened with death and nights were plagued with gunfire intended to intimidate Serbs.
<p>
"Families are being told they will be killed if they don't leave. A number of families are coming to us asking for protection and support in evacuating them because their situation is getting unbearable," he said. "If the Bosnian government is truly dedicated to multi-ethnicity, as it says it is, they are really blowing their chances in (former) Serb Sarajevo with people being harassed and threatened on a daily basis. We believe the Bosnian government is doing absolutely nothing to stop this harassment."
<p>
Ivanko said a 37-year-old Serb woman was recently found dead in a pool of blood at her home in the suburb of Ilidza. In another suburb, he said, a Serbian Orthodox Christian church was torched and 67 Serb graves vandalised. Five Moslems were arrested, but immediately released.
<p>
Bosnian Interior Minister Avdo Hebib said on Wednesday he was generally satisfied with public safety in the suburbs
although "it could be better and we'll work in that direction."
<p>

<b>Violence is perpetrated by local thugs</b> or refugees impoverished and embittered after being expelled en masse from their homes. Many loved ones were killed in Serb-held regions. Bosnian Moslem leaders insist lawlessness in the suburbs is nothing compared to the mass persecution of Moslems on Serb-held territory during the war. Moslems are still being evicted from the Serb entity from time to time. "Serbs in the suburbs do have difficulties, but here we have double standards on the part of the international community," Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said last week.
<p>
A Western security official in Sarajevo who asked not to be named said the government's failure to rein in Moslems preying on Serbs reflected a desire to "see the ethnic balance changed in Sarajevo before the September elections." He told Reuters that the government had moved 17,000 Moslem refugees from Serb-controlled eastern Bosnia into Sarajevo's suburban ring in the last four months alone.
<p>
Sarajevo, a tolerant haven of ethnic diversity before the 1992-95 war, has become a predominantly Moslem city as a result of an influx of rural Moslem refugees and an exodus of Serbs.</td>

SARAJEVO, July 22 (Reuter) - Separatist Bosnian Croats,
under intense U.N. pressure, freed a Bosnian Moslem police chief
on Monday four days after arresting him during a U.N.-brokered
meeting for alleged war crimes.
<p>
"The immediate problem has been resolved," U.N. spokesman
Alex Ivanko said. "But not the root problem, which is a
complete disregard by the Croats for U.N. personnel and
procedures set by the Dayton (peace) treaty for handling war
crimes issues." The United Nations had denounced the detention
of the police chief without formal charges or an arrest warrant
as "despicable" and threatened to take the issue to the
highest level before the Croats relented and freed the man.
<p>
Emin Zebic, chief of police of Jablanica in Bosnian
government territory, was seized during a meeting on freedom of
movement issues with separatist Croat counterparts in the Croat-
held sector of the divided city of Mostar.
<p>
"As a result of enormous pressure put on the Croats by the
U.N., Mr Zebic was released into the custody of U.N. police
today and is now being escorted in one of their vehicles back to
Jablanica," Ivanko said. The United Nations had fiercely protested over Zebic's
arrest, in part because it raised tensions in a shaky Moslem-
Croat federation ahead of countrywide elections in September.
<p>
Separatist Croats controlling west Mostar were upbraided by
the U.N. for snatching Zebic during talks in a U.N. office,
threatening and shoving U.N. police monitors aside, failing to
produce concrete war-crimes charges or an arrest warrant when
asked and obstructing U.N. access to Zebic in jail.
<p>
Ivanko said Peter Fitzgerald, commissioner of the
International Police Task Force (IPTF) which seeks to deter
human rights abuses in Bosnia, would still raise the matter with
Croat leader Kresimir Zubak to ensure nothing like it recurred.
The Moslem-led central government in Sarajevo retaliated for
Zebic's arrest by detaining eight Bosnian Croat militia officers
but freed them quickly following a protest by Fitzgerald.
<p>
Mostar split into Moslem and Croat sectors during a 1993-94
war between the communities. The western half remains a fief of
Croat nationalists who maintain a separatist entity in southwest
Bosnia in violation of Dayton.
<p>
An informed Western official who asked not to be named said
Zebic was detained possibly over unsubstantiated allegations
that men under his command during the war were involved in
expulsions of Croats from the Jablanica area.</td>

SARAJEVO, July 20 (Reuter) - A separatist Bosnian Croat court has remanded a Moslem police chief in custody for 30 days pending an inquiry into war-crimes allegations, the United Nations said on Saturday. 
<p>
U.N. police stationed in postwar Bosnia to deter and report on human-rights abuses said the Croats had produced no concrete charges against Emin Zebic, police chief of Jablanica who was arrested in Mostar on Thursday.
<p>
He was detained during a meeting under U.N. auspices of Croat and Moslem police chiefs in the Croat-held part of the divided city to discuss improving freedom of movement within Bosnia's shaky Moslem-Croat federation. The Moslem-led central government in Sarajevo retaliated by detaining eight Bosnian Croat militia officers near Jablanica but freed them after a strong protest by international police (IPTF) commissioner Peter Fitzgerald.
<p>
The arrests for alleged atrocities during the 1993-94 Moslem-Croat war aggravated tensions within the federation. IPTF spokesman Alex Ivanko said Zebic appeared in a west Mostar court on Friday and was remanded for 30 days to Rodoc prison, notorious for mistreatment of Moslem detainees during the war.
<p>
"We have asked west Mostar police if they had specific charges. They couldn't produce any. We asked them if they had a pending arrest warrant, they couldn't produce that either," Ivanko told a news briefing in Sarajevo. "We understand these are strictly allegations and we are not aware of concrete charges."
<p>
Mostar split into Moslem and Croat sectors during the war and the western half remains a fief of Croat ultra-nationalists dedicated to secession of their region from Bosnia.</td>

SARAJEVO, July 19 (Reuter) - Separatist Bosnian Croat authorities arrested a Moslem police chief for alleged war crimes and the Bosnian government retaliated by detaining eight Croats, NATO and U.N. officials on Friday. Spokesmen for the NATO peace force and U.N. police monitors said the arrests on Thursday heightened tensions within the shaky Moslem-Croat federation two months before elections.
<p>
Bosnian army commander General Rasim Delic ordered the eight Croats freed after a strong protest by U.N. police Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald but the Moslem police chief remained in custody, NATO Colonel Max Mariner said. The latest sign of Croat-Moslem enmity lingering from a 1993-94 war erupted during a meeting of police chiefs from each sides in the Croat-held western sector of Mostar in southwest Bosnia to discuss freedom of movement.
<p>
Mariner said Emin Zebic, the chief of police in Moslem-controlled Jablanica 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Mostar, was arrested during the session by Croat colleagues, "charged with war crimes" and jailed. A few hours later, Bosnian Croat militia commander General Zivko Budimir told NATO that his deputy, Major-General Zeljko Siljec, and seven of his staff had been arrested by Moslem police on the outskirts of Jablanica. "This was presumably tit-for-tat retaliation," Mariner told a news conference in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
<p>
He said Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Walker, commander of NATO ground forces in Bosnia, then telephoned Delic and told him that "his reaction to the affair was neither helpful nor conducive to inter-ethnic relations." "Within 10 minutes General Delic returned the call with the news of the release of the (Croat) general and his staff."
<p>
Delic also called Budimir to protest at "institutionalised kidnapping that only served to cast the federation in a very poor light" and urged him to exert influence to get the Jablanica police chief freed, according to Mariner. He said the International Police Task Force (IPTF) and the European Union administrator of Mostar were making efforts to have Zebic released and defuse the dangerous dispute.
<p>
Mostar split into Moslem and Croat sectors during the war and the western half remains under control of Croat ultra- nationalists dedicated to secession of their region from Bosnia. The International Criminal Tribunal on former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has charged 18 Bosnian Croats and half a dozen Moslems with war atrocities against each other's civilians.
<p>
None of the men detained by local authorities on Thursday were known to be on the tribunal list.</td>

<center><H1><IMG ALIGN=Top SRC=koop.gif ALT="KOOP-AM Homepage">
</H1></center><P><hr>
<P>Welcome to the KOOP-AM homepage! If you're wondering what this station is about, then stay tuned... because the KOOP-AM history is coming right up!</P>
<hr><H2><B><I><U><center>HISTORY OF KOOP-AM</U></I></B>
</H2></center></P>
<P>KOOP-AM started out with a predecessor called <I>Radio Free Cheney</I>,
which was an audio portion of Eastern Washington University's cable station
in Cheney, Washington. However, back in 1990, Cheney's cable company and
the university got into some heated arguments concerning installing cable
television in the school's residence halls. The end result: the cable company
pulled the cable station, and with that, <I>Radio Free Cheney</I> went off
the air. In 1991, a Radio-Television student named Shannon Muir looked into
the possibility of starting a closed-circuit radio station that would broadcast
to the residence halls; she conducted a survey, and pitched a proposal to
the student government. The original proposal called for the station to be
run by the Radio-Television department, and that it would be a place where
students could earn credits while learning about radio. However, the project
cost more than the department had anticipated, so the student government
stepped in and took over the project, thereby leaving it under the jurisdiction
of the student government. In 1992, KOOP-AM went on the air, and it managed
to stay on the air until the June of 1995, when the student government decided
to cut all funding for KOOP-AM.</P>
<hr><P>So, as you can tell from above, the station is no longer on the 
air. So you may be asking yourself right about now, <B><I>WHY DID SHE 
START A WEB PAGE FOR A STATION THAT NO LONGER EXISTS</I></B>? The answer 
to this is easy: I consider this page to be a tribute to something that 
was a major part of my life for a couple of years, and ended up having a 
major impact on my life as well.</P>
<hr><P>I first started working at the station during the fall of 1993. I 
started a program called <I>Totally Classic '80's</I>, which featured the 
pop hits of the 1980s. This show lasted from October 1993-June 1995, 
thereby earning it the "award" for the longest-running show on KOOP-AM.</P>
<hr><P>During the spring of 1994, my older sister Shannon and I started a 
show called <I>Very Recent '90's</I>, which featured the hits of the 
current decade, as well as some songs that "should've been" hits. Also 
featured in the program during that quarter was <B>ROCK-THE-KOOP 
BABY</B>; this is when Shannon put on a baby voice and played the 
character of Rock-the-KOOP Baby. If you'd like to hear <A HREF="koopbaby.wav">Rock-the-KOOP Baby</A>, click on the
link. Shannon and I did this show together for one quarter; she left
the show after that, but I continued doing the show on my own from September
1994-June 1995. However, during the fall of 1994 (September-November), Shannon
and I did one final show together called <I>Really Retro '70's</I>; Rock-the-KOOP
Baby was also featured in this show, but during the finale show, her true
identity was revealed. During the 1994-1995 school year, not only was I a
disc jockey -- I was also the station's promotions director.</P>
<hr><P>A <A HREF="farewell.html">"farewell message"</A> that was written as a protest against the shutting down of KOOP-AM is now available. If you'd like to read it, click on the link. <B>(Added 10/21/96)</B></P>
<hr><P>Shannon Muir has written an <A HREF="letter.txt">"Open letter to the Internet community"</A> concerning KOOP-AM. Click on the link if you would like to read it. <B>(Added 11/4/96)</B></P>
<hr><P>If you'd like to read the copy for <A HREF="promos.html">promotional 
spots</A> that aired on the station for some of the shows, click on the 
link.</P>
<hr><P>There, I hope that was enough about the history of the station and my
involvement about KOOP-AM. If you feel anything is missing, please email
me at <A HREF="mailto:jem@olivier.dementia.org"><B>jem@olivier.dementia.org</B>.</A></P>

<P>Welcome to the "Totally Classic '80's" HomePage! "Totally Classic
'80's" was a program I hosted on KOOP-AM from October 1993-June 1995,
which featured the pop hits from the 1980s. As I said on the KOOP-AM
Homepage, "Totally Classic '80's" ended up being the longest-running show
on the station.</P>
<hr><P>"Totally Classic '80's" was always the show that signed on the station 
every Saturday afternoon. In the fall of 1993, the show ran from noon-3 
p.m.; winter of 1994, it aired from noon-2 p.m.; spring of 1994, it aired 
from noon-6 p.m.; and during the 1994-1995 school year, the show aired 
from noon-3 p.m.</P>

<TITLE>Lesley's Biography</TITLE>
<BODY bgcolor=#ff0000 text=#000000 link=#0000ff vlink=#ffff00>
<center><H1><IMG ALIGN=Top SRC=bio.gif ALT="My Biography">
</H1></center><P><hr>
<P>My name is Lesley (Muir) Aeschliman, and I was born on March 21, 1975 (so 
that means I'm currently 21 years old) in San Diego, California. My 
father was in the Navy then, so from the time I was born until I was 9 
years old, we moved around; I've lived in California, Japan, and Hawaii. My family currently
resides in Cheney, Washington, and we've lived here for twelve years. 
Right now, I live at home with my parents. I'm a recent graduate of
Eastern Washington University (the college located in Cheney), earning my 
Bachelor of Arts degree in Radio-Television.</P>
<hr><P>I also have an older sister, Shannon Muir, who graduated from EWU in 
1994 with majors in both Radio-Television and English. To get to her web 
page, click <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/shanemuir">here</A>.</P>
<hr><P>When I was younger, being an R-TV major was the furthest thing from
my mind. For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a teacher. Heck, I
even discovered something last summer while I was cleaning out my closet...
back in the beginning of ninth grade, I'd written in an assignment for my
English class that I wanted to be an English teacher. However, just six short
months later, I discovered what my true calling in life was... being a radio
disc jockey. I started to seriously pay attention to the music on the radio
at that time, and I was also fortunate enough to meet an actual disc jockey.
My sister was starting her coursework in the Radio-Television department
during the winter of 1990, and had a graduate assistant named Rob Potter
as an instructor. Rob worked as a disc jockey for the local Top 40 station;
it was from meeting him that I finally realized what my future career goal
was going to be.</P>
<hr><P>So, for the next few years, I worked hard in my studies and knew 
exactly where I was headed and what I wanted to do. Some of my plans 
changed during those years, some for the better and some for the worse. 
The most positive change, though, occurred when I was given the 
opportunity to take a couple of college courses during my senior year of 
high school; I ended up taking two Radio-Television courses at Eastern 
Washington University in the spring of 1993.</p>
<hr><p>My overall education includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheney High School graduate; 1993 (with honors)
<li>Eastern Washington University graduate (Radio-Television); 1996 (cum laude)
</ul>
<hr><P>When I got involved in the Radio-TV department, I ended up participating in activities in both the radio and television aspects of the department.</p>
<P>My involvement with radio included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://olivier.dementia.org/~jem/koop">KOOP-AM</a>; 1993-1995, as both an on-air personality and as the promotions director
<li>KEWU-FM; 1994-1996; as an on-air personality
</ul>
<hr><P>In the realm of television, I was involved with several 
productions:</p>
<ul>
<li><U>You're In Good Company</U>; art segment producer and lighting crew (Spring 1994), technical director and assistant director (Fall 1995), director (Winter 1996), co-director (Spring 1996)
<li><U>Alpha House</U>; Fall 1994 and Winter 1995; writing, lighting, editing
<li><U>Fear of the Unknown</U>; Summer 1995; writing and acting (portraying the main character, Layla Johnson)
<li><U>Choices</U>; Summer 1995; co-directed, co-edited, and extra (as a student)
<li><U>Done in the End</U>; Summer 1996; co-edited and extra (as a party-goer)
</ul>
<hr><P>Now, on to my personal life... I'm married to Daniel Aeschliman. The
wedding date was November 23, 1996, and took place at the First Christian
Church of Kent (located in Kent, Washington). My husband is known in the 
on-line community as Kylis. It's actually an interesting story about how we
met... if you're interested in reading this, then go <A 
HREF="http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis/biog">here</A>.</P>
<hr><P>Hmmm... should I include anything else?? I can't think of anything at
the current moment. If anyone thinks of something I should add, please let
me know. You can write me with your comments and questions at:

<TITLE>Deborah Gibson Section</TITLE>

<hr><P>Welcome to the Deborah Gibson section of my homepage! This page 
contains various resources, including lyrics, quotes made by Deborah 
Gibson, and links to other homepages of Deborah Gibson fans. But first, 
here's the story of how I became a Deborah Gibson fan!</P>
<hr><P>When I first heard the song "Only in My Dreams" during the summer 
of 1987, I knew I liked it, but had no idea who did the song. When "Shake 
Your Love" came out, I heard who did that song... and for a while, I 
<B>didn't</B> like the song! Mainly, though, this was due to the fact 
that "Shake Your Love" was overplayed at the time (I remember riding the 
school bus, and how the radio was always on the Top 40 station... and I 
clearly remember how it seemed as if "Shake Your Love" was being played 
<B>EVERY DAY</B>!) It wasn't until the third single (the title track for 
<U>Out Of The Blue</U>) was released until I became a fan of Deborah 
Gibson. And just a couple of months later, my parents gave me the <U>Out 
Of The Blue</U> cassette for my 13th birthday. The next year, for my 
14th birthday, I went down to a local music store and bought Deborah's 
second album, <U>Electric Youth</U>, with some birthday money that I had. 
For Christmas of 1990, my sister bought me the <U>Anything Is 
Possible</U> CD (Deborah's third album). And just a few weeks after Christmas
of 1992, I bought Deborah's fourth album <U>Body Mind Soul</U> on CD.</P>
<hr><P>After <U>Body Mind Soul</U>, I hadn't heard anything about Deborah 
Gibson for two years. However, during February of 1995, I was logged on to a
local computer bulletin board system and was reading the posts in the 
Majornet Music Forum, when I saw a particular post that caught my eye. 
It was from someone going by the handle of "The Electric Youth"... this 
individual posted that Deborah was currently working on her fifth album 
and that it was due to be released later that year. I wrote to that 
person, and they told me how I could access on-line information about 
Deborah Gibson by writing to the fan club's email address at America 
On-Line. I did, and I was told about how to access the information: the 
<I>Between the Lines</I> electronic newsletter (a newsletter devoted to 
Deborah Gibson and her music), the <I>Electric News</I> mailing list (a 
mailing list for fans to post <B>news</B> concerning Deborah Gibson), the 
<I>Anything Is Possible</I> mailing list (a mailing list devoted to 
on-line debate and discussion of Deborah Gibson and her music), and the 
Usenet newsgroup devoted to Deborah Gibson (<I>rec.music.artists.debbie-
gibson</I>).</P>
<hr><P>BTW, I bought Deborah's fifth album, <U>Think With Your Heart</U>, 
when it was released to stores on July 4th, 1995... (and interesting to
note: I also bought the Foo Fighters' self-titled CD the same day... :))</P>

<H1><B> KOOP SAYS FAREWELL</B></H1>
<font color=#000000>
</center>
<pre>
<I>What follows is an excerpt from a protest letter/farewell message we
posted around campus in early June 1995 when we heard KOOP-AM 
might fall to the ax of student government.  Now, we are putting
the farewell portion of the message on the Web, to remember all those we
worked with and hope that their experience were as great as ours.


With the advent of new technologies, we worry that college radio may
be a "dying breed" -- seen as old and antiquated in the face of other
forms of communication.  But radio can do things no other medium 
can.   By bringing us information taken in only through our ears, it
challenges us to stretch our minds and use our imaginations, done
with intimacy and immediacy.  That's a powerful thing.


May people learn from situations like KOOP-AM before it's too late...</i>
<hr size=5>
 
As both of us have been involved with KOOP-AM at various stages 
between its inception in 1991 through today, we wanted to give 
recognition to the people that we've worked with.  Without them, there 
never would have been a KOOP-AM.  We know this list is not complete, and 
if anyone has been left out, we want you to know we thank you as well. 
The staff of KOOP-AM over the years has included:
 
 Dan Aeschliman    	Yukari Baba   		Todd Barkes 
 Gerald Barnhart   	Troy Berglund     	Bret Boyer 
 Ben Briggs  		Josephine Brunetto  	Jim Burgess

 Jon Haman  		Jason Hammond   	Jon Hansen

But I've come back
Stronger than ever
Smarter than ever
And I hope you realize
That your ways were wrong</P>
<P>I'm back
Back where I belong
And now I feel strong
I should've known it all along
I'm back
And I'm never gonna go away again</P>

<TITLE>A Look Back At Life</TITLE>
<BODY><center><U><H2>A LOOK BACK AT LIFE
</H2></U></center><P>
<PRE>When I look back at my life
Everything seems so different
At one time, what seemed to be a tragedy
Is now something petty
And events I brushed aside
Come back to haunt me
And now I must deal with the past</P>
<P>A look back at life</P>
<P>Taking a look back at my life
Remembering what happened long ago
Good times and bad times
Remind me of who I was
And who I am
And who I'm going to be
I'm learning from my mistakes
And becoming a better person
As I look ahead to my future
I take action
And take control of my life
I learn from the past
So I can build a better future</P>
<P>As I sit in the old rocking chair
Fifty years from now
I wonder what I've really accomplished
During my lifetime
I sit back and try to recapture the memories
Of that one special moment
The one moment that lives on in your mind</P>
<P>This strange retrospective
I don't even know what the objective is
What is the purpose?
What is the meaning?
What good are memories
When they're all that you've got left?
Dreams I had of what could be
Dreams I had of what could've been
Dreams of what will never be
Clinging onto hope
When it seems that's all that you've got left
In this retrospective
I recapture the magic of youth</P>
<P>Time slips on by
Photos fade
And so do memories
Longing to relive the past
Yet forgetting at the same time
Hold on to your memories
Before they slip away</P>
<P>A fleeting glimpse of the past
Appears in your mind
And then disappears</P>
<P>A look back at life</P>

<PRE>There's no telling
What you're feeling inside
But if you're willing
You can tell me
How you feel
I'll understand
If you tell me to let you be
But perhaps you need a helping hand</P>
<P>Your parents split
And it's hard to handle
You think this is it
Nothing to live for
Nothing's right
There's nothing left
And there's no hope behind the door
And your escape is death</P>
<P>Don't end it all
There's so much to live for
Just don't take that fall
Look at your life
See what's there
See what you find
Look how you've overcome your strife
Just look into your mind</P>
<P>I know you've got problems
But they're only temporary
All you need to do is talk
Don't rely on a permanent solution</P>

<P>As we stumble our way through the dark
We encounter obstacles and pain
We're about ready to give up
And just go insane</P>
<P>But, wait a minute...
What's that up ahead?</P>
<P>Look over there, something's shining bright
Can you see it ahead, at the bend?
It's the light we've all been looking for
The light at the end</P>
<P>I can finally see the light -
The light at the end of the tunnel of life</P>

<PRE>I've been living in a fantasy world
For most of my life
Just following my dreams
And seeing them shatter</P>
<P>You gotta start livin' in the real world
And face up to reality
After you see the truth
You'll be welcomed back
Welcome back to reality</P>
<P>Yes, I know you'd like to live out your dreams
'Cause I've been there, too
But I've learned that you got
To go face the real world</P>
<P>Livin' in a fantasy world
Following dreams
But you gotta face the real world</P>
<P>Watch your dreamworld fall apart
Right in front of your face
After it all crumbles down -
Welcome to reality</P>

You can work them out
You can deal with them
I just hope you don't choose

Don't give up the fight
You've got so much going for you
You can rise above your problems
Without resorting to suicide
Because there's just too much to lose</P>

<PRE>I wish I understood you way back when
Before all these changes came about
I should have tried back then
Maybe I wouldn't have these nagging doubts</P>
<P>And now I'm totally confused
And I don't know what I should do</P>
<P>I don't understand why our feelings changed
It just makes no sense to me at all
Wish I could find a way
To just stop myself from taking the fall</P>
<P>Why is it you can't help me?
It's just too hard for me to see</P>
<P>No matter how hard I try to forget
The memories keep rushing back
Of the good times we shared
Before the storm clouds of hate rolled into our lives
And now I can't hold back the tears</P>
<P>I find myself living with regret
About the things I never did and said
I never got to know you very well
And now our relationship is dead
I feel it's all my fault
That our friendship fell apart
And now I'm living with regret</P>

</H2></center></U><P>
<PRE>Life can be such a mystery
And nothing is what it seems
Sometimes my hopes and dreams
Can or will never come to be</P>
<P>All I need is a bit of hope
And strength in order to cope
All I can do is mope
I've come to the end of my rope</P>
<P>At times life can seem insane
And all I can feel is pain
I wish this was a game
Everything seems to be the same</P>
<P>And there are times life seems strange
Strife seems to take center stage
And yet throughout this age
I feel like I'm locked in a cage</P>
<P>Memory plays tricks with my mind
I've found there's nowhere to hide
From all the pain inside
Doesn't matter how hard I try</P>
<P>I just don't understand my life
I've put up with all this strife
It cuts me like a knife
I just don't understand my life</P>

They flicker on the wall
They've come to remind me

<P>Over the past year, my life's changed drastically
Since all the darkness came

Not who I used to be</P>
<P>Oh, how I wish these shadows would let me be
Don't want to remember
I'm now a whole new me
After the tragedy</P>
<P>I've changed ever since my best friend went away
'Cause she's been dead and gone
And I've changed since that day
She up and went away</P>
<P>Shadows from the past had come back to haunt me
They flickered on the wall
They came to remind me
Of who I used to be...</P>

<PRE>You have a dream
You're the only one who knows what it means
Only you know how it should be
And you just want to see truth come for this dream</P>

Expectations seem to lag behind
True perfection's so hard to find
Because it only exists within your mind</P>
<P>It's for the best
Just to make sure it's different from the rest
And to make sure that it's the best
So you can make sure the dream passes the test</P>

Go and dwell on the past
But time has changed my point of view

Look ahead, not behind
And see what my life has in store
For that's the only way I can live my life</P>

And to put our relationship in the past
I want to make it through all this strife

<BODY><center><U><H2>ANTICIPATION
</H2></U></center><P>
<PRE>What happened two weeks ago
I can't believe it's true
Even though I know it is
That you told me the words, "I love you"</P>
<P>Right now you're miles away
But you'll be back to stay
In a very short time now
And all I can do is count the days</P>
<P>And though we write every day
All I can do is wait
For you to come back to me
All I can do is anticipate</P>
<P>Whenever I hear from you
It just brightens my day
And I always find myself
Hanging on to every word you say</P>
<P>I find myself filled with anticipation
Awaiting your return...
But you'll be back soon, darling
And then we'll be together
Forever</P>

<PRE>It's hard to believe it's been two months
The time slips by so quickly
But I cherish every moment
That we've spent together</P>
<P>As you help me love myself again
You make my heart skip a beat
Whenever I see you smile
This love is meant to be</P>
<P>I know inside we'll see forever
Together as man and wife
We have a love of a lifetime
It refuses to die</P>

At times when you need a friend
I'm here to help you through the strife
When everything seems wrong in your life</P>

Help you see things in a different light</P>

And to help you understand
I'll be here for you when you call
I'll always be there to catch your fall</P>

<PRE>You've left me for a short time now
And I find myself wondering how
I will be able to survive
Right now, I just don't feel alive</P>
<P>Every minute I'm missing you
I'm constantly thinking about you
And sometimes I spend a while
Just wishing to see your smile</P>
<P>I hold on to a memory
Until the day you come back to me
Right now, that seems like a long time
All I do is break down and cry</P>
<P>You'll be back in three weeks,
But that's three weeks too long...</P>
<P>I miss you</P>

Our lives changed so drastically
Since we are together now
Sometimes it's hard to believe</P>
<P>I can see forever
Whenever I look in your eyes
And I know that it's never
Anything else in disguise</P>

Down the aisle as man and wife
And then after the wedding
Partners through life</P>

I can see forever
Whenever I see you smile</P>
<P>And I can see forever...
With you</P>

<PRE>It's finally happened now
Things have come to a head
After all these months of trying
But this friendship is now at an end</P>
<P>And there's no going back
After reaching the end
We can't go back and change the past
And there is no turning back, my friend</P>
<P>There are days that I wish
I could go back in time
And take back things I said and did
It's too late, it's the end of the line</P>
<P>So now I must go on
Put it all in the past
Pick up the pieces and move on
It's a shame our friendship couldn't last</P>
<P>So I guess this is the end...
Goodbye</P>

<PRE>I see you're still playing your little game
You're still hiding behind your masquerade
And you're still playing your little charade
But I think it's time to rain on your parade</P>
<P>I've seen you with someone, making a play
Trying to find all the right things to say
You're already dating someone today
But that doesn't matter to you anyway</P>
<P>I thought you had learned your lesson by now
So it's hard for me to understand how
You can still keep breaking a solemn vow
It's just like you, but I'm surprised anyhow</P>
<P>Just like last time
You're burning the candle at both ends
But when will you ever learn
That the closer you get to the fire
The more you'll get burned?</P>

<PRE>Old wounds have been ripped apart
     Once again
And I must try to heal
     Them now
The pain comes rushing back
     To me
Swallow my pride and try to face
     The past
As it stares me right in
     The eyes
And there's no turning away
     From it
So now I must try to
     Stand tall
And make the pain
     Go away
And heal my wounds
     Once again</P>

<PRE>Life changes in a heartbeat
As everything comes from out of the blue
Surprises come around every corner
Believe me, it's true</P>
<P>My life is in upheaval
It seems as if nothing is built to last
Everything appears to be different now
As things change so fast</P>
<P>I cannot depend upon
What I could count on as reality
Andn now these changes are making me see
The world differently</P>
<P>People come and people go
They seem to walk in and out of your life
Some you see again, but there are some who
Stay out of your life</P>
<P>Many changes are abound
As you gain more experience in life
Some experiences will be good while
Others cause you strife</P>
<P>Life changes --
You live and you learn
But don't let life pass you by
As everything changes around you</P>
<P>Life changes...</P>

<P><U>From an interview with <B>ASCAP</B></U>:
"That's what I can't stand about collaborating sometimes. You
 can get in a room with somebody and feel like jumping out of
 the window because people will say stuff like 'Do you think
 that if we use the word 'but' it insinuates something
 different than the word 'if'? I believe that if it sounds
 like a sentence a human being would form and it gets the
 point across, chances are it's what we should use. Songwriters
 in Nashville understand that."</P>

<a name="Quotes from 1987"></a>
<P><U>From the <B>Chicago Sun-Times</B> (December 27, 1987)</U>
"I'd put my ear to the speaker in my bedroom and run back here to
the piano and play - left and right hands together. Classical music
gave me a good foundation. When I was little, I could play 15 classical
pieces. I would put a ragtime beat to jazz them up for fun."</P>
<P>(about her songwriting)
"I'm very observant of everything that goes on around me. I get ideas
from reading teen romances, movies, friends, my older sisters - and
sometimes a phrase will spark me to make up a story."</P>
<P>"My friends and I are kinda like your typical all-American teens.
We have fun going to movies, malls, and just hanging out at someone's
house. They haven't changed towards me, 'cause I haven't changed
towards them. Everyone has their own interests, you know, some of
the guys are into their sports - we all go cheer them on. I have friends
that are into tennis and we'll go to their matches. So, I'll perform and
my friends will come see me. It's all kind of the same thing."</P>
<P>"If I ever want to be cheered up, I read my fan mail. It's a lot of
fun. I've been pretty much keeping up with the writing back, even if
it's a short note to thank them. The age group is 10-24. One young
girl wrote, 'I like to sing and now I know I can make it at a young age
if I work hard.' It's good, kids relate to me because I'm close to their
age and it gives them hope to keep following what they want to do."</P>
<P>(about writing a fan letter to George Michael)
"I know I would have died if I would have gotten a response, but I
didn't. I understand that he must get 1,000 letters a day."</P>
<P>"I'm not an untouchable person. I often pull people on stage to
dance. Or, I'll jump into the audience in the middle of a number
like 'Only In My Dreams'."</P>
<P>"I saw Kenny G open for a Whitney Houston concert, and he
walked around the stadium playing his saxophone - it was wild!"</P>
<P>"Some people don't realize what's involved. They think you
wake up one morning and find an envelope with Ed Mc Mahon's
picture on it saying 'You have won a recording contract.' What they
don't realize is that how much work you put in you get back."</P>
<P>(about performers sustaining themselves over time)
"They don't have attitudes. They've been around a long time
because they didn't get wrapped up in it - they know what their
responsibilities are, they know why they're doing it - because they
love music. The people who have attitudes are the ones you run
across who have one record out and suddenly think they're it. Even
having your picture in magazines is meaningless unless you really
know that it's still a lot of work and there are responsibilities and you're
not going to make instant money, then you're not going to get caught
up in it. My real concern is being in the studio and being on stage -
that's the fun."</P>

<a name="Quotes from 1988"></a>
<P><U>From <B>In Fashion</B> (March/April 1988)</U>:
"When my mom was a teenager, she thought Paul Anks was the
 greatest, because he was her age and he sang about things
 she could relate to. That's what my music is all about."</P>
<P>"A lot of people think success just fell in my lap. Well,
 let me tell you something, I wrote my first song when I was
 five, and I haven't stopped you."</P>
<P>"Billy Joel's music has really influenced me. I have ever
 one of his albums. My main goal in life is to sing a duet
 with him one day."</P>
<P>"It would be nice to pull a Michael Jackson and walk away
 with a shopping cart full of awards."</P>
<P>"I like to dress fun, but I'm not into anything wild. That
 would be like playing dress-up."</P>

<a name="Quotes from 1989"></a>
<P><U>From the liner notes of the <B>Electric Youth</B> album</U>:
"In the '60s, young people were fighting to be heard. They were
 looking for peace and they wanted to change the world. Today,
 children are still struggling to voice their opinions. The song
 'Electric Youth' is about treating young people like people and
 helping to develop their ideas and creativity."</P>

<P><U>Deborah explaining each song on <B>Electric Youth</B></U>:
<B>Who Loves Ya Baby?</B>
"I originally wrote this song with Olivia Newton-John in mind
 because I knew she was working on a new album. Anyway, I
 ended up recording the song myself. It's basically a song
 about true friendship. At the end of the day, it's nice to
 know you have a friend who asks only one thing of you... to
 be yourself."</P>
<P><B>Lost In Your Eyes</B>
"I wrote this song a little over a year ago (fall '87). The
 song is pretty self-explanatory and straight-forward. It
 basically says that eyes can speak a language of their own."</P>
<P><B>Love In Disguise</B>
"Sometimes two people break up because they think it's time
 for a change. Then both people walk around, pretending
 everything is fine when, in fact, they want to get back
 together. I had the chorus/hook to this song lying around
 for months because I lost the verses. Anyway, I did new
 verses, found the old ones, and decided I liked the new
 ones much better anyway... So everything worked out for
 the best in the end."</P>
<P><B>Helplessly In Love</B>
"I wrote this song around the same time I wrote 'Lost In
 Your Eyes.' Again, this is a self-explanatory song about
 someone who is, you guessed it, helplessly in love. I
 would like to explain one line. 'I can't see clearly even
 though the sun's been lifted from my eyes.' I guess what
 I'm trying to say is that love blinds you when it's around,
 but still leaves you blinded/confused when it's gone."</P>
<P><B>Silence Speaks (A Thousand Words)</B>
"Shhhhh... Enough said."</P>
<P><B>Should've Been The One</B>
"I was considering this song for the first album, since the
 'Out Of The Blue' project was so dance-oriented. I decided
 to hold off on recording this live-sounding track. The
 song itself is about that one person you always had your
 heart set on, but was unobtainable."</P>
<P><B>Electric Youth</B>
"When I was in elementary school, I participated in a
 program called 'WINGS' - Widening Interests Through New
 Experiences For Gifted Students. This program focused on
 developing children's creativity outside the regular
 curriculum. If you have children or simply remember what it
 was like to be a child, you realize how much energy a young
 person has and how many off-the-wall ideas only a child can
 come up with. 'Electric Youth' is about not dismissing a
 young person's ideas because 'he/she is just a kid.' I owe
 a lot to my family and teachers for helping to develop my
 creative side and for teaching me and many other children
 how to channel energy and ideas into worthwhile and creative
 projects."</P>
<P><B>No More Rhyme</B>
"This is a song about how the consistency of the 'rhythm' of
 a relationship will keep it going even though the substance
 or the 'rhyme' is gone. The line 'waiting for the other shoe
 to drop' is like waiting for the last note of a scale to be
 played or waiting for something to go wrong in a relationship
 because something is going almost too smoothly. Fred Zarr
 produced this song and I think that it is one of his strongest
 pieces of work to date."</P>
<P><B>Over The Wall</B>
"This is a song about looking for more than what is right in
 front of your eyes. The 'wall' can mean something different
 to everyone. 'Over The Wall' is about bettering yourself by
 taking chances and not limiting yourself to only what you
 are familiar with. I spent ages on this string arrangement.
 People often call this song 'Over The Edge,' 'Over The Water,'
 'Off The Wall.' The meaning of the song is 'Over The Wall.'
 Got it?"</P>
<P><B>We Could Be Together</B>
"The message in 'We COuld Be Together' is this: Although you
 may be secure with what you have, you may really have your
 heart set on something else. This song is about doing what
 you know in your heart is best for you, even if the world
 disagrees. Society has a set of standards that discourages
 people from dating people of different cliques or classes or
 colors or religions. Sometimes people have to make decisions
 in life that not everyone agrees with but you have to do
 what's best for you because you only live once."</P>
<P><B>Shades Of The Past</B>
"In this song, I'm having a conflict within myself. I want
 to make a decision about whether or not to continue in a
 relationship. I want things to be clear, either black or
 white, but love is grey."</P>

<a name="Quotes from 1990"></a>
<P><U>From an early 1990 interview with <B>SuperTeen</B></U>:
"I just really want to focus on living healthy again, get
 in shape! Since my last tour I haven't been too good
 about that. So it's time for me to start again!"</P>
<P>"I have to say, Japan and Australia were pretty extreme,
 in a sense, in that the Japanese audiences are more laid
 back and the Australian audiences were absolutely the
 craziest we ever had! The Hapanese have a whole different
 way of expressing their enthusiasm. They are laid back but
 they really are appreciative. Both places were really great.
 Probably the people in both places impressed me the most."</P>
<P>"It's funny, I have been in show business since I was 5
 years old, and I learned to expect that anything could
 happen. But when I look back, everything was always for the
 better. I remember when I was up for <U>Les Miserables</U> --
 I was 15 then... I came really close getting a role in it and
 of course it was a big disappointment when it didn't happen
 at the time. But then my record-deal happened just a few
 months after that and it changed my whole life! So I keep
 my belief in that."</P>
<P>"I used to do a lot of theatre, industrial films,
 commercials. I used to go to movie auditions all the time,
 so it's a familiar field to me. And once I do do a movie, it
 will feel good that it was something that I was aiming for
 initially. And it's not something that just happened out of
 the blue."</P>
<P>"My favorite is definitely Billy Joel. He recently did
 some concerts in New York so I got to see him. It was a
 great show. I did a song with him. He asked me to come up
 on stage for a song. It was funny, because one of the guys
 from his crew who we also worked with came and got me from
 my seat about two minutes before and said: 'Do you wanna
 come on stage?' I was startled and jus tsaid: 'Sure!' It
 was a lot of fun."</P>
<P>"I like Neneh Cherry and Paula Abdul. In fact I worked
 with Paula a couple of years ago on the 'Shake Your Love'
 video. She choreographed it. She's another one that
 worked so hard, so it's really nice to see her so successful.
 I like them both a lot!"</P>
<P>"I believe in being honest with yourself and never doing
 anything to sacrifice your belief. For instance, even if
 the going got rough, I just kept right on doing what I wanted
 to do -- no matter what. That's probably my main belief."</P>

<P><U>From the <B>Live Around The World</B> videocassette</U>:
"Kids are getting the idea that it's wrong to be a good person,
 and I think that <B>that's</B> wrong!"</P>

<P><U>From the liner notes of the <B>Anything Is Possible</B> album</U>:
"No one can achieve success alone. A lot of people don't realize
 how much goes into developing a career. I feel so lucky to be
 surrounded by people who are not only true professionals,
 but...true friends."</P>
<P>"Throughout this album, there is an ongoing theme. This theme
 is about being positive, standing up for yourself and others,
 reaching for the brass ring, and getting what you feel you
 deserve out of life.  I also do write about obstacles too, because
 it would be unrealistic to think that things will always run
 smoothly. I do believe, however, that anyone can beat the odds if
 they have the will, strength, and persistence to do so. Hopefully
 the messages in the music can help serve as some inspiration. This
 is my goal."</P>
<P>"There is a world of endless resources. There is a mind full of
 outrageous dreams. There is a place where the two meet. Anything
 is possible..."</P>

<P><U>From an interview on <B>Hitline U.S.A.</B></U>:
"I'll tell you a little bit about the video, just because I think
 it describes the song. In the video, there are little vignettes
 of bad situations and people trying to get out of them and bad
 situations turned good. You know, I really wanted to show people
 that I'm optimistic, but I'm also realistic."</P>
<P>"The verses of the song really have a love theme. It's really
 about, let's say, the 'untouchable guy,' and the girl who thinks
 she can't get him. And when he does, in fact, pay attention to
 her, it teaches her that <B>anything is possible</B>. And, as far
 as the choruses go, the lyrics are 'anything is possible if you
 set your mind to it,' so you could apply that to anything you
 want. And that's kind of my philosophy in life."</P>

<a name="Quotes from 1995"></a>
<P><U>From <B>ASCAP Playback Magazine</B> (May/June 1995)</U>:
"One the one hand, I look at the last eight or nine years
 and I think, my God, that's nine years under my belt for
 recording; toruing; doing theater and all that stuff. And on
 the other hand, I feel like a debut artist and this is a debut
 album. It's interesting and exciting."</P>

<P><U>From <B>Hollywood Moms</B> (May 7, 1995)</U>:
"For as long as I can remember, I walked, talked, and sang, and
entertained. I mean, this picture that I look at, and, you know,
I don't even remember it, obviously, because I was only two."</P>
<P>(about Deborah and her mother working out at the gym)
"It's kind of also inspiring to work out with someone else,
because, like, my mom just started working out about a year
ago. And I think, 'Oh, God, I'd better keep up. She'll run circles
around me'."</P>
<P>(about Deborah's mother "recipe for success")
"It's like, she's got a professional life, her own personal life that
includes, like you saw, the working out. She takes a lot of time
and energy, but still there's always time left her her four kids and
her two grandkids. And it's just amazing - like 'Supermom'."</P>
<P>"I tend to get into something, like two feet and jump in, you
know, she's always kind of going, 'Come on, Deb, it's your career,
slow down, take it easy'."</P>
<P>"I'm kind of a quirky dresser usually. Like today, I'm actually
pretty put together, but I dress kind of off sometimes, but that's
just part of my personality."</P>

<P><U>From an interview on <B>Inside Edition</B> (May 30, 1995)</U>:
"The music now is about my personal life, where I'm at as a
24-year-old young woman, so it's very honest and it's very
pure and it's very emotional."</P>
<P>"And I always had people telling me, 'You can't do this.
You're from Long Island, how do you expect to be on Broadway?
You can't go into the city and be on Broadway.' What do you
mean? It's an hour away! Of course I can be on Broadway someday."</P>
<P>"I did, like, a couple of sexier videos, because all of a sudden
I went, 'Wow, I have a body. I have this side of me that I
haven't shown yet.' And I started kind of playing around with
that side of things."</P>
<P>"One of my favorite songs from the album is a song called
'For Better or Worse,' and it's basically about unconditional
love, which is, I'd say, an ongoing theme in my personal life."</P>
<P>"What I love about how my career has gone up to this
point is that I've always, always put my head down on my
pillow at night, and I've been able to say that I've done,
honestly, what I've felt like I wanted to do. And that's really
all you can hope for in everything you do."</P>

<P><U>From an interview on the <B>Biggers & Summers</B> show (June 23, 1995)</U>: 
"I wanted the tools to be able to work on arrangements and work
 on demos. Because anyone who writes knows that it'll cost you
 a thousand dollars to demo one song, and you'll come out with
 something that didn't even sound like what you had wanted it
 to sound like. So, the best thing to do is to learn how to do
 it yourself."</P>
<P>"I expressed a big interest in all of it. And my parents
 are just really supportive and basically thought, 'Well, wow,
 she's right. If she did have the tools she probably could do
 this.'"</P>
<P>"I was playing when I was, like, 4... by ear. So that's how
 they knew that, you know, that I just loved it, because I'd
 just sit and fiddle around at the piano for hours."</P>
<P>"I did theater throughout my whole childhood. And, Long
 Island is great for the arts. There was always a show to
 be in."</P>

<P><U>From an <B>MTV News</B></U><U> segment (July 21, 1995)</U>:
Keith Morris, Circle Jerks: "If we had Neil Young on our record,
   that would give us, a lot of, like, alternative credibility."  
Deborah Gibson: "I don't know what kind of credibilty this gives
   them, but it definitely is hysterical."</P>
<P>Keith Morris, Circle Jerks: "Mainstream."
Greg Hetson, Circle Jerks: "Bubble gum."
Keith Morris, Circle Jerks: "Mainstream."
Deborah Gibson: "Hey now! Watch it, watch it!"</P>
<P>Zander Schloss, Circle Jerks: "I think it was a natural
   progression for us."
Keith Clark, Circle Jerks: "We needed to increase our mall
   sales."
Deborah Gibson: "No, that's Tiffany."</P>
<P>Keith Morris, Circle Jerks: "It's an ugly pop song."
Greg Hetson, Circle Jerks: "She adds such a beautiful
   counter-melody towards the end."
Deborah Gibson: "It was kinda like, 'Yeah, do whatever you
   want,' so I tried to make it as bubble-gummy as possible."</P>
<P>"I like what's going on. A lot of stuff that older people
 would say, 'Ah, that's just noise,' is actually quite musical."</P>
<P>Keith Clark, Circle Jerks: "How did you like the stage
   dive this evening for the first time?"
Deborah Gibson: "Oh... oh... thank God my mother didn't come."
Keith Clark, Circle Jerks: "Having all of those people holding
   you up?"  
Deborah Gibson: "I knew there was a reason I told her to stay
   home."</P>
<P>"I looked off the stage and all those people were like,
 'Come on Debbie! You could do it! You could do it!' And
 they were so friendly, I just couldn't resist!"</P>
<P>Deborah Gibson: "We were just actually discussing their
   future tour dates and my future tour dates and the
   possibility of me, like, opening up with an acoustic set
   or something."
Keith Clark, Circle Jerks: "Uh-huh. And we would play on hers."
Greg Hetson, Circle Jerks: "I think we should do the acoustic
   set and you should do the electric set."
Deborah Gibson: "There you go."</P>

<P><U>From an interview with <B>The Malay Mail</B> (August 11, 1995)</U>
(about Barbra Streisand)
"Barbra has done so many things, and she's still going strong. She's
my role model in every way."</P>
<P>"I think many youngsters are more attracted by the fame and
fortune bit. They check out the latest musical trends, ride the wave,
and then fall out of favour when the scene changes. But I am a
musician because that's what I love to do."</P>
<P>You get so many people telling you that doing this beat or that
arrangement would make this song a hit, it's easy to lose sight of
what it's all about."</P>
<P>(about the <U>Think With Your Heart</U> album)
"It's the most honest album I have ever done. It was self-produced,
so the songs turned out the way I wanted them to, without pressure
from anyone."</P>
<P>(about singing with just the piano)
"If the song sounds good with just that, then it's worthwhile
proceeding further with it."</P>
<P>(about Carole King's "Will You Love Me Tomorrow")
"That song is timeless, and I know the emotions expressed in that
song ring true for many people."</P>
<P>(about working in theatre)</P>
"It was very good experience. I had to be very disciplined. It was
just vocal training, then the show, and sleep."</P>
<P>(about her movie script, "Skirts")
"It's about girl gangs challenging each other in dance contests in
the 60s. There is some music for the dance scenes, but I am
thinking about turning it into a full-fledged musical."</P>
<P>"I just want to exploit my potential to the fullest. It's a fear
of mine that I don't do that. There are still many things for me
to accomplish before I am satisfied."</P>

<P><U>From an interview on the <B>Mike & Maty</B> show (August 29, 1995)</U>:
"I think everybody changes from 16 to 24. Actually, I'm right
 on the verge of 25."</P>
<P>"You know what I've been finding out about, like, 'growing
 up,' is that I go to the gym, let's say, and if I work out
 too hard, I am sore for, like, a week. I feel like, 'God,
 you can't do this?' You can't do the same things at 25 as you
 could at 16. You notice these little changes."</P>
<P>"This is the time it all starts, I'm telling you. Like, 16,
 I mean, forget it. You could just get beat up, you could go
 through these grueling schedules..."</P>
<P>"I'm glad I started so young, because you are really able
 to endure so much at that age."</P>
<P>"I've been, I think, able to stay grounded in such a crazy
 business, and I attribute that a lot to my family, and
 especially to my mother. Because, you know, she just was
 always there to kind of remind me of what priorities should
 be. O.K., yes, I'm an artist, I'm a performer, but I'm a
 sister, I'm a daughter, I'm a granddaughter, I'm an aunt.
 Those things have to be as important, if not more important,
 than my career."</P>
<P>"I think any parent that makes their kid sit at a piano
 against their will and practice, they're going to have a kid
 that's not going to want to play the piano."</P>
<P>"This business is about working. It's really not about
 glamour. For me, the most glamorous thing about it is to be
 able to get on stage and perform my music for people. That's
 the privilege. And that's what all the work leads up to, and
 that's why it's worth it to me."</P>
<P>"I've been sponsoring kids in Manila, for like, 6 years.
 And I got to meet them. Now, how many people write away in
 the mail... you don't even know if these organizations are
 for real. So, there are examples of the power of music that
 come into play, like that, where I go, 'This is great.
 This is amazing that I'm here with these kids.'"</P>
<P>"Once I started writing songs, though, there was this
 feeling of, 'Oh my God, what a cool thing to be able to say
 to someone, 'You've never heard this before. And I know you
 haven't, because I wrote it.' I felt like, 'Wow, if I could
 present something new to people, that would be the ultimate
 thing.'"</P>

<P><U>From an article in HUH?! magazine (Fall 1995)</U>:
Paul Semel: What I want to do I play a couple of different things
and get your comments.
Debbie: Cool.  This is more interesting than telling people where
you were born. Besides, I sang with the Circle Jerks, you cannot
scare me....</P>

<P>(listens to "If I Only Had a Brain" by MC 900FT Jesus)
Debbie: I liked that.  I'd put that on if I was getting ready to go
out and wanted to feel attitude-y.</P>

<P>(listens to "Closer To God" by Nine Inch Nails)
Debbie: Uh-Oh, "parental advisory."  Get my mother.
Paul Semel: I notice you're not tapping your feet this time.
Debbie: Yeah, the static approach is turning me off.  It's very
distracting.  It's not like a good, clean groove like the other
one.</P>

<P>(listens to "Jerry Was a Race Car Driver" by Primus)
Debbie: Sailing the Seas of Cheese.  I like these guys
already, because if you asked me what my place in pop
music was - especially with the first album - it was the
cheesiest place you could imagine.  No one else ever
would've written "Shake Your Love," I can guarantee you.
Which song is this?
Paul Semel: "Jerry Was a Race Car Driver."
Debbie: This is cool too, I like this.  I'd go see them live if
I was feeling really out of it and I just wanted to clear my
head and bop around and not think.  If that makes any
sense."</P>

<P>(listens to "Super-Connected" by Belly)
Debbie: I don't like this.  I don't like to hear breathy voices
like that.  I like people who belt it out."</P>

<P>(listens to "Disposable Heroes" by Metallica)
Paul Semel: This would be for when you come home and
want to trash your apartment.
Debbie (laughing): Oh, that is what this is for.  This is cool,
though.  I could picture this being played on violin; I picture
these psycho violinists going "dit-dit-dit, ditty dit-dit-dit."  It's
got a classic rhythm.  (She starts to do those conductor moves.)
That's my impression.
Paul Semel: If you ever want a career in writing reviews, we
always need people to write about metal.
Debbie (laughing): I've read enough cynical reviews about
myself that I could write a good one.</P>

<P>(listens to "Double Dare" by Bauhaus)
Paul Semel: Did you ever go through a gothic phase?
Debbie: (shakes her head)
Paul Semel: No?  Come on!  You never got really
depressed and listened to Joy Division?
Debbie: 'Fraid not.  I've always been stable and happy.
Makes for a really boring article, sorry.  What is this?
This is not good at all.  This I'm just dying to turn off.</P>

<P>(listens to "But Anyway" by Blues Traveler)
Debbie: I know within the first eleven seconds that this
could prompt a trip to Tower Records.  I really like this.
(Starts to dance in her seat; prompting images of Debbie
Gibson doing that hippie dance in a tie-dye skirt).</P>
 
<P>Paul Semel: Some of these others you must know, so we
don't have to play them.  How about R.E.M.?
Debbie: I like them and respect them, but I don't find myself
listening to them.
Paul Semel: Black Sabbath?
Debbie: I can't say I've ever listened to Black Sabbath.
Paul Semel: Oh, we'll have to put them on. Nirvana?
Debbie: I like Nirvana.
Paul Semel: Hole?
Debbie: Not into Hole, I'm not a Courtney Love fan.  I
probably relate to her as much as she'd relate to me.</P>

<P>(listens to "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath" by Black Sabbath)
Debbie: This is kind of cool.  Y'know what I like about this?
This is kind of  like theatrical rock.  I think.  Y'think?  That
change was kind of dramatic...in the way Queen was dramatic.
Their music was very theatrical.</P>

<P>(listens to "Digging the Grave" by Faith No More)
Debbie: (starts to smile).
Paul Semel: You always start to grin when I put on the heavy
stuff.
Debbie: I know.  I like the energy.  I like the energy of this.
I have CD's like this at home that I've literally bought just out
of curiousity.</P>

<a name="Quotes from 1996"></a>
<P><U>From the <B>1996 Deborah Gibson calendar</B></U>:
"Never look at things like odds, competition, or the
 possibility you may fail.  Instead, know that you have
 something to offer and no one can do it quite like you!"</P>
<P>"Never feel you have to justify yourself to anyone.  Do
 what you need to do to feel good and you will be of better
 service to others."</P>
<P>"Pace yourself and you'll never have to want to retire."</P>
<P>"Sometimes a cynical journalist will assume that they
 can judge my personal happiness by a chart position or
 sales...  little do they know that during a sold out
 concert a relative passed away and at a time of particularly
 low sales my niece took her first steps. They haven't got
 a clue!"</P>
<P>"Do not let anyone be an obstacle in your journey to
 achieve your goals.  You must radiate so much belief in
 yourself that they simply have no other choice than to
 become a supporter."</P>
<P>"Success is about achieving personal goals and using
 your potential to the fullest.  It is a journey and no
 one else is on your particular path. How scary and
 invigorating!"</P>
<P>"Pavoratti says that fear is helpful so long as it
 doesn't cripple you. Use your fears to propel you to
 greater heights."</P>
<P>"Don't let people make you feel stupid about what
 you don't know.  Feel good about your own knowledge and
 unique experiences."</P>
<P>"Never begrudge someone else's success.  It has nothing
 to do with yours. You are only in competition with one
 person... you. There will always be someone in higher and
 lower power positions... Comparisons get you nowhere."</P>
<P>"I've always loved the audition process even though it
 is full of rejection. I choose to see every audition as a
 performance. I do my best knowing that if it's meant to be,
 it's meant to be!"</P>
<P>"I've learned to have a sense of humor about myself. Lord
 knows everyone else does!"</P>
<P>"Most success stories are not accidents. If you believe
 they are, you are probably afraid of success. Don't make
 excuses, just get down to business!"</P>
<P>"Follow your heart and your inner voice. They are
 always right."</P>
<P>"Think, plan, but more importantly, do!"</P>
<P>"Cherish every day, every show of love, and pray for
 those mean in spirit. This is a lesson I've just recently
 learned."</P>
<P>"Instead of 'jealous of' try 'inspired by'."</P>
<P>"Be generous and charitable. It makes everyone feel good."</P>
<P>"Celebrate your achievements without guilt and
 self-consciousness."</P>
<P>"Never look down on someone else.  You have no idea how
 far they've come and what it took to get there."</P>
<P>"Being a good person doesn't always get immediate
 attention in a world that thrives on scandal.  But,
 collectively it contributes to making the world a better
 place."</P>
<P>"There are no regrets, only lessons."</P>
<P>"You are an example, especially for young people.
 Choose to be a leader."</P>
<P>"Never downplay the importance of preparation and
 practice. They're much more reliable than luck!"</P>
<P>"Simplicity is beautiful."</P>

<P><U>From the <B>Los Angeles Daily News</B> (January 22, 1996)</U>:
"I love doing Rizzo because everyone outwardly associates me
 with Sandy. It's fun to surprise people. Even my family
 members who have come to see it have been quite surprised."</P>
<P>"I look at the girl playing Sandy and I go, 'Oh, my God,
 I know where you're at in your life because I was there
 five years ago."</P>
<P>"I've kind of graduated from playing Sandy from that
 standpoint. Sandy spends the whole show trying to prove
 that she's worthy of those other girls' approval, and I
 feel like I'm more of a leader of a gang coming into this
 show. It feels right that I'm not bouncing around and
 trying so hard. I can take a stronger stance even in my
 body language."</P>
<P>"I've been in school and people think that they know
 what was going on when I was on the road, let's say. And
 they have no idea, the levels of discipline it takes. You
 just kind of want to go, 'Look, leave me alone. You guys
 don't understand.'"</P>
<P>"Like Sandy, I've always been very outgoing, very friendly.
 People assume that means you're wimpy; they assume that
 means you can't put on a little black dress and surprise
 people, which is kind of what she does at teh end. So I
 think I've got bits and pieces of both in me."</P>
<P>"It's really interesting, because while all that stuff was
 going on, I was as aware as I could possibly have been and
 as grounded as I could have been. But now, I have this whole
 different perspective of that time in my life."</P>
<P>"It seems like that was such a whirlwind, I was lucky to
 have saved my sanity. I feel I have, which is, to me,
 probably my biggest accomplishment. People will think, 'Oh,
 that record sold 3 million copies, what an accomplishment.'
 But my accomplishment was more on the personal end of things."</P>
<P>"I go, 'Oh, my God, I thought I was singing like Barbra
 Streisand and I sounded like a munchkin.' I also kind of say,
 'Well, that sounds like a 16-year-old made that record.'
 Period. End of story."</P>
<P>"Even though the work is play, you have to have friendships,
 and I used to put those on hold a lot of times. This time of
 my life is more about growing up, and starting to find a
 balance because I want to have a family someday. I hope to
 juggle that and a career."</P>
<P>"There's something to be said for having a life. As a
 songwriter, you need life experiences to write about. I
 feel like I've just begun to accumulate that. I'm looking
 forward to seeing how that affects my writing in the future."</P> 

<P><U>From Deborah's <B>America On-Line</B> chat on March 27, 1996</U>:
"I think that the more negative angst-ridden music stems
 from someplace very real and it is the real-life situation's
 influence on music that I worry about more than the music's
 influence on a child's life. If a child has a great upbringing,
 they won't be easily swayed by pop-culture.  But it is also
 the responsibility of performers to be aware that some children
 may use their favorie musician as their role-model."</P>
<P>(about signing autographs)
"I do it happily so long as someone doesn't come up to me when
 I have a piece of lettuce hanging out of my mouth."</P>
<P>"I will continue doing melodic ballads and fun up-beats,
 but I think that there is another element in my writing
 that has developed lately. You'll have to wait and see what
 it is."</P>
<P>(about working with the Circle Jerks)
"The guy who mixed my album produced their album and they
 asked him if I'd sing backup vocals on 'I Want To Destroy You,'
 and from the title, it sounded like it was right up my alley!"</P>
<P>(about trying to shake the Tiffany/mall type image)
"Over time people's perceptions will change but it will be an
 uphill battle, like it always has been."</P>
<P>(about her age)
"Debbie looks great for 42 doesn't she? No No No......I'm 25."</P>
<P>"I always felt like a creator and communicator and music
 was always a natural outlet for me. It's hard to explain in
 words the way music makes me feel connected to so many
 people. I mean, music has us all staring at a small screen
 right now."</P>
<P>"Competition doesn't come into play for me in this
 industry anymore. It is simply about expressing myself."</P>
<P>"I have heard from many a radio program director that
 my music is 'Too Musical.' So I will call my music
 'Musical Music.'"</P>
<P>"I continue to do my thing with the same energy and
 enthusiasm I have always done it with. Two weeks ago I
 finished a national tour of <U>Grease</U>, so for me, it
 feels the same and I don't notice how bright the
 spotlight is and I never have."</P>
<P>(the most rewarding thing of Debbie's career)
"Well, of course, there's the personal fulfillment and
 realization of dreams. But even more than that music
 heals people and success gives people like me the power
 to help people less fortunate through charity work. Also,
 I love people and I get to meet TONS of 'em!!!"</P>
<P>(Deborah's closing statement)
"Now it's time to say goodbye to all my Fam-I-LY
 MIC see you real soon! KEY Why? Because we love you!!
 Thanks, guys this has been a BLAST!!!!!!"</P>

<P><U>From <B>Entertainment Tonight</B> (June 6, 1996)</U>:
"People just expect me to be this one thing. They don't
 realize that in theater you can be anything and that's
 the great thing about it."</P>

<P><U>From <B>People</B> magazine (June 17, 1996)</U>:
"When you start young, people find it hard to let you
 grow up and change. It takes a long time before you're
 known as an adult."</P>
<P>"Broadway was my first dream. I love the challenge and
 the tradition."</P>
<P>"If I've one major struggle, it's learning to relax.
 I really have a hard time doing nothing."</P>
<P>"People have the perception that I resorted to
 Broadway. Come on. Resorted to Broadway!"</P>

<P><U>From the <B>Seattle Times</B> (August 6, 1996)</U>:
(about being in a revival of <U>Funny Girl</U>)
"It's the same thing with any revival. There's always
somebody who came first. But you do the best job you can
and you don't worry about whether you're imitating someone
else. The last thing I want to do is play Streisand; she's
a hero of mine."</P>
<P>"I've been having trouble with major record labels, so
I'm making the album myself and it'll be sold out front of
the theaters where 'Funny Girl' is playing, and then I
expect to make a distribution deal."</P>
<P>"I've never liked 'Debbie,' but I'll be billed as 'Debbie'
for the tour. I'm just making a slow transition to 'Deborah'."</P>
<P>(when asked about <U>Funny Girl</U> making it to Broadway)
"That's (the producers') intention. But I've always believed
that nothing comes until it comes."</P>

<P><U>From <B>NBC Weekend Today</B> (September 15, 1996)</U>:
(about <U>Funny Girl</U>)
"Well, I'm gonna be playing Fanny Brice.  I'm gonna be on 
the road for nine months, and it's the first tour in over thirty
years."</P>
<P>"It's a lot of cities, but you know what, concert tours, 
you're in a different city every night, and this, at least we're
in some places between a week and four weeks, so..."</P>
<P>(about <U>Funny Girl</U> going to Broadway)
"It's the Pre-Broadway tour.  Hopefully in about a year."</P>
<P>(about a clip of Deborah rehearsing for <U>Funny Girl</U>)
"I am having a lot of fun.  I was just critiquing, you know, 
because we've only been rehearsing for like two weeks, and
we open in a week-and-a-half, so...  Oh, no, in two-and-a-half
weeks, sorry.  Um, so I was sitting there going, 'Oh, could do
that differently; that better'."</P> 
<P>(about comparing Deborah to Barbra Streisand)
"Well, I went and I did a lot of research on Fanny Brice,
and Fanny Brice is not Barbra Streisand, and I really wanna
just concentrate on portraying Fanny Brice.  And Barbara
Streisand obviously is one-of-a-kind.  You know, she is so
unique in the entertainment world, and I have my own unique
qualities to bring to it, so I don't really think about comparisons. 
When I'm working, I just concentrate on what I'm doing."</P>
<P>(about other roles Deborah has done in theatre)
"I played Eponine, which was a big thrill.  It was 
something I had originally auditioned for when I was about
fourteen before I ever started recording, so it was a long-time
dream.  And I played Sandy in London in the revival of 
<U>Grease</U>, and I also played Rizzo over here on tour."</P>
<P>(about playing Rizzo)
"Yeah, it was a blast, especially to kind of play opposite
what people think of me as, so it was a lot of fun."</P>
<P>"Over the summer I recorded a new album, and we
actually have our own label.  It's my own family-run label,
because it's such a personal thing, music.  And sometimes
you feel like you get lost in the shuffle if you don't do it
yourself.  So I have a new label called Espiritu Records, and
my album is just going to be called 'Deborah' because it's always
been my name; it's what I've prefered people to call me."</P>
<P>(about "Debbie" vs. "Deborah")
"My friends and family have always called me 'Deborah', and
I went with 'Debbie' initially just because it kind of suited what
I was doing.  It sounds like a young girl's name.  Not that I'm
over the hill, but...  This album is very personal, and I think 
it shows growth.  And I want to make that statement in the
title."</P>
<P>(about the name "Espiritu")
"Spirit.  You know, I mean it's just, um, I'm all about
spirit.  I think you can do anything if you have spirit; if you
have determination."</P>

<P><U>From Deborah's <B>Prodigy</B> chat on September 17, 1996:</U>
(asked about how many copies of the "Lost In Your Eyes" single were sold)
"I am not exactly sure, I think it went platinum, and I'm not sure
what the numbers are for a platinum single. Thanks for the
compliment!"</P>
<P>(about how Deborah's career started)
"I started in community theater and local talent shows. When
I started writing songs I went to local studios. Then I realized
I had ideas of my own and I set up my own studio. I released
a single to the clubs and after a year of promoting "Only in My
Dreams", things started to take off."</P>
<P>(asked about the name "Espiritu")
"Basically, I wanted to sum up what I was all about and I think
that Spirit sums it up because I think there are alot of people who
have talent, but I think you have to be enthusiastic about it and
do it with heart and I think that's what spirit is. For people who
don't know, that's the name of my independant label. It's the label
my new album is on."</P>
<P>(about how long Deborah intends to play Fanny Brice)
"I have to admit, even though it is very gruelling doing eight shows
a week, I feel I am making this role my own and I would have a
hard time turning this role over to anyone else! A normal
broadway contract is nine months, but I would love to do it for
much longer!"</P>
<P>(asked if there will be a 1997 D.G.I.F. convention)
"The office is still recovering from the '96 convention! But I'd
love to."</P>
<P>(about Deborah's appearance and song on "Weddings of a Lifetime")
"It was 'For Better or Worse', and it was kind of crazy,
performing to somebody elses family. To have the mayor present
as well! But the hosts, Catherine Hickland and Michael Lee
Knight [sic] are actually people who I have met before, so at least
I knew somebody! : ) The couple who were married came up to
me after the day was done and said they realized now what public
life was like. They kind of had a mini breakdown. It made me
realize that I am not crazy when sometimes I do the same."</P>
<P>(about when Deborah will tour for the next album)
"I'm not sure, I'm going on the road with <U>Funny Girl</U>
for nine months. It's supposed to go to broadway for a year, so
I'll be tied up for a while. Happily tied up. After that, I'd love to
do another full on tour, pull out all the stops."</P>
<P>(how Deborah feels about taking on the role of Fanny Brice)
"It feels amazing, in fact, just being asked that question gave me
goose bumps. Every day when I go into rehearsal I am reminded
of the history as we are dealing with the agents of deceased
writers and Bob Merrill (lyricist). I feel that it is one of the best
musicals there is, so I am absolutely thrilled."</P>
<P>(asked if Deborah was religious)
"I was raised Catholic going to church every Sunday. I believe in
some of what I learned. I also have developed philosophies of my
own. I would say that more than religious, I am spiritual."</P>
<P>(asked if Deborah sees any changes in her musical direction)
"When you don't have business people looking over your shoulder,
you are able to be more spontaneous and I feel a freshness and an
energy with a new album. And oddly enough, the direction of the
new album is along the lines of what the major labels were after me
to do for years and I kept trying to explain to them that you have to
allow yourself to progress naturally or else it seems forced and people
pick up on that."</P>
<P>(asked if Deborah will ever make a new album)
"I'm listening to mixes of the new album as we speak! It will be out
in November and is called 'Deborah'."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah what touring was like)
"Touring is gruelling, it's exciting, it's a great feeling to be able to
perform in cities that don't have as much of a choice of shows as
we do here in New York. The hardest part about touring is staying
healthy through weather changes, time changes...etc. I guess there
is something about it I love because I keep going out on the road."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah about her opinion of the current music scene)
"I prefer the more musical alternative music, like the Smashing
Pumpkins and Alanis. There is some rap that I like, like the more
storytelling kind, and more entertaining than negative. I feel the
music business has, over the past ten years, gotten to be less about
the music and more about politics and image which is very
disheartening to me."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah if she enjoyed playing Sandy or Rizzo more)
"I enjoyed them equally as much in the sense that they both came
at the right time in my life. Looking back I guess I would have to
say it was more fun to play the opposite of what people perceive
me to be, which was playing Rizzo."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah if she has any other "dream roles")
"Gypsy Rose Lee, Ava Perrone, Maria Von Trapp and Peter Pan.
I am also working writing my own musical based on a film script
called <U>Skirts</U>. That is probably my ultimate dream, to see
something I have composed on Broadway. The other day while I
was in my costume fitting for <U>Funny Girl</U>, I saw glimpses
of Norma Desmond in trying on Fanny Brice's more divaesque
costumes... but I could wait another thirty years for that. : )"</P>
<P>(about achieving chart success as an adolescent vs. as an adult)
"Oddly enough, it is easier for me to make good music now, but
harder to achieve chart success. I think as you get older you stop
jumping through hoops for publicity purposes and you gain more
integrity which can sometimes work against you publicly, but
personally it is the only way I live."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah if she was bothered by fans coming up to her)
"No, in fact, the other night, I was out in the village with my
boyfriend, and we have very limited time together at the moment
because I am going on tour. Someone who had been at the
convention came up and asked if they could take a picture, which
was fine with me because she was very polite and not intrusive and
respected my private life. However, there was one time where
someone followed me into a restroom and stuck a piece of paper
under the stall with a pen. That definitely was not cool."</P>
<P>(about the power of music)
"Wow, the power of music! It never ceases to amaze me. I have
heard some very personal stories about how a song that may seem
ridiculous or sappy to one person affects somebody's life in a
profound way."</P>
<P>(asked if Deborah went to college)
"No, I didn't. I definitely got a hands on education. I think college is
great for some professions, but as far as performing goes, learning
by doing is the best way."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah about what's important in today's entertainment world)
"For some strange reason, packaging has become more important,
which to me, is just awful. But I have met enough people who can
see through all that to make what I do so worthwhile."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah what her biggest inspiration is for writing songs)
"It varies from song to song. Sometimes it stems from a deeply
personal place, like a song I am listening to right now, off the
upcoming album called 'I Will Let You Go'. Other times I base a
song around a catch phrase or general theme. Other times my life
is so boring I have to make stuff up!"</P>
<P>(about why Deborah no longer wants to go by "Debbie")
"I've actually always referred to myself as Deborah but went with
Debbie because people seemed to be uncomfortable calling such a
young girl such a formal name. Now I am sick of it and want people
to call me by my real name."</P>
<P>(asked about Deborah's views on abortion)
"Personally, I don't think I could ever have one. However, there have
been people close to me who have been in situations that
unfortunately led to the decision to have an abortion and I fully
supported it because of their circumstances. As I said, I would have a
hard time with it, but I definitely believe in choice."</P>
<P>(asked Deborah if it was difficult to separate the two images of her)
"I certainly have no problem with it because I have lived with
myself through the years. But I do realize other people's difficulty. It's
like my cousin Albert who is 19 and I still think of him as being 10.
But I think that through musical progression and through staying in the
public eye, people become familiar with your changes and growths."</P>
<P>(about what artists Deborah draws inspiration from)
"Always Billy Joel and Elton John. In the theatrical world, Barbra
Streisand, Bette Midler and Patty Lupone. Currently in my CD player
is Luis Miguel, Counting Crows and the soundtrack from Rent. I like
good music in general, no matter what the style."</P>
<P>(Deborah's closing remarks)
"Thank you all, I'm sorry I didn't get to answer every question, but it
is time to put the vocal chords to bed. No, that is not me typing, I'm
speaking to a typist! I'm looking forward to seeing you guys when I hit
the road next week with <U>Funny Girl</U>. Good Night!"</P>

<P><U>From <B>Playbill Online</B> (September 19, 1996)</U>:
(asked how it feels to follow in Barbra Streisand's footsteps)
"When you have a ten-hour rehearsal day, you're just not thinking
about that.  I love and admire Barbra Streisand enormously, but I'm
not intimidated.  I know I'm right for this role."</P>
<P>(asked about stage fright)
"I do vocal exercises and lots of breathing.  You can't let it affect you,
I mean, you might have had a horrible breakup, a relative passes away,
you still have to come onstage and make people happy and laugh." </P>
<P>(asked about <U>Funny Girl</U>'s moral)
"You're stronger than you think you are.  Especially if you use your
strength in a positive way.  Fanny uses her dramatic flair to get what
she wants -- even if it isn't always what's best for her."</P> 
<P>(asked if the character of Fanny Brice made the right choices)
"Fanny probably should have married Eddie, but there are
things you can't explain.  And she's in love."</P>
<P>(about how singing on stage isn't too different from recording pop records)
"The hard part is going from a beautiful ballad and then having
to do a big ensemble number, and then back again."</P>
<P>(about whether or not Fanny's Jewishness presented a problem)
"I'm Italian.  We eat a lot and talk with our hands."</P>

<P><U>From <B>USA Today</B> (September 30, 1996)</U>:
"I'd heard about a possible revival about four years ago, and the day I
auditioned (for the show's composer, Jule Styne), I broke out in hives.
I don't think I was fully ready."</P>
<P>"Being a concert artist has helped me. Brice was a solo artist,
growing up on the road and dealing with personal hardships and
10 minutes later facing an audience."</P>
<P>(about how Deborah was criticized for her looks when she was younger)
"But when I was a kid and going to commercial auditions and such,
they'd say, 'You've got a lisp and crooked nose. Get those fixed.' I'm
not a beauty queen. I don't have a dancer's body. I've always felt quirkier.
Of course, Fanny felt downright ugly."</P>
<P>"In the midst of eight shows a week I can't do a concert, but I'll
be doing all the morning shows (for nine months), and it takes that long
to build up awareness of an album."</P>

<P><U>From the <B>Beaver County Times</B> (September 30, 1996)</U>:
"My chief concern was making a connection with Fanny when she was
older and suffering because of another divorce in a string of unsuccessful
marriages.  I've had some boy-girl breakups, but nothing like hers.  I've
never been married.  I have no children.  I had to turn to friends who were
willing to tell me their experiences so that I could try to make an inner
connection with the pain."</P>
<P>(about watching the movie <U>Funny Girl</U> with Barbra Streisand)
"I watched the movie four times.  She is fabulous, but I knew I had
to create my own characterization, not to try to copy her."</P>
<P>"My research helped to make Fanny real to me and then I began to
make the role my own.  I keep in mind that even though the musical
depicts her life, it's a musical, not 'This is Your Life.' "</P>

<P><U>From the <B>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</B> (October 1, 1996)</U>:
"Barbara Streisand doesn't cross my mind a lot when I'm in rehearsal 
concentrating on what I'm doing.  I mean, I knew the  production was
gonna happen.  Someone was gonna be up there playing Fanny Brice
and I would have absolutely kicked myself if it wasn't me,  'cause I've
wanted to do it forever.  It's great that for a lot of new  people, I can be
Fanny."</P>
<P>"I made up my mind that I didn't want to do a Barbra Streisand 
impersonation, because that's obviously only one of her.  And she's
pretty amazing."</P>
<P>(about researching for her role as Fanny Brice)
"I spent many hours at the Museum of Television and Radio pulling
up clips of sketches."</P>
<P>(about the parallel between Deborah Gibson and Fanny Brice)
"She used to worm her way into auditions, which I would do all the
time.  It would come to the 10 finalists for a role and I'd say to my
mom, 'They must have made a mistake.  I'm just gonna go sneak into 
the group.'  I always felt like if I had the chance for them to really 
seriously listen to me, I could do it." </P>
<P>"One minute you're in tears, and the next minute you're on stage
making people laugh.  That, I think, is the part I understand most 
of all."</P>
<P>(about when Deborah for Jule Styne for <U>Funny Girl</U>)
"That was about four years ago.  I never got nervous.  My 
adrenaline always goes haywire, but I never get scared.  Well,
that would be the one and only day in my whole life I broke out
in hives.  I was so aware of the fact I was in the presence of a legend.
I had done 'Gypsy' several times as a kid, and grew up listening to
the music."</P>
<P>"I had my Equity card before I had my first record deal.  As 
a kid, I was 'Annie'-obsessed.  I wanted to be Annie in the worst way.  
In fact, if I have one regret in life, it's that I'm too old to play Annie."</P>
<P>(about Deborah's involvement in theatre from ages 5 to 15)
"I'd be doing a children's show during the day and then a college
production at night."</P>
<P>(about putting theatre on hold for a recording career)
"It was heartbreaking to me, to have to put it on hold.  So when the
opportunity came up later to do 'Les Miz,' I thought, 'Well great,
I'm finally going to get to strike a balance between the two'."</P>
<P>(about the success of Deborah's early recording career)
"For the amount of whirlwind activity I had just been through to
try and get those songs there, I felt like I was supposed to be
happening at that point."</P>
<P>(about how the kids at school reacted to Deborah's success)
"My friends, who knew how hard I'd been working on it,
understood completely.  They were like, 'OK, that's supposed to
be happening, because she gave up going to this football game and
this party.'  They knew I was demo-ing every night after school."</P>
<P>(about the kids who resented Deborah's success)
"Kids would say, 'You think you're so great.'  And in my head,
I'm thinking I didn't do anything to them, I didn't say anything
to them that would have led them to believe that."</P>
<P>(about working with the Circle Jerks on "I Wanna Destroy You")
"Niko Bolas, who mixed my album, was producing their album and
they were like, 'We think she's cool.  Do you think she would ever come
and sing with us?'  So I just thought it would be a hoot."</P>
<P>(about being called Deborah)
"It's funny, because I always preferred to be called Deborah and other 
people had a very difficult time calling such a young girl what they 
considered to be such a formal name.  So I kind of went with it, 
thinking we'll make everyone else feel comfortable.  But I'm really 
sick of it now.  My name is Deborah, my friends and family have always 
called me Deborah."</P>
<P>(about being labeled as a "Renaissance Teen")
"That's cool.  That's all a part of my life and what I've done.  It's not 
like I'm putting something terrible behind me."</P>
<P>(what Deborah thinks about when she hears her older recordings)
"I can't say that I listen to them too often.  But when I do happen to 
hear them, I kind of marvel at how munchkin-y my voice sounded 
at the time.  But it sounds like what was going on in Top 40 at the 
time.  The '80s music scene was very cool because you could be as
cheesy as you wanted to be, and I am cheesy.  I admit it."</P>

<P><U>Deborah's message on the inside of the "Sneak Preview" CD</U>:
"The four songs on this sampler are from the forthcoming album
entitled 'Deborah.'  This title is a reflection of how I feel my life as
a performer and my personal life truly come together through this
music.  As much as major label success initially was a big part of
what I did, I've always preferred a 'grass-roots' approach to
promoting albums.  My dad put countless amounts of flyers in
co-workers mailboxes to get 'Only In My Dreams' off the ground
in 1986.  And, my family run management company headed by
my mother -- Diane, has truly been the foundation of what I've
done for the past ten years.  When nobody else 'got it,' Gibson 
Productions was tireless when it came to getting my music heard.
Now it is time for that support to be officially recognized and I 
proudly show my belief in my 'team' by releasing this next album
on Espiritu Records, an extension of Gibson productions.  Music
is a truly personal thing.  It involves putting everything you are on
the line.  But its healing powers are one of the greatest miracles on 
earth.  I hope you enjoy the songs featured.  Three are originals,
and 'Don't Rain On My Parade' was of course written by Bob Merrill
and the late, great Jule Styne--lyricists and composers of FUNNY
GIRL.  I embark on this, my fourth professional theatre experience
(and my 'dream role' I might add!!), and my sixth album with wide-eyed
enthusiasm and much gratitude for the opportunity to be able to share
this piece of my soul with all of you..."</P>

<P><U>From the <B>Richmond Times-Dispatch</B> (October 6, 1996)</U>:
(about how much Deborah wanted to be in <I>Funny Girl</I>)
''I would have done this show anywhere for any amount of
money.''</P>
<P>''This is my dream role because there are so many
similarities between Fanny Brice and myself.  We both started
quite young. She used to do shows in her alley on the Lower
East Side of Manhattan. I used to do shows in my back yard
on Long Island. She used to talk her way into talent shows and
auditions. I would do the same.  I absolutely hope my personal
life doesn't suffer the way hers did.  Up to now, my choices in
men have been better."</P>
<P>(if Deborah had to choose between theater and recording)
''I can't answer that because I don't have to choose.  One keeps
me sane enough to do the other.  I'm a creative person. I have
to get that creativity out of my system by writing and producing
and recording, but I love the family feeling of being part of a
cast. I don't love living in hotels, but I do love the idea of
bringing theater to the people.''</P>
<P>(how often she thinks of Barbra Streisand when playing Fanny)
''The only time I ever think of Barbra Streisand is when people
ask me.  My philosophy is that somebody has to bring 'Funny
Girl' to a '90s audience, so why not me?  I'm making musical
and acting choices based on my own experience of what I know
to be true in show business. I would never do a Barbra Streisand
riff if it didn't come from somewhere deep in me."</P>
<P>(about <I>Funny Girl</I> going to Broadway)
''Broadway is a hope.  The only indication this might go to
Broadway is that they have a cut-off point on the tour. I'm
signed at the moment for nine months with the option of
doing this on Broadway.''</P>
<P>(about Deborah's voice) 
''I'm constantly learning to sing in new ways for every project
I do.  It was more of a stretch to take the theatrical sound out
of my voice to record. I'm a natural belter.''</P>
<P>(about <I>Skirts</I>) 
''I'm composing my own musical, and I've already done basic
arrangements and preliminary recordings of 10 songs.  It's
called 'Skirts,' and it takes place at the New York World's Fair
in 1964.  It's a combination of 'Moonstruck' and 'West Side
Story.' It involves family life and racial tensions, and music and
dance are key elements.  Oddly enough I'd be a good choice for
the lead role, a teen-aged girl who ends up being a motivating
force through difficult circumstances in many people's lives.
We have producers interested in this, and I'm waiting for the
book writers."</P>
<P>''I just have a lot of creative energy I haven't used.  I have
a fiery side. I relate to every word in that 'Funny Girl' song,
'Don't Rain on My Parade.' ''</P> 

<a name="Quotes from 1997"></a>
<P><U>From Rolling Stone Online Q&A (February 10, 1997)</U>:
(asked about the "overall vibe" of her latest album)
"This album is a little more versatile. But it still somehow all fits
together. I'd say the biggest difference is that it was done really
quickly and the only other album I ever did that was done really
quickly was my first album. So, in a lot of ways, it has that
peppy energy of a debut album. When I listen to it, that's one
of the things that hits me. I think it's a spontaneous album, and
it's got a lot of raw energy."</P>

<P>(why Deborah collaborated on this album)
"It was a pleasure to put that stuff on the album, because it
wasn't somebody forcing me to co-write -- saying, "Ooh,
we need to plot and plan your next move, so why don't you
co-write with Babyface or Prince." I've heard all those
suggestions before, and I took them almost as insults just
because I felt like, "All right, you guys are much more
concerned with me having a hit then creatively sticking to
my guns.""</P>

<P>(what the album says where Deborah is at personally and professionally)
"I just think it's the next step. I think that it says I'm still sticking to
the concept that trends come around. This isn't me saying, "Gee,
alternative's happening at this moment, so let me do that just to
have a hit." I think it's a statement about my integrity and my belief
in real music."</P>

<P>(what music Deborah is listening to now)
"I listen to bizarre things at bizarre times. Like I just got the first
Counting Crows album. Now I listen to it religiously, and I
jam out on the piano with it. In fact, on the road for "Funny
Girl," people would pass by my dressing room and stick
their heads in, like, "What's going on?" It sounded like a
full-on jam session going on. And I just got sent this whole
package of everything Liberace ever recorded. Rusted
Root -- I do Afro-Brazilian dancing to Rusted Root. But I
don't think that's leaving my living room."

<P>(Deborah's hopes for the album's success)
"My hopes are that whoever is meant to hear it and
whoever it's going to affect gets to hear it. Of course,
you always hope that everyone in the whole world can
hear it and form an unbiased opinion on it, but I don't
know how realistic that is at this point."</P>

<P>(which of her songs Deborah would like The Smashing Pumpkins to cover)
"I'd love to hear the Smashing Pumpkins singing ... oh, this is
just endless... I mean, the obvious would probably be
"Electric Youth." I'd love to hear them do a thrashy,
high-energy version of "Electric Youth." They're quite
young, aren't they?"</P>

<P>(why she finally chose to go by Deborah professionally)
"When I called myself Debbie initially, it was because
everyone else was uncomfortable calling me Deborah. So
I went, "Well, let me make everyone feel comfortable." But
I didn't feel comfortable because anyone who's ever known
me has always called me Deborah. It's kind of where I feel
I've reached my limit and I want to say, 'You know what?
My name is Deborah." I just feel it's more representative of
what I'm doing now, and the whole thing that goes along with
getting older, being more comfortable with yourself."</P>

<P>(the funniest thing anyone has ever said to Deborah)
"Hmm ... I can think of a lot of harsh things. You know what
had to be the funniest thing? The Beavis and Butt-Head thing.
They were talking about who would win in a fight -- me or
Tiffany. They said I'd kick her butt. I thought it was very funny."</P>

<P>(difference between recording for her own label and a major label)
"Recording this album is, in a lot of ways, like recording my
very first album because I don't have anybody looking over my
shoulder. I think that's the way music is supposed to be made.
For better or worse, you should just do what you're doing. It was
great because I got to be really spontaneous with it, and the album
kind of made itself. When I was most successful with my records
was when nobody was looking over my shoulder. I mean, I
brought my first two albums to Atlantic [Records] fully done.
They had nothing to say about what I did, who I worked with,
how I worked. I remember walking into Atlantic with a bag full
of tapes with each final mix on a different tape and dumping the
bag on the table and saying, "Here's my album.""</P>

<P>(how she feels about Alanis Morissette being referred as the
"Canadian Debbie Gibson)
"I guess that initially she was, in the sense that she did
dance/pop music and she had cheesy big hair, which I had
for about eight months, and the fact that she did "You Can't
Do That on Television," which is something I definitely
would've done. It's right up my alley. But at this point, we are
so different, oh my god. She's amazing at what she does, but
we're night and day. I've held on to my traditional performer
roots, and she's definitely abandoned them for doing her thing.
Actually, I had gone to see her concert, and she had a couple
of crew people back there who were on power trips and
were very obnoxious to me. So I left before I met her. That
disappointed me about Alanis, and whether or not she was
aware that they were rude, my philosophy is always who you
surround yourself with is kind of what you represent. So that
was a strike against Alanis for me."</P>

<P>(what people should think when they hear the name "Deborah Gibson")
"What they do think and what they should think are
definitely two very different things. I would think that they
should think good songwriter and strong live performer.
People should also think human being. I'm a 26-year-old
young woman who's actually had a lot of very unique
experiences in my life. I actually have a lot to say to people
who want to listen. But unfortunately, the media and pop
culture creates very one-dimensional pictures of people."</P>

<P>(what Deborah thinks of "Out Of The Blue" and "Electric Youth")
"I think that I sound like I'm on helium. It takes me back
to that time. It takes me back to seeing girls with their jeans
ripped, with faces on the knees, and the black hats and living
in Merrick. It's funny though, in no way will I ever be
ashamed of those records, which is what a lot of people
always think will happen. It's part of my history and it's why
people know my name."</P>

<P><U>From Deborah's America On-Line Chat (February 10, 1997)</U>:
(asked about the advantages and drawbacks of being successful as
a teenager)
"Well, there are many of each!  It was great to start young,
because when you're young and you don't have to think
about things like paying the rent, you're free to be creative...
and you don't quite know what th word stress means.
One of the drawbacks is just constantly fighting perceptions...
A lot of people think three years have passed when in fact
it's been ten years!  But I wouldn't go back for anything....
I'm very glad I started when I did."</P>

<P>(what inspired her write songs at such a young age)
"The first song I wrote was when I was five years old
and I think it was about some deep hidden fear I had
about starting kindergarten! I think I just love the idea of
knowing that I was going to be singing something for
people, even if it was my familiy in the living room,
knowing that it was something they had never heard
before.  It's like, writing songs is kind of like you have
a secret to share with people.  I like that."</P>

<P>(asked if <I>Funny Girl</I> would be back on tour in the fall)
"I don't know!  Hound your local promoters!  I feel like
even if it doesn't, that role is mine to play for the next
ten years if I want to. I feel like for some reason the
universe feels like it shouldn't be on the road now but I
feel like it will happen some time in the next few years."</P>

<P>(asked if she was interested in a movie career)
"Actually... there was a movie project that I was
supposed to do in 1989 called SKIRTS. It fell
through the cracks when Sony took over Columbia,
but I've turned it into a musical for the stage. I'm
working on it with Kenny Ortega.  A movie career
does interest me, but I don't feel I'm ready yet,
because I have so much hyper energy, and films are
so much about waiting and focusing and calm energy.
But I never turn down an audition!"</P>

<P>(asked what her tour plans are)
"I'm going to be doing some dates in March and April,
possibly at Billboard Live in L.A. and Westbury
Music Fair in Long Island and I'd LOVE to do a stint
at Rainbow and Stars.  I feel like a one-woman-show
type of performer right now.  I still love pop concert
energy, but my kind of music doesn't lend itself to
mosh pits. I kind of like classier venues."</P>

<P>(asked who she'd like to sing a duet with and who she'd
like to write a song with)
"I'll answer the 2nd part first: I'd LOVE to write with Billy
Joel.  He has been my favorite since I was 8 years old.
This is going to sound bizarre... but Patty LaPone is one
of my favorite singers, and I would kill to work with her
in some way, especially on stage in the theater.  That
would be a big thrill.  Oh, I'd love to sing with Luis Miguel."</P>

<P>(asked if there was ever a time in her career when she
wanted to give up)
"This business can be very frustrating at times. But never
in a million years would I give up what I do. Whenever
obstacles come into play, I just go back to basics, and
sing in my living room and remind myself of why I do
this. It's very easy to let the business end of things get
to you.  One obstacle that I have overcome is being
on major labels. It's great when the chips are up and
things are "easy" for the record company, but I learned
about politics and what happens when a record
company comes up against a bit of resistance the hard
way.  As a result, a lot of my music didn't get the
promotion I feel it deserved.  So my mom and I started
our own label.  Just today I was in Tower Records in
Boston and the manager said "good for you, don't get
a distributor, nine out of ten times an indy artist gets a
distributor and we never hear from them again!" So I
guess it's the the old "if you want something done
right, you have to do it yourself" thing."</P>

<P>(asked when the new CD would be coming out)
"It's out now in some markets, but will be everywhere
in March.  You can get it now at Tower Records in
NY and Boston and a few places in California.  We
have listening stations and window displays, and
those were things that we were told couldn't be done."</P>

<P>(asked what advice she'd give to a teenager who wants
to get into show business)
"Just be super persistant.  Always train-- never think
you're above taking lessons or classes.  Really believe
you have something to offer.  People always try to talk
about stories of failure, instead of stories of success....
there are thousands of roles and auditions going on
constantly, and someone has to be in the shows and
record the music on the radio every day! I like to
focus on the positive. So like I said, training,
discipline, self-motivation.  It's an emotional field, and
if you believe in what you're doing, it's the only field to
be in."</P>

<P>(asked if she liked being in <I>Les Miserables</I> or in <I>Grease</I> better)
"I would say Les Miz was more about discipline, but
because it was a long-time dream of mine to be in, it
was very rewarding. HOWEVER, after 100
performances or so of it, it was great to sing rama lama
lama ding dong.  I don't really have a favorite becuase
they really are opposites.  I can say at this point that I've
had enough Grease in my life to last a lifetime.  I would
love to play Fontaine in Les Miz!"</P>

<P>(asked if she ever talks to Tiffany "now a days")
"I haven't spoken to Tiff in years!  We're not really
traveling in the same circuit like we used to be...
Now that there's no more American Bandstand and
Top of the Pops, I never see her.  I think she's
married and with a baby, so if anyone out there
knows her, send her my regards!"</P>

<P>(asked if she's still friends with Buddy Casimano)
"I am friends with Buddy.  For those who don't
know him, he is someone I went to high school
with, and he danced with me from my first club date
to Madison Square Garden.  I just saw him in Chicago
recently... he was there doing a Christmas show with
Sandy Duncan.  Sandy actually broke his nose in
rehearsal!  They were doing a lift and, well, she broke
his nose.  But yes, I do still talk to him."</P>

<P>(asked why she didn't produce any songs on the new album and
why she didn't play piano or keyboards much)
"Well I was kind of in a time crunch. I was going on
the road with Funny Girl for what I thought would have
been nine months, and I wanted to get the music heard.
It was a case of feeling that getting my melody and
lyrics and voice was the most important thing at the time.
I did oversee the produciton of the entire album.  The
same with the piano and keyboards -- there were some
instances where someone else put down a reference
piano and I ended up loving it."</P>

<P>(asked if she thinks <I>Funny Girl</I>'s hiatus would affect her
future work)
"Well, it opens up the opportunity for me to promote the new
album more thoroughly."</P>

<P>(asked if she uses her own relationships now as a basis for her songs)
"Yes, I do.  However, my personal life isn't always that
amazingly exciting, so a lot of times, I just make things up!"</P>

<P>(asked if she is dating now)
"I am. I've actually been with the same guy for almost
two years.  It's Chris Bruno; he plays Michael Delaney
on All My Children."</P>

<P>(asked if she's met Susan Lucci)
"I saw her once at the studio in the ladies room...she
had curlers in her hair and looked great.  I didn't
introduce myself though. I think the ladies room is
an inappropriate place to hassle someone famous!"</P>

<P>(asked what inspired the song "Moonchild")
"I wrote that song with a woman named Joyce Swinea.
We wrote it in my dressing room in the Dominion
Theater in London while I was doing Grease. It's really
just an abstract song that it to be left to your
interpretation.  It was about singing what came to mind,
and playing around on the piano--it wasn't a real life
thing that inspired it."</P>

<P>(the strangest question a fan ever asked her)
"I've had people ask me for psychological advice--
literally, things that make me say "I think you should
ask your therapist!" Things like, should I seek
revenge on this person that kind of stuff."</P>

<P>(asked if she plans to put out any more Smart Packs)
"Smart packs?! What's a smart pack? Is that like a
compliation thing or something?"</P>

<P>(asked if she and her boyfriend Chris Bruno would ever
work together)
"We've talked about possibly wanting to do a play
together, or collaborating on a film but with him possibly
writing or producing and me doing the score.  So we would
like to work together in some way, shape or form."</P>

<P>(asked why she thinks the ballad has lost favor today to
rhythmic dance music)
"I think that people are afraid to let themselves feel. It's
interesting being on stage in a show like Les Miz; instead
of people crying, you'd always hear a lot of coughing
during death scenes. I think people are afraid to be
vulnerable.  They think it's a sign of weakness instead of
strength. People are more in tune with their angst-ridden
side while in fact, a melodic ballad might make them face
that there is good in the world.  It's like people feel they
have to have an edge.  Personally, I say, give me a sappy
ballad any day!"</P>


<P>(asked if she writes her owns songs and how she feels about
artists writing their own material)
"I do write my own songs, I don't think that it's fair to
say that an artist who doesn't write has less credibility
than someone who does.  (That was something that always
bummed me out about me and Tiffany).  I think if a singer
has something to offer and can hook up with a writer who
shares their creative vision, that's great. I like singers who
steer their own careers, even if they don't write -- as
opposed to singers who will sing anything handed to them."</P>

<P>(asked if she's written much poetry)
"I write some. Melodies usually pop into my head at the
same time, so most things end up in song form."</P>

<P>(asked what she listens to for inspiration)
"There's a song on my new CD called "Butterflies Are
Free," that I would say was inspired by Sandy Patti,
because I like her inspirational gospel music.  I also like
classical music for inspiration, I think it has a lot in
common with the pop music of today."</P>

<P>(asked if she goes on the Internet a lot to see the web pages
devoted to her)
"I have looked a few times but to tell you the truth,
sometimes it freaks me out to think that people are out there
talking about me!  So often I pretend the net doesn't exist.
It almost makes me feel abnormal, and I kind of pride
myself on being normal! I'm a late bloomer, and I'm that way
with the net also, it's taken me a while to get used to the
whole thing."</P>

<P>(asked when she will be releasing a single from the new album)
"At the moment I'm concentrating on getting the album out
to the people without relying on the radio stations to break
it open.  Just because, radio stations don't really like to go
out on a limb I've found.  To play alternative music isn't going
out on a limb, even though somewhere along the line they
thought it was. To really go out there would be to play
my stuff, just because of the whole perception that goes along
with my name. So we're going in the back door with my album.
I would like to eventually release a single to radio but I'm holding
off on that for a while."</P>

<P>(asked if any more video compilations would be released)
"Well... that's a good question. Because I've switched labels a
couple of times, different labels own different rights to
videos so that can be complicated."</P>

<P>(asked how she comes up the material for her songs)
"Basically, I write songs like people write journal entries.
It's like a very personal and constant thing in my life. The
ideas come from observation as well as experience. As I
mentioned earlier, some of it is just fiction. Sometimes it
starts with a melody idea, other times with a sentiment I
want to express. When I feel that there are enough songs
that I feel strongly about, I go back into the studio."</P>

<P>(asked what it was like to work with the Circle Jerks)
"It was definitely strange recording with a bunch of guys who
could not get their act together enough to order lunch in the
studio!  It was pretty crazy, especially performing with them
live.  I recorded a song with them called I Want to Destroy
You and I thought, why the heck not?  I enjoyed the fact
that I got to "rock out" a bit."</P>

<P>(asked about the significance of a ring she's worn a lot)
"It's actually a pink ring, and it's ceramic, and it has the sun
on it.  I wear it facing out, and call it my "spread sunshine
ring"  Maybe three days in the four years I've owned it, I've
had to face it in toward myself because I needed the energy.
I'm a creature of habit and I feel like I'm going to jinx myself
if I don't leave the house without the ring on."</P>

<P>(asked if she'd ever consider a boxing match with Tiffany)
"Not really, I'm not the violent type. BUT I think there was a
Mojo Nixon video where two people playing us were mud
wrestling. I think it was Winona Ryder playing me.  I have a
big sense of humor about myself and you can't do much
that would jar me, I think!"</P>

<P>(asked what's been the most rewarding experience of her career
to date)
"Two things come to mind... One is being able to affect
people on a large scale, and being able to be involved with
charities and make a difference by doing something I love to
do.  The other is that one of the fringe benefits that comes to
mind-- Being able to see Barbra Streisand at Madison Square
Garden and having a backstage pass, but not using it because
I had my own show the next day and I had to go home and
rest my voice!  I kind of felt empowered in some sick,
deranged way."</P>

<P>(asked what her favorite charities are)
"Starlight Foundation and Make a Wish... those are
charities that grant wishes to terminally ill kids. Through
the years, many kids have wished to meet me, and
that's very touching. Special Olympics is another, and
I've actually been involved with them since I was 12.
To be involved on a local level and also being able
to be involved in a worldwide scale is pretty exciting.
There's a new organiztion, called Music Cares, which
is a drug intervention program.  If it's known that a
musician is struggling on the road with drugs, the
organization will send someone out to help them
one-on-one, I think that's pretty amazing.
Pediatric AIDS organziations, and more, there are
just so many charities that I'm involved with."</P>

<P>(asked if there will be another convention and if the album will
be released in Europe)
"The new album will be out there, I don't have a date yet.
We haven't planned a convention yet. (For those who
don't know, I had a fan club convention last year and it
was a hoot! There were people from all over the world
and it was a two-day convention.)  My younger sister
Denise was making fun of me because she said it was like
a big garage sale... we had a bunch of merchandise and
donated a lot of the money to charity.  It was like this big
shrine to Debbie, and hilarious, but at the end of the two
days, I did a two-and-a-half hour concert which was a lot
of fun. I'd like to do another one soon but I think my office
is still recovering from last year!"</P>

<P>(asked if the House of Blues concert would be released on her
label)
"Hmmm!  There is a bootleg floating around called "Out at
the Blues" but we didn't really make a proper recording of it....
I would love to do a live concert in the future because I feel
it's definitely one of my strong points, and being part of an
era that was so much about videos and dancing, it's like
people think that anyone who recorded in the 80s doesn't
know how to perform live though that's my forte. I might
wait until I get to play Carnege Hall, where the acoustics are
perfect!"</P>

<P>(asked if she plans to do more sexier adult material now)
"I have to laugh at that at the moment because I'm in
pinstriped men's PJs and a top with cows on it!  I love
songs that are sexy but not in a blatant way.  You do
get more in touch with your sexuality as you get older."</P>

<P>(asked if she's auditioned for any plays recently)
"Oh boy! that's a loaded question, because I just
auditioned for Rent last week, to play Maureen.  I
haven't heard anything yet, but I had a great time at the
audition, and I feel I did a really good job with it and
I would love to play that role in the future.  It's just a
wacky role!  I'm actually in Boston with a friend who is
in Rent and I saw it last night for the fourth time. I love it!"</P>

<P>(asked which Smashing Pumpkins song she'd like to cover)
"There are so many good ones, it's hard to choose!  My
boyfriend is constantly saying, great melodies, if only they
didn't sing like that."</P>

<P>(asked about her piano teacher on Long Island)
"Thanks, my teacher was Morton Estrin in Hecksville.
And if you're a serious student, I'm sure he'll be happy
to hear from you.  He's an ingenius teacher. He used
to sit across the room in what he called "his throne"
and without even seeing your hands on the piano he
could tell what note and what measure was wrong, and
what note it should be."</P>

<P>(asked what her favorite songs are on the new album)
"One is "Butterflies Are Free," which I actually just
performed on the Gordon Elliot show.  It was a show
about child prodigies, and I was there supposedly
as a shining example or something.  These kids were
amazing -- they were in college at the age of nine.
Anyway, back to the subject, I didn't write it but I love
"Don't Rain On My Parade" from Funny Girl is certainly
a favorite."</P>

<P>(Deborah's last comments before the end of the chat)
"Thank you all for a fun-filled hour!  Please have a happy
Valentine's Day and make sure you play "Lost In Your
Eyes" over and over again to get your special someone in
the mood.  Thank you!  And remember, I'm "Forever Your
Girl" -- OOPS! Wrong artist!  And thanks to my friend Ray
for the delicious pasta I wish I could share with you all now!"</P>

<title>Deborah Gibson Megamixes</title>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 link=#00008b vlink=#ff1493 alink=#8b0000>
<center><img src="dg.jpg" alt="[Deborah Gibson Megamixes]"></center>
<hr>
<p>So far, my husband and I have come up with two Deborah Gibson megamixes. They 
used to be housed on this page, but they've been taking up too much disk space on this 
account. However, I have left the descriptions of the two mixes on this page, and will make 
the mixes available via e-mail to anyone who requests them.  If you would like to hear 
either one of the megamixes listed below, you can write to either
<a href="http://olivier.dementia.org/~jem">Lesley Aeschliman</a> or 
<a href="http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis">Daniel Aeschliman</a> to request them.</p>
<hr size=7>
<p>The first mix began on the night of Friday, September 13th, when Lesley (while 
playing with a sound editing program on her computer) put together <I>Only In My 
Dreams</I> and <I>Electric Youth</I>.  The segueway worked rather well, so it was 
decided to continue from there.</p>
<p>After restarting from the beginning, this mix was completed on Saturday, September 
14th.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first mix includes the following songs:<br>
<center><table>
<ul>
<tr><td><li>Only In My Dreams</td><td><li>Out Of The Blue</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Electric Youth</td><td><li>Should've Been The One</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>One Step Ahead</td><td><li>Fallen Angel</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Shake Your Love</td><td><li>Another Brick Falls</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>It Must've Been My Boy</td><td><li>Shock Your Mama</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Dontcha Want Me Now?</td><td><li>Tear Down These Walls</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><li>Free Me</td></tr>
</ul>
</table></center>
<p>This file is an 4.3 MEG, 8 Bit, 11kHz, mono soundfile. It should also be noted that 
this mix is just under seven minutes long.  Just thought we would warn you. (It also 
explains why the file is so huge… J</p>
<hr size=7>
<p>The second mix is of a different nature than the first.  The idea for it was running 
around in the back of Dan's head.  After feedback on the first mix, which included a 
request for a mix of a different style, we sat down and created another one.  It was 
completely implemented in the course of Wednesday, September 18th.</p>
<p>So what is this "different nature"?</p>
<hr>
<center><b>The Ballad Megamix</b></center>
<hr>
<p>This mix is a compilation of ballads from various points in Deb's musical history.  Due 
to the way in which the ballads are arranged, we found ourselves using larger portions of 
each song, which caused us to use fewer songs.  The final track list ended up as:</p>
<hr>
<center><table><ul>
<tr><td><li>For Better Or Worse</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>One Hand, One Heart</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Lost In Your Eyes</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Foolish Beat</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>In The Still Of The Night (I'll Remember)</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Two Young Kids</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>Goodbye</td></tr>
</ul></table></center>
<p>Also due to the fact that we were using larger portions of each song, this mix clocks in 
at slightly under 8 minutes.  It's a 4.8 MEG, 8-bit, 11kHz, mono soundfile.</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember, if you would like to request either one of these megamixes, drop a line to 
either <a href="mailto:jem@olivier.dementia.org">Lesley</a> or <a 
href="mailto:kylis@olivier.dementia.org">Dan</a>!</p>

(Ooh ooh)
(Wo wo)
(Ooh yeah)
Without you, without you
I always thought that everything was fine
Without you
Never knowing you'd be mine
Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile
 
Now with you, out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
What love was
What love was
 
I need you, I need you
And every day, I love you more and more
Without you I know what it's all for
(Without you I know what it's all for)
Suddenly I see you there
And everything's okay
Don't know why
(Don't know why)
I feel this way
(Oh...)
 
Now with you, out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
What love was
What love was
Here with you
 
We are together now
Never take my heart away
All the love I found
Is here to stay...

(Out of the blue)
(Wo wo wo)
It's like a dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you

(Out of the blue)
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
(Wo wo wo)
Here with you

Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue
Oh, it's like a dream come true
I never thought, I never thought

(Out of the blue)
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue
Here with you...

You can't go, boy
We've been over it a hundred times, but this one's different
This time, I'm not asking you what I think, I'm telling you
(We're staying together)
Whether you like it or not
Here we go!

If you thought that I would get up and go
Oh baby, got something you should know
I got one thing on my mind
That's staying together
 
Oh, and I'll tell you boy, it just isn't right
I won't say goodbye without a fight
Cause you and me are staying together
 
Don't you say goodbye to me boy
There's something you should know
Here's love before your eyes
(Ooh ooh)
If you go, my heart would leave me
(Would leave me)
When you walk out that door
It's like I told you before
Let's stay together
 
Oh, if you thought that I would stand by your side
You know me, boy, I never lied
Cause you and me are staying together
 
Oh, it was so much more than love at first sight
Please say you'll stay, say you might
Then say we are staying together
 
Don't you say goodbye to me boy
There's something you should know
Here's love before your eyes
(Ooh ooh)
And if you go, my heart would leave me
When you walk out that door
It's like I told you before
Let's stay together
 
Cause I don't know, baby, what you've done, don't know
(I only know, baby, I only know)
You were always the only one
(Oh please don't go, baby)
Oh please don't go
Don't take my heart away from me
And leave me out in the cold, baby
(Out in the cold, baby)
Cause you're the only one, you're the only one
Who could ever hold me...

Now here's love
(Ooh ooh)
If you go, my heart would leave me
When you walk out that door
So let's stay together

Don't you say it, don't you say it, don't you say it
Don't you say goodbye to me, boy
(Here's love)
It's right before your eyes
(Ooh ooh)
Don't even think about it
(Think about it, think about it)
(Ooh ooh)
 
If yu go, my heart would leave me
(Ooh ooh)
When you walk out that door
(Ooh ooh)
It's like I told you before
(Ooh ooh)
Let's stay together
(Ooh ooh)

Don't you say goodbye
(Ooh ooh)
Now don't you say goodbye
(Ooh ooh)
(Here's love)
Here's love
(Ooh ooh)
It's right before your, it's right before your eyes

Every time I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realized how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free
 
Now I see I'm up to no good
(No, no, no)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good, baby
No, I can't remember when
 
No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams
 
Couldn't see how much I missed you
(Now I do)
Couldn't see how much it meant
(Ah)
Now I see my world come tumbling down
(Tumbling down my world)
Now I see the road is bent
 
If I only once could hold you
(No, no, no)
And remember how it used to be
(Ah)
If only I could scold you
And forget how it feels to be free
 
No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

ooh...

There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four-leaf clover
 
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you, oh
 
I could never love again the way I loved you, oh
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
 
Oh, when I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
(Turn around)
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart...
 
I could never love again the way I loved you, oh
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
 
Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you, now you're gone...

(ooh ooh ooh)
do do do do do

I've always tried to break through your walls of fire
An angel in love can always fly much higher
'Til I looked in your eyes
That's when I left the skies
 
Take me now, I'm your fallen angel
You taught me why angels fall
Watch me fly, your fallen angel
I can break through your walls
 
With all of the dreams that we have together now
(We have together, baby)
It's hard to believe that this is forever, now
(ooh ooh)
And when I heard your call
You were there to catch my fall
 
So take me now, I'm your fallen angel
You taught me why angels fall
Watch me fly, your fallen angel
I can break through your walls
 
Love's a test for the heavens
Turns an angel's dreams around
You're the best that I've discovered
All your red hot love I've found...

Take me now, I'm your fallen angel
You taught me why angels fall
Watch me fly, your fallen angel
I can break through your walls

Oh, love's a test for the heavens

All your red hot love I've found

So take me now, I'm your fallen angel
You taught me why angels fall

Watch me fly, your fallen angel
I can break through your walls

Loving can be simple
(Find a guy, settle down)
Can it be so simple?
(Touch the sky, look around)
There is so much out there
(Wait your turn, stand in line)
There's a someone somewhere
(You will learn, you will find)
There is so much waiting for you
Listen, here is all you must do
 
Play the field
You gotta look around
Lovin' is so real
Don't just settle down
Just play the field
And leave what is behind
Don't just make a deal
See what you can find - oh, oh
 
If you want some loving
(You'll be loved, many times)
Pushing comes to shoving
(And enough chance to find)
Come on, stop your crying
(Over one special boy)
Do a little lying
(Have some fun, don't be coy)
Don't waste your life on a dream
Take it to the opposite extreme
 
Play the field
You gotta look around
Lovin' is so real
Don't just settle down
Just play the field
And leave what is behind
Don't just make a deal
Come on, have some fun - oh, oh
 
Don't just waste your life on a dream
Take it to the opposite extreme

Play the field
You gotta look around
Lovin' is so real
Don't just settle down
Just play the field
And leave what is behind
Don't just make a deal
See what you can find

Just play the field
And let yourself go wild
Lovin' is so real
You're acting like a child
So play the field
You're always on the run
Don't just make a deal
Come on, have some fun - oh, oh - oh
 
Play the field
On the run
(On the run)
Make a deal
(Oh)
Have some fun
 
Play the field
You gotta look around
Lovin' is so real
Don't just settle down
Just play the field
And leave what is behind
Don't just make a deal
See what you can find
 
Just play the field
And let yourself go wild
Lovin' is so real
You're acting like a child
So play the field
You're always on the run
Don't just make a deal
Come on, have some fun

Play the field
You gotta look around
Lovin' is so real
Don't just settle down
Play the field
And leave what is behind
Don't just make a deal
See what you can find

Just play the field

Lovin' is so real
You're acting like a child
So play the field
You're always on the run

ooh...

I've been searching
I've been thinking
I've been searching so long
What am I looking for
I've been hearing love will hit you
But everybody's wrong
'Cause I just happened to notice
That certain look in your eye
 
I'm reading between the lines
I didn't need no neon signs
To notice, baby
I never before had you on my mind
But now I really do
(ooh)
 
Nothing major ever happened
But it's the greatest feeling I've ever had
(ooh)
Strong emotions all have left me
Just a tenderness inside my heart
(Just happened I noticed)
I noticed that knowing smile
 
I'm reading between the lines
I didn't need no neon signs
To notice, baby
I never before had you on my mind
But now I really do
(Now I really do)

Just happened to notice
That certain look in your eyes

Busy life, not enough time
To look in the mirror
Life in the fast lane
(wo wo)
Look around and take note
Who really loves you?
Don't get caught up in the clouds
Or you'll go insane
When it seems everyone is needing something
Remember who's always been there for you
 
Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's always been on your side
(Morning and night)
Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's gonna see to it that
(You're treated right)
(Right...)
 
Just a smile is alright
Don't owe me anything
Come escape with me
(wo wo)
(sound effect: laughter)
(wo wo)
You have got the world at your feet
That's not always easy
All those people caring,
Yet you're still alone
I understand what's behind the feelings
I think I know you better than anyone
(Anyone)
(ooh)

Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's always been on yourside
(Morning and night)
Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's gonna see to it that
(You're treated right?)
 
I believe in you... yes!
You believe in me too
Don't ever get swept away by something not real
'Cause the way I feel
Oh, I will always feel that way

Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's always been on your side
(Morning and night)
Oh who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's gonna see to it that
(You're treated right?)

Oh yeah, oh yeah
ooh
Ooh believe this baby

Who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?
Who's always been on your side

Who loves ya baby?
I really love you baby
Who's gonna see to it that

Oh who loves ya baby?
Who really loves you baby?

Oh yeah

I said who, who, who

Who loves ya baby?
Who, who, who

Who loves ya baby? - yeah

I get lost
In your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?
 
I get weak
In a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
Cause when I'm lost
I can't let go
 
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies...
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes
 
I just fell
Don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you
 
And if I
Can't find my way
If salvation seems worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes...
(Eyes...)
(wo)
 
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies...
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes...
 
I get weak
In a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost...
In your eyes

oh... oh...

I don't know why we had to go
Our love ended with the change of weather
I know a way to survive
(oh oh)
But it would be much better if you were here
Cause we never fell out of love
 
There's not a trace of happiness
Why do you think it's all right
When love is in your eyes?
(oh)
We still live for each other
But still we keep pretending
That there's no love in disguise
(In disguise)
 
We're playing games like we did before
Now we're feeling the sorrow
But some things just never change
(oh oh)
So come on, take me back into your arms
If I remember, you left them open for me
(oh)

There's not a trace of happiness
Why do you think it's all right
When love is in your eyes?
(oh)
We still live for each other
But still we keep pretending
That there's no love in disguise
 
After all it took to get together
(oh)
You would think
(You would think)
It would last
(Tt would last)
Forever
(Forever.. oh)

There's not a trace of happiness
Why do you think it's all right
When love is in your eyes?
(oh)
We still live for each other
But still we keep pretending
That there's no love in disguise
In disguise
(oh oh)

Ooh baby

There's not a trace of happiness
Why do you think it's all right
I see love is in your eyes
(oh)
We still live for each other
But still we keep pretending
That there's no love
There's no, there's no love in disguise
(oh)

There's not a trace
(There's not a trace)
Why do you think it's all right
When love is in your eyes?
(oh)
We still live for each other
But still we keep pretending
That there's no love in disguise
In disguise

My ears are gonna fade away
Without a word from you
My lips are gonna fade away
Without kissin' you
'Cause I'm missin you
Can't you see I
Feel helpless
So alone here
Out of touch with all I love
So helpless
So helpless in love
 
Forever is so long to wait
Well it seems like forever
It was so much more than fate
That brought us together
(Together)
Don't ya know I
Keep counting
The days 'til
I can see you again
So helpless
I'm missin' the love of my life
And my best friend
 
Oh I can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
 
I know that it's so hard to hear
The voice of reason
It's like goin' from summer to winter
Unwanted change of season
It's not pleasin' me, baby
I can't see clearly
Even though the
Sun's been lifted from my eyes
So clearly
'Til the day we said goodbye

Oh I can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you

Can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell
 
I used to wonder if you felt the same
(ah)
I know you do and now it's a different game
(ah)
When someone you love's
Been taken away
Even though it's not for long
It seems like forever and a day

Can't you see I
Feel helpless
So alone here
Out of touch with all I love
So helpless
So helpless in love

Oh I can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you

Can't count the stars in the sky
No matter how hard I try
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell

(ooh ooh ooh)
(ooh ooh ooh)
Can't count the stars in the sky
I'm helplessly in love and missin' you
Can't think of anything else
Except how hard I fell...

When I asked you
You said nothing was wrong
But I listened to
Your magical song
All its notes were gone
You sang it, I heard
Silence speaks a thousand words
 
You keep telling me
I'll pay the price
For asking you once
And telling you twice
But I paid the day
Your emotions turned cold
Silence speaks a thousand words
 
Where do I turn when you turn away?
It's never just the things you say
You never ever put me down
But when I speak, you turn around
And saying not much
Is saying a lot
 
If you spoke truth
There would be no doubt
But the only words are
"We'll work it out"
Well, that's not saying much
You just don't take the time
And that is where I draw the line
(ooh)

Oh where do I turn when you turn away?
It's never just the things you say
You never ever put me down
But when I speak, you turn around
And saying not much
Is saying a lot
 
You're sending signals
First of hope, then insecurity
Signals of doubt are everywhere
And subconsciously
You know you wanna break the ties
But you use silence
You use lies
Don't worry
I'll return your song of silence

Silence speaks a thousand words
Silence speaks
(ooh...)
A thousand words...

Well, if I looked all over this world
I don't think I would find someone so true
Someone like you
Oh and I know it may be too late
But ya know I cannot wait
What should I do?
I still love you
(oh....)
 
When the stakes all are high
And the odds are all against us
Why do I still keep loving you?
 
You know you should've been the one
Our love could've been something new
And now I don't know what to do
Oh I'll never give up on your love
Cause you always will be the one
Who brightens every day
Even though you took my heart away
Ya know it makes no difference to me
Cause you always will be the one
 
Well, call me crazy or what you will
It doesn't change the way I'll always feel
Cause this is real
It's nothing you ever said
It's all those crazy dreams that are in your head
(That are in your head)
(In your head)

You know you should've been the one
Our love could've been something new
And now I don't know what to do
Oh I'll never give up on your love
Cause you always will be the one
Who brightens every day
Even though you took my heart away
Ya know it makes no difference to me
Cause you always will be the one...

All right now,
Here we go!

Even though you took my heart away
Ya know it makes no difference to me
Cause you always will be the one...

You know our love could've been something new
And now I don't know what to do
Because you always will be the one
Who brightens every day
Even though you took my heart away
Ya know it makes no difference to me
Cause you always be the one

Where the fear sets in
Where the fire burns
Where I find a place
Where there's nowhere to turn
When the evening sings
An eerie song
(oh...)
Longing for the day
You say I'm wrong
 
You can find your place
But never fit in
And only when you've left
Do you know where you've been
I can see the light
But only when it's gone
You can go on waiting
But only for so long...
(So long...)
(So long...)
 
I know we are right
It's not always clear
Because I've never felt the fear
Can it stay so good
Forever in time?
I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when
There's no more rhyme
 
Can we face ourselves
Like we face each other?
We've never felt anything
On our own
I can't wait much longer
To feel any danger
I hope we're not living for
A lifetime alone

I know we are right
It's not always clear
(It's not clear)
Because I've never felt the fear
Can it stay so good
Forever in time?
I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when
There's no more rhyme
(ooh...)
 
Hard to go on
(Go on)
It's like waiting for
The other shoe to drop
I'll never stop
Believing in you
It's just we never had to struggle
It all came too easy
I hope we felt what we felt from the start
We've never suffered a broken heart
We've been so blinded by all the best
We never put our love to the test...
(To the tesr...)

I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when
There's no more rhyme...

We can play it safe
For awhile
If we can
But will that make me a better girl,
You a better man?
I trust myself
And that's all I can do
Don't you see the world is alive and
Right in front of you
 
Over the wall
There is a new world waiting
Over the wall
I want to find out something more
Over the wall
I cannot wait to find it
Over the wall is where I want to be
Come take my hand and
We can be free...
 
Fear of the unknown
Is unhealthy to the soul
But it eats you up inside
If you don't have a higher goal
You see no light
On the dark side of the sun
What do you think about when
Everyday is over and done?

Over the wall
There is a new world waiting
Over the wall
I want to find out something more
Over the wall
I cannot wait to find it
Over the wall is where I want to be
Come take my hand and
We can be free
 
And when the darkness comes
You'll still have a long road
In front of you
And when you cry out
All the world will be around
(Will be around...)
It won't be easy
But it will have greater rewards
Mountains and valleys
Are better than nothing at all...

Over the wall
There is a new world waiting
Over the wall
I want to find out something more
Over the wall
I cannot wait to find it
Over the wall is where I want to be
Come take my hand and
We can be free...

Over the wall
There is a new world waiting
Over the wall
I want to find out something more
Over the wall
I cannot wait to find it
Over the wall is where I want to be
Come take my hand and

Over the wall
There is a new world

If I were an only child
I would be a lonely child
But baby we've got nothing to lose
I'm standing tall in my own shoes
I'll take this chance
I'll make this choice
I'll right this wrong
I'll raise my voice
If it means
We'll be together
For a while
 
I have never had a doubt
But for you I'll take time out
I'll push his love far away from me
And then I'll be completely free
I'll give up my security
For just the possibility
That we could be together
For a while...
 
Oh if you said "Jump!" I'd say "How high?"
If you said "Run!" I'd run and fly
Just for the chance
Just for the moment
Should the moment pass us by
And if you ask once I'll tell you twice
I'll ignore the world's advice
If we could be together
For a while
 
I am taken by your strength
I've thought about it at great length
I thought that I was happy now
But there are things that I found out
Happiness means greater things
I'll sit here 'til that telephone rings
Then we could be together
For a while...

Oh if you said "Jump!" I'd say "How high?"
If you said "Run!" I'd run and fly
Just for the chance
Just for the moment
Should the moment pass us by
And if you ask once I'll tell you twice
I'll ignore the world's advice
If we could be together
For a while...
(While...)
 
Wait'll I tell my guy
(Wait'll I tell)
Wait'll I tell my other friends
They'll all think I'm crazy --
And you know what?
That depends
Cause I'm crazy in love
With you
And everyone's best won't do
They'll say my hopes
Will not come true
But I'm taking the chance
Because you only live once
(Only live once...)
(Only live once...)
And...

If you said "Jump!" I'd say "How high?"
If you said "Run!" I'd run and fly
Just for the chance
Just for the moment
Should the moment pass us by - yeah!
If you ask once I'll tell you twice
I'll ignore the world's advice
If we could be together
For a while...
 
There are no guarantees
But if it means
There's even a possibility
(Possibility)
Then I'll give up whatever it takes
(Whatever it takes)
I know I've made mistakes before
It may be just another closed door
But we could be together
For a while...
(While...)

If you said "Jump!" I'd say "How high?"
If you said "Run!" I'd run and fly
Just for the chance
Just for the moment
Should the moment pass us by - yeah!
Ask me once, I'll tell you twice
You know I'll ignore the world's advice
If we could be together
For a while...
(While...)

If you said "Jump!" I'd say "How high?"
If you said "Run!" I'd run and fly
Just for the chance
Just for the moment
Should the moment pass us by
If you ask once I'll tell you twice
I'll ignore the world's advice
(The world's advice)
(If we could be)
Together for a while

Don't you know that
We could be together for a while...

(ah...)
(ah...)
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
ooh...
do do do do do do do do do do

Red as the roses come
My love it never was
Dark as the evening sky
We let love pass us by
I was caught in the middle
Somewhere in the gray
Now it's time to leave that all behind
My uncertain yesterdays
 
Now it's black or white
Now it's right or wrong
I can't live without you here
Shades of the past are long gone
I've got one thing on my mind
There's a choice to make
There'll be no mistake
The time has come around
I'm leaving no middle ground
Let my heart be the only sound
 
Pink is not red or white
But you brought me pink roses tonight
And I got to thinking to myself
Oh the time is right
A promise is stronger
Than a whisper
So I say "goodbye" to our yesterdays
And leave behind those shades of gray

Cause it's black or white
Now it's wrong or right
I can't live without you here
Shades of the past are long gone
I've got one thing on my mind
There's a choice to make
There'll be no mistake
The time has come around
I'm leaving no middle ground
Let my heart be the only sound

oh...
do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do
(ah...)
do do do do do do do do do do do

Now it's black or white
Now it's wrong or right
I can't live without you here
Shades of the past are long gone
I've got one thing on my mind
There's a choice to make
There'll be no mistake
The time has come around
I'm leaving no middle ground
Let my heart be the only sound

Now it's black or white
Now it's wrong or right
I can't live without you here
(Here...)
Shades of the past are long gone
I've got one thing on my mind
There's a choice to make
There'll be no mistake
The time has come around
(Around...)
I'm leaving no middle ground
Let my heart be the only
Only sound...

(Black or white)

Oh there's a choice to make
There'll be no mistake

Day after day I try to
Earn my pay
Go a little further
But the odds are never in my favor
(oh... another)
I tell myself this can't go on
Very much longer
But when I put the last brick in the wall...
 
Another brick falls
 
I try to run
I try to hide
A thorn gets stuck right in my side
I tell myself it's all a game
But the truth remains
(Another)
I pick it up
I plow ahead
I think of all
I've done and said
But, it is never quite enough
Life will always be a little
Tough

(oh... oh... oh...)
 
I run my race, keep up - oh
Pretty well, at a steady pace but
There are days I fall behind the pack
(oh... another)
It all seems simple till it
(Till it)
Gets so hard to handle
From the sky
(Sky)
From nothing at all...
 
Another brick falls
 
I try to run
I try to hide
A thorn gets stuck right in my side
I tell myself it's all a game
But the truth remains
(Another)
I pick it up
I plow ahead
I think of all
I've done and said
But, it is never quite enough
Life will always be a little
Tough...
 
Obstacles are a loss of concentration
A thought that is in total isolation
Hang on, you're headed for a ride...
(Ride...)
Don't stray from the path that leads you
Instincts will never deceive you
When life really kicks
(Kicks)
Learn to catch those falling bricks
(Bricks...)
(Bricks...)
(Bricks...)
 
I try to run
I try to hide...
A thorn gets stuck right in my side...
I tell myself it's all a game
(oh)

(oh... oh... oh...)
 
I try to run
And I try to hide
A thorn gets stuck right in my side
I tell myself it's all a game
But the truth remains
(Another)
I pick it up
I plow ahead
I think of all
I've done and said
But, it is never quite enough
Life will always be a little
Tough!

Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(Just put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
 
Thought I couldn't slow him down
Long enough to look my way
Thought he was out of my league
Wouldn't give me time of day
Thought he was like all the rest
Love her, leave her, no remorse
But I guess that I misjudged
And this thing just ran its course...
He taught me
 
Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(Just put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
Break it down now
 
(No matter what it is, it's possible)
(Said anything is possible)
Anything
(No matter what it is, it's possible)
(Said anything is possible)
Anything
(No matter what it is, it's possible)
(Said anything is possible)
Oh, anything
(No matter what it is, it's possible)
(Said anything is possible)
 
Much to my surprise I felt
A warm, not cold vibe
When he looked in my eyes
(Oh yeah, it's possible)
His bad boy front not charm
Was his disguise
(oh... wo... oh... oh...)
(Let me tell ya)
He read so much into me
Listened so attentively
He liked me, I rest my case
Wasn't just a pretty face
 
Anything
 
If you set your mind
You can do anything you want
(You can do anything you want)
Not every guy is a bad guy
Don't stereotype
Cause this guy, he proved me wrong
(Anything is possible)
He taught me
 
Anything is possible
(If you just put your mind to it)
Anything is possible 
(oh... oh... oh... oh...)
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything
Anything is possible

Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
(Put your mind to it)
You know you can do anything
(Anything is possible)
Anything, anything
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything
(Anything is possible)
(It's possible)

Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(Just put your mind to it)
Anything is possible
(If you put your mind to it)

(woo hoo)

Reverse psychology
Doesn't work on me
It works my nerves
But I think logically
So don't rehearse what you're gonna say
I like it better the spontaneous way
You got an insecurity?  I won't nurse it
I don't buy psych - so why reverse it?
 
Games are good for attention
(ooh... yeah)
But in the end they let you down
Hold me back or let me go
But no more middle ground
(ooh... yeah)
Boy, you've got to play your cards right
Get on back to the basics of love
We don't need no mindless mind games
A little give and take, push and shove
A little honesty is what I'm in need of!
 
Reverse psychology
(huh)
Doesn't work on me
(huh)
It works my nerves
But I think logically
So don't rehearse what you're gonna say
I like it better the spontaneous way
You got an insecurity?  I won't nurse it
I don't buy psych - so why reverse it?
(Why)
 
Don't you know I've seen it all
Though I seem naive to you
(So naive)
Hit me with anything at all
Just hit me with the truth - yeah!
You keep thinking one of these days you'll
Push my back against the wall
(Against the wall)
It's too late for tricks of the trade now
I can escape anything at all - oh!
A little push and shove, give and take
But I won't fall
 
Reverse psychology
Doesn't work on me
(Never did, never will)
It works my nerves
But I think logically
(Always did, always will)
So don't rehearse what you're gonna say
I like it better the spontaneous way
You got an insecurity?  I won't nurse it
I don't buy psych - so why reverse it?
 
Why wait till something better comes along?
Why not stay steady and strong?
(Steady and strong)
A silver lining cannot be far away
(Too far)
You'll get much further if you
Do what you mean and mean what you say

do do do do do do
do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do
(do do do do)
Yeah

do do do do do do

Reverse psychology
Doesn't work on me
It works my nerves
But I think logically
(oh so much)
So don't rehearse what you're gonna say
I like it better the spontaneous way
(I like it better)
You got an insecurity?  I won't nurse it
I don't buy psych - so why reverse it?
(I don't buy it)
 
Reverse psychology
I said it doesn't work on me
(ooh...)
I said it works my nerves
But I think logically
So don't rehearse what you're gonna say

<pre>
Watch it, watch it
Watch it
Go!
 
Always gotta be one step ahead
You know where you're lying when you make your own bed
You'll never end up in the red
So watch your step, one step ahead

Woo... yeah, yeah
(yeah, yeah)
oh
 
Energy up!
Bring the energy up!
On the double
 
Steppin' on toes is a common routine
Sneakin' up from behind
You won't get anywhere
Dancin' out of time
If you're living up to expectations
You may as well be dead
Gotta go, gotta go for it
Always gotta be one step ahead
So
 
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
Don't depend on lady luck
Can't walk, you just run instead
If you want to be one step ahead
 
Look over your shoulder
And predict what's to come
You're not feeling life if you're simply numb
So don't be dumb, grab the brass ring
You really can't depend on anything
Gotta make it happen all by yourself
Why rely on anyone else?
 
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
(Up)
Don't depend on lady luck
Can't walk, you just run instead
If you want to be one step ahead
(One step ahead)
 
Don't calm down
Bring the energy up
(Energy up)
Don't depend on lady luck
Can't walk, why not run instead?
If you wanna be one step
One step ahead
 
This dream is holding me tight
Keeping me up all night
Oh it's not out of reach, just out of sight
Do you think I'll get it?
Think I may, say I might - oh
 
Oh, this dream is holding me tight
Keeping me tossing and turning
It's not out of reach, just out of sight
Do you think I'll get it?
With the way I'm burning
I just might
(Might)

(ooh...)
ooh... ooh
It's time to rap - huh!
 
Always gotta be one step ahead
You know where you're lying when you make your own bed
You'll never end up in the red
So watch it
(Watch it)
(Watch it)

ooh
Don't calm down, bring the energy up
You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it
 
Don't calm down, bring the energy up
You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it
(Go for it, for it, for it)
(You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it)
Don't calm down, bring the energy up
You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it
(Are you listening?)

(You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it)
Don't calm down, bring the energy up
You gotta go for it, go for it, go for it
(yeah, yeah)
yeah yeah yeah

Don't calm down, bring the energy up
Don't depend on lady luck
(Don't calm down, bring the energy up)
Can't walk, go and run instead
If you want to be one step ahead
(I know you do - huh!)

(Don't calm down, bring the energy up)
You try to walk one step ahead
And you know it's good for you
And you know it's good for you

(Don't calm down, bring the energy up)
yeah... you know
Don't rely on lady luck
(And you know it's good for you)
yeah!

Don't calm down, bring the energy up!

Revenge'll sure feel nice
If inside you've paid the price...
 
You know it and you've gotta stand your ground

When you're strong, everyone's your friend
Guard the jewel you've found

Come on everybody clap your hands
(sound effect: clapping)
Doesn't it feel good to take a stand?

Fight for the beat
 
Whether you want for yourself or for others
Stand up for your sisters and brothers
Just do what you wanna do
No one can say what's right for you...

You know it and you've gotta stand your ground
You've earned it - no one can cut you down

Yo, Fred, check this one out!

Swallow your pride - don't you go it alone
Don't you run away from what is right
Stand your ground - stay there and fight

You gotta work - now double time
'Cause runnin' only lets 'em get the best of you
So stand your ground
Do whatcha gotta do

Yo, Ira!
 
You know it and you've gotta stand your ground

I'll admit that I've loved many people along the way
It's only natural, so - hey!
I can honestly speak my mind
When I say that I adore you
So send me a sign
Your laugh keeps me on my toes
Lately I've reached an all-time low
But you've turned that all around by just being you
You made me think
When I was on the brink of letting go
 
Deep down I feel it

I can only hope and pray
That we see eye to eye one day
But it's hard to go against true gravity
Every other word I say is
Your name
I can't help thinking about you, boy
I hope my instincts are so right
'Cause I think I hit the bullseye

Leads the other boys

Who'll be holding him

Hmmm...
Lead them home...
Lead them home my dreams...
ooh...
My dreams...
 
Some people stand
Some choose not to understand
Some people fight
(Fight)
(Fight)
ooh...
Some people dream
Some people wake up
In the middle of the night
With the eyes of a tiget and a child's curiosity
Can't turn from my conscience when it's starin' at me
 
Lead them home...
Lead them home my dreams
(Lead them home my)
(Lead them home my)
You can hear
When you disguise whispers as screams...
(Lead them home my)
(ooh...)

Some people climb
Some people wait for time to pass
(To pass)
Looking for a miracle
A miracle...
Some people could care less
Some people dwell on the impossible...
And I always remember the times I let myself slide
And I put all the bad things like money
Far lower on the list than pride
 
Bring me home
Bring them home my dreams...
(Lead them home)
Bring them home my dreams

Wait a lifetime
Oh
(Dreams...)
Then my wish will drag on slowly
(Slowly)
Come into one's own
(One's own)
At the time of conception
(ooh ooh)
Give in over time
(Time)
You may as well change your mind
(Mind)
Now is when I see the light
(I see it)
I'm gonna touch it, grab it
Make it mine...

Come with me,
To a place where
All is free
No one to tell you what to do,
How to tell me your feelings
Just, pure honesty
 
I know that,
If we were
Given space
Baby we'd find our place
Together
But people get in the way
'Cause they don't understand
 
All alone
I want to be
All alone
Sharing my heart, my home
In your arms
All alone
No people and no telephone
Just you and I
One hand, one heart...
 
How can you
Sit around taking
In the view
While people tell you
What to do
You know it ain't right
 
Use your mind
Leave the whole world behind
They're only temporary friends
Your happiness depends on you...
 
All alone
I want to be
All alone
Sharing my heart, my home
In your arms
All alone
No people and no telephone
Just you and I
One hand, one heart...
 
Everyone has their own opinions
Well everyone knows what to do
Look around and keep your eyes wide open this time
If they're in love would they listen to you?
Oh no
Oh no....

ba bum
hmmm...
Let's share our heart, a home in your arms...
 
All alone
No people and no telephone
Just you and I

I was so sure
Until I just
Didn't know any more
Thought no storm would come
And when it came
I had to run
And I'll never be the same
 
Tears
They come and go
So often now
When I think of how hard we tried
It's no one's fault
Just like the tide
You never know until it hits you
 
I remember days now they're in the past
Bitter sweet days - they went so fast
Try to win them back - it's a losing fight
'Cause we're alone tonight...
 
I swear
I hear you calling
Your voice seems clear
Unlike the situation
Love
Love really hurts
The more you learn
The more you wished you had forgotten
 
I remember days now they're in the past
Bitter sweet days - they went so fast
Try to win them back - it's a losing fight
'Cause we're alone tonight
 
You apologize for being you
But never justify
The things you do
What is it I'm asking for
I only want to be sure...
 
So cry
Yourself back to sleep now
(oh...)
It won't be over though
(hey)
The morning comes
Daylight turns into darkness
As you realize
Only in dreams
Do dreams come true

oh wo
(I remember days)
ooh...

'Cause we're alone tonight
 
You apologize for being you

But never justify

I only want to be,
All I wanna be,
God all I ask of you is to be sure...
 
'Cause I was so sure
Until I just didn't know any more

Thought no storm would come
And when it came
I had to run
And I'll never be the same...

He says he keeps a journal
I wonder what he writes of me?
I suppose by now I should know
But I just can't see
There are a million thoughts always
Running through my head
But the words I think,
Are different from the ones I've said...
 
In his mind
Can't I go there? Spend some time
Just to see what's going on
So I can see
If he really thinks of me...

Something different from his logic
Oh, I've kept it deep inside
And I don't want to waste precious time
Gotta know what's in his mind

(ooh...) 
A person of many words
But still a mystery
When he shuts his eyes at night
Does he see darkness or me?
(Darkness or me?)
No matter how close we are
There are things we'll never tell
I know a lot about you
But I know myself better
Very well...

Something's funny 'bout your touch lately
It's like you've been touching someone else
(Else)
And the sound of your voice,
Well something's stopping you from being yourself
We've always been honest
And painfully so
So tell me though I don't want to hear
 
I have to ask you
Where have you been?
'Cause I think I know the answer
And it's not what I wanted to hear
Dear, where have you been?
I've been waiting up for you
(ooh...)
I don't want to accuse but
(ooh...)
Your eyes and mouth they tell a different story
I don't want to hear it but
The truth
(Truth)
Where have you been?
oh
 
Well I know it's easy to lose faith
(ooh...)
We look simply for a change of pace
And I know my moods, they go up and down
(Up and down)
But when you're climbing walls, don't I stick around?
You caught me
On some little white lies
It's you who taught me
About silent goodbyes...
 
I have to ask you
Where have you been?
'Cause I think I know the answer
And it isn't what I wanted to hear
Dear, where have you been?
I've been waiting up for you

I don't want to accuse but
Your eyes and mouth they tell a different story
I don't want to hear it but
The truth
Where have you been?
 
A silent cry fills the room
I hear it no sooner than the words ring true
(ooh...)
I knew it all along
Please erase this song
End this harsh reality
What did you do to me?
oh...

I have to ask you
Where have you been?
'Cause I think I know the answer
And it isn't what I wanted to hear

Baby, what ever did I do
(I do, I do, I do)
To make you not only turn away
But turn, oh so far away
Never considering turning back

I need you to know I'll never smile
Until we reconcile
(Until we reconcile)
I know now that that won't happen
Somehow I'll try and cope
But I just can't get out of my head
That glimmer of hope
 
Oh everybody tells me I need time away from you
But you're the only thing in my world
And that's the last thing I wanna do

It's gonna take a miracle
To give up my hope and get on with my life
(ooh...)
Oh that mystic moment
A split-second stop
Of my heart
And with this miracle
Comes unwanted reality
(I don't want reality)
'Cause this so-called miracle
Has turned into a tragedy

Baby, whatever did I do
(Did I do)
To make you not only go away
But twist every word I say
To make the tables turn...

You're sayin' I'm the one who's at the core
Yes, I'm the one who glanced at the door
(Oh slam the door)
But you're the one who turned the handle
Tried the burn the candle at both ends

At both ends you lead me
On and on and on
You really, really took me
(Now you've left)
Now you've left, my mind is gone
(Really gone)

And it's gonna take a miracle
(It's gonna take a miracle)
To give up my hope and get on with my life
(ooh...)
That mystic moment
(ooh...)
A split-second stop
Of my heart
And in this miracle
Comes unwanted reality
(I don't want reality)
'Cause this so-called miracle
Is really a tragedy

It's easy to give advice
When your heart's not in it
But the best thing for me to do is let go
But somehow I get lonely
(Get lonely)
It's hard to stand and face the crowd
(So hard)
Doin' a one-woman show

(It's gonna take a miracle)
It's gonna take a miracle
(Miracle, miracle)
(It's gonna take a miracle)
(Miracle)

Oh everybody tells me I need time away from you
But you're the only thing in my world
And that's not what I'm gonna do

It's gonna take a miracle
(It's gonna take a miracle)
(It's gonna take)
ooh...
To get on with my life
(ooh...)
oh
(ooh...)
Oh a mystic moment
(It's a mystic moment)
A split-second stop
Of my heart
And in this miracle
(oh...)
Comes unwanted reality
(It's a miracle)
(I don't want reality)
(It's a miracle)
This so-called miracle
(oh...)
Just isn't my reality

It's gonna take a miracle

Ow!
Oh, did I get the count off?

Ow!

Ooh baby
Love, money

You might be a small town boy but you're livin' large in my world
When you wrap your love around me, you know I'm your number one girl
Traveled across the sea but it didn't mean that much to me
You're the star that makes me shine no matter where my heart may be
Do you need to know anything more than this?
 
I wouldn't leave you for love
Wouldn't leave you for money

Wouldn't leave you for anything in this world honey
Wouldn't do it for diamonds
Wouldn't do it for gold
Baby next to your lovin', they just leave me cold

Ooh
Anything else?
You wouldn't believe
Tell me about it
(Mmm hmm)
Here it is
 
A millionaire from London tried to sweep me off my feet
A lear jet, a fancy car, but you've got them beat
If Valentino courted me to marry him in Rome
It might be tempting, but you know I'd rather stay home with you

hmmm...
oh
hmm...

Baby all the songs on the radio
Seems they're playin' too fast
Or they're playin' too slow
Nothin' seems right since you walked out of my life
Love's a lost feeling that cuts just like a knife in my heart
Darlin', emptiness surrounds me now
And chains are all around me tonight
And I'm bound to your love
But when push comes to shove
It seems just like an endless fight
So tell me
 
Do you have it in your heart?
To give another try before we say goodbye to love
So that we can start again baby
Do you have it in your heart? 
Am I losin' my mind?
Maybe I was too blind to see
That our love could ever end
But baby if you have it in your heart
You will never part from me
ooh
 
Just the other night at the movie show
(oh oh oh)
I saw you from a distance but you didn't know
(You didn't know)
Though time has passed, I can still read your face
I could tell that girl, she made you feel so out of place
Boy I know...
Though we said goodbye forever I know
We could never let our dreams die
'Cause I'm lookin' around
(I'm lookin' around)
I don't like what I found
Boy won't you look me in the eye
(ooh ooh)
And tell me
 
Do you have it in your heart?
To give another try before we say goodbye to love
So that we can start again baby
Do you have it in your heart?
Am I losin' my mind?
Maybe I was too blind to see
That our love could ever end
But baby if you have it in your heart
Don't say goodbye
 
Let's put our pride aside and try to be strong
So we can put the pieces back where they belong
Baby I'm losin' sleep
And I'll be losin' much more
If you don't walk back through my heart's door
ooh
(ooh)

oh
You're the one thing I dreamed of
Now don't you say goodbye to love
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Tell me
(oh no)
I never thought our love could end
Baby say we'll start again
ooh...
That our love could ever end

Baby do you have it in your heart?
(Do you love me baby?)
Will you give another try
(Do you? Do you?)
Before we say goodbye to love
(ooh...)
So that we can start again
Baby do you have it in your heart?
(D oyou still think baby?)
Am I losin' my mind?
(yeah)
Maybe I was too blind to see
(Come back to me now baby)
That our love could ever end
(oh)

Do you have it in your heart?
(Never thought our love could end)
Emptiness surrounds me now
(Won't you say we'll start again?)
(ooh...)
And chains are all around me tonight
(Baby do you trust me?)

Do you have it in your heart?
We said goodbye forever, darlin'
We could never let our dreams die
(Never let our dreams die)
oh no no

Do you have it in your heart?
(Do you? Do you?)
Emptiness surrounds me now
And chains are all around me tonight...

Free me
Free me
Free me

Got a groove in my head and a feeling of chains
Releasing me from this bed of nails
Got a smile up my sleeve and wind under my feet
With the air I can set sail
Oh baby, you can only push me just so far
I've been a fool for too long
I know the words to this song
You might tear us apart
But I'll still have my heart
 
You might like to think you're strong
You can't break me, you can only free me
Think I'm stuck like glue?  You're wrong!
You can't break me, you can only free this heart...
 
There's a whole world of life with a promise of love
That's waiting outside of these four walls
And you can't walk away though you feel your heart break
Suddenly freedom calls
Ooh, I've been searching for something I've yet to see
I've been thirsting for what you can't be
Now I need to be free
 
You might like to think you're strong
You can't break me, you can only free me
Think I'm stuck like glue?  You're wrong!
(You're wrong!)
You can't break me, you can only free this heart
Oh, this heart
You can only free this heart
This heart
Oh oh
 
You can only push me just so far
I've been a fool for too long
I know the words to this song
You might tear us apart
But I'll still have my heart

Boy you have only touched
The tip of the iceberg
I'll meet you at the other extreme

Your mother thinks I'm cool and everything's fine
Boy the things that she doesn't know

I'm not talkin' about your mama but I'm hoping that if you wanna
We could go on a trip, would it be hip, baby!?!
We could go to the stars, Venus and Mars
Maybe we could find another kind of love that's different than ours
Lovin' that knows no boundaries, I found a reason
Love that has no limits or no gimmicks or no jealousy within it
Mama don't allow the kinds of things that I've been sayin'
The games that I've been playin'
The hearts that I've been swayin' in my direction
It's heading straight into your heart
And my suggestion is that you better do your part
And don't worry if you shock your mama
 
Shock it 'til ya drop

Shock it baby won't ever stop

Ooh

Over you

Lost all reality, you've really got a hold
Turned myself over to you, body, mind, and soul
It might seem crazy and though I'm in over my head
(Ooh...)
Got no direction and my world is spinnin' 'round
Feel like I'm risin' up and never comin' down
A million people talk but I don't hear a word they say
(Ooh ooh)
 
Nothin' I can do
I'm losin' myself over you
Can't deny it's true
You know I couldn't fight it baby even if I wanted to
I'm losin' myself... over you
(Over you)
 
Love like the ocean feel it rushin' over me
You are the treasure that I've searched for desperately
The tide, it races in, it's pullin' me out to the sea...
Willingly
You're my celebration boy, the reason I exist
I feel a hundred lifetimes deep within your kiss
Don't say a word, just hold me close
I hear your heart talkin' to me secretly
 
Nothin' I can do

Can't deny it's true

What happened to the love we made?
We used to be so good together
And life was just a big parade
And kisses lingered like forever
Now we argue and we fight
It doesn't seem like the middle of the night
When love was all around...
 
How can this be?
Did you lose your heart along the way
Or did I lose me?
Now the rain comes down, the sun has gone
But I don't know how this can be
The same hearts that were so free
How can this be?
 
I want so bad to feel so good
I don't think we have reached our limit
I just know I don't wanna have
A single dream if you're not in it
I've grown accustomed to your face
I've grown to love you more each passing day
When did this laughter turn to pain?
 
Well, how can this be?
Did you lose your heart along the way
When you got lost in me
Now the rain comes down, the sun has gone
But I don't know how this can be
The same hearts that were so free
How can this be?
(hmm hmm)
(wo wo)
 
Toy soldiers falling down
I thought we were on solid ground
Is anyone ever?

Can we sacrifice forever?

Or is the pain to much to bear
Without you in my life forever...

Maybe I thought I wanted your lovin' tonight
The music too slow, the lights too low
But something just wasn't right

Your words, they were too much for me

Livin' in a world where love is deadly

Temptation took us all for a ride
Love was made to the beat of a perfect song
Chances are, it wasn't love at all
Chances are, the rewards were not great, but small
Yet in a selfish time even the strong don't survive

Tear down these walls
(These walls)
Come on
(Tear down)
Tear down these walls
(These walls)
Once and for all I'm crying
(Tear down)
No man's too great or too small
To tear down these walls...
 
Let's build a bridge and meet halfway
And if we fall, we'll fall together
I know there once was a dark day
But the past shouldn't linger on forever
Can't we try to see with one eye
In a world full of all our people...
Come on now
ooh

(We're all one and the same)
(You are all my brothers)
(ooh)
(When ashes turn the tide)
(Will we stand up for each other)
(Or stand on separate sides?)

Tear down these walls
(ooh ooh ooh)
Tear down these walls
(oh wo wo)
(oh wo)
Nothing's too strong to

Tear down these walls
Tear down these walls, baby
(ooh)
Tear down these walls
Tear down
(wo wo wo wo)
(oh yeah)
(Tear down)
No man's too great
(These walls)
Once and for all I'm crying
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
No man's too great
(ooh)

(Tear down)
Tear down these walls
(These walls)
Once and for all I'm crying
(Tear down)
Tear down these walls
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Tear down)
No man's too great
(ooh)
(These walls)
No man's too small
(Tear down)
No man's too great
(wo oh wo wo)

(Tear down)
(ah)

(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Tear down)
(oh...)
(Tear down these walls)
(oh oh oh oh)
(oh...)
Tear these walls down

(Tear down)
Tear down
(These walls)
No man's too great

No man's too great
Tear down these walls

<pre>
Darlin', I was hoping that we could pretend
And make believe that we could still live happily
And start again
Seems like you and I, we've been caught up in your world of lies
I kept believing you could start anew
And be a friend
Well I've got something I've wanted to tell you
And it's the last thing I wanted to say
But I think I must go there anyway
 
Goodbye
How do you say goodbye?
Do I just look you in the eye
Shake your hand, wish you well
After all this time
I never wanted for goodbye
 
Don't let go
I was devoted to your heart and soul
And then we took a turn
And I had to learn
What I tried not to know
Seems like yesterday
I'd give the word to hear you say
(ooh ooh)
A simple whisper of a word or two
Like "I love you"
Breaks my heart to see it end this way
 
Goodbye
(ooh)
How do you say goodbye?
(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Do I just look you in the eye,
Shake your hand, wish you well
After all this time
(All this time)
I never wanted for goodbye
 
Can it ever be the same?
Goodbye
Did we lose more than we gained?
There's nowhere to hide
(Nowhere to hide)
Baby I feel it inside
(ooh)
As my heart cries out your name...

Goodbye
(Goodbye)
Howdo you say goodbye?
(Goodbye)
(ooh baby)
Do I just look you in the eye,
(oh)
Shake your hand, wish you well
(ooh)
After all this time
(All this time)
I never wanted for goodbye

Darlin', I was hoping that we could pretend
Goodbye

(ooh ooh ooh)
Gone are the days
Of ponytails and bobby socks
Lost are those childhood memories
(Memories)
Now we must deal in a world
That is real real cold
(In a world)
(In a world)
(ah ah ah ah)

I used to play
Dress up in my mother's clothes
Now they are just my style
Can I find comfort
Looking through the eyes of a child
(Eyes of a child)

Eyes of a child
Innocent smile
Are those days gone forever?
Eyes of a child
Innocent smile
Are they lost for good?
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Whisper to me in hushed tones of love
Unconditionally let me know
Let your words linger for mile upon mile
Love me through the eyes of a child
(Eyes of a child)

Eyes of a child
(ooh ooh ooh)
Eyes of a child...

<h3><center>For Better Or Worse</center></h3>

<pre>
You could walk behind me
Or you could hold my hand
You could know me fully
Or never understand
And you can drive me crazy
Like only you can
Life's blessing, life's curse
For better or worse
 
You could leave me stranded
Or hold me with your eyes
Come home empty handed
Or with a brilliant surprise
You could sing me love songs
Or just make me blue
Life's blessing life's curse
For better or worse
I'm with you
 
Sure there are plenty of fish in the sea
Flocks of birds on the rise
Baby, not for me
Cause I live in paradise
 
And if harm's way found you
You know I'd be there
To wrap my love around you
To let you know I care
And when the angels came down
I'd say don't you dare
You know not what you do
May God take me first
For better or worse
I love you
 
May God take me first
For better or worse
I love you

<h3><center>Didn't Have The Heart</center></h3>
<hr>
<pre>
I found somebody new
Though you mustn't believe
That means I'm over you
I know that in time
We'll figure it out
You'll read my mind
 
And though I'll wait for that day
Without making a sound
I don't want to be
The one who's letting you down
I just want you to know
The reason behind the rhyme
 
It's not that
I didn't have the time
Didn't have the love
I didn't have the strength
Not to fall apart
It's not that I don't care
It's just I wouldn't dare
Cause I just don't have the heart
 
Love is not black and white
You'd believe that it's true
If you saw me tonight
I struggle with what is real
But the logical side
Doesn't stop what I feel
 
And though you're holding your breath
To be given a sign
Your heart cannot be
Broken in pieces like mine
I just want you to know
The reason behind the rhyme
 
It's not that
I didn't have the time
Didn't have the love
I just didn't have the strength
Not to fall apart
It's not that I don't care
It's just I wouldn't dare
Cause I just don't have the heart
 
Loving you was more than I could stand
I was scared my heart was in your hand
(My heart was in your hand)
But I know now
I figured it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
I must let go...
 
Yes, I had the time
Yes, I had the love
I just didn't have the strength
Not to fall apart
(Not to fall apart)
It's not that I don't care
It's just I wouldn't dare
Cause I just don't have the heart
 
I don't have the heart

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

(ooh) 
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sigh?
(Can I believe?)
Will you still love me tomorrow?
 
Tonight with words unspoken
You'll say that I'm the only one
(Say I'm the only one)
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?
 
I'd like to know that your love
(I'd like to know)
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
 
I need to know
Will you still love me tomorrow?

hmm
Feelings carry away with me
'Til I tremble no more
Music makes lovers of all of us
Out on the floor

ooh
I don't know you too well
And we don't have much time
But whenever you cross my mind
 
We'll be dancin' like we did that summer
When no boundaries kept us confined
We'll be intimately dancin' in my mind
 
I wish I had many lives
At least, more than this one
Then I could deeply feel and learn
To love everyone

No, I just can't up and leave
Everything behind
But still you have touched my life
 
And I'll be dancin' like we did that summer
When no boundaries kept us confined
We'll be intimately dancin' in my mind
 
You feel lovely
You're just what I need right now

do do do do
 
Dancin' like we did that summer
When no boundaries kept us confined
We'll be intimately dancin' in my mind

I'm evasive I'm cool and I'm nobody's fool
And I'm layin' it on the line
You looked a mess
Cause my little black dress
Stopped you on a dime
Don't even try it your ticket has expired
And I'm just too tired to dance
Even if you want me
You're not gonna get me
Cause baby you had your chance
 
Don't you want me now
Now that I'm trying not to try so hard
Don't you want me now
Don't you wonder how
You could've pushed this naive girl
To go so lowdown
(ooh)
The tables are turned somehow
Don't you want me now

do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do
 
It's not really me it's somebody else
But I'm lovin' her just the same
The look on your face
When I walked in this place
Will remain forever on my brain
Cause the joke's on you
And it's long overdue
(ooh)
Tell me can you take the heat
Wanting to hassle the king in his castle
Revenge never tasted so sweet
 
Don't you want me now
Now that I'm trying not to try so hard
Don't you want me now
Don't you wonder how
You could've pushed this naive girl
To go so lowdown
(ooh)
The tables are turned somehow
Don't you want me now
 
Who cares who wins 'cause just the same
I'm not into baby games
Yet you once swept me off my feet
Now, look who's in the driver's seat
Now
 
Now that I'm trying not to try so hard
Don't you want me now
Don't you wonder how
You could've pushed this naive girl
To go so lowdown

You know I'm not one to complain
But it's not how it used to be
It's not like anyone is to blame
But you can at least look at me
Hardships come and go
This I know, this I know
 
But I've got all the time in the world
All the things you require
All the strength to survive
All the pain and desire
But there's more than just one
In a happy home
If you want it to work
I can't do it alone
 
I know that you're under a strain
You, me, and the rest of the world
The sunrise and the evening rain
I would risk it all

Fairytales are nice
But it takes work to bring them to life
 
I've got all the time in the world
All the things you require
All the strength to survive
All the pain and desire
But there's more than just one
In a happy home
If you want it to work
I can't do it alone
 
Fairytales are nice

Quiet now while I hold you
Turn it off the mind that is stopping you
Love is here
So why deny what you feel
 
Think with your heart
Speak with your soul
Touch me and feel
The world become whole
Break down the walls
Keeping you far
Be as in love as you think you are
 
We live one time forever
It can be glorious heaven on earth
So quiet now while I kiss you
You decide what you feel heaven is worth
 
Think with your heart
Speak with your soul
Touch me and feel
Your world become whole
Break down the walls
Keeping you far
Be as in love as you think you are
 
Think with your heart
Speak with your soul
Touch me and feel
Your world become whole
Break down the walls
Keeping you far
You may be as in love as you think you are

He likes Armani suits
To wear with ties of silk
Bought a herd of cows
To milk his own milk
I like his heart of gold, his personality
He's just too fancy for me
 
He's got a Cartier and a Mercedes Benz
And that was all okay
When we were only friends
But when we're on a date
It's all too plain to see
He's just too fancy for me
 
I like a man who can roll up his jeans
And wade in the water
And still has some dreams
I like a man who can understand simplicity
 
Don't want 'em finely tuned
Cause quirky men are cool
The Concorde's caviar
Ain't like Balducci's food
Those thousand dollar suits
May suit society
But they're just too fancy for me
 
Give me a fishing boat
Give me a wide-eyed grin
Don't even try to gloat
Cause you won't even win

Don't want the courtside seats
I want my nose to bleed
He's just too fancy for me
He's just too fancy for me

Spare me advice for a change
Just let me go my own way
I am the one in this thing

I know you're looking out
Checking me for last minute doubt
He makes me happy
When will you take my word
 
You don't have to want this to work
It's my life and a love deserved
Tearing him down, yeah it's a sin
But you don't have to see
What I see in him
 
There is respect all around
Miracles in what we found
Surely you can understand

And when I come home to him
It just confirms again and again
That I don't have to explain
But to say that he's my man
(oh my man)
 
And you don't have to want this to work
It's my life, it's a love deserved
(You don't have to want)
Tearing him down, yeah it's a sin
But you don't have to see what I see in him
(What I see)
 
Yes, it would please me
If you'd make it easy
And open up your mind
(Open up your mind)
 
But you don't have to want this to work
It's my life and a love deserved
Tearing him down, yeah it's a sin
But you don't have to see what I see in him
(What I see in him)

You don't have to see

Sitting at the table tonight
You looked so beautiful
In the candlelight
And looking at her, looking at him
After fifty years
I pictured you and I and candlelight
And we would look so beautiful
And two young kids
Would be wishing they were us
 
Time it is a vision unclear
Blessed with adventure and full of fear
And looking at her, looking at him
Made it seem so easy

You're looking natural in my eyes
We've found life's wonderful surprise
And someday two young kids
Will be wishing they were us
 
Perfect love exists
I've seen it for myself
It's not kisses and moonlight serenades
It's two people holding on to happiness
Before it fades
 
I just cannot be here without you
Darling what's this heart supposed to do
It's suddenly here, crystal clear
You are the one
(You are the one)

I picture flowers and me dressed in white
(oh...)
And you and I and candlelight
And two young kids
Just wishing they were us

Why is the truth so rare
It's not the lighting, it's not the day
And I know it's not that you don't care
 
Love is not a secret to take to the grave
(oh...)
Why won't you run away with me tomorrow
We could dance under moonlight
Play catch with the stars all day
Let's run away
 
Imagine a place
Where pride could cease to exist
And we cannot speak of pain
And angels carry us on their wings
We are kissed
As we bathe in the pouring rain
 
Love is not a secret to take to the grave
(oh...)
Why don't you run away with me tomorrow
We could dance under moonlight
Play catch with the stars all day
Let's run away
 
I cannot pretend
Oh no, not to care anymore
So look inside and come up smiling
With eyes of the adored
 
Why don't you run away with me tomorrow
We could dance under moonlight
Play catch with the stars all day
Let's run away...

<h3><center>Call Yourself A Lover</center></h3>
<hr>
<pre>
You have no idea what a woman wants
What a woman needs
Don't go by what you hear
You won't find it in the books you read

Come on strong man
That's the wrong man for me
Have you no clue
What a real man's supposed to be

So you call yourself a lover
A Romeo, a Cassanova
Thinkin' that there is no other
Well guess again
(You better guess again)
(No)
Don't you think yourself attractive
Your mind's a bit too overactive
You don't know from any other
So you call yourself a lover

Once upon a time
Maybe then some help, just what we needed
Wake up the world has changed
I just need your touch some tlc

I won't shrivel up and die without you
The sonner the better you hear those words
Ring loud and true

So you call yourself a lover
A Romeo, a Cassanova
Thinkin' that there is no other
Well guess again
(You better guess again)
(No)
Don't you think yourself attractive
Your mind's a bit too overactive
You don't know from any other
So you call yourself a lover

They say romance
Is dead and gone, gone, gone
Don't you know it's love sweet love
That this girl's world is built upon
(Built upon, yeah)

A token to show
A tall tale to tell
Won't get you anywhere with me

So you call yourself a lover
A Romeo, a Cassanova
Thinkin' that there is no other
Well guess again
(You better guess again)
(oh oh)
Don't you think yourself attractive
Your mind's a bit too overactive
You don't know from any other
So you call yourself a lover

Oh baby

I know people say they know you
But they've each a different face to show you
Honest people don't they take you
When they know you and they say they hate you

Why don't we take the time
To get to know each other
Isn't it worth it

Cause you, you remember what I say
Don't throw my words away
And that means the world to me oh baby
You know why I do what I do
Not a wall you can't see through
You look inside, yeah you know me

I've five fingers to count friends on
And they stand for what my life depends on
I don't get it those why don't try
So many molds and rules to live by
Break out of your shell

Put all hearts and souls out there
So glad I found you

Cause you, you remember what I say
Don't throw my words away
And that means the world to me oh baby
You know why I do what I do
Not a wall you can't see through

Who knows what's in it

Don't throw my words away
And that means the world to me oh baby
You know why I do what I do

Lay your head down by my side
Look that way just one more time
And promise me… nothing
I know time isn't ours to keep
But that doesn't mean I can't watch you sleep
Listen to the strength of silence

There's a sweet sensibility
And darlin' that is enough for me
I know you are taken
But, do I get to you just a little bit
I know I'm as close as I'm gonna get
And though my heart is close to breaking

Oh if you're any kind of man at all
You know the woman I am
So darling don't be afraid I won't break plans you've made
I will be just a friend

Flowers grow in the month of May
And they brighten my every day
You're here for me now and I'm laughing
And though I crave your soulful kiss
I can deal with it as it is
Two tall ships passin'

Oh if you're any kind of man at all
You know the woman I am
So darling don't be afraid I won't break plans you've made
I will be just a friend

I don't doubt for a moments time
The heart's not a mirror of the mind
But think it through anyway
And if you wake up a lonely child
And want to escape for a little while
Come to me and we'll dance out in the rain
Friend or lover we can dance out in the rain

If I said I'm in love with you
Tell me what then would you do?

Goodnight...

Moonchild moonchild

All day long I wait for the sun to disappear
So I can free myself in the cool night air
Take down my hair and feel the wind of my shoulders
With every breeze I feel my heart grow bolder and bolder

Moonchild, love it when your light shines down on me
Moonchild, want someone to dance the dream
Moonchild, wrap me up beneath the stars
Moonchild, come to me when the night grows dark
Tell me who you are, moonchild

I swear that I can feel your arms around me now
I know you're somewhere ooh so I'm reaching out
All day a misty shadow follows me
I can hear you calling, darling
Can't you see
I'm your

Moonchild, love it when your light shines down on me
Moonchild, want someone to dance the dream
Moonchild, wrap me up beneath the stars
Moonchild, come to me when the night grows dark
Tell me who you are, moonchild

Moonchild, moonchild
Moonchild, moonchild

Baby take my hand and I'll take you higher
'Cause my one desire is you and I need you now
More than ever if it takes forever and I know
These things are things you've heard
But up 'til now they were only words

Dancing on the lips of intimate strangers
Shallow like the city, now they're vivid like the sun
Blinding me with spirit
In the night, my private soul can hear it
Common as the hummingbirds
But they were only words

Now I feel like a wise old man 
(oh yeah)
I now understand all the hows, the whens, the whys
These thoughts are mine for the very first time
Love it springs, it blooms, eternal and true
It may sound nothing new to you

Only words
Dancing on the lips of intimate strangers
Shallow like the city, now they're vivid like the sun
Blinding me with spirit
In the night, my private soul can hear it
Common as the hummingbirds
But they were only words

Here's hoping that we'll never break the silence
Here's hoping that we never run from ourselves
Here's hoping "can't" and "never", "not now"
And "gee it's time to go" are words we'll never know

Dancing on the lips of intimate strangers
(oh yeah)
Now they're vivid like the sun
Blinding me with spirit
In the night my private soul can hear it
Common as the hummingbirds
But they were only words

Dancing on the lips of intimate strangers
Shallow like the city, now they're vivid like the sun
Blinding me with spirit

Sorry if I didn't do this, didn't do that
It's just I don't know you anymore
What turns you on
What has been turning you off
'Cause I hear you talking behind closed doors
What do they say all these friends of yours
And why are they no longer friends of mine?
Do they remember

When we didn't have to touch
It's just that it meant so much
And all hesitation was gone
We didn't analyze
We didn't have to do anything
It just came naturally

Wasn't it you who used to read my mind
I'd pick up the phone and you were there
Now it's as if you are a step behind
(A step behind)
It was an effortless affair
Under the moon I made promises
That I really thought I'd keep back then
Do you remember

When we didn't have to touch
It's just that it meant so much
And all hesitation was gone
(Gone, gone)
We didn't analyze
We didn't have to do anything
It just came naturally

I don't want to let go
I'd be letting down you and me and everyone
That hung their hopes upon
Our love and our trust
Where has all the goodness gone?

Do you remember

We didn't have to touch
It's just that it meant so much
And all hesitation was gone

Please don't
Go away don't
Leave me to face the crowds alone
Oh don't you know you're my home

Please stay, just one more night stay
Then if you must move on without me
Wait til my wits are about me
Deep in your heart know though I'll start anew
Nobody's you

I will always compare them always to you, no they don't stand a chance
They'll try poor souls but won't come close
Save me, dance close and save me
Truth be known I will not be whole without you here to hold
But if you must go like lovers often do
Know nobody's you

Oh if it's pleasure I seek then pleasure I'll find
I'll even go so far as to say a treasure will be mine
But, oh there's gold and then there's diamonds my darling
Precious and few a gem of the earth the magic of you

Give in, go on and give in
I am what you are to me too
A light in a dark room
Try as they do
Nobody's you
Though they move me too
Nobody's you

Deborah Gibson:
Hey, I'm the one he left you for
Can I come in? 'cause the wolf is at my door
He said that it was you
Now that just don't ring true
Like it did when I thought he was mine
Please let me inside, oh...

Deborah Gibson:
I just want to cry tonight
And I know you'll understand
How much I hurt inside
'cause I know that you know the man
I know he had his way with us
Aren't you afraid he stole your pride?
Out of sight isn't out of mind
So don't you want to cry tonight?

Anna-Jane Casey:
Hey did he say you hung the moon?
And you made it shine in a sky he never knew
Well I've got news for you
I hung the moon too

Deborah Gibson:
Ain't it funny how that moon turns blue
When there's someone new

Anna-Jane Casey:
Can't believe there's someone new

Anna-Jane Casey:
I just want to cry tonight

Deborah Gibson:
Don't you wanna cry?

Anna-Jane Casey:
And I know you'll understand
All the hurt that I feel inside
'cause I know that you know the man

Deborah Gibson:
Yes I know that man

Anna-Jane Casey:
Though he had his way with us

Deborah Gibson:
Ooh yeah

Anna-Jane Casey:
So afraid that he stole my pride

Deborah Gibson:
Same with me

Anna-Jane Casey:
Out of touch isn't out of mind

Deborah Gibson:
Ooh

Anna-Jane Casey:
Don't you want to cry tonight?

Together:
Who would have thought
We'd be each other's shoulder to cry on
Life sure holds the strangest surprises
And they're not always sweet, no

Deborah Gibson:
I just want to cry tonight

Anna-Jane Casey:
I just want to cry

Deborah Gibson:
And I know you'll understand

Anna-Jane Casey:
How much I hurt inside

Deborah Gibson:
Oh I hurt inside

Anna-Jane Casey:
'cause I know that you know the man

Deborah Gibson:
I know that man

Together:
I know he had his way with us
I'm so afraid that he stole my pride
Out of sight isn't out of mind

More than memories are left behind

Talking all the talk that makes me feel strong
Going all the places where smiles greet me
Can't get it through my head that I did nothing wrong
It would be easier if I had myself to blame
But it's pouring rain under my umbrella

I tried walking around, 'round these streets by myself
Said "pretty girl don't look down"
But I could look no place else
The smiles, the bed, the telephone
And still I can't make him see
And I can't call this life my own
Cause I'm not where I want to be

Going out with the girls on a Saturday night
Reaching out to strangers so I don't feel deeply moved
Yeah they're my friends and I like them alright
But they can't do the things that we used to do
So I've got to say that I miss you baby

I tried walking around, 'round these streets by myself
Said "pretty girl don't look down"
But I could look no place else
The smiles, the bed, the telephone
And I still can't make him see
And I can't call this life my own
Cause I'm not where I want to be

It's amazing how one little broken heart
Can radiate so much pain
Some guy looked at me and then he turned away
Saw my eyes sayin' I will never fall again

I tried walking around, 'round thse streets by myself
Said "pretty girl don't look down"
But I could look no place else
The smiles, the bed, the telephone
And I still can't make him see
And I can't call this life my own
Cause I'm not where I want to be

Don't close your hand
Just close your eyes
And I will stay right by your side
And if this world turns cruel & cold
Look to the skies
Don't you see the truth?
The power of one, the power of two
The power of me loving you

Butterflies are free
Free to come and go
Free to spread their wings
Know that I know
You'll come back to me
Cause love like butterflies are free

You see a light
You hear the call
And if I don't let you fly
I don't you know at all

So go on and roam
See all that you can
Born unto this earth a curious soul
You and you alone can make you feel whole
But don't I add truth you've never known

Butterflies are free
Free to come and go
Free to spread their wings
Know that I know
You'll come back to me
Cause love like butterflies are free

The tighter the grip
The more you'll resist
It's human nature I suppose
But I'd rather be surprised by a kiss
Then under your control

Butterflies are free
Free to come and go
Free to spread their wings
Know that I know
You'll come back to me
Cause love like butterflies are free

Baby why do you not love me
Why do you not see me in the light that I see you in
Don't you ever need me in the still of the night
I've been there in your shoes feeling strong, feeling innocence
Nothing short of a miracle could make it make sense
Oh darling

I gave you the moon, the stars above
You think you would give me your love
Came in like the tide, rose up like the sun
You think you would give me your love

I know all that's in your rulebook
I took more than one look
And I know you are the proud type
But I hate game playing, yes I know how to win
But it's not fair to me

You should move 'cause you're wanting to
Not because I fly
Can you only view your dreams when they're
Up there in the sky
Oh, darlin…

I gave you the moon, the stars above
You think you would give me your love
Came in like the tide, rose up like the sun
You think you would give me your love

Blame it on the blues you sing
Blame it on anything and everything
Blame it on a lack of faith or a twist of fate
'Til it makes you feel ok
Then come to terms with the fact
It was over because it was

It wasn't the time
It wasn't the place
Or my frame of mind, or the look on your face
It wasn't the road we were on
Or the days, though there were not enough
Sad to say
It just wasn't love

Oh, I thought that you were the one
Saw forever
It was here and it was gone
I needed a reason clear things don't disappear
And that's how I found the truth
It's just how the story goes
We've been over it a hundred times

It wasn't the time
It wasn't the place
Or my frame of mind, or the look on your face
It wasn't the road we were on
Or the days, though they were not enough
Sad to say
It just wasn't love

Some things need no explanation
No chance for will that's free
(oh no, no)
Some things kill every reason we have
To ever believe things are what they seem

It wasn't the time
It wasn't the place
Or my frame of mind, or the look on your face
It wasn't the road we were on
Or the days, though there were not enough
Sad to say
It just wasn't love

Chris Bruno:
Salut ma belle fille
                    [Hello beautiful/gorgeous]
Ca va ce soir?
                    [How are you this evening?]
Je croit que tu est absolument jolie
                    [I think you're positively beautiful]
C'est nous tout seul ce soir
                    [We're alone tonight]
Est je veux etre avec toi
                    [And I want to be with you]
Ca c'est "cool"
                    [That's "cool"]

The writing's on the wall
And the words it spells aren't very nice
Although I'm me, you're you
I've been down that road once or twice
And it's ended in disaster
And someone's heart always breaks
But, I cannot help but wonder 'bout the love that we might make

I should walk away from you now
Should just turn right around
Should say I'm never gonna fall for you
But I can't

I've counseled many peers
In situations milder than this
And my advice to them
Was at all costs avoid that first kiss
But we've waltzed in dreams already
And I never could tell lies
And I can't resist the wonder
That is there behind those eyes

I should walk away from you now
Should just turn right around
Should say I'm never gonna fall for you
But I can't

Dangerous as it may be
I want to dance this dance
Let the world take me baby
But not before I take this chance

I've told your heart good-bye
So why does mine refuse to hear?
I've pondered what and why
I tremble when you are near
You're the drink that makes me thirsty
But I crave you just the same

I should walk away from you now
Should just turn right around
Should say I'm never gonna fall for you
But I can't

We travel single-o
Maybe we're lucky but, I don't know
With them just let one kid fall down
And seven mothers faint
I guess we're both happy
But maybe, we ain't

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

Don't tell me not to live just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade

Don't tell me not to fly I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade

I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum 
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat sir 
At least I didn't fake it
Hat sir, I guess I didn't make it

But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection
Or freckle on the nose of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye

I gotta fly once, I gotta try once 
Only can die once, right sir?
Ooh love is juicy, juicy and you see
I gotta have my bite sir

Get ready for me love cause I'm a comer
I simply got to march my heart's a drummer
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade

I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang
Eye on the target and wham
One shot, one gun shot and bam
Hey Mr. Arnstein, here I am!

I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum 
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir 
At least I didn't fake it
Hat sir, I guess I didn't make it

Get ready for me love cause I'm a comer
I've simply got to march my heart's a drummer
Nobody, no nobody is gonna rain on my parade

Here we stand
Each of us afraid to make a sound
Hoping love will turn this thing around
And I know what I must do

So I will let you go
Yes fly away my love
Linger for awhile
Live for a strangers smile
And hope it is enough
You'll return
But I must let you go

Sometimes
Two steps back is just what lovers need
Not knowing that it's love that makes us free
So I'll be brave and retreat

So I will let you go
Yes fly away my love
Linger for awhile
Live for a strangers smile
And hope it is enough
You'll return
But I must let you go

No it's not, no it's not fair darling
Missing precious hours, precious days
Making you figure out
What I know to be true
Love remains

So I will let you go
Yes fly away my love
Linger for a while
Live for a strangers smile
And hope it is enough
You'll return
But I must let you go

Well that phone doesn't ring when you want it to
And it isn't your dream on the line
It's just dad telling mom to have dinner without him
'Cause he won't be coming home on time

Well there's always that dance to escape to
But that doesn't always work out
You don't have a date; you're not going alone
Isn't it nice to know you can still come home?

Well you don't have a million friends to speak of
But a best one is all that you need - oh
Growing up so strong but you're not made of stone
Isn't it nice to come home?

In the real world you're not always welcome
And all's not forgive and forget
It's a cruel world without understanding
And little one it's not over yet

Well you never can trust a stranger
So you may as well give up this fight - oh
Your best friends are waiting in the living room
So go on and kiss them goodnight

I remember when rock was young
Me and Tommy had so much fun
Holding hands and skipping stones
Had an old Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking around the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rockin'
There's something shockin'
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will

Oh, mama mama, those Friday nights
When Pittsburgh rocks with all its might
Crocodile Rockin' was on the side

But the years went by and the rock just died
Tommy went and left us for some better time
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the thrills we got
We all owe to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went fast
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well, Crocodile Rockin'
There's something shockin'
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will

Oh, mama mama those Friday nights
When Pittsburgh rocks with all its might
Crocodile Rockin' was on the side

One more time!

I remember when rock was young
Me and Tommy had so much fun
Holding hands and skipping stones
Had an old Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking around the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rockin'
There's something shockin'
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will

Oh, mama mama those Friday nights
When Pittsburgh rocks with all its might
Crocodile Rockin' was on the side

If you mean it - well, then you mean it
If you don't - just stay away
I don't want to be a penny
That you saved for a rainy day

Stop wishing it, take action
I tell myself make your move
It's just a kiss
Better stop it, think logically
Do I want a guy who acts like this

Don't flirt with me
I can't deny, I want you baby
Don't flirt with me
Don't play mind games
Just stop, before someone gets hurt
Don't flirt

All I'm asking is for the real thing
No tricks are up my sleeve
Be straightforward, ask your questions
Tell me something I'll believe

My feelings are so strong
But they hurt so easily
(Hurt so easily)
I'm not asking for much at all
Just a lifetime guarantee

Don't flirt with me
I can't deny, I want you baby
Don't flirt with me
Don't play mind games
Just stop, before someone gets hurt

I know that there will come a time
When you will stop messing with my mind
And when love is the message you understand
I'll be here to give you some of your own medicine
You'll be saying

na na na na na na na
na na na na
na na na na na na na
na na na na
(ooh ooh)
na na na na na na na
na na na na

Don't flirt with me
I can't deny, I want you baby
Don't flirt with me
Don't play mind games
Just stop, before someone gets hurt

Stop, stop, stop it baby
Don't hurt me baby
Don't flirt with me
I can't deny, I need you baby
Don't flirt with me
Don't play mind games
Just stop

Don't flirt with me

America is the place I love

So hurry up and climb aboard
Get on the boat and wave goodbye forever

I did the hula in Hawaii

I feel there's something wrong between us
I have no real reason
You say you love me
But you have one way to show me
And I need more
So listen to me

Another night alone with you
Another game you put me through
Another tear, another lie
Another see-thought alibi
How can yo usay "I want you dear?"
You know the words I want to hear
But everytime that you say that line
Can't help but wonder what's really on your mind

Is it love or is it lust?
Are you someone I can trust?
Would you take it to the limit for me?
Is it truth or is it dare?
Tell me if you really care
Baby, I don't mean to make a fuss
Is it love or is it lust?
Is it love or is it lust?
So tell me

The finest jewels may hypnotize
But I don't need what your money buys
(oh no)
I'm searching for a heart that's true
(You know)
The kind of love I give to you
I can't deny you satisfy
I'm not so sure of what you feel inside
You don't express your love unless
You feel the warmth of my caress

Is it love or is it lust?
Are you someone I can trust?
Would you take it to the limit for me?
Is it truth or is it dare?
Tell me if you really care
Baby, I don't mean to make a fuss
Is it love or is it lust?
Is it love or is it lust?
So tell me

Just talk to me, can't read your mind
I hope you're not the selfish kind
I could be wrong, I could be right
So you tell me
Just stay tonight

Is it love or is it lust?

Is it love or is it lust?
Are you someone I can trust?
Would you take it to the limit for me?
Is it truth or is it dare?
Tell me if you really care
Baby, I don't mean to make a fuss
Is it love or is it lust?
Is it love or is it lust?
So tell me

I don't mean to make a fuss
Tell me is it love or lust?
Tell me
Baby, is it truth or dare?
Tell me darlin' do you care?
Is it love or is it lust?

Another tear, another lie
Just tell me dear 'cause I wonder why
I'm searching for a heart so true
You always said I could trust you
Now I feel that something's wrong
I thought we had a bond so strong
I can't deny you satisfy
I want more

I wanted to write the most beautiful love song
Because we have the most beautiful love
But words never came harder
It's not as blatant as days have gone by
It's hard to be as unique as you
But since it's for you I'll try
Were you feeling what I was feeling?
Were you dizzy when yo ulet go?
Does it seem like sometimes when you're alone
I'm the only thing you really know?

'Cause I could be completely mad
Broken down in tears, sadder than sad
And if there's one thing that could change my mind
It's knowing you're not far behind...

You touch something inside of me
That's been only touched in dreams
I never felt my happiness in heartache
Go to so many extremes
We didn't say what we're supposed to say
We just were ourselves
It turned out this way
Didn't know your impact
It just crept up and swept me away

'Cause I could be completely mad
Broken down in tears, sadder than sad
And if there's one thing that could change my mind
It's knowing you're not far behind...

No words can get me when they come from you
You finish everything
You follow through
It's not just a matter of consistency
Everything you do is new to me...

Everytime you talk about it baby I think words
Do we really belong
In the same place, at the same time
Wasn't sure about faith but you changed my mind...

'Cause I could be completely mad
Broken down in tears, sadder than sad
And if there's one thing that could change my mind
It's knowing you're not far behind...

No words can get me when they come from you
You finish everything

And now I'm all alone again
Nowhere to turn, no one to go to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face to say hello to
And now the night is now, now I can make
Believe he's here

Sometimes I walk alone at night when everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own
Pretending he's beside me
All alone I walk with him till morning
Without him
I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes
And he has found me

In the rain the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me for ever and forever

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone, the river's just a river
Without him the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him
But everyday I'm learning
All my life I've only been pretending
Without me his world will go on turning
A world that's full of happiness that I have
Never known

I love him, I love him
I love him, but only on my own

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we

We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be

Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two

Comeo n, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives!

Fears of getting hurt again, doubting your eyes
Why do we listen?  Why do we care?

There'll be no resurrection
How can life break its promises?  I even made this promise to myself
So close but never there again
 
Once a king, now a prince, one step lower on the list
It's not plain and simple innocence
'Cause we've been through more now
And it's left its scars somehow

Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
And held loosely at his side
Yesterday's papers telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to change your mind

In the all night cafe, at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there all alone
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London

Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London
Dirt on her face, and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

And then I'll feel the joy that they're all singing of
This Christmas just give me someone to love

I was too small to remember, though I cried out loud
I wish they would write or call me, I guess they're just too proud
People make mistakes, though the heart sunk to the ground
I'd gladly open my arms if they'd only come around

Someone take me home for Christmas so I won't be alone
Let me have a family to call my own
And then I'll feel the joy that they're all singing of
This Christmas just give me someone to love

All year came and went
I held my hopes up high
But now I need you bad
If ever there was a time
It's just once that we live
We take so much, why can't you give?

So someone take me home for Christmas, so I won't be alone
Let me have a mom and dad again, someone to call my own

Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance
Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night
Wait around for muster right
Take cold showers every day
And throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true

I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy
I don't steal and I don't lie

A fact I'll bet you never knew

Too few I want one more chance at...

Playing my favorite tunes
And having a blast

Sitting here with Scott and Ross
Clair and John, what do you think about that?
I never went to the prom
With Magic Matt

Scott gave me just three minutes
To write this silly song
They thought I could do it
But you see they were wrong

So this is a wimpy cop-out
But it will have to do
Cause it's something you'd expect
From the Z-Morning Zoo

Kim Leeson:
I was deprived of a young girl's dream
By the cruel force of nature from the blue

Debbie Gibson and Kim Leeson:
Instead of a night full of romance supreme
All I got was a runny nose and
Asiatic flu

Kim Leeson:
It's raining

Debbie Gibson:
It's raining

Kim Leeson:
On prom night

Debbie Gibson:
On prom night

Debbie Gibson and Kim Leeson:
My hair is a mess, it's running, it's running
All over, all over my taffeta dress, taffeta dress
It's wilting, it's wilting the quilting, the quilting
In my maidenform, my maidenform and mascara flows
Mascara flows right down my nose, right down my nose

Kim Leeson:
Because of the storm

Debbie Gibson:
Because it's raining

Kim Leeson and Debbie Gibson:
I don't even have my corsage, oh gee
It fell down a sewer with my sister's I.D.

Kim Leeson:
It's raining on prom night
Oh, wha tcan I do, it's raining from the skies
It's raining tears from my eyes over you
It's raining on prom night oh what can I do

Debbie Gibson:
Oh dear God please let him feel the same way I'm feeling right now.
Make him want to see me again and let him know that I'm the only girl
in the whole wide world for him and that someday we'll make that special
vow that'll bring us together forever and ever. What can I do.

Kim Leeson and Debbie Gibson:
It's raining rain from the skies
It's raining tears from my eyes over you

Kim Leeson and Debbie Gibson:
Raining, raining, raining, raining on prom night
Raining

<h3><center>I Wanna Destroy You</center></h3>

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

I feel it coming on again
Just like it did before
Then feed your pride some [motor?]
And they'll leave you wanting more

They way you treat each other
Makes me feel your guilt
And if you want to fight them
Then you're dying to get killed

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

You [hopped?] upon the media
Everything you read
They'll tell you your opinions
And they're very good indeed

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

When I have destroyed you, I'll come pick you at your bones
(ooh)
You won't have a single atom left to call your own

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

I wanna destroy you
(do do do do do do)
(do do do do do do)
I wanna destroy you
(do do do do do do)
(do do do do do do)

Destroy you
Destroy you
Destroy you
Destroy you...

Debbie Gibson:
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
You're here. That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow

John Leone:
But you will live 'Ponine - dear God above
If I could close your wounds with words of love

Debbie Gibson:
Just hold me now, and let it be
Shelter me, comfort me

John Leone:
You would live a hundred years
If I could show you how
I won't desert you now

Debbie Gibson:
The rain can't hurt me now
This rain will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I'll sleep in your embrace at last
The rain that brings you here
Is heaven blessed
The skies begin to clear
And I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain
Will make the flowers

John Leone:
Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine
You won't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt you now
I'm here
I will stay with you till you are sleeping
And rain
Will make the flowers
Grow

Keeth Stewart:
Baby I know it's time to go but
I've been meaning to tell you for some time
How special you are, the closeness I feel for you, girl

Debbie Gibson:
Oh, the one thing I need to know is, do you feel it, too?
'Cause every night I close my eyes
And you're all I'm thinking about

Debbie Gibson and Keeth Stewart:
'Cause it's so nice to go to sleep
With love under my pillow
It's so nice to know that someone cares
I hold you close to me
At night, 'til the morning light
The best of our words are right here with me
Love under my pillow

Debbie Gibson:
Baby when I held your hand
Well you showed me that you cared
'Cause I felt my heart leap out from my head to my feet

Debbie Gibson and Keeth Stewart:
I felt like I wanted to give you the world
If only it was mine to give
'Cause without your loving, I can't live

Debbie Gibson and Keeth Stewart:
It's so nice to go to sleep
With love under my pillow
It's so nice to know that someoen cares
I hold you close to me
At night, 'til the morning light
I have all your words
Right here with me
Under my pillow

Debbie Gibson and Keeth Stewart:
'Cause I no longer have to be alone - anymore
And I close my eyes and I shut the door
I turn up my favorite song
And baby I sing along
How can anything be so right
Nothin', nothin' at all is wrong

Debbie Gibson and Keeth Stewart:
It's so nice to go to sleep
With love under my pillow
It's so nice
It's so nice
I hold you close to me
At night, 'til the morning light
The best of our words and here with me
Under my pillow

Debbie Gibson and Keeth Stewart:
I got your words lying under my pillow
I got them all under my pillow
I got your words lying under my pillow

Love has flown all alone

Why, yi, yi, oh, why
You left me, oh, Sandy

I think, I wish, I hope, I pray
So now I'm gonna make it my reality
Someday

ooh...
Listen

Do you have to go shake your head yes or no
Do you have to tell me it isn't so
Do you wonder why it makes us cry
Everytime we say goodbye

Do you ever give in to what you believe
You know I never want you to leave
Do you wonder why it makes us cry
Everytime we say goodbye

Catch your breath and I'll catch mine
Why does it feel like the end of the world
I've read and I've seen and I've heard
About the power in that word
Goodbye, I know it's not forever
Goodbye, I don't understand
Why it seems so silly to cry
Everytime we say goodbye

I don't see how you've become so far away
I'm around the new friends that I have found
But you mean so much more
I just can't ignore you're the one that I adore

It's so crazy, there's just not a choice
My heart beats just to hear your voice
Do you wonder why it makes us cry
Everytime we say goodbye

Catch your breath and I'll catch mine
Why does it feel like the end of the world
I've read and I've seen and I've heard
About the power in that word
Goodbye, I know it's not forever
Goodbye, I don't understand
Why it seems so silly to cry
Everytime we say goodbye

Funny how when you are younger
You just giggle at a farewell kiss
I never knew it could be like this...
The way you're watching from the outside
You can see what's in a soul
I guess that loving someone makes us all

Catch your breath and I'll catch mine
Why does it feel like the end of the world
I've read and I've seen and I've heard
About the power in that word
Goodbye, I know it's not forever
Goodbye, I don't understand
Why it seems so silly to cry
Everytime we say goodbye

Say goodbye, say goodbye baby
Say goodbye, say goodbye baby
Say goodbye, say goodbye baby
Say goodbye, say goodbye baby...

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Let's get friendly
Let's get friendly

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Give me some friendly advice
Don't ask me twice

Don't twist my arm
Don't resist the power of my lucky charm
Don't wipe my number off your hand
'Cause you've got to understand

I'm tied down, so are you
But I'm also in love with you-know-who
We don't have to be an item, just a mutual attraction
I'm the stating the fact with a casual reaction

I don't want to be your lover, don't want to be just friends
Rules were made for breaking, rules were meant to bend
So since you can't be mine and I can't be yours completely
Let's not take it slowly, let's be friendly

Try to resist
Just a harmless kiss
We're still so young
No time for getting serious, let's have fun

Who knows in time
Maybe we'll change our mixed up minds
And we'll want so much more
But for now one thing's for sure

I don't want to be your lover, don't want to be just friends
Rules were made for breaking, rules were meant to bend
So since you can't be mine and I can't be yours completely
Let's not take it slowly. let's be friendly

I don't want to be your lover, I don't want to be just friends
Rules are meant for breaking, rules are meant to bend
So since you can't be mine and I can't be yours completely
Let's not take it slowly, let's eb friendly

I know the score, I know the circumstances
I see the door, but I just can't get up and leave
(oh no)
I'll follow you when my instincts are leading to you
Don't want to wake up all alone someday
And rememebr what I forgot to say

I don't want to be your lover, don't want to be just friends
Rules were made for breaking, rules were meant to bend
So since you can't be mine and I can't be yours completely
Let's not take it slowly, let's be friendly

I don't want to be
Rules were meant for breaking, rules are meant to bend
So since you can't be mine and I can't be yours completely
Let's be friendly... yeah

Hit me, hit me
Ton of bricks
Hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks

Something unexpected
Something so new
Something so crazy
Crazy like you
I mean, I knew you had a reputation
(Of flirtation)
And I knew you had a messed up mind
But you went and did it this time

You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks

You told me all about all the boys you loved
Every single romance you were ever dreaming of
Of course you knew I wasn't shy
(You know I was that type of guy)
I told you open up your eyes and see
I didn't know you had your eye on me

You hit me, hit me, hit me
You hit me, baby
Like a ton of bricks
(Ow)
You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
You hit me, hit me, hit me
You hit me
Like a ton of bricks

You could have prepared me for this shocking experience
(Huh!)
I can't even speak to you
Never mind giving you an answer
We've joked around but were never serious
(At least I never was)
But girl you really went and did it, did it
Girl ya really did it this time

Yeah, ow
Hit me, hit me, hit me

You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
You hit me, hit me
You hit me, hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks

You hit, hit, hit
Hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
Oh, hit me, hit me, hit me
You hit me, hit me, hit me, yeah
Like a ton of bricks

You hit, hit, hit
Hit me, hit me
Like a ton of bricks
You hit me, hit me
(Ow)
Hit me, hit me, hit me...

<p>
<H3>So What's A Search Link?</H3>
This is how we look for stuff on The World Wide Web. There's no order to 
the things you can find - no Dewey Decimal System or anything like that, 
so people created Search Engines and Indexes to help you find what you're 
looking for. <p>A lot of search pages are run by very nice people on a 
volunteer basis; these are sometimes good but they're sometimes out of 
date or incomplete or just plain inaccurate. <p>Other search pages are 
made by professionals who are paid by someone to make the search page. 
Think about it - ain't no such thing as a free lunch. These professional 
pages are usually up to date but frequently point you to things that cost 
you money, or they tout some specific company's stuff.

<CENTER><H3><STRONG>By Erika Henry</STRONG></H3></CENTER>

<P>----Hi! My name is Erika Henry.  I was born in 
<A HREF="http://www.ior.com/spk/info.html">Spokane, WA.</A> on March 6th 1976.
  My parents are <A HREF="family.html#Dad"> John F. </A>and 
<A HREF="family.html#mom">Virginia M. Henry</A>.  I went to Head Start when 
I was 3 and 4.  When I was 4, my Aunt Rosy and Uncle Kenny gave my family my 
first cat <A HREF="family.html#sam1">Sam</A>.  Soon after Sam was given to 
us, my Mom had my brother <A HREF="family.html#jim">James (Jim) Henry</A>.  
After Head Start, I went to Logan Elementary School for K-4th grade.  In 
kindergarten I met <A HREF="friends.html#Shai">Shai Bray-Waters</A>.   In 
1985, our next door neighbor was moving, and could not take her cat 
<A HREF="family.html#babe">Babe</A>.  To save the cat, she was given to my 
parents.  After 4th grade, my family moved to the South Hill in Spokane.  For 
5th-6th grade, I went to Franklin Elementary School.  I went to Libby Middle 
School for 7th and 8th grade.  At Libby, I met 
<A HREF="friends.html#D">Josh Dellinger</A> and 
<A HREF="friends.html#Neil">Neil Sunderland</A>.  
</P>
<P>----In 1990, I started Ferris High School.  In 9th grade, I met 
<A HREF="friends.html#Alto">Josh Alto</A> and 
<A HREF="friends.html#Sam2>Sam Park</A>, and someone I met at school found a 
cat, and gave it to me.  We named the cat 
<A HREF="family.html#hilary">Hilary</A>.  In 10th grade, I met 
<A HREF="friends.html#Tim">Tim Lane</A>.  He and I dated for a year and a 
half.  In 11th grade,  I met <A HREF="friends.html#Adam">Adam Forster</A>, 
<A HREF="friends.html#Jack">John (Jack) Prevost</A>, and 
<A HREF="friends.html#Forrest">Forrest Carman</A>.  I met Adam first, and 
soon after we started dating I met Jack and Forrest through him.  I also got 
to know Josh D., Josh A., and Neil.  Adam and I dated off and on for 3 years.  
During my last year of high school, Sam (my cat) became blind and stopped 
eating.  He was very old, so we had to put him to sleep.  The summer between 
graduation and starting college, I met 
<A HREF="friends.html#Jerry"> Jerry Ha</A>.  
</P>
<P>----After High School, I went to <A HREF="http://www.ewu.edu">Eastern 
Washington University</A>.  I started working at Tawanka (campus dining 
service).  There I met <A HREF="friends.html#Abe">Abraham Deweese</A>.  
While I was at college, my family got a new cat.  We named him 
<A HREF="family.html#mikey">Mikey</A>.  Some time after Mikey came, Hilary 
brought us a hamster.  My silly brother thought it would be a good idea to 
call him Fred, so he became Fred.  In 1995, Mikey, we think, was hit by a 
car, and soon after he died.  The year got worse when Fred died of natural 
causes.  Soon after his death, a friend had to get rid of her cat.  We took 
in the cat, and named him <A HREF="family.html#Buddy">Buddy</A>.  
</P>
<P>
Right now I'm a Junior at EWU, going for a bachelors in Child Development.  
For more information about me, please see my <A HREF="resume.html">resume</A>.

<h3><strong><A NAME="Shai">Shai</A></strong></h3> --- I met Shai when we were 
in kindergarden at Logon Elementery.  At first Shai and I were not very close 
friends.  We could play to together for a few hours then we would start 
arguing.  As we got older we could spend weeks togther.  Soon after meeting 
Shai, her mom had her sister Chelsea.  When her mom got a divorce her family 
moved a few times.  We still saw each other every once in a while, but not as 
often.  Shai is married to her second husband, and has 3 kids.  Two of the 
kids are her husbands, and she has a little girl.

not start to be come friends until my second year at EWU.  It was then that 
we started talking over lunch after work.  Abraham is one of the nices 
people I know.  Why do you ask???  He is the type for person that can 
make any person feel like a close friend.  Plus he is very funny. (if 
you can't tell from the picture)  He has come up with some wierd stories 
that will have you on the floor laughing your head off.  He received his 
bachelors in Buisness in 1996.

<STRONG><H3>Magic the Gathering</STRONG></H3>
<p>----My addiction to Magic started in 1993.  At that time the Beta card 
edition was out, and I was poor.  If I had known that Betas were going to 
be worth as much as they are, I would have bought more than one starter.  
My friends bought lots of cards though.  They played non-stop.  Soon they 
were all better at the game than I was, so I stopped playing.  By the time I 
stopped playing I had a few Betas, lots of Unlimiteds, and Arabian Nights.  
What to do with the box of cards??  That was about the time that the 
differences between the Alphas , and Betas were noticed.  My friends then 
joined a trading and gaming group to trade for these rare cards.  While they 
were off playing and trading, I talked to a couple people who collected the 
cards.  I thought that it would be neat to have a complet set of Betas.  I 
thought since most of the Alphas were sold on the east coast, that being on 
the west coast, I would not get many.  The first complete set I ever had was 
a set of Arabian Nights.  My friend Neil and my boyfriend bought it for me 
for $20.  (now it is worth over $450)  After the Unlimiteds were no longer in 
stores, I started collecting Unlimiteds, and so on.  I now have about 5,000 
cards, some cards in German, French, and Italian.  I also have 14 started 
sets of rare, unlimited, and common of each basic and expansion set since 
Beta (only  2 of those are complete).  Plus I have 14 common sets (4 not 
complete).  To complete these sets I have made a list of cards I need.  I 
buy, sell, and trade cards.  If you're intersted please check out my 
<A HREF="wantlist.html">cards wanted list</A> or

<STRONG><H3>Snapple</H3></STRONG>
<P>----I started collecting Snapple labels my freshman year of college 
<1994>.  It all started when I started buying Snapple after work.  I would 
drink it on my way to class, then hide it in my bag during class.  After 
class I would forget that it was in there until I got back to my dorm room.  
My being the recycleing type person, I would put them on top of my shelves 
until I was ready to recycle them.  

Well one day my neighbor came into my room and asked if I was collecting 
Snapple bottles.  I told her no.  After she left I saw a Snapple commercial 
where they gave someone a ton of his favorite Snapple flavor.  My roommate 
was watching with me, and said that I could be on that commercial.  She 
thought that I could write in that I had collected all the Snapples I could 
find in Cheney, and could they send a list of ones I don't have.  She thought 
then maybe they would give me one of each flavor instead of a list.  I would 
have a lifetime supply.  After that I saved every flavor I could find.</P>
<br>
<P>----Here is a list of all the flavors I have.  If there are others I don't 
have listed please send e-mail to me at

<STRONG><H3>Comics</H3></STRONG>
<p>----My intrest in comics started in 1993.  That is when my boyfriend Adam 
told me about Elf Quest.  I ended up going to the library and getting all the 
graphic novels they had.  After reading them I moved on to the first book of 
<EM>The Blood of Ten Chiefs</EM>.  I thought that the stories were very 
intresting, and explained a lot on why they are the people they are.  The one 
problem was that I missed the pictures.  Sometime later Adam went to Seattle, 
WA. and bought a ton of comics.  Soon I started going to a comic book shop 
and looking at comics too.  I found some back issues of Elf Quest that went 
past the novels I had read.  I also found Ranma 1/2.  I remembered how funny 
the Ranma 1/2 was from the Japanese animation a friend got in Japan.  
Most of what I saw of Ranma 1/2 was in Japanese, so it was great to finaly 
know what they were saying.  After reading all of Ranma I can find and a lot 
of Elf Quest, I expanded to Mermaid Forest, (Oh!) Ah! My Goddess, and Magic 
Mates.  For now I'm just looking for new and back issues of those 4.  If you 
have any issues that I don't have that you want to part with, please write me 
at <A HREF="mailto:Pulch@olivier.dementia.org">Pulch@olivier.dementia.org</A>.  
Thanks!!</p>

<H3><STRONG>Elf Quest:</STRONG></H3>
<p>
----Elf Quest is a story about a tribe of elves.  Mostly the comics are about 
the life of Cutter and his tribe, the Wolfriders.  It goes through them 
fighting humans, finding other elf tribes, and finding out about the history 
of the elves.  The newer comics, (sence the 9th graphic novel), have been 
about other tribes, how the future is for the humans, and how the 
wolfrider split up to fight an evil human king that is trying to get rid of 
the wolfriders (with the help of an evil elf named Winnowill).  The books are 
short stories about the past (sence the elves got to the planet of Two Moons) 
of the Wolfriders.  It goes throught parts of the lives of the wolfriders, 
and their chiefs.

<p>In 1993 I went to Incon (a game convention in Spokane, WA.).  At Incon they were giving out free Magic the gathering (Beta) booster packs to everyone who entered.  Ever since then I have been collecting one of <STRONG>all</STRONG> the cards (except Alphas).  The list that follows is an (incomplete) list of magic cards I'm looking for to complete my collection.  If you have any that you are willing to trade of sell please e-mail me at:  <A HREF="mailto:Pulch@olivier.dementia.org">Pulch@olivier.dementia.org</A>.  Do to size difference of some of the names, I have cut the names to make them fit.  If the name is confusing please e-mail me (address is above), and I will change it back.  Thanks!! </P>

<BODY BGCOLOR=#0000FF TEXT=#FFFFFF LINK=#FF7F00 VLINK=#C0C0C0>

<P>I'm a brother of Alpha Phi Omega, a National Co-Ed Service
Fraternity.  I pledged in the Fall of 1990 at Kappa Chapter at
Carnegie Mellon University, in the Lorin A. Jurvis Pledge Class, and
have been an active brother ever since.  After I graduated from CMU in
1994, I went to graduate school at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
where I became involved in Alpha Sigma Chapter and am still an active
brother.

<P>Some fraternity-related links of mine:

<TITLE>Jeff's Research Interests</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#0000FF TEXT=#FFFFFF LINK=#FF7F00 VLINK=#C0C0C0>

My research interests are in the realm of physical chemistry.
Specifically, I'm studying second-order nonlinear optical effects,
including Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) and Hyper-Rayleigh
Scattering (HRS).  I also study nonlinear absorption phenomena, such
as two-photon-induced fluorescence (TPF).  Currently I'm studying a
molecule called DANS (4-dimethylamino-4'-nitrostilbene) and its
interesting nonlinear properties for potential applications to the
optronics industries.

my research.

<P>Visit Jeff's <A HREF="anti-legalization.html">Compendium of
Arguments Against Drug Legalization</A>.

<P>For better or for worse, I occasionally participate in political
discussion groups on Usenet.  Thus I know all about getting
"flamed". :-)

<P>I consider myself to be a "moderate Republican".  What does this
mean?  Well, I agree with the Republican Party on most of their
issues, but I differ with them on some of the more important ones.

<P>Some relevant Republican links:

Installed on the Web: Sun Sep 17 18:14:08 EDT 1995
<P>
This program fits experimental data to one of five single/double
stretched/unstretched exponentials and also calculates the average tau
value for the experiment.  Its primary purpose is for fitting a curve
to results obtained from SHG (Second Harmonic Generation) relaxation
experiments.
<P>
The program is written in C, is ANSI-compliant, and tested on SunOS

<BODY>
From: <A HREF="http://cse.unl.edu/~bvh">Ben Hollingsworth (bvh@cse.unl.edu)</A>
<P>
<BR>
Are You a Guy?
<P>
Take This Scientific Quiz to Determine Your Guyness Quotient
<P>
<BR>
1. Alien beings from a highly advanced society visit the Earth, <BR>
and you are the first human they encounter. As a token of <BR>
intergalactic friendship, they present you with a small but <BR>
incredibly sophisticated device that is capable of curing all <BR>
disease, providing an infinite supply of clean energy, wiping out <BR>
hunger and poverty, and permanently eliminating oppression and <BR>
violence all over the entire Earth. You decide to:
<P>
a. Present it to the president of the United States.<BR>
b. Present it to the secretary general of the United Nations. <BR>
c. Take it apart.
<P>
<BR>
2. As you grow older, what lost quality of your youthful life do <BR>
you miss the most?
<P>
a. Innocence.<BR>
b. Idealism.<BR>
c. Cherry bombs.
<P>
<BR>
3. When is it okay to kiss another male?
<P>
a. When you wish to display simple and pure affection without <BR>
regard for narrow-minded social conventions.<BR>
b. When he is the pope. (Not on the lips.)<BR>
c. When he is your brother and you are Al Pacino and this is the <BR>
only really sportsmanlike way to let him know that, for business <BR>
reasons, you have to have him killed.
<P>
<BR>
4. What about hugging another male?
<P>
a. If he's your father and at least one of you has a fatal <BR>
disease.<BR>
b. If you're performing the Heimlich maneuver. (And even in this <BR>
case, you should repeatedly shout: "I am just dislodging food <BR>
trapped in this male's trachea! I am not in any way aroused!") <BR>
c. If you're a professional baseball player and a teammate hits<BR>
a home run to win the World Series, you may hug him provided that <BR>
(1) He is legally within the basepath, (2) Both of you are wear- <BR>
ing protective cups, and (3) You also pound him fraternally with <BR>
your fist hard enough to cause fractures.
<P>
<BR>
5. Complete this sentence: A funeral is a good time to...
<P>
a. ...remember the deceased and console his loved ones.<BR>
b. ...reflect upon the fleeting transience of earthly life.<BR>
c. ...tell the joke about the guy who has Alzheimer's disease and <BR>
cancer.
<P>
<BR>
6. In your opinion, the ideal pet is:
<P>
a. A cat.<BR>
b. A dog.<BR>
c. A dog that eats cats.
<P>
<BR>
7. You have been seeing a woman for several years. She's <BR>
attractive and intelligent, and you always enjoy being with her. <BR>
One leisurely Sunday afternoon the two of you are taking it easy-- <BR>
you're watching a football game; she's reading the papers--when <BR>
she suddenly, out of the clear blue sky, tells you that she<BR>
thinks she really loves you, but she can no longer bear the <BR>
uncertainty of not knowing where your relationship is going. She <BR>
says she's not asking whether you want to get married; only <BR>
whether you believe that you have some kind of future together. <BR>
What do you say?
<P>
a. That you sincerely believe the two of you do have a future, <BR>
but you don't want to rush it.<BR>
b. That although you also have strong feelings for her, you <BR>
cannot honestly say that you'll be ready anytime soon to make a <BR>
lasting commitment, and you don't want to hurt her by holding out <BR>
false hope.<BR>
c. That you cannot believe the Jets called a draw play on third <BR>
and seventeen.
<P>
<BR>
8. Okay, so you have decided that you truly love a woman and you <BR>
want to spend the rest of your life with her-sharing the joys and <BR>
the sorrows, the triumphs and the tragedies, and all the <BR>
adventures and opportunities that the world has to offer, come <BR>
what may. How do you tell her?
<P>
a. You take her to a nice restaurant and tell her after dinner. <BR>
b. You take her for a walk on a moonlit beach, and you say her <BR>
name, and when she turns to you, with the sea breeze blowing her <BR>
hair and the stars in her eyes, you tell her.<BR>
c. Tell her what?
<P>
<BR>
9. One weekday morning your wife wakes up feeling ill and asks <BR>
you to get your three children ready for school. Your first <BR>
question to her is:
<P>
a. "Do they need to eat or anything?" <BR>
b. "They're in school already?"<BR>
c. "There are three of them?"
<P>
<BR>
10. When is it okay to throw away a set of veteran underwear?
<P>
a. When it has turned the color of a dead whale and developed new <BR>
holes so large that you're not sure which ones were originally <BR>
intended for your legs.<BR>
b. When it is down to eight loosely connected underwear molecules <BR>
and has to be handled with tweezers.<BR>
c. It is never okay to throw away veteran underwear. A real guy <BR>
checks the garbage regularly in case somebody--and we are not <BR>
naming names, but this would be his wife--is quietly trying to <BR>
discard his underwear, which she is frankly jealous of, because <BR>
the guy seems to have a more intimate relationship with it than <BR>
with her.
<P>
<BR>
11. What, in your opinion, is the most reasonable explanation for <BR>
the fact that Moses led the Israelites all over the place for <BR>
forty years before they finally got to the Promised Land?
<P>
a. He was being tested.<BR>
b. He wanted them to really appreciate the Promised Land when <BR>
they finally got there.<BR>
c. He refused to ask directions.
<P>
<BR>
12. What is the human race's single greatest achievement?
<P>
a. Democracy.<BR>
b. Religion.<BR>
c. Remote control.
<P>
<BR>
How to Score: Give yourself one point for every time you picked <BR>
answer "c." A real guy would score at least 10 on this test. In <BR>
fact, a real guy would score at least 15, because he would get <BR>
the special five-point bonus for knowing the joke about the guy <BR>
who has Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

I have 2 for chemical engineers:
<P>
1). Chemical engineer: n. A person who does for profit what a chemist<BR>
    does for fun. see also "Prostitution"<BR>
2). Q: What is the difference between a chemist and a chemical engineer?<BR>
    A: Oh, about $10 K a year.*
<P>
* Fill in the going rate. That's what it was when I was the sole Chem E.<BR>
  in a chemistry lab ;-)
<P>
I also heard a shaggy dog story once about a skilled but sinful engineer who <BR>
died, went to hell, and remodeled the place. It included mentioning that he<BR>
used all the free energy and built an air conditioner so powerful that the<BR>
place now offers snow-skiing (yes, it really DID freeze over) and nobody<BR>
wanted to go to heaven any more.

COLLEGE LIGHTBULB JOKES
<P>
How many CMU students does it take to change a lightbulb?<BR>
four --one to design a fusion-powered one that never needs changing,<BR>
        one to figure out how to power the rest of Pittsburgh using that<BR>
        lightbulb, one to install it, and one to write the computer code that<BR>
        controls the wall switch.
<P>
How many MIT students does it take to change a lightbulb?<BR>
three--- one to call CMU to see how they did it,<BR>
one to screw it in, and<BR>
one to take the credit.

From: Lori Susan Browne (00210235@BIGRED.unl.edu)<P>

     YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE TOO LONG WHEN...<BR>
<BR>
* You consider McDonald's "real food"<BR>
<BR>
* You actually like doing laundry at home<BR>
<BR>
* 4:00 AM is still early on the weekends<BR>
<BR>
* It starts getting late on the weeknights<BR>
<BR>
* Two miles is not too far to walk for a party<BR>
<BR>
* You wear dirty socks three times in a row and think nothing of it<BR>
<BR>
* You'd rather clean than study<BR>
<BR>
* "Oh f*** how did it get so late!" comes out of your mouth at least<BR>
once a night<BR>
<BR>
* Half the time you don't wake up in your own bed and it seems normal<BR>
<BR>
* Minesweeper is more than a game it's a way of life<BR>
<BR>
* You schedule your classes around sleep habits and soaps<BR>
<BR>
* You know the pizza boy by name<BR>
<BR>
* You go to sleep when it's light and get up when it's dark<BR>
<BR>
* You live for getting mail<BR>
<BR>
* Looking out the window is a form of entertainment<BR>
<BR>
* Prank phone calls become funny again<BR>
<BR>
* It feels weird to take a shower without shoes on<BR>
<BR>
* Whole wars can take place, and you are clueless (no connection to<BR>
the outside world)<BR>
<BR>
* You start thinking and sounding like your roommate<BR>
<BR>
* Blacklights and highlighters are the coolest things on earth<BR>
<BR>
* Rearranging your room is your favorite pastime<BR>
<BR>
* You find out milk crates had so many uses<BR>
<BR>
* Wal-mart is the coolest store<BR>
<BR>
* The weekend lasts from Thursday to Sunday, (or Wednesday morning to<BR>
Tuesday night<BR>
<BR>
* People guard their quarters as if they're worth more than $0.25<BR>
<BR>
* You wash your dishes as a last resort of procrastination<BR>
<BR>
* "Going out for coffee" isn't fashionable--it's a necessity.<BR>
<BR>
* You are sitting around making lists about how you know you've been<BR>
in college too long<BR>

50 Fun things to do in a final that does not matter (i.e. you are going<BR>
   to fail the class completely no matter what you get on the final exam)<P>

  1.  Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15<BR>
  minutes. Wake up, say "oh geez, better get cracking" and do some<BR>
  gibberish work. Turn it in a few minutes early.<BR>
<BR>
  2.  Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming "Andre, Andre, I've got the<BR>
  secret documents!!"<BR>
<BR>
  3.  If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is long<BR>
  answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be creative. Use the<BR>
  integral symbol.<BR>
<BR>
  4.  Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the instructor's<BR>
  left nostril.<BR>
<BR>
  5.  Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud, debate<BR>
  your answers with yourself out loud. If asked to stop, yell out, "I'm<BR>
  SOOO sure you can hear me thinking." Then start talking about what a jerk<BR>
  the instructor is.<BR>
<BR>
  6.  Bring cheerleaders.<BR>
<BR>
  7.  Walk in, get the exam, sit down. About five minutes into it, loudly<BR>
  say to the instructor, "I don't understand ANY of this. I've been to<BR>
  every lecture all semester long! What's the deal? And who the hell are<BR>
  you? Where's the regular guy?"<BR>
<BR>
  8.  Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc...). Play with the volume at max<BR>
  level.<BR>
<BR>
  9.  On the answer sheet (book, whatever) find a new, interesting way to<BR>
  refuse to answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this<BR>
  question on the grounds that it conflicts with my religious beliefs. Be<BR>
  creative.<BR>
<BR>
  10.  Bring pets.<BR>
<BR>
  11.  Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a sigh of<BR>
  relief. Go to the instructor, say "They've found me, I have to leave the<BR>
  country" and run off.<BR>
BR>
  12.  Fifteen minutes into the exam, stand up, rip up all the papers into<BR>
  very small pieces, throw them into the air and yell out "Merry<BR>
  Christmas."  If you're really daring, ask for another copy of the exam.<BR>
  Say you lost the first one. Repeat this process every fifteen minutes.<BR>
<BR>
  13.  Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers.<BR>
<BR>
  14.  Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel on your<BR>
  head, and nothing else.<BR>
<BR>
  15.  Come down with a BAD case of Turet's Syndrome during the exam. Be as<BR>
  vulgar as possible.<BR>
<BR>
  16.  Do the entire exam in another language. If you don't know one, make<BR>
  one up!  For math/science exams, try using Roman numerals.<BR>
<BR>
  17.  Bring things to throw at the instructor when s/he's not looking.<BR>
  Blame it on the person nearest to you.<BR>
<BR>
  18.  As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it.<BR>
<BR>
  19.  Walk into the exam with an entourage. Claim you are going to be<BR>
  taping your next video during the exam. Try to get the instructor to let<BR>
  them stay, be persuasive. Tell the instructor to expect a percentage of<BR>
  the profits if they are allowed to stay.<BR>
<BR>
  20.  Every five minutes, stand up, collect all your things, move to<BR>
  another seat, continue with the exam.<BR>
<BR>
  21.  Turn in the exam approximately 30 minutes into it. As you walk out,<BR>
  start commenting on how easy it was.<BR>
<BR>
  22.  Do the entire exam as if it was multiple choice and true/false. If<BR>
  it is a multiple choice exam, spell out interesting things (DCCAB. BABE.<BR>
  etc..).<BR>
<BR>
  23.  Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and answers<BR>
  completely blacked out.<BR>
<BR>
  24.  Get the exam. Twenty minutes into it, throw your papers down<BR>
  violently, scream out "Fuck this!" and walk out triumphantly.<BR>
<BR>
  25.  Arrange a protest before the exam starts (i.e. Threaten the<BR>
  instructor that whether or not everyone's done, they are all leaving<BR>
  after one hour to go drink)<BR>
<BR>
  26.  Show up completely drunk. (Completely drunk means at some point<BR>
  during the exam, you should start crying for mommy).<BR>
<BR>
  27.  Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor asks why,<BR>
  tell him/her in a very derogatory tone, "the light bulb that goes on<BR>
  above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a clapper. DUH!"<BR>
<BR>
  28.  Comment on how sexy the instructor is looking that day.<BR>
<BR>
  29.  Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30 minutes, put<BR>
  on a white mask and start yelling "I'm here, the phantom of the opera"<BR>
  until they drag you away.<BR>
<BR>
  30.  Go to an exam for a class you have no clue about, where you know the<BR>
  class is very small, and the instructor would recognize you if you belonged.<BR>
  Claim that you have been to every lecture. Fight for your right to take<BR>
  the exam.<BR>
<BR>
  31.  Upon receiving the exam, look it over, while laughing loudly, say<BR>
  "you don't really expect me to waste my time on this drivel? Days of our<BR>
  Lives is on!!!"<BR>
<BR>
  32.  Bring a water pistol with you. Nuff said.<BR>
<BR>
  33.  From the moment the exam begins, hum the theme to Jeopardy. Ignore<BR>
  the instructor's requests for you to stop. When they finally get you to<BR>
  leave one way or another, begin whistling the theme to the Bridge on the<BR>
  River Kwai.<BR>
<BR>
  34.  Start a brawl in the middle of the exam.<BR>
<BR>
  35.  If the exam is math/science related, make up the longest proofs you<BR>
  could possibly think of. Get pi and imaginary numbers into most<BR>
  equations. If it is a written exam, relate everything to your own life<BR>
  story.<BR>
<BR>
  36.  Come in wearing a full knight's outfit, complete with sword and<BR>
  shield.<BR>
<BR>
  37.  Bring a friend to give you a back massage the entire way through the<BR>
  exam. Insist this person is needed, because you have bad circulation.<BR>
<BR>
  38.  Bring cheat sheets FOR ANOTHER CLASS (make sure this is obvious...<BR>
  like history notes for a calculus exam... otherwise you're not just<BR>
  failing, you're getting kicked out too) and staple them to the exam, with<BR>
  the comment "Please use the attached notes for references as you see fit."<BR>
<BR>
  39.  When you walk in, complain about the heat. Strip.<BR>
<BR>
  40.  After you get the exam, call the instructor over, point to any<BR>
  question, ask for the answer. Try to work it out of him/her.<BR>
<BR>
  41.  One word: Wrestlemania.<BR>
<BR>
  42.  Bring balloons, blow them up, start throwing them around like they<BR>
  do before concerts start.<BR>
<BR>
  43.  Try to get people in the room to do the wave.<BR>
<BR>
  44.  Play frisbee with a friend at the other side of the room.<BR>
<BR>
  45.  Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right next to you.<BR>
  Pray to it often. Consider a small sacrifice.<BR>
<BR>
  46.  Get deliveries of candy, flowers, balloons, telegrams, etc... sent<BR>
  to you every few minutes throughout the exam.<BR>
<BR>
  47.  During the exam, take apart everything around you. Desks, chairs,<BR>
  anything you can reach.<BR>
<BR>
  48.  Complete the exam with everything you write being backwards at a 90<BR>
  degree angle.<BR>
<BR>
  49.  Bring a musical instrument with you, play various tunes. If you are<BR>
  asked to stop, say "it helps me think." Bring a copy of the Student Handbook<BR>
  with you, challenging the instructor to find the section on musical<BR>
  instruments during finals. Don't forget to use the phrase "Told you so".<BR>
<BR>
  50.  Answer the exam with the "Top Ten Reasons Why Professor xxxx Sucks"

HOW TO TELL IF YOU'RE AN IDIOT
<P>
  answer the following multiple choice questions and find out!
<P>
You are next in a long line for the check out counter at the grocery <BR>
store.  The clerk rings up your groceries and gives you the total.  You....
<P>
a.  pay in cash, get your change and quickly move along.<BR>
b.  pay with a check that you have already started to fill out.<BR>
c.  stare blankly at the clerk, mouth agape, after anouncing that  you have <BR>
	no cash and you've left your checkbook at home.
<P>
You are watching a T.V. A comercial urges you to call a 900 number and recieve<BR>
personal advice from a live psychic, at $5.00 per minute.  You...
<P>
a.  chuckle to yourself and change the channel.<BR>

c.  dial the number and chat with Madam Tosha, into the night, about your<BR>
	financial woes.
<P>
Yours is the first in a line of cars stopped at a traffic light.  The<BR>

	phenomenon.<BR>
b.  look both ways, just to be safe, then drive through the intersection.<BR>
c.  examine the booger you've just picked from your nose and wonder why<BR>
	the people behind you are beeping their horns.

Ten Things That Would Be Different if Microsoft Started Building Cars<BR>
<BR>
1. A particular model year of car wouldn't be available until after<BR>
   that year instead of before it.<BR>
<BR>
2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you'd have to buy<BR>
   a new car.<BR>
<BR>
3. Occasionally your car would just die for no reason, and you'd have<BR>
   to restart it. For some strange reason, you'd just accept this.<BR>
<BR>
4. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you<BR>
   bought a Car 95 or a Car NT. But then you'd have to buy more seats.<BR>
<BR>
5. Sun Motorsystems would make a car that was powered by the sun,<BR>
   twice as reliable, and five times as fast -- but it would only run<BR>
   on 5 percent of the roads.<BR>
<BR>
6. The oil, engine, gas, and alternator warning lights would be<BR>
   replaced with a single "General Car Fault" warning light.<BR>
<BR>
7. People would get excited about the "new" features in Microsoft<BR>
   cars, forgetting completely that they had been available in other<BR>
   cars for years.<BR>
<BR>
8. We'd all have to switch to Microsoft gas.<BR>
<BR>
9. The U.S. government would be *getting* subsidies from an<BR>
automaker,     instead of giving them.<BR>
<BR>
10. New seats would force everyone to have the same-size butt.

From: Tim Clougherty (tpc@formtek.com) <P>

An *actual* bug report filed with Microsoft ...
<P>
Bug #   Status          Title<BR>
5143    ACTIVE          "Build done" signal makes no sound
<P>
============ ACTIVE - 01/30/95 - MIKEBLAS ====================
<P>
Visual C++ makes an audible signal when a build completes.  When no<BR>
developer is in the room, this signal doesn't make a sound.  To reproduce:
<P>
1) Start a build.<BR>
2) Leave the room.<BR>
3) Note that the chime does not make a sound.
<P>
We should find a way to make the build bell make a sound even if nobody<BR>
is there to hear it.
<P>
This philosophical issue may need program management's attention before<BR>
being resolved.
<P>
============ ASSIGNED to MATTHEWT - 01/30/95 - SCOTF =========
<P>
Can we use the telepathy support in Win95 to contact whomever is logged<BR>
into the machine doing the build?  Maybe we should just detect when the<BR>
developer is leaving the room and prompt for a phone number where s/he<BR>
can be reached.
<P>
How about disabling leaving the room during a build?
<P>
============ RESOLVED - BY DESIGN - 01/31/95 - MATTHEWT ======<BR>
============ ACTIVE - 02/01/95 - MARKLAM =====================
<P>
Actually, we can't do this either. The problem is that while you're out<BR>
of the room your build is neither finished nor unfinished.  It stays in<BR>
a state of flux until you return and collapse the quantum uncertainty by<BR>
observing it.
<P>
Perhaps we could link the build finished event to a cat in a box?
<P>
============ ASSIGNED to HEISENBERG - 02/01/95 - MARKLAM =====<BR>
============ RESOLVED - NOT REPRO - 02/03/95 - HEISENBERG ====
<P>
I cannot repro this.  I tried standing just outside my door and it made<BR>
the beep.  Do I have to go further from my office?  Would the mailroom<BR>
do?
<P>
============ ACTIVE - 02/03/95 - MIKEBLAS ====================
<P>
The relative position of the mailroom and your office are relatively<BR>
uncertain to me, Doctor.
<P>
Please try again:
<P>
1) start a build<BR>
2) leave your office<BR>
3) go down the hall<BR>
4) wait until you don't hear the beep<BR>
5) return to note that the build is done
<P>
I think this is how I first repro'ed the problem, but I can't remember<BR>
what I was doing to make it happen.
<P>
The idea of disabling leaving the room might be the best possible<BR>
solution, I think.  When a build starts, the IDE should pop up a message<BR>
that says "There are no more Fritos" or "The kitchen has closed early" or<BR>
"The bathroom is being cleaned" so the developer will not be tempted to<BR>
get up and wander around.
<P>
With minimal rebuild in place, we should consider diversions that won't<BR>
take as long to remedy: "You're expecting a phone call" or "Someone will<BR>
stop by to see you soon".
<P>
We need to think of messages that are easy to localize for VC++3.0J.
<P>
============ ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/13/95 - MARKLAM =======
<P>
To do this we'll need to avoid messages about the bathrooms and vending<BR>
machines for external releases.  Perhaps some customer research is needed<BR>
to find out exactly *why* Visual C++ users leave their keyboards.
<P>
Some suggestions (including MB_ types)<BR>
Get a drink :<BR>
(i) You're out of coffee<BR>
(i) You're out of tea<BR>
(i)(i) YYoouuvv''ee hhaadd eennoouugghh
<P>
Get something to eat :<BR>
(?) You have no food, remember<BR>
/!\ You need to lose weight, fatso. Sit your ass down
<P>
Exercise etc :<BR>
(?) Did You Know - sunlight causes skin cancer<BR>
(i) With a Nordik Trak you can get a workout in front of your monitor.<BR>
    Call for home delivery.<BR>
/!\ I didn't mean that about your weight
<P>
See family :<BR>
(i) They already know you love them<BR>
/!\ They'll only want money for something<BR>
/!\ Your in-laws have arrived
<P>
Call of nature :<BR>
    This could be difficult. Consider supplying bed-pan or similar.
<P>
============ ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/13/95 - MARKLAM =======<BR>
============ ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/16/95 - HEISENBERG ====
<P>
I attempted to repro this once more:
<P>
I placed my machine in the forest at the edge of the campus. I started a<BR>
'rebuild all' and ran out of the forest towards my mailroom. My build<BR>
normally takes 3 minutes. After 5 minutes I had not heard anything, so I<BR>
returned to my machine. Unfortunately a tree had fallen on it. I had not<BR>
heard that, either.

An old woman was sitting in a park in Moscow reading a "Teach<BR>
Yourself Hebrew" book.  A policeman notices her and decides to<BR>
start to give her a hard time.
<P>
"What are you reading that for?" he shouts at her.
<P>
She replies,  "I am old, and I will die soon.  I want to be<BR>
prepared; so I am studying the language of heaven."
<P>
The cop says, "Well, how do know that it's heaven that you are going<BR>
to?"
<P>
The old women answers, "Well, honestly I don't, but that's okay.  I<BR>
already speak Russian."

LOS ANGELES TIMES, December 9:
<P>
A man walked into a branch of the Antelope Valley Bank and handed a teller<BR>
a note demanding money.  The man had one hand in his pocket, as if holding<BR>
a gun, so the teller began handing over the contents of her cash drawer.<BR>
 When she had forked over $7,000 the robber said, "That's enough" and walked<BR>
out the door.  It's hard to find a bank robber who knows when he's had enough.

Chalk up a new triumph for modern packaging in 1987!
<P>
I wanted to remove some Tie-Wraps from some equipment.   The usual way to<BR>
do this is with dikes (diagonal cutting pliers).   I didn't have those, so<BR>
I went to the stockroom and bought a pair.
<P>
They came in the usual bubble pack, but with an extra twist:  To keep them<BR>
closed during packing, the cutting tips were bound together----with a tie <BR>
wrap!
<P>
So I bought another pair to cut that tie wrap,  only to encounter the same<BR>
problem,  so I bought another pair to cut that one-----etc. etc. etc. etc.
<P>
I can hardly wait for '88.

<P>
Snoring and Calf Pain
<P>
Here's an article from the New England Journal of Medicine that reminds us<BR>
how simple some diagnoses can be.  A 66 year old man went to his general<BR>
practitioner, complaining of pain and tenderness in his right calf for 4<BR>
days durations.  He said the pain was deep in the muscle and did not change<BR>
with position or exercise.
<P>
The doctor examined the man and couldn't find anything wrong, except that<BR>
he was tender over this spot in his right calf.  The patient has had a lot<BR>
of problems with snoring.  The doctor was unable to make a diagnosis.  A<BR>
couple of nights later this man was in bed and had just fallen asleep when<BR>
he was awakened by a sharp pain in his right calf.  The cause was a kick<BR>
from his wife.  He told her not to kick him there because that's where the<BR>
leg hurts.  She replied, "You were snoring again, and that's where I always<BR>
kick you to stop it."  Subsequently, his wife agreed to stop kicking his<BR>
calf in spite of the fact that he continued to snore and the leg got better.
<P>
 No lab test in the world would have picked that one up.

The US Department of Agriculture has encountered an unanticipated difficulty in<BR>
its project to develop robot fruit pickers.  To contain costs, the robots were<BR>
designed with monochrome scanners.  Unfortunately, to the robots, an orange has<BR>
the same size, shape, and brightness as a small cloud.  Current robot pickers<BR>
are often hung up literally reaching for the clouds.  The USDA says it's back<BR>
to the drawing board - this time using color.

<P>
	During the past few months, the BCS's Telecommunications Group has been<BR>
trying to develop a viable alternative to the FCC's proposal to impose a<BR>
tariff on computer data networks.  The group's work has received so much<BR>
national attention that the congressional committee that oversees the FCC<BR>
has asked the BCS to testify before Congress.<BR>
	The BCS is concerned, however, because our nonprofit, tax-exempt status<BR>
limits our ability to engage in activities that might be considered political<BR>
lobbying.  If the IRS feels that we have stepped outside our educational<BR>
mission, it could threaten to revoke the Society's charitable status. 	Thus,<BR>
when the director of the BCS's Telecommunications Group was told a few days<BR>
ago that an agent from the IRS had phoned and was waiting on hold to speak<BR>
with him, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.<BR>
	"I'd like to speak with you about your work on the FCC proposal," the<BR>
agent told our director.<BR>
	An ominous silence followed.<BR>
	"Yes," our director replied.<BR>
	"The IRS is the largest user of one of the leading data networks.  If this<BR>
proposal goes through, we're going to get hurt badly.  We could really use<BR>
the BCS's help."

     There are basic personality differences between engineers, research<BR>
     scientists, and theoretical mathemeticians.  This can be illustrated<BR>
     by the way each reacts to the same situation.  The situation is:<BR>
     waking up with one's bedroom curtains on fire.
<P>
     The engineer wakes up, sees that his curtains are on fire.  He quickly<BR>
     jumps out of bed and gets a bucket of water, throws the water on the<BR>
     flaming curtains, and puts the fire out.  Seeing that all is well,<BR>
     he then goes back to bed.
<P>
     The research scientist wakes up, sees that his curtains are on fire.<BR>
     He jumps out of bed, cuts a piece of the flaming curtain and carries<BR>
     it to the bathroom sink where he pours water on it.  He sees that<BR>
     pouring water on the fire will put it out, so he goes and gets a<BR>
     bucket of water and throws it on the flaming curtains.  The fire is<BR>
     now out, so he is satisfied and goes back to bed.
<P>
     The theoretical mathemetician wakes up, sees that his curtains are on<BR>
     fire.  He jumps out of bed, cuts off a piece of the flaming curtain, <BR>
     and carries it to the bathroom sink where he pours water on it.  He<BR>
     sees that the water put out the fire, and he is satisfied, so he goes<BR>
     back to bed.

A mathematician, scientist, and engineer are each asked:<BR>
"Suppose we define a horse's tail to be a leg.  How many legs does a horse<BR>

The mathematician answers "5"; the scientist "1"; and the engineer says<BR>
"But you can't do that!"

a technician, an engineer and a scientist were given the folowing problem<BR>
to solve :<BR>
  You are standing 20ft. away from a gorgeous female. You start walking<BR>
towards her with a speed, inversely proportional (specific relation given) to<BR>
the distance between you two. How long will it take you to reach her ?
<P>
following answers reflect the differences in their approaches :
<P>
the technician : forget the equations, I will catch her somehow, pretty soon.
<P>
the scientist : after doing a lot of paper work, says - well theoretically<BR>
speaking I can never get to her, because the distance will never be <BR>
theoretically zero.
<P>
the engineer : after doing a quick rough calculation, says - well I will reach<BR>
her in about 6sec, for ALL PRACTICAL PURPOPSES.

obey the speed limits," says the driver.  Finally Gorbachev<BR>
orders the driver into the back and takes the wheel.  Sure<BR>
enough a patrol car soon pulls them over.  The senior officer<BR>
orders the junior to go write up the ticket.  But the junior<BR>
officer comes back and says he can't give them a ticket, the<BR>
person in the car is too important.  "Well, who is it?", the<BR>
senior officer asks.  "I didn't recognize him," says the junior<BR>
officer, "but Comrade Gorbachev is his chauffeur."

Subject: The one which didn't get away
<P>
(The following appeared recently in the Globe & Mail.)
<P>
     Forget about Dog Bites Man.  Relegate Man Bites Dog to the back pages.<BR>
Today we are dealing with Fish swallows dog, an item which reaches us by<BR>
way of Moscow.  <BR>
      The dog was swimming across the Pechora River to join its master<BR>
when it vanished, leaving only a ripple.  The dog's master, who was fishing<BR>
at the time, hauled in his net and found it contained a giant pike.  He<BR>
looked closely at its mouth and said to himself (probably) "Thereby hangs a<BR>
tail."<BR>
     Yes, it was Fido (or the Russian equivalent).  The dog struggled out<BR>
after the fish was cut open, and, according to Radio Moscow, hurled itself<BR>
at the pike, "barking excitedly."<BR>
     It is often difficult for fishermen to tell stories about the one that<BR>
got away.  In this case,  Radio Moscow notwithstanding, will it be any easier<BR>
to tell about the one that didn't?

Los Angeles Times, January 15:
<P>
Computer programmers Joseph and Jonathan Seiber of Inscribe Inc. in<BR>
Cambridge, Massachusetts, designed a software package that produced<BR>
letter-perfect calligraphy.<BR>
 However, prospective buyers complained that it was too perfect,<BR>
lacking the slight irregularities and tiny flaws that real calligraphy<BR>
would have.<BR>
 So the Seibers went back to the drawing board, so to speak, and<BR>
introduced those little human touches into their software.  Now<BR>
business is booming and everyone is happy.

A rare delicacy is sauteed Sloth a la Dortmunder. Using the middle toe of<BR>
the great Australian three-toed sloth -- the only edible part of that large,<BR>
furry, indolent creature -- the careful chef debones it, pounds it as with<BR>
veal, and sautBees it briefly over a hot flame with shallots, carrot circles,<BR>
and just a touch of Tobasco. Prepared in this fashion, sloth is an excellent<BR>
main course, not unlike alligator in texture and taste.
<P>
Many people are under the false impression that sloth does not make a good<BR>
meal, but this is because they've eaten it improperly prepared. It can only<BR>
be sauteed, A LA DORTMUNDER, a fact ill-appreciated in culinary circles.
<P>
TOO MANY COOKS BROIL THE SLOTH!!!

The December 1987 issue of Space World magazine had a letter describing the<BR>
38th meeting of the Congress of the International Astronautical Federation<BR>
(IAF) held in Brighton, England the week of October 11, 1987.  There were<BR>
1,500 attendees and about 600 papers were presented.  Here is an excerpt.
<P>
"At least one Soviet speaker at the IAF was looking far beyond tomorrow.<BR>
 L. M. Shkadov, from the USSR Academy of Sciences, presented a paper in which<BR>
he proposed to use a solar sail to move the entire Solar System around the <BR>
galaxy.
<P>
His calculations showed that the Solar System could be moved a distance of<BR>
30 parsecs (about 98 light years) in one revolution of the Galaxy (about<BR>
200 million years) using a reflector some 400,000-800,000 miles in diameter<BR>
positioned so that the Sun's gravitational pull on the reflector would be<BR>
just balanced by the force of the solar radiation on the reflector.
<P>
The idea is to eventually move the Earth into the planetary system of a <BR>
relatively
<P>
young, solar-type star before our Sun begins the trauma of stellar <BR>
senescence."

A man goes to the doctor for a checkup. After the checkup, the<BR>
doctor tells the man he has bad news. "You only have six months<BR>
to live." The man sits for a while thinking, and then says,<BR>
"There's only one thing I can do, I'm going to become a<BR>
communist." The doctor says, "You've been a patriotic American<BR>
all your life, why are you going to become a communist now?"<BR>
The man says, "Better one of them should die than one of us."

A few years ago a refugee from Laos came to the US in one of the resettlement<BR>
influxes.  He had been an announcer in radio back in Laos, and he wanted<BR>
to get into the same line of work here.  The first thing he did was join<BR>
AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Announcers).
<P>
He tried to pursue a job, but of course, he had problems with the English<BR>
language, being a new resident.  In order to keep body and soul together<BR>
while going to English classes, he took up barbering.  Soon, he became a<BR>
very good barber, giving haircuts, stylings, and shaves.  He seemed to be<BR>
an artist with the straight razor.  In fact, the shop where he worked made<BR>
him specialize in giving shaves.
<P>
Thus, he became known as an AFTRA shave Laotian.

  This nice, old Jewish man really wanted to win the lottery.  So, one<BR>
week, he goes to synagogue and he says (good Yiddish accent<BR>
mandatory), "Oy, Lord of heaven and earth, imagine how much good I<BR>
could do with ze money I vould vin if I von the lottery!  Imagine how<BR>
much charity I could give!  Help me vin the lottery and I will spent<BR>
ze money wisely!"  He doesn't win the lottery.
<P>
  The next week, he goes to synagogue again and says, "Oh, lord of<BR>
heaven and earth, you must not have heard me last veek!  Imagine how<BR>
many lives I could make easier with ze money from ze lottery!  Help me<BR>
vin ze lottery!"  Once again, he doesn't win.
<P>
  The third week, he goes to synagogue again and prays in a similar<BR>
vein.  Suddenly, he hears a voice from the heavens:  "Help me, help<BR>
me!"
<P>
  He says, "Lord of heaven and earth, what can I do to help you?"
<P>
  "Buy a ticket!"

                            A Christmas poem
<P>
  'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<BR>
  How to live in a world that's politically correct?<BR>
  His workers no longer would answer to "Elves".<BR>
  "Vertically Challenged" they were calling themselves.<BR>
  And labor conditions at the north pole<BR>
  Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.
<P>
  Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<BR>
  Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<BR>
  And equal employment had made it quite clear<BR>
  That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<BR>
  So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<BR>
  Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!<BR>
  The runners had been removed from his sleigh;<BR>
  The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<BR>
  And people had started to call for the cops<BR>
  When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.<BR>
  Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<BR>
  His fur trimmed red suit was called "Unenlightened."
<P>
  And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<BR>
  Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose<BR>
  And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<BR>
  Demanding millions in over-due compensation.<BR>
  So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,<BR>
  Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,<BR>
  Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,<BR>
  Demanding from now on her title was Ms.
<P>
  And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion<BR>
  That making a choice could cause so much commotion.<BR>
  Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<BR>
  Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<BR>
  Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<BR>
  Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.<BR>
  Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<BR>
  Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.<BR>
  Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<BR>
  Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.
<P>
  No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<BR>
  Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<BR>
  And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,<BR>
  Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.<BR>
  For they raised the hackles of those psychological<BR>
  Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.<BR>
  No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;<BR>
  Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.<BR>
  Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;<BR>
  And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.
<P>
  So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;<BR>
  He just could not figure out what to do next.<BR>
  He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<BR>
  But you've got to be careful with that word today.<BR>
  His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;<BR>
  Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.
<P>
  Something special was needed, a gift that he might<BR>
  Give to all without angering the left or the right.<BR>
  A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<BR>
  Each group of people, every religion;<BR>
  Every ethnicity, every hue,<BR>
  Everyone, everywhere...even you.<BR>
  So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<BR>
  "May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth."

<BODY>
From: Dan Edward G Mejia (mejiadan@student.msu.edu)<P>

> Q:  WHAT IS P.C.?<BR>
><BR>
> PC stands for Politically Correct.  We of the Politically Correct<BR>
> philosophy believe in increasing a tolerance for a DIVERSITY of cultures,<BR>
> race, gender, ideology and alternate lifestyles.  Politically Correctness<BR>
> is the only social and morally acceptable outlook.  Anyone who disagrees<BR>
> with this philosophy is bigoted, biased, sexist, and/or closed-minded.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  WHY SHOULD I BE PC?<BR>
><BR>
> Being PC is fun.  PCism is not just an attitude, it is a way of life!  PC<BR>
> offers the satisfaction of knowing that you are undoing the social<BR>
> evils of centuries of oppression.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  I AM A WHITE MALE.  CAN I STILL BE PC?<BR>
><BR>
> Sure.  You just have to feel very guilty.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  WHY?<BR>
><BR>
> If you are a white male, your ancesters were responsible for practically<BR>
> every injustice in the world- slavery, war, genocide and plaid sportcoats.<BR>
> That means that YOU are partially responsible for these atrocities.  Now<BR>
> it is time to balance the scales of justice for the decendants of those<BR>
> individuals whose ancestors your ancestors pushed down.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  HOW?<BR>
><BR>
> It's simple.  You've got to be careful what you say, what you think, and<BR>
> what you do.  You just don't want to offend anyone.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  YOU MEAN I SHOULD GUARD AGAINST OFFENDING ANYONE?<BR>
><BR>
> That's right.  Being offensive is destructive, and will not make the world<BR>
> a harmonious utopia, like in John Lennon's IMAGINE.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  HOW ELSE CAN I BE PC?<BR>
><BR>
> Oh, there are lots of ways.  For example, why buy regular ice cream when you<BR>
> can buy "Rain Forest Crunch?"  Segrega..whoops..seperate all of your garbage<BR>
> into different containers:  glass, metal, white paper, blue paper, plastic,<BR>
> etc.  Make sure that all your make-up has not been tested on animals.  Try to<BR>
> find at least sixty ways to use your water; when you take a shower, brush your
<P>
> teeth at the same time.  Then don't let the water go down the drain, use it to
<P>
> irrigate your lawn.  Or better yet, replace your lawn with a vegetable garden.
<P>
> Don't use aerosal.  By all means, don't burn American Flags!<BR>
><BR>
> If you are fortunate enough to know your ethnic heritage, dress the part!<BR>
> Don't do drugs.  You should listen to at least one of the following PC<BR>
> musicians:  U2, REM, Sinead O'Connor, Sting, or KD Lang.<BR>
><BR>
> Harrass people who wear fur coats.  Remind them that an innocent baby seal was
<P>
> mercilessly clubbed.  Or just yell, "FUR."  They hate that.<BR>
> And don't EVER eat meat.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  DON'T EAT MEAT?  WHY NOT?!<BR>
><BR>
> Cows are animals, just like humans are animals.  That means that they have<BR>
> rights.  When you eat meat, you're oppressing animals!<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  SO ALL KILLING IS BAD?<BR>
><BR>
> No, not always.  Sometimes killing can be justified, like in the Persian<BR>
> Gulf.  You have to be able to tell when an animal has rights, and when<BR>
> it doesn't.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  HOW DO I KNOW WHEN AN ANIMAL HAS RIGHTS?<BR>
><BR>
> The general rule is as follows:<BR>
><BR>
>           IF AN ANIMAL IS RARE, PRETTY, BIG, CUTE, FURRY,<BR>
>              HUGGABLE, OR LOVABLE, THEN IT HAS RIGHTS.<BR>
><BR>
> Examine the following chart:<BR>
><BR>
>       RIGHTS                       NO RIGHTS<BR>
>      --------                     -----------<BR>

><BR>
> Q:  WOW.  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO BE PC?<BR>
><BR>
> Hug a tree.  Rejoice each day in our cultural differences, for they are what<BR>
> gives flavour to our great country.  Get in touch with your sexual identity.<BR>
> Check your refrigerator for freon leaks.  Subscribe to National Geographic.<BR>
> Search it for neat non-Western cultural traditions and costumes.  After you re<BR>
ad<BR>
> it, use the paper as an alternate fuel source.<BR>

> RIGHT.  It's that simple.  You are right.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  HOW DO I KNOW IF AN ACTION IS UN-PC?<BR>
><BR>
> Good question.  It's important to know when someone is saying something<BR>
> insensitive so that you can have that person removed from society.  The<BR>
> guideline is as follows:<BR>
><BR>
>      Is the confrontation between two white people?<BR>
>         Yes ->  The liberal is right.<BR>
>         No  ->  The white person is oppressing the ethnic person.<BR>
><BR>
> Remember, many seemingly obvious issues, such as the railroading<BR>
> of Mayor Marion Barry, or the Clarence Thomas issue, are really race issues.<BR>
><BR>
> Here's a fun practice drill for you:  See how many newspaper articles you can<BR>
> make into race bias stories.  It's fun!  Some PCers are so good they can make<BR>
> the weather report look like a KKK pamphlet!<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SEE SOMEONE DO SOMETHING NON-PC?<BR>
><BR>
> It all depends on the situation.  If you are not in a position of authority,<BR>
> by all means report this activity immediately to whomever is in charge.  If<BR>
> your school leader, employer, or superior is hip to the trend of the 90s,<BR>
> she or he will take the necessary steps to have the insensitive offender<BR>
> disciplined.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  BUT ISN'T THAT CENSORSHIP?<BR>
><BR>
> The Constitution never meant for racism, sexism and insensitivity to be<BR>
> espoused by anyone.  That's not what free speech is about.  Some call it<BR>
> censorship.  PCers call it "selective" speech.  Saying something negative abou<BR>
t<BR>
> a particular race or gender is just as damaging as, say, punching them in the<BR>
> face.  We just can't allow that kind of verbal assault.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT PC WORDS TO REPLACE "BLACK," "INDIAN." ETC.<BR>
><BR>
> Yes.  That's part of the PC movement.  You see, part of the way we think<BR>
> about people comes directly from the words we use to describe them.  Take<BR>
> "black" for instance.  Why should a person be judged by the color of their<BR>
> skin?<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  YOU MEAN THEY SHOULD RATHER BE JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER?<BR>
><BR>
> No, I mean they should be judged by where their ancestors are from.  If your<BR>
> great grandparents are from Africa, or Asia, or wherever, then you should<BR>
> be identified by that fact.  You can even apply for special scholarships!<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  I'M A MIXTURE OF FRENCH, GERMAN, ENGLISH, AND RUSSIAN.  CAN I GET ONE?<BR>
><BR>
> No, there are no scholarships for any of those.  Sorry.  If you are a woman,<BR>
> however, there should be plenty.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  HEY, WOULDN'T A WHITE PERSON FROM LIBYA OR EGYPT TECHNICALLY BE AN<BR>
>     AFRICAN-AMERICAN?<BR>
><BR>
> Technically, yes.  But that's not the kind of African-American we mean.<BR>
> That is, we're REALLY talking about skin color, but we're pretending that<BR>
> we aren't.  Another example:  A white South-African U.S. immigrant is not<BR>
> an African-American either.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  HOW CAN I LEARN TO MAKE MY LANGUAGE MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT?<BR>
><BR>
> For more help, see the PC LEXICON at the end of the handbook.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  I'D LIKE MY CHILD TO BE PC.  WHAT CAN I DO?<BR>
><BR>
> Well, for one thing, we should forcibly encourage students to volunteer<BR>
> their time with philanthropies.  Also, we should re-emphasize non-Western<BR>
> perspectives on history.  Finally, we should re-structure tests and quizzes<BR>
> to reflect cultural biases.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  I DON'T GET IT.<BR>
><BR>
> Well, the way the system works now, "select" under-represented minorities<BR>
> who tend to do worse on entrance tests have lower standards of admissions<BR>
> at school and work and receive preferential treatment.  This is unfair and<BR>
> wrong.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  IT IS?<BR>
><BR>
> Yes.  The truly PC way to do it is to have a different grading scale for<BR>
> different groups which gives or subtracts points from the final score,<BR>
> depending on who is taking the test.  If you are white, then you have been<BR>
> benefited by society during your life.  That means that you lose<BR>
> ten to fifteen points to make the test fair to everyone else.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  I GUESS THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.<BR>
><BR>
> It IS right.  That's the beauty of PC.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF?<BR>
><BR>
> Humor.  PC people take every comment VERY seriously.  We will not accept<BR>
> any comment, joke, remark, or anything that sounds like it could be a<BR>
> racial slur.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.<BR>
><BR>
> "What's black and white and red all over?" has been staple humor for<BR>
> decades.  Not PC-  It can be taken the wrong way.<BR>
><BR>
> In every day speech, try to use phrases like,<BR>
> "Isn't that the pot calling the kettle African-American."  Any racial jokes<BR>
> or jokes even mentioning culture or gender should be omitted.  True, this<BR>
> mostly limits comedy to the level of sitcoms, but that's the price you pay for
<P>
> social equality.<BR>
><BR>
> Q:  IS THAT ALL THERE IS TO IT?<BR>
><BR>
> Yes.  The Politically Correct belief is essentially a recognition that<BR>
> people are diversely equal.  We rejoice in this equality by treating<BR>
> people differently based on their equal individuality.  Hop aboard the<BR>

From: Ian M Colrain (im_colrain@aukuni.ac.nz)<P>

Wonder if you are a nineties type person?  Take this quiz and find out for <BR>
sure.
<P>
NAVIGATING THE NINETIES: A P.C. SURVIVAL GUIDE
<P>
A Quiz.
<P>
1. When I greet the morning sun, I:
<P>
A.  Take a deep breath, stretch out my arms and embrace life.<BR>
B.  Realize that we are consuming fossil fuels at an obscene rate and<BR>
    need to use more passive energy sources such as the sun's rays.<BR>
C.  Ask the bartender for the return of my car keys, so I can go home.
<P>
    If you answered A, you really need to be more socially aware:<BR>
people are being oppressed even as you indulge yourself.  B is the<BR>
correct answer.  Never allow yourself to enjoy the moment without<BR>
being fully cognizant of the sorrow that lurks around the corner.  If<BR>
you chose C, which is so obviously not PC, you're in for a long, slow<BR>
decade, and should carefully study the remaining questions.
<P>
2. I watch Club MTV because:
<P>
A.  I want to monitor what kind of TV my children are viewing, because<BR>
    I know TV is bad for them.<BR>
B.  It provides a window onto contemporary pop culture.<BR>
C.  I'm curious to see how intimate a girl's butt can get with a<BR>
camera.
<P>
    If you answered A, you are describing an attitude liberals had<BR>
regarding children and TV in the Seventies and Eighties, before they<BR>
had children.  If you answered C, you're probably telling the truth,<BR>
but the truth is no longer Politically Correct - even if you're a<BR>
normal heterosexual person.  Expressing an interest in heterosexual<BR>
activity violates the rights of those people who, for whatever reason,<BR>
aren't curious to see how far a camera can get with a girl's butt.  PC<BR>
people are always interested in contemporary pop culture, as long as<BR>
it's viewed through a window, so the answer is B.
<P>
3. If I saw Cindy Crawford (Richard Gere) in a bar, and wanted to pick<BR>
her up, I would say:
<P>
A.  "I think we could both reach our sexual potential, but only if you<BR>
    think it's still possible for two people to celebrate their gender<BR>
    diversity without oppression or subsuming their individuality."<BR>
B.  "I know to women(guys) like you, guys (women) like me are a dime a<BR>
    dozen, but then, what do you have to lose - eighty three cents?"<BR>
C.  "I can lick my eyebrows."
<P>
    The correct answer is A.  Neither humour nor self-deprecation,<BR>
which encourages negative self-images are PC, so B is out.  Answer A<BR>
uses several PC buzzwords, such as "diversity", and "celebrate", and<BR>
is earnest.  Being earnest is very PC, without necessarily being<BR>
honest - which isn't.  It is also obfuscatory, a PC tactic resorted to<BR>
when on thin ice, and let's face it, if you're trying to pick up Cindy<BR>
Crawford (Richard Gere) anywhere, you're on thin ice.  C is out,<BR>
because it makes Cindy Crawford(Richard Gere) into a sex object and is<BR>
an obvious lie.
<P>
4. I object to the Miss America Paegent because:
<P>
A.  It exploits women's bodies for commercial ends.<BR>
B.  It doesn't go far enough to exploit women's bodies for commercial<BR>
    ends.<BR>
C.  It gives me Joan Van Ark nightmares.
<P>
    Answers A and B represent a schism in the PC church, which<BR>
traces its origins to feminism, which rewrites its manifesto once a<BR>
month.  On one hand, PC endorses a new Puritanism in which any<BR>
sexuality for financial gain becomes exploitation unless it's women<BR>
using men - it's very PC for the oppressed to oppress back - or women<BR>
using women, as long as such usage is self-exploitative without being<BR>
self-deprecating or self-gratifying.  On the other hand, PC embraces<BR>
all alternative sexualities, and for many young women today, entering<BR>
beauty contests is an alternative to sexuality - therefore the correct<BR>
answer is C.
<P>
5. I consider Norman Schwartzkopf's Operation Desert Storm to have<BR>
been:
<P>
A.  A hideous and unnecessary mismatch in which American imperialism<BR>
    once again subjugated a helpless Third World Country.<BR>
B.  A glorious victory in which American boys, allied with coalition<BR>
    forces and American knowhow, squashed an evil tyrand and liberated<BR>
    Kuwait.<BR>
C.  Johnathan Winters' best movie.
<P>
    C is wrong since, contrary to popular belief, Schwartzkopf and<BR>
Winters are two different people.  Answer A alone is too PC, answer B<BR>
alone is not PC enough - therefore the answer is A and B.  PC is both<BR>
antiwar and pro-veteran, in which case the Gulf War was ideal,<BR>
producing more veterans (well, American veterans, anyway) per war-hour<BR>
than any other war.
<P>
6. Appropriate behavior at an Iron John seminar led by Robert Bly in a<BR>
woodland clearing includes:
<P>
A.  Singlng ancient tribal chants, spinning myths around a campfire,<BR>
    and beating on a drum.<BR>
B.  Cursing your father, weeping copiously around a campfire,<BR>
    admitting you have tiny genitals, then beating your hairless chest.<BR>
C.  Howling at the moon, passing a pitcher of Martinis around the<BR>
    campfire, then beating the crap out of Robert Bly.
<P>
    If you answered A, you're confusing the New PC with Indian<BR>
Guides, which it strongly resembles.  C is appropriate only at Bly's<BR>
poetry recitals.  The answer is B.  Blaming others, especially past<BR>
generations, is central to the PC movement, whose motto is NO BUCK<BR>
STOPS HERE.
<P>
7. If Julia Child were to cook a PC meal, the menu would feature:
<P>
A.  Carrots, barley, oats, grass, and silage.<BR>
B.  Brewer's yeast, calendula, tofu, uvaursi leaves, kasha and bulgur.<BR>
C.  Cheeseburgers, chocolate malts, french fries, and pies.
<P>
    The answer is B.  A is wrong since it lists foods which were<BR>
tested on animals.  C is wrong because cheeseburgers taste good and<BR>
are made from animals.  Politically correct dining institutionalizes<BR>
eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia by equating food with<BR>
poison and consumption with guilt.  The only correct foods are either<BR>
antidotes (brewer's yeast, calendula) to everything you've eaten in<BR>
your life to date or foods (tofu, kasha, bulgar) which in a world of<BR>
famine, even famished people won't eat.
<P>
8. When the check-out girl at the supermarket asks me if I want paper<BR>
or plastic, the correct answer is:
<P>
A.  "Paper because it's recyclable and doesn't deplete the world's oil<BR>
    supplies."<BR>
B.  "Plastic because it's recyclable and doesn't deplete the worlds<BR>
    forests."<BR>
C.  "I brought my own cloth bag."
<P>
    If you answered A you're probably hoping that it rains and the<BR>
bag gets wet and the bottom tears out and your brewer's yeast, tofu,<BR>
kasha and bulgur spill and you won't have to eat them.  If you<BR>
answered B you forgot that plastic is a petroleum product and thus you<BR>
are encouraging further American armed intervention in the Middle<BR>
East.  A PC person carries a cloth market bag, which you can recycle<BR>
by cutting two holes in the bottom and using as a diaper.<BR>
    Finally, any ideology worth its salt has a vocabulary and a<BR>
diction all its own.  Remember, it doesn't matter how you feel, as<BR>
long as you use the right words.  Match the following words or phrases<BR>
with their PC counterparts.
<P>
1. A person with an I.Q. less than 60 is called:
<P>
    A. Retarded<BR>
    B. Intellectually challenged<BR>
    C. Mr. Vice President
<P>
2. Human females are called:
<P>
    A. Women<BR>
    B. Wimmin<BR>
    C. Vagino-Americans
<P>
3. A female business leader might be called:
<P>
    A. Madam Chairwoman<BR>
    B. Ms. Chairperson<BR>
    C. The boss in the grey-flannel panty-hose
<P>
4. A person who needs his head examined is:
<P>
    A. In therapy<BR>
    B. Emotionally challenged<BR>
    C. A Democratic presidential candidate
<P>
5. Michael Jordan is:
<P>
    A. An African-American<BR>
    B. A person of color<BR>
    C. God
<P>
6. A person without a penny to his name is called:
<P>
    A. A bum<BR>
    B. Homeless<BR>
    C. Donald Trump
<P>
7. The woman who brings you food in a restaurant is a:
<P>
    A. Waitress<BR>
    B. Server<BR>
    C. Servo-American
<P>
8. A man on his second Martini is:
<P>
    A. A businessman<BR>
    B. In denial<BR>
    C. Patiently waiting for the year 2000

A man walks into a bar and hears piano music.  He looks at the piano and<BR>
can't see anyone sitting there, so he walks over and discovers a foot-tall<BR>
man standing on the piano bench playing the tune of Dixie-Girl.  The man<BR>
thought that this was strange so he goes over to the bartender and asks<BR>
where the man came from.<BR>
	"Here," says the bartender, handing the man a genie lamp, "rub this."<BR>
	So the man rubs the lamp and out comes this genie.<BR>
	"What do you wish for?" asks the genie.<BR>
	"A million bucks," the man states, quite sure of himself.<BR>
	"Granted."  And the genie claps his hands and disappeared back<BR>
into the lamp.<BR>
	The man looks around, checks his wallet but can't find a<BR>
million bucks anywhere.  Just that moment, a million ducks fly through<BR>
the bar.  Astounded the man says:  "Hey!  I didn't ask for a million ducks!"<BR>
	"Do you think that I asked for a 12 inch pianist?"  replied<BR>
the bartender.

Practical Jokes<BR>
===============
<P>
<BR>
One joke that we did in residence was the Chinese Fire Drill, <BR>
I don't quite know why it is called that. Anyway..
<P>
The victim is on the pot in the dorm washroom. Everyone grabs a bucket<BR>
(we used the waste baskets from our rooms) and fills the buckets with <BR>
water. Take a paper bag and set it on fire, toss it under the door into the <BR>
stall. Yell fire as everyone tosses the water into the stall. Needless to say<BR>
the fire as well as the victim get very wet.
<P>
This one fellow in the house was hit a number of times and took to relieving<BR>
himself in other locals. We followed him a couple of times and nailed him<BR>
in many parts of the residence.
<P>
Later of course we conspired with our victim to get back at the<BR>
original instigator of the drill. The guy in the stall had a bucket of water,<BR>
and when the the instigator tossed the bag in we all hit him. 
<P>
*********
<P>
It is common for draftsmen to sprinkle SCUMEX (powdered rubber<BR>
eraser) on tracings prior to doing any drawing on it. This reduces<BR>
smearing of the pencil marks and such and results in a cleaner<BR>
tracing.
<P>
At a former employers we had replaced the Scumex at one draftsmans<BR>
desk with dried parmesian cheese. It looked about the same. It was<BR>
extremely interesting watching him draw for a while and then begin<BR>
to smell the paper. Took the poor dude almost 10 minutes to guess<BR>
that he had been gigged!
<P>
*********
<P>
I just pulled one on somebody -- I slipped some of those anti-<BR>
shoplifting strips into the lining of the victim's favorite<BR>
jacket.  I was set to pull another one, but didn't get the chance<BR>
- to cut out a silhouette of a gun from metal and hide it in a<BR>
piece of carry-on luggage.
<P>
*********
<P>
	Two teachers at my high school started a practical joke war<BR>
that culminated in a junk mail war of huge proportions.  They<BR>
finally called a truce and got it cleared up and the mail stopped,<BR>
EXCEPT for the military mail that one had signed the other one up<BR>
for.  He wrote (honestly) that he had graduated from a fine college<BR>
and was interested in the Marines, Air Force, etc. etc.  <BR>
	When I left, about two years after this, he was still<BR>
getting PHONE CALLS from 2-4 times a month.... they were VERY<BR>
persistant even over he (loud) objections that he was 45 and not<BR>
interested in a career change...
<P>
*********
<P>
New secretary (second day on the job) answers telephone as is told in<BR>
official tones: "This is the phone company.  We are testing a new<BR>
circuit wiring scheme in your offices.  Please keep everyone off the<BR>
phones for the next 10 minutes.  We will be verifying the correct wiring<BR>
of your system by passing HOT STEAM through the wires.  Instruct your<BR>
employees to place their phones on the floor, or, better yet, wrap them<BR>
in towels to avoid scalding themselves.  We will advise you when the<BR>
tests are complete *click*"  After momentary panic, the secretary begins<BR>
a frenzied "Paul Revere" routine, running from desk to desk while<BR>
glancing frequently at her watch.  Just as the 10 minutes are about up,<BR>
she bursts into her boss's office (while he is in the midst of an<BR>
important long-distance call) and, screaming, grabs the receiver from<BR>
his hand and flings the whole phone under his desk...
<P>
*********
<P>
	Tell someone you can pin a glass of water to the wall --<BR>
	a real glass, not a paper cup, using an ordinary straight<BR>
	pin.  Naturally they won't believe, so you set out to<BR>
	prove it.
<P>
	Get a glass of water and a pin.  Hold the glass up to the<BR>
	wall and start to pin it up.  And then drop the pin.<BR>
	You've got the glass in position just right, so you ask<BR>
	your victim real nice to get the pin for you.  When they<BR>
	bend down to pick it up, dump the water on their head.
<P>
This works especially well when there's a crowd of people watching.<BR>
It can also be very dangerous for the joker, so be careful if you<BR>
try it.
<P>

	one time in my undergrad days, it was snowing like mad<BR>
	out. someone decided it was time a make a snowball. then<BR>
	someone else suggested that we should put this snowball in<BR>
	this one guy's room-- nobody liked this guy-- so when the<BR>
	word got around, half the people in our dorm section came<BR>
	out and help! we got this sucker so BIG that it must be<BR>
	at least 4 feet in diameter. it took about 6 person to haul<BR>
	the darn thing up 3 flights of stairs. we got the snowball<BR>
	into this guy's room while he was out, turn off the heat in<BR>
	the room and left all the windows open, so the snowball<BR>
	won't melt too fast. well... the turkey came back 3 hours<BR>
	later and found a HUGH snowball sitting in the middle of his<BR>
	room, and started melting! I still have the picture of the<BR>
	snowball. (if you really wonder how big the snowball is,<BR>
	just imagine a snowball the size of a normal dinning room<BR>
	chair!)
<P>

<P>
This reminds me of a similar stunt we used to enjoy at the dining hall<BR>
in my undergrad days.  The food service used opaque plastic salt and<BR>
pepper shakers with pop-off tops that could be pried off with a knife<BR>
blade if you were persistent enough.
<P>
PREPARATION (in a restroom nearby):  (1) Empty salt ( or pepper) from a<BR>
previously 'acquired' container and fill about 1/3 full with<BR>
concentrated lemon juice.  (2) Place a thin tissue across the opening,<BR>
poke it down a bit to form a depression, and fill the depression with<BR>
about a teaspoon of baking soda.  (3)  Cover (from the inside) the<BR>
holes of the top with tape of the appropriate color.  (4) Replace top<BR>
on container and trim visible tissue from around the top.
<P>
Carry the device to dining hall (upright and as stable as is<BR>
possible...  for your own sake).
<P>
After discretely placing the shaker on your table (only place it near<BR>
to you... see caveat #1 below), observe the next person to use the<BR>
salt (pepper).  (S)He will shake lightly at first, then harder as<BR>
nothing comes out.  Due to the breakdown of the tissue and the pressure<BR>
resulting from the classic acid/base reaction, the top will pop off<BR>
(quite spectacularly) amidst a shower of foam.  Your victim (as will as<BR>
everyone around) should have quite a reaction, since one does not<BR>
usually observe this type of behavior in a salt (pepper) shaker!
<P>
CAVEATS: 1.  The top will come off with some force.  If the holes are<BR>
sealed well, this will happen on about the second or third shake.<BR>
Once, though, due to poor sealing, it took about 5 seconds, during<BR>
which time our victim started looking at the shaker to examine the<BR>
"foamy stuff coming out" of the holes...  we quickly grabbed the shaker<BR>
>from her to direct the top towards the ceiling before it went off.  So,<BR>
watch carefully!
<P>
2.  The "foam shower" (lemon juice & soda) may ruin you victim meal...<BR>
be prepared to pop for another one.
<P>
3.  Don't do this if your victim or anyone near ground zero is dressed<BR>
up (this joke will flop at board meetings and the like).
<P>
*********
<P>
This joke has been done 50 (yes, 50) years ago by my father-in-law.
<P>
First, a little background:
<P>
He lived in a small village, north-west of Quebec City along the St-Laurent<BR>
river. In those days, toilets were located outside the house in what<BR>
we call in good ol' french canadian 'becosse', from 'back house' I think.<BR>
These are a little wood shack with no floor over a hole in the ground<BR>
where you ... You can guess.
<P>
Now, for the joke:
<P>
He and a friend were thrown out of a party by the doorman.
<P>
When it was really dark,, the doorman went to investigate what was<BR>
knocking at the window. They had suspended a rock to the window<BR>
frame so it hung right it the middle and tied another string<BR>
to the rock and hid behind the 'becosse' where they pulled<BR>
that second string to make the rock knock in the window.<BR>
That's an old trick. The doorman wouldn't fall for that one. So<BR>
he followed the second string in the dark<BR>
and soon concluded that they were hidding behind the 'becosse'.
<P>
He ran toward the merely visible wood structure...
<P>
But my father-in-law and his friend had taken care of moving the<BR>
shack six feet ... Boy he fell in the sh*t !!
<P>
*********
<P>
This one hasn't come up despite the presence of UCLA on the net.  I'm<BR>
led to the sad conclusion that the tradition has died.
<P>
In the mid '70s, just before it was overrun by fanatic Dungeons &<BR>
Dragons (tm) players, the UCLA Computer Club was host to a long series<BR>
of "glitter traps."  Example: joke subject sits at a desk, pulls out a<BR>
drawer.  A string runs from the back of the drawer, up the wall, into<BR>
the false ceiling, over to a spot directly over the subject's head,<BR>
where it triggers the trap: a mousetrap whose action snaps a card away<BR>
>from its position covering a funnel, releasing a handful of glitter,<BR>
which flows down the funnel, through its spout, through a hole in the<BR>
ceiling acoustic tile, onto the subject.  It was wonderful to watch: a<BR>
muffled snapping noise, a quiet "chuff," and the slow, glittery descent<BR>
of a cloud of brightly colored dust, to settle over the head and<BR>
shoulders of a club member who by now has assumed an expression of<BR>
appreciative resignation.
<P>
Another, more short-lived ploy was to suspend a wooden horseshoe by a<BR>
string from the ceiling in the corridor, such that the horseshow<BR>
dangles a couple of inches above the top of an upright broom.  Most<BR>
conventional brooms will stand on their straws with a little coaxing.<BR>
We attached a sign labeling the horseshow "wood magnet."  Quite a few<BR>
people took it at face value.
<P>
*********
<P>
Another Cow joke I attribute to my 'Ol chemestry prof was the placement of<BR>
a cow onto the roof.  I would presume a fairly storng roof, but once up<BR>
there it would be hard to hide the fact to the cow that any direction would<BR>
be down.
<P>
Another pratical joke involved the use of outhouses.  Once the target has<BR>
established himself you take up the slack on the attached rope which has<BR>
been measured to set up tremendious harmonics in the structure.  When the<BR>
rope transfers your strumming to the outhouse, it usually falls apart with<BR>
a most revieling nature..
<P>
*********
<P>
	I was once in a nice family-style restaurant when I observed<BR>
some kids supergluing the dishes to the table.  They also attached<BR>
the silverware, napkins, salt, pepper, etc.  If it wasn't already nailed down,<BR>
it was now.  They stayed long enough to let the glue set, and then paid and<BR>
left.  They watched as the poor busboy tried to get the stuff off of the table.
<P>
<BR>
	Also funny is supergluing a quarter to the sidewalk.  I know its old,<BR>
but in the city, with the diverse types of people around, it gets really <BR>
amusing.  I watched this old lady whack at it with her cane for about 10 min. <BR>
cursing......
<P>
*********
<P>
A few months ago I saw a newspaper clipping which told of a newspaper in<BR>
Illinois (I think...) which ran a story warning consumers that, on such-and-<BR>
such day, Illinois Bell would be "blowing the dust out of the phone lines" and<BR>
that all phone owners should cover the earpiece of their phones with a bag to<BR>
catch the dust. 
<P>
Bell made them print a retraction, after receiving numerous calls asking<BR>
what sort of bag to use ...
<P>
People, they is amazing.
<P>
*********
<P>
When I was in college our RA told us of a good one that (supposedly)<BR>
some friends had pulled a couple of years earlier.  These two guys made<BR>
up a concoction of all kinds of left overs, semi-pureed it in a blender,<BR>
and filled a hot water bottle with it.  One of them took the hot water<BR>
bottle, taped it to his stomach inside of his shirt and put a short<BR>
piece of hose into the top so that it came up to the front of his shirt<BR>
collar, but not visible.  They both went to a local pub and sat at the<BR>
bar, acting already slightly intoxicated.  After having a couple of beers<BR>
the guy with the hot water bottle says that he is feeling sick a couple<BR>
of times and "barfs" VERY loudly all over the bar to attract attention.<BR>
Naturally this causes the patrons to move away from him, all except his<BR>
buddy, who calmy pulls a fork out of his coat pocket and begins EATING<BR>
the stuff. ;-)  I don't know how true it is, but I'd love to have been<BR>
there watching faces if it was...
<P>
*********
<P>
I can't resist a few:
<P>
1. Once you have stolen a dormmate's room keys, the room is yours to<BR>
   plunder.  As a variation, steal the dorm keys but reverse the lock<BR>
   (so the keyhole faces INTO the room); we had a mechanical engineer<BR>
   who got this down to about 20 seconds.  Then loudly announce to the<BR>
   victim you own the keys, but "let" them win the race back to their<BR>
   room.  PRESTO!  Locked inside their own room (with no keys).  If<BR>
   you've fixed the phone to continually ring, they get very pliable<BR>
   after about 10 minutes.
<P>
2. We connected our secretary's electric typewriter to a variac (can<BR>
   vary the line voltage).  At about 40-50 volts (out of the 110)<BR>
   the little ball makes three or four jerky attempts before finally<BR>
   striking a faint imprint.  Fairly pathetic looking, actually.
<P>
3. Reverse the horizontal yoke leads on terminals (so the text comes<BR>
   out backwards from right to left).  This works best on a software<BR>
   team who thinks they have just released the firmware for screen<BR>
   drivers.  Besides, hardware people figure it out too quickly.
<P>
4. Hand lotion inside of an air hose on the final assembly line is<BR>
   effective, but very vindictive.  Use with caution (now, I'm not<BR>
   saying I ever did this, but I "saw" it done once :-)
<P>
And the standard saran wrap across women's toilets, Karo syrup, flour in<BR>
the shower, water-filled surgical tubing jammed in a drawer....ah, for<BR>
the good old days!!
<P>
*********
<P>
One night when you have a few friends around, take turns calling the<BR>
same phone number, a really obnoxious acquaintance that won't<BR>
recognize your voices is always a good choice.  When the person<BR>
answers, try to leave a message for John Smith (or any name that<BR>
sounds real). Insist that you have the right number and even read<BR>
their number to them. Have a bit of fun here, and stretch this on as<BR>
long as possible.  Repeat several times, once or twice an hour. Let<BR>
everybody have a turn at calling. Just as the party is breaking up,<BR>
call one last time.  Tell the poor soul answering the phone that you<BR>
are John Smith, and ask "Are there any messages for me?"  This is sure<BR>
to get a groan.
<P>
*********
<P>
Seven friends once pulled this at my college cafeteria.<BR>
One put a hot water bottle filled with pea soup down his chest;<BR>
he sat at the head of a table, with the other six friends<BR>
sitting along the sides.<BR>
When the cafeteria was pretty full of people,<BR>
he made a loud noise (to attract attention),<BR>
stood up, bent over and squeezed his chest.<BR>
This caused a huge gush of green liquid to spew all over the table;<BR>
the other six immediately began to eat this green liquid.<BR>
I think a lot of food went uneaten that night.
<P>
*********
<P>
Here's one that my roommate and myself did to a residence buddy. One<BR>
morning (early) we taped together a bunch of sheets of newspaper to cover<BR>
the victims doorframe. Then taped this big sheet over the doorframe which <BR>
left a gap of about two or three inches between the sheet and the door. <BR>
Then we filled the gap with paper balls right to the top of the doorway.<BR>
When he opened the door he was showered with a barrage of paper balls (makes<BR>
a nice mess too!) Of course, the door has to swing in for this to work!
<P>
My roommate was (and is) rather inventive and can be quite nasty. He buttered<BR>
all of the toilet seats in our wing of the residence (fortunately told me<BR>
first). He also buttered doorknobs at one point. We wrapped celophane over <BR>
the toilet bowl then replaced the seat: this one can be really messy!
<P>
Try this: hang a shower curtain out a window. When the person below reaches<BR>
out and pulls it in, pour a bucket of water onto the shower curtain. Listen<BR>
to hear the results. Requires a nosy neighbor below you.
<P>
Six friends of mine and myself tried a less complicated version of the classic<BR>
dismantling of a car and putting it back together somewhere strange. We lifted<BR>
a friends car that was parked between two other cars and turned it so that the <BR>
front and back end were facing the neighboring cars. This posed quite a problem<BR>
for our friend when he decided to go home. Requires either a small car or a lot<BR>
of very strong people! :-) I take no responsibility for any back injuries that<BR>
result from this. Of course I take no responsibility for any of my actions. :-)

There are, of course, some fairly standard pranks that are pulled in residence.<BR>
Typically, people are shafted on their birthday which is therefore a hazardous<BR>
date to reveal. Total demolition of a room is quite common, but lacks any real <BR>
humor. A common shaft is to remove everything from the victims room and set it<BR>
up somewhere else exactly as it was. The best examples I saw of this were: a <BR>
room moved to the roof of a science building, a room moved to the front<BR>
courtyard of the residence (really funny when it started to snow!) and a room<BR>
moved to the dining hall.

When I was younger, I had a practical joke genius for a working companion. We<BR>
both worked in the same computer store for a while. He left and became manager<BR>
of another store. I remember receiving an envelope with his firms return address<BR>
on it. Inside was a very silly brochure. I said aloud "There has to be something<BR>
else in this envelope". So I looked and of course there was a sheet of paper.<BR>
It read "No there is nothing else in this envelope!" I could never get him back<BR>
for anything that he pulled but he was an inspiration. The last practical joke<BR>
that I will relate was one that he taught me and it requires a bit of time to<BR>
prepare. First you need: iodine cristals and some amonium hydroxide. Mix the <BR>
two together and a brown sludge will form. Drain off the excess liquid and let<BR>
the sludge dry. The result? Snap powder, a pressure sensitive explosive. Just<BR>
sprinkle this on the floor and watch people's reactions. Its quite amusing.

I have lived in several different houses with a bunch of guys. Needless<BR>
to say things got pretty rowdy sometimes and many were victims of some<BR>
pretty funny jokes.  One of the favorites as I recall (and still is) is<BR>
to go into the bathroom while the victim is taking a shower, and pour<BR>
a bucket of extreeeemmmlly cold water on them over the top of the <BR>
shower curtain.  This is quite a shocking experience, and if you are<BR>
fast enough you can get away before the victim finds out you did it.
<P>
I remember one guy I lived with getting this all the time.  One time<BR>
he got sick of putting up with it and jumped out of the shower into<BR>
the hall squirting shampoo at everyone in sight.  The next time this<BR>
happened the guys were ready with a camera to take pictures of him as<BR>
he ran out of the bathroom.  These pictures were later shown at his<BR>
bachelor party.

1)  Got a neighbor that's a real pain in the ass?  Do they have a<BR>
    lawn? Do they have a garden that's accessible?  Yes to all the<BR>
    above? Great!  Go out and get yourself some grass-killer and fill<BR>
    the suckers hose with the stuff.  Then sit back and wait for them<BR>
    water their lawn!  Nuff said?
<P>
2)  Does the person that you want to get even with drink red wine?  If<BR>
    so, have I got one for you!  Get yourself some Neutral Red, a water<BR>
    soluble, crystalline, red dye.  Mix some into the persons wine and<BR>
    wait for them to take a leak.  (Nuetral Red comes out as red as it<BR>
    goes in, and people have a tendancy to get really nervous when they<BR>
    start pissing what they think is blood!
<P>
3)  (I'm surprised nobody mentioned this one yet.)  Go to a pet shop and<BR>
    buy a fancy looking pet collar and leash.  Then, the next time you<BR>
    see a dead animal in the road, attach the leash and collar setup<BR>
    to its neck.  Attach the whole thing to revengees rear bumper, making<BR>
    sure to toss dead animal under the car so it won't be seen.  When<BR>
    revengee drives away, chances are he/she will be stopped by either a cop<BR>
    or a member of some animal lovers group for draggin some poor defenseless<BR>
    pet down the road.  Either way, they are gonna have some awful quick<BR>
    explaining to do!
<P>
4)  Last, but certainly not least, is a great stink bomb.  This one takes<BR>
    a bit of time for preparation, so it's not too good for spontaneous<BR>
    revenge.  (But it's worth the time!)  Get a quart jar with a rubber seal.<BR>
    (Mason jars work quite well.)  Pour about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of crystal Drano<BR>
    along with about an inch or so of warm water into the jar.  Place the<BR>
    lid on the jar and allow the mixture to sit in a warm place for about an<BR>
    hour.  Take the lid off and add six egg whites, (no yokes).  Add a quarter<BR>
    cup of Methylene Blue, then fill the jar to within an inch of the top<BR>
    with water.  Seal the jar tightly and allow to sit for four to six weeks.<BR>
    (I warned you it takes a while!)  When the 'bomb' is ready to use, you<BR>
    can either throw it like a molitov(sp?) cocktail, or shake it up and<BR>
    pour the contents out, making damn sure you don't get any on yourself.<BR>
    The results have to be seen, or is that smelled, to be beleived!

Is everyone out in net land familiar with Sensormatic?  They are the company <BR>
that make the large plastic clips that set off alarms when you exit a <BR>
department store.  I used to work for a department store and the is what<BR>
we did.
<P>
Open up the clip and remove the shiny piece of paper.  It is about an inch<BR>
long and about half an inch wide.  This is the "thingy" (that is the technical<BR>
word for it) that sets off the alarm.  This "thingy" is easy to insert into<BR>
a pen case, lining of a jacket ...
<P>
We did this to a co worker and needless to say, he had problems wearing a <BR>
particular jacket to work.

We have various local spots where the teenagers park, cruise, hold drag<BR>
races, drink beer etc.  We happen to own a white 1983 Dodge Diplomat,<BR>
the exact kind of car used by the State Patrol around here as well as<BR>
many law enforcement agencies nationwide.  (Actually our car WAS a<BR>
state patrol car, but that's another story).  Anyway, my brother in<BR>
law, who is a cruiser, would occasionally borrow this car and drive it<BR>
down to the cruising spots.  Needless to say, when they saw him coming<BR>
there was brief but furious activity.  He finally had to stop doing<BR>
this because it made his friends so mad.
<P>
People hate to pass us on the freeway too.  It is not unusual to see<BR>
some Camaro or Porche come zipping along through traffic until he is<BR>
about 2 car lengths behind us, then decelerate to a perfect 55.00 miles<BR>
per hour.  It takes him about 10 seconds to look us over, decide we<BR>
aren't in uniform, notice that we don't have state license plates, and<BR>
make up his mind.  He will then typiclaly test how fast his car will<BR>
accelerate to about 90 mph.

They had a 'witchy' old lady next door that was constantly complaining<BR>
about everything and everyone in the neighborhood.  After one really good<BR>
round about kids and pets messing up her spotless front yard, my buddies<BR>
planned what turned out to be a better joke than they originally thought.<BR>
Juvenile as we all were, they planned to write some dirty words in her<BR>
meticulously-groomed front lawn with some kind of powder that would stand<BR>
out.  The only thing they could find was some Ortho Super-Gro Lawn Food<BR>
(white powdery stuff).  They wrote the message in the dead of night, and<BR>
next morning it was bold and white for the world to see.<BR>
The 'kicker' came after.  She came out, saw the graffiti, and immediately<BR>
grabbed a hose and WATERED IT OFF!
<P>
To this day, those sections of grass are just a little bit greener than<BR>
everything around them, and the words can STILL be read!

This reminds me of a story that a former roommate related to me.  In college<BR>
he and a group of friends got revenge on complete strangers.  ....Well, let<BR>
me set up the situation.
<P>
Y'know how sometimes you gotta park real far away from your destination <BR>
because certain types of people like to take up two parking spaces...?<BR>
Well, he and his friends got a little ticked about this, especially during<BR>
weekends at the school.  One day, they decided to get even with every <BR>
"#@@#$#@$&&*" that took up "their" space.  They turned the car sideways.<BR>
As he said, "He wanted that space so bad, now he can have it for a loooong<BR>
time!"

In a similar vein, tell your victim that you have a test of coordination<BR>
you would like him to try with you.  Find a door with a fairly large crack<BR>
between the door and the wall when the door is open.  (You know, over by<BR>
the hinges; across the width of the door from the doorknob...)  You need an<BR>
egg (NOT hard-boiled), and a wood floor (you don't want the egg cracking on<BR>
carpeting, do you??).  Now, have your victim get on the opposite side of<BR>
the door from you, and put 2 fingers through the door.  Hand him the egg,<BR>
in those two fingers.  Working with him, trade the egg back and forth a<BR>
couple of times, moving UP the door frame.  After you have his confidence,<BR>
leave.  He will be trapped there, holding this egg by two fingers through<BR>
the door.  If he lets go and nobody takes the egg, it will crash to the<BR>
floor.  Best to do in the person's own room.

A few years  ago some members of the  infamous Dartmouth Outing Club pushed<BR>
an  occupied  one-seat outhouse off  its  foundations,  onto its door.  The<BR>
victim tried in vain for a  few minutes to roll the  entire building onto a<BR>
different side, but soon gave up, as it was too heavy.  She then was forced<BR>
to climb out through the seat, and over the pit  near the bottom (now side)<BR>
of the outhouse.
<P>
The followup  to this episode   was that some  `friends'  seized me  in the<BR>
middle of the night and tied my feet in a noose  suspended in a tree.   But<BR>
that's another story.

   This practical joke is hearsay.  A fellow student some years ago<BR>
   related the following.  Apparently another student was a bit of<BR>
   a braggar.  His favourite topic was his car, and one sub-topic<BR>
   was the terrific gas milage (pre-metric) it got.
<P>
   So it began one evening.  Fill up a one-gallon container of gas<BR>
   each night and pour it into the victim's gas tank.  Wait for the<BR>
   story each day to get better and better.  Repeat until it cannot<BR>
   be taken any more.  I believe 2 weeks was sufficient.
<P>
   Finally the moment (days) of truth.  Each night for 2 weeks,<BR>
   the effect was reversed, and one gallon of gas was REMOVED from<BR>
   the victim's tank.  It was amazingly effective at reducing some<BR>
   of the stories.  I suspect the truth was never revealed to the<BR>
   victim.

<P>
Another harmless practical joke to be played on people living in multiple story<BR>
apartment buildings is as follows:<BR>
Knock on victim's door.  Say, "I've got to use your window, someone's about to<BR>
jump from an apartment above yours."  Run to window and look outside, but don't<BR>
let victim look.<BR>
At this point your accomplice dumps a rag-filled dummy either from the window<BR>
above or from the roof.  The dummy should be fully closed; for added realism put<BR>
some plastic bags of fake blood inside the clothes.<BR>
On the sidewalk below, a third accomplice puts down a plastic sheet, then<BR>
covers it with a sheet painted to resemble the sidewalk.  After the body hits,<BR>
let the victim see the gore, then convince him to run down and help while you<BR>
stay and call the ambulance.  As soon as the victim has left, signal your<BR>
accomplice to remove the sheets and the dummy and head for some prearranged<BR>
hiding place.  Then you leave the apartment and disappear somewhere in the<BR>
building; later, you make your way downstairs and leave.<BR>
The victim will race downstairs expecting to find a dead bloody body and<BR>
will instead see only clean, empty pavement.  Of course, it is best done late<BR>
at night since the joke would be spoiled by a passer-by who informed the<BR>
victim of the "body's" fate.<BR>
The fun comes imagining the victim trying to convince the police or anyone<BR>
else of what happened!

In our residence the lounge door can be locked (or unlocked) by any room<BR>
key from the floor. You can also remove the handles from a door (ie the lock<BR>
comes too) and switch the handles.
<P>
We did this to one guy, he was the only one who could lock the door to the <BR>
lounge (we never locked anyway) but everyone could get into his room.<BR>
Every night for a week (at about 3:30 am) someone would go in and do something<BR>
to him while he was asleep (nothing really nasty). As he was a sound sleeper, it<BR>
actually took him a week to figure out what was going on.

This one reminded me of a joke some of the guys on our floor pulled on another<BR>
guy while he was in the shower. While he was in the shower, they took all his<BR>
clothes and even his towel and hung them outside in the hall (over water<BR>
pipes in the ceiling - we were in the basement). I don't know how long he<BR>
stayed in there and/or whether or not someone ever gave him back his clothes.<BR>
The worst part of this one was that there were 2 shower stalls in the bathroom -<BR>
and I happened to be in the other one; it could of happened to me!!

	In my younger days, while employed at a warehouse, I was the butt<BR>
of the usual practical jokes directed at newcomers.(Fetch me a light-bulb<BR>
repair kit, son;etc) As days passed, I noticed that one of my antagonists<BR>
was actually afraid of his terminal. This was at the time when the press<BR>
was full of accounts of the dangers of X-rays from color TV's, and this <BR>
guy was deathly afraid of the noise made by the high-voltage section of the<BR>
CRT as it warmed up. Each morning he sat in his swivel chair, coffee in his<BR>
left hand, and with the chair as far as possible away from the terminal, used <BR>
his right hand to quickly flick the ON switch, and then jerked it away from<BR>
THE CERTAIN DEATH THAT AWAITED. After the racket settled down, he would wheel<BR>
up to the terminal and commence operations.<BR>
	This situation was too good for yours truly to pass up. I went upstairs<BR>
and pulled out a stock item, a stadium buzzer, used by high schools on the <BR>
football fields to announce the end of a quarter. I came in early the next<BR>
morning and installed it in one of his file boxes, near the terminal. I ran the<BR>
wires out to the next office via a pass-thru, and alerted all of the staff<BR>
(but him) of what was about to transpire.<BR>
	He entered the room, coffee in hand, and sat in his chair. All others<BR>
were heads-down in work. He adjusted his chair to the proper distance, reached<BR>
way out for the switch, and as soon as he pulled, I plugged in the cord. As the<BR>
buzzer sounded, he assumed the facial expressions of one who has seen death<BR>
reaching it's skeltal fingers to snatch him from the land of the living.<BR>
Coffee flew to the ceiling, and for a few brief seconds before hitting the<BR>
opposite wall, a new world land speed record for backward swivel-chair<BR>
operation was established!

Preface:  The person that this is played on must be someone who really<BR>
deserves it because it takes several people to pull off.  He must<BR>
also live on the first floor of his dorm.  It must also occur in the winter<BR>
in a suitably cold and barren area like Dartmouth.
<P>
PHASE 1:
<P>
We did this trick to someone we found very difficult to live with.<BR>
When the victim was away from his room we began to pile up a large amount of<BR>
snow outside of his window.  The conditions were perfect.  His window was<BR>
divided into two sections.  One didn't open, the other (in theory) swung<BR>
outward like a door.  The snow was wet and packed heavily and easily.<BR>
(On colder days a hose may be used to harden the snow.)  We built a huge<BR>
pile of snow which reached six or eight feet back from the part of his<BR>
window that swung.  We then, as a demoralizing factor, put a cosmetic layer<BR>
of snow which completely covered the section which didn't open.
<P>
When we had finished the outside work we went into his room and closed his<BR>
shade and curtain so that he would not notice what we had done until it was<BR>
too late.
<P>
PHASE 2:
<P>
We then waited for him to come home.  Luckily his room was on a side of the<BR>
dorm away from the entrance so that our work wasn't visible from the approach.<BR>
He arrived and entered his room.  We listened outside his door until we<BR>
heard his shade go up and a sudden "What the F--K?" as only pure, white<BR>
snow was visible through the window.  At this point we wedged a paperback<BR>
book between his door and the frame. (Similar to using pennies, but more<BR>
effective.)
<P>
We then sat back and listened as he started towards the door.  "Allright, who<BR>
put all the snow outside my...what the F--K?  OPEN THIS DOOR!"
<P>
The show got more exciting as he, thinking that he could still just go out the<BR>
window, walked over, opened his curtain, tried to open the window, and became<BR>
aware of the magnitude of the problem facing him.  He had no phone, and so<BR>
could not call the campus police to come help him.  His neighbors would<BR>
not heed his cries, because most of them had assisted us with the trick.
<P>
We eventually released him, but only after he had come to the realization that<BR>
he needed to be more considerate of those living around him, or else face<BR>
living out the rest of a prematurely shortened life in a small, snow<BR>
covered dorm room.

<P>
My favorite dorm practical joke involved collecting newspapers for about 3 <BR>
months by everyone.  When a guy on my floor had a three hour lab we crumpled<BR>
up newspapers and completely filled his room from floor to ceiling.  <BR>
When he returned, he had to go in through in the bathroom, and wasn't even able<BR>
to get the door open far enough to get through.

Want some fun times! Heres the way:
<P>
1. While your friend is sleeping, carefully water down his mattress.<BR>
   (If he sleeps in a waterbed, just give it a few punctures)
<P>
2. Take an extension cord, clip off the cube-tap, seperate the wires,<BR>
   and strip the two ends, exposing about two inches of bare wire.
<P>
3. Wrap one end around his left big toe, the other on his right.
<P>
4. Stand near an electrical outlet, plug the poor unsuspecting soul in!
<P>
This is a great ice breaker for your new roommate, etc.  Cleanup is<BR>
a bit, er, messy, but well worth the gag.  You can be guarenteed that<BR>
the victim will be impressed!  And think of it: No retaliation!  It's <BR>
the perfect practical joke!  And to think that nobody's posted it yet.

About nine years ago the book "The Adolescense of P1" was very popular at<BR>
the computer shop where I was employed.  In case you don't know, this is<BR>
about a hacker named Gregory and a computer program he wrote which is self-<BR>
perpetuating.  Years later he is employed as an honest Systems Analyst and has<BR>
almost forgotten about his "child."  Then the system downstairs prints out<BR>
"CALL GREGORY" and locks up ... followed by a thickening plot, some<BR>
humorous, some frightening.
<P>
I worked nights.  It wasn't hard to replace the boot file on our system disks <BR>
with another that typed out "CALL GREGORY" before replacing itself with the<BR>
original.

It's funny that there haven't been more computer practical jokes posted<BR>

<P>
I designed and wrote a point-of-sale system which was first installed in<BR>
1976, after which I left the company.  At midnight, December 31, 1977 every<BR>
system in the country stopped whatever it was doing, flashed every light and<BR>
sounded every beeper on every cash register, printed "Happy New Year" on<BR>
every printer, and went back to whatever it was doing.  I wonder how that<BR>
happened?
<P>
Some of the least elaborate practical jokes are the most effective.  Go with<BR>
a couple of friends, stand near some busy street corner, and take a great<BR>
interest in some point near the top of a tall building, or maybe just up in<BR>
the sky.  Watch the reactions of people around you.
<P>
Take an old windowshade, go to a gymnastics show or anywhere else where people<BR>
wear leotards, wait for someone to do a split, and tear the windowshade<BR>

Go to any gag store and get a fake plastic vomit.  Put it in a drinking<BR>
fountain.  Wet it is amazingly realistic ...

Back around 1969 at another university, we had just gotten time sharing <BR>
facilities and because of the unrest (this was about Kent State) we had <BR>
armed guards protecting the computer and the few terminals. It being <BR>
around midnight, I got the guards playing an interactive monopoly game. <BR>
The next evening i was confronted by a VERY upset computer operator. <BR>
Apparently at about 4:00AM one guard landed on Boardwalk and the game <BR>
ended when he didn't have enough money to pay the rent. The guards <BR>
DEMANDED the operator restart the game and bcame more and more upset<BR>
when he couldn't.

Recipe for LARGE quantities of soapsuds:
<P>
1.  Fill a large bucket with hot water.
<P>
2.  Empty contents of one bottle of dishwashing detergent into bucket (Ivory,<BR>
    Joy, Dawn, or equivalent).  
<P>
3.  Drop in a few pounds of dry ice that has been crushed to small pieces.
<P>
4.  STAND BACK!
<P>
Recipe will fill a phone booth, or a small room (or even a big one). <BR>
A friend and I once did this in the bed of his truck.  While stopped at <BR>
traffic signals the whole bed would fill up to the rim with suds.  Then, <BR>
as we would accelerate away from the light, large "chunks" would break loose<BR>
and waft lazily through the air, causing much consternation to the traffic<BR>
behind.  On the freeway the result was much smaller pieces of suds billowing<BR>
out of the back of the truck.  It looked like a snowstorm!  It's funnier to <BR>
see than the description sounds.  We were hysterical. 
<P>
Also, the soap can be omitted from the above to obtain fog.  A phone booth<BR>
that is opaque with dense fog looks pretty strange too.

Okay, this is something me and my best friend did to our Comp. Sci.<BR>
teacher senior year of high school.
<P>
	We started this joke by getting into heated arguments for a<BR>
week before the actual event and of course everything was building up<BR>
a big head of steam.  By this time the other kids knew something was<BR>
up and we let them in on the joke, so now we have about 30 people<BR>
helping in our cause.<BR>
	Anyway, on the day of the crime we went to the school's<BR>
dressing room and, since we were both active in the drama club, no one<BR>
asked what we were there for.  So, I get ready for the fun by making<BR>
myself a nice layer of plasti-skin and filled it with stage blood.<BR>
Danny, my friend, obtained the services of a prop knife, you know one<BR>
of the ones that retract and we tested the depth of the cut with the<BR>
thickness of the skin, it was right, so now we are set.<BR>
	We walk into class seperated by about a minute and we start<BR>
right where we had left off, teh name calling, the pushing and all the<BR>
other aspects of high schoolers that don't like each other.  So Danny<BR>
pulls the knife out of his pocket and yells, "That's it Ray, you're<BR>
dead."  So he swings at my neck and the knife cuts the plasti-skin and<BR>
the stage blood goes everywhere, I crumple in a gurgling heap and lay<BR>
prone under the table of trash80's.  Mr. Waddington comes up and sees<BR>
Danny standing over me with a blood covered knife and sees me<BR>
apparently dead starts to roll me over.  I flop over like any good<BR>
corpse and he dabs at the blood now covering my neck and says the line<BR>
I was waiting for, "My God you killed him!"  At that moment, I opened<BR>
my eyes and asked him what he was doing.  I have heard of peoples<BR>
faces going white and now I saw it.<BR>
	After he relised what we had done, he congradulated us on a<BR>
job well done.

Where I used to work, one of the group leaders used to have a<BR>

One prank I haven't seen listed yet is the one I used to do at summer<BR>
camp and the college dorm.  Take the top off the toilet tank.  Inside,<BR>
there is usually a vertical plastic pipe about 1 inch in diameter.  <BR>
Going into the top of this pipe is a little plastic tube.  Turn the<BR>
tube outward and, if it is long enough, then put it toward the toilet<BR>
bowl with the end just sticking out.  Replace the tank cover, making<BR>
sure that the little plastic tube is just sticking out.  When someone<BR>
flushes, the tube will squirt water.
<P>
One time in Colorado I did this at 3:00am.  The guy that got caught<BR>
must have flushed with his elbow while still seated.  His back was <BR>
sprayed with ice cold water.  His language was abominable, and made<BR>
funnier since this was a Christian camp.  Oh well, we're all human.

These are computer-related practical jokes played by an old<BR>
acquaintence years ago at a nameless university in Northern<BR>
California. He wisened up and stopped playing them when the <BR>
various administrations of the computer centers found out who<BR>
it was. Sometimes I simply could not believe that he would do<BR>
things like this.
<P>
The first one was probably the worst. The undergraduate computer<BR>
center was being connected to a large terminal lab across campus via<BR>
a long line across campus. This had taken the technical folks who<BR>
worked at the computer center months of planning, pulling cables,<BR>
attaching lines, reconfiguring the system, and so forth.
<P>
It was at about this time that Jack (not his real name), wrote a<BR>
program called "GARB" (short for "Garbage") This program sat in the<BR>
background running at low priority. It would choose a random interval,<BR>
sometimes seconds, sometimes minutes, sleep for that interval, and<BR>
then wakeup. At that point, it would choose a random ASCII character<BR>
and then choose a random terminal on that computer and send the character<BR>
to the terminal. Then it would loop back into its sleep mode until the<BR>
next time it woke up.
<P>
The administration and technical people spent weeks wondering why<BR>
their attempts at connecting cross-campus cables were causing spurious<BR>
data across existing lines, as well as the lines that had been connected.<BR>
They had people out there with the elaborate technical equipment trying<BR>
to trace down the source of the "noise" that was polluting the terminal<BR>
lines with stray characters.
<P>
Quite a while later, they did indeed discover the problem and confronted<BR>
Jack. I'm not sure what happened after that.
<P>
Another thing Jack did, before that, was write a program called "GOD".<BR>
It would patch the running monitor and actually insert a jump into the<BR>
code that performed the logout-job function within the monitor. The<BR>
jump simply took control of the monitor to a patch-area elsewhere<BR>
within memory where a simple comparison took place to see if the<BR>
logout being requested was of any jobs belonging to Jack. If so, it<BR>
simply did a no-op, with an appropriate return-condition indicating<BR>
success (so that the calling program which initiated the system call<BR>
would not know the job had not been logged out). This program, "GOD"<BR>
most came in handy to Jack during the wee morning hours when few<BR>
people used the system but the proverbial "wheel wars" occurred, in<BR>
which enabled superusers with privileges attempted to conquer each other<BR>
in various ways.
<P>
Needless to say, none of the above behavior is tolerated by the <BR>
administration any more, with good reason.

Propose to the  victim  a  co-ordination test,  and  tell him that it has been<BR>
taken  by  the brightest people around you (quote some scores!).  You  sit  in<BR>
front of the victim and put your  palms about twelve inches apart. The victims<BR>
task  is very simple. With eyes closed, his palms clasped together, he  should<BR>
cautiously take his  palms  between  your palms,  remove  them, and repeat the<BR>
process. Of course he must not touch your palms otherwise he "looses". Each<BR>
cycle counts as one point and "any average person can get 100 points". As I<BR>
said, tell him the scores of some other people you know.
<P>
Let him paractice a little with  his  eyes  open. Then blindfold him (to avoid<BR>
the "natural" temptation of cheating) and say START. After a while leave. it<BR>
is a hilarious sight to see a person rock his clasped palms back annd forth<BR>
for no obvious reason.
<P>
Be sure to invite many of your friends to witness this sight. You will find<BR>
that this co-ordination test really sounds sincere, and many innocent people<BR>
who listen to you explaining to the chosen victim, actually volunteer to take<BR>
the test before the victim. This gives you a choice of victims to choose from.
<P>
OK, OK... I insisted on taking this test too and made a fool of myself !!

1.  This one happened impromptu.  A group of us were novice UNIX hacks working<BR>
for our department of computer science, all on similar terminals.  I had      <BR>
written a small program that would transmit a single character at a time to<BR>
another terminal.  (No big deal, but no one else had tried it.)  One guy was<BR>
typing away, and I was making his cursor "wiggle" by pressing the forward and<BR>
reverse arrow keys.  He exclaimed that something was wrong with his cursor.<BR>
Another guy picked up on this, and explained that the cursor beam must be loose.<BR>
He gave the right side of the first guy's (John's) terminal a good hard whack,<BR>
I transmitted a carriage return.  John laughed, but actually sat there typing<BR>
in (some text), and whacking the side of the terminal every time he needed a<BR>
carriage return, FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  Needless to say, we were hysterical.
<P>
The second guy, (Tim), says "John, watch this!" and put his hand under John's<BR>
desk and gave the underside of the desk another whack: I transmitted a "HOME"<BR>
character, moving the cursor to the top of the screen, again as if the whack<BR>
had moved the cursor.  John continues typing, whacking the bottom and side of<BR>
the terminal whenever he needs cursor motion.  Tim smacks the top of the       <BR>
terminal and I transmit a CLEAR key: it looked as if the characters have been<BR>
"knocked off" the screen.  John is just about the get the lab manager when<BR>
we clue him in.
<P>
2.  I once had a job as a COBOL programmer.  A particular program was to<BR>
input no more than 20 items from an operator, and them produce  the appropriate<BR>
report from them.  I asked my boss what the program should do if the<BR>
operator wanted more than 20 items to appear in the report.  He said, oh,<BR>
that will never happen.  But what if it does, I asked.  Gruffly, he said, <BR>
have it notify the operator.
<P>
This particular machine had a seriously loud bell (control G) that sounded<BR>
like a real bell, plus it was fairly easy to make the screen flash off and on.<BR>
I coded it to flash and ring the alarm for a minute.  I tried it once and<BR>
it was truly alarming.  I never heard if anybody tried to enter more than<BR>
twenty items, but it is something I think about from time to time ...

<P>
on the subject of practical jokes on the computer, i pulled the following<BR>
one.  when i was in college at new mexico tech (located in socorro, which<BR>
is spanish for help!), i was a programmer for several departments.  as a<BR>
result, i was setting up some user interfaces.  the machine was a dec 20<BR>
(with tops20) and there was a central terminal room with about thirty adm 3s<BR>
(now, there is a terminal) in it.  anyway, when this 20 went down in a<BR>
controled manner it would send out a warning "dec 20 going down", then<BR>
three dots at one second intervals, then a "p", then go down.  when it came<BR>
up, it would send out a message "dec 20 coming up", then three dots at<BR>
one second intervals, then a "p", then the login header.  anyway, the<BR>
victum sat down to use a statistical package (it is so much fun to play with<BR>
people whose use canned stat packages).  after he had been on for ten<BR>
minutes, he received the dec 20 going down sequence and then his terminal<BR>
went dead.  so he waited (about five minutes).  however, all during this<BR>
time, everyone around him was typing away merrily.  finally he asked if<BR>
the system had gone down.  everyone said no.  then he asked the operator.<BR>
again no.  then the system manager.  he finally brought back the user<BR>
servant (someone paid to answer user's questions) back to the terminal.<BR>
they played with the switches, then the user servant scratched his head<BR>
and said "beats me".  about this time, the message "dec system 20<BR>
reengaged" appeared on his terminal, then the three dots, then the "p",<BR>
then the message "automatic login in effect, status at crash resumed"<BR>
and he was right where he left off!  the program that caused this then<BR>
deleted (and expunged) itself.  to this day, i don't think he knows what<BR>
happened to him.

Another practical joke under the guise of a co-ordination test is the <BR>
following. Ask your victim to take a quarter and place it on a piece of<BR>
paper. Then ask him to take a pencil, and without removing his finger off<BR>
the quarter, to draw a circle around the quarter. Have him repeat the same<BR>
exercise with each of his fingers pressing on top of the quarter. Afterwards,<BR>
have him pick up the quarter and rub it along the bridge of his nose. It'll<BR>
then be really funny to watch him walk around with a black line on his face.
<P>
I also have heard of a practical joke that can be done to a person while <BR>
he/she is sleeping. If the person's hand is dipped in warm water, this <BR>
causes a subconscious relaxation of the bladder and causes the person to<BR>
wet his/her bed. I have never tried this, nor have I seen it tried, but I've<BR>
heard it from quite a few people. Has anyone out there ever tried it?

This is true.  It seems that a colleague and myself are scheduled to<BR>

Also, just today I got a letter that begins "Thank you for agreeing to<BR>
serve as chairperson of the following session at ICASSP-87 in Dallas,<BR>
texas."  I've never met nor spoke to the person sending the letter nor<BR>
did I agree to be a chairperson.  Either someone is setting me (us) up<BR>

A computer related practical joke a played in my younger days<BR>
(2 years ago...) was to write an unstoppable program (disabled<BR>
break, ^C, etc...) that would imitate the login procedure. I<BR>
would leave it running on a public terminal and whenever<BR>
somebody tried to logon, it would always print the message<BR>
'User validation error' (Or whatever message corresponding<BR>
to the operating system [that was VAX/VMS.] login error)<BR>
and loop back.
<P>
Meanwhile, the user ID and the password were written in a file<BR>
in my directory...
<P>
The only way to get out of the program was to turn off the<BR>
gandalf box.

Back in the good old college days, when pulling all-nighters (sure, you must<BR>
have done some of those before!), at about 2 or 3am, try calling someone to<BR>
"remind" them to go to the bathroom (or do something). Wait for half-an-hour<BR>
or so, call again just to make sure s/he did what you asked them to do earlier!

When I was out at Union College in Schenectady N.Y, we had a great college<BR>
radio station that would give away pizzas, movie passes, clothes, etc. for<BR>
answering trivia questions throughout the day.  One day, my friend and I  <BR>
recorded a trivia question on our tape deck and kept the tape in the deck.<BR>
A little later one of our good friends came over to visit and we were all<BR>
listening to the campus station.  As soon as one of the songs ended, we turned<BR>
on the tape with out our friend noticeing and the D.J asked a trivia question<BR>
for a large pizza.  Our friend knew the answer and since he was closed to the <BR>
phone, he immediatly picked it up and dialed the station.  He was really excited<BR>
that he got through and started yelling the answer at the mystified D.J.  He was<BR>
incredibly embarrased, we were trying so hard not to laugh it hurt.

DEC 20 practical jokes were rampant at an undergraduate computer center<BR>
I once frequented. One practical joker, call him Jack (yes, the same<BR>
Jack mentioned in an earlier message on this list), wrote a program<BR>
that was really rather nasty.
<P>
This program maintained two tables or arrays of strings. The strings<BR>
would be things like:
<P>
    [FROM TTY NN: HI SWEETIE, JUST CAUGHT YOU LOOKING AT ME]<BR>
or<BR>
    [FROM TTY NN: HEY YOU GORGEOUS HUNK, COME OVER AND MEET ME]
<P>
The program would cycle through the system sending out these messages<BR>
occasionally to a random terminal, insuring that the terminal mentioned<BR>
in the terminal messages above would have an actual logged-in job.<BR>
The person who received the message would either be a) annoyed b)<BR>
flattered and want to meet their admirer or c) angry.
<P>
I heard that many meetings of users resulted from this program.

it (they?) was published by Paladin Press.

It contains real gems for all occasions. (mad at the landlord that<BR>

In 1972 I was working at a very boring job in an aerospace factory.  <BR>
There were three guys my age (early 20's) in the department and we <BR>
werw always playing what we saw as a joke on some poor unsuspecting<BR>
soul.  I was also in the Navy Reserve at the time and had to take <BR>
two weeks off during the Summer to due my training.  When I returned <BR>
>from two weeks off, not yet bored enough yet to begin playing more <BR>
jokes, the other three guys went off their heads pulling any kind of <BR>
trivial, dangerous or otherwise obnoxious stunt they could think of.  <BR>
At the end of the second day the supervisor called me into the office <BR>
and said:
<P>
"Jones, I don't know what's the matter with you but you better knock<BR>
it off.  I've had two weeks of peace and quiet while you were gone<BR>
and now that you're back all hell's breaking loose. You go on back<BR>
out there and stop bothering people."
<P>
I knew that I hadn't done anything but I didn't bother to protest.  <BR>
I could recognize a well executed joke when I saw one.

	A great trick I have gotten away with many a time requires a little <BR>
preparation, simply to go to the grocery and get a few packages of Kool-Aid.<BR>
Then while your 'prey' is away, simply spread it nice and liberally into his <BR>
bed, best if done in stripes, to leave his body in different colors. This<BR>
works best in a warm room where he is sure to sweat during the night to the<BR>
utmost.
<P>

<P>
	If you have access to a two(or more) line phone, this is a great one,<BR>
dial the first six numbers of your prey's phone number, and put that line on<BR>
hold, then dial the other number; a pizza place, or his girlfriend is good for<BR>
starters, then escalate to college offices, activist terrorist organizations<BR>
and the CIA are good from then on. After you dial the second number, quickly <BR>
put the second number on hold, then dial the last number of the first number<BR>
and push BOTH buttons down at the same time to activate both calls at once,<BR>
then listen, but don't laugh, or they might hear you and do worse in return.

<P>
If you had someone staying at your house, especially if they're traveling<BR>
with small children, help them pack up the car.  Slip some limburger (sp?)<BR>

1) Get a piece of plastic as long as the victims bed and a little over<BR>
twice as wide.  Remove his mattress from his bed frame and line the frame<BR>
with the plastic.  Tape the plastic to the bed if necessary.  Fill with water<BR>
(a hose connected to the tub is helpful).  Fold the rest of the plastic<BR>
over the water, and make the bed.  (Done to my roommate by mutual friend.)

2) If your victim has a roommate, switch all their possesions.  Or, turn<BR>
all the posters upside down and hang the furniture from the ceiling.  (Both<BR>
done to me.)

I think I have one of these books.  It is by George Heyduke (Hayduke?).  When<BR>
I read it, I was practically overcome with mirth.  Some of the things he sug-<BR>
gests are hilarious!  It says right in the book that it is written for enter-<BR>
tainment purposes only, and not to try any of the ideas, so I guess he has his<BR>
behind covered.  Some of the better ideas that I remember are:
<P>
1.  "Time bombs."  This is the phrase he uses to describe chicken parts. <BR>
    Easily gotten at any supermarket, they are innocent little items that<BR>
    can be carried almost anywhere (in a baggie, if neccessary).  But when<BR>
    stashed in an out-of-the-way place, like under furniture cushions in the<BR>
    house or under car seats or in the trunk in a car, and given a little<BR>
    time, YOW!  Watch out for the smell!  Gotten ripped off by a used-car<BR>
    dealer?  Wait awhile, then take some test drives in some other cars.<BR>
    With a few strategically placed "bombs" in a car with the windows closed<BR>
    in the hot sun.... use your imagination.  Getting evicted?  Remove some<BR>
    outlet covers or switch covers and stuff some of these babies down inside<BR>
    the wall.  They'll be impossible to find, and won't start to smell until<BR>
    after you're long gone.
<P>
2.  Parties.  Parties are great fun to plan, especially if you plan them for<BR>
    someone else to host (as a surprise).  Print up a few flyers for a party<BR>
    at your victim's house and distribute them where undesirables will be<BR>
    sure to see them.  For example, you might put up flyers around biker bars<BR>
    advertising "all the beer you can drink", and "crowning of Miss Biker", or<BR>
    something equivalent.  Even if the reluctant host doesn't let them in his<BR>
    house when the horde shows up, he will still wind up with a party on his <BR>
    lawn.  Of course, if you're his neighbor this gives you a good reason to<BR>
    complain to the cops or to his landlord, etc. 
<P>
3.  Set your victim against a third party, or against another victim.  Let<BR>
    other people do your dirty work for you.  Here's an example:  Call up<BR>
    the electric or gas company and impersonate your victim.  Request that <BR>
    service be terminated for a week or two (going on vacation, or whatever).<BR>
    As soon as that happens, call your victim.  Impersonate an officer of the <BR>
    gas/electric company, and be very nasty and abusive, saying that service <BR>
    has been discontinued because of non-payment of bills.  This should rile up<BR>
    your victim, asasuming that he HAS paid his bill and knows it. At any rate,<BR>
    tell him he must come down to the office immediately to discuss the problem<BR>
    or you will send the police to his house to collect, or something like that.<BR>
    Then, once you have him mad, and know he is going to the gas/electric<BR>
    company, call up that company.  Impersonate your victim.  Be very nasty,<BR>
    and try to get into an argument with a supervisor.  Wind up the conver-<BR>
    sation by saying that you are coming down there right now with a gun, and<BR>
    you are going to kill somebody.  Then hang up.  
<P>
    Or, if you call enough times so that people associate your voice with his<BR>
    name, you could call back some time after the argument and make a bomb<BR>
    threat.  They would recognize the voice as being 'him', and knowing that<BR>
    he was disgruntled would make him a prime suspect.
<P>
4.  Buy a cheap toy gun.  Plant it in your victim's car.  Then call the police<BR>
    and anonomously report that you saw a suspicious armed person in the area,<BR>
    and give the vehicle's description and location.  A variation of this would<BR>
    be to plant baggies full of phony drugs.  He probably won't be arrested,<BR>
    but he will probably be stopped and harrassed.
<P>
5.  Enter subscriptions in his name to the most filthy homo/bondage/snuff<BR>
    magazines you can find, and change his address by one so his NEIGHBOR<BR>
    receives them.  His neighbors will not only be disgusted by his perver-<BR>
    sions, they will also be irritated by the fact that he is too dumb to<BR>
    even get his address right on a subscription.
<P>
6.  If you can get one of his credit cards, or even a charge receipt or <BR>
    carbon copy of one, use the account to order gifts through the mail.<BR>
    Order gifts for REAL friends and relatives of the victim, and have<BR>
    them delivered directly to the recipient.  It puts him in an embarras-<BR>
    sing position to have to explain to his family and friends how his<BR>
    gift to them must be returned.  Also, can you imagine the guy trying<BR>
    to convince the bank that HE did not make the purchases?  Don't use his<BR>
    charge accounts for your own benefit, or you will very likely be caught.  
<P>
*********
<P>
Another joke which one can easily perpetrate goes like this:
<P>
Fill a plastic, or rubber, tube with water. Hold the tube<BR>
vertically up into the air and with the thumb of one hand<BR>
plug up the bottom hole of the tube and place it next to<BR>
your ear (hide the fact that you are plugging the hole).
<P>
Next, call a friend, or victim, and tell him that you are<BR>
hearing something really strange through the tube and he <BR>
should come over and listen in on it. When he gets close <BR>
enough to your ear to listen turn the tube towards his ear<BR>
and release your thumb.

First, go to the library and find some phone books for large cities.<BR>

the same name as the target.  Then go down to the post office and file<BR>
a change of address for the target, forwarding his mail to himself in<BR>
a far away city.
<P>
If I remember correctly the book states that this is very illegal and<BR>
is only included for amusement.

it's saturation level, then hang it outside until it freezes solid.<BR>
Once solid, replace on the victim's bed and make the bed up to look<BR>
like normal.  Boy will they be surprised when they go to bed.

Next time when you are having dinner, keep an empty jug of water on the table.<BR>
When somebody asks you to pass the jug, pretend while picking it up that it is<BR>
full of water and heavy. Keep the jug on the table near the victim. The<BR>
victim will apply what he/she considers is appropriate strength needed to pick<BR>
up the jug. This will cause the jug to jerk up to a significant height. The<BR>
sight is very funny and so is the victim's face.
<P>
Must try to believe. Even the most prude of your aunts will not mind being a<BR>
victim of this joke.

AH yes.. ye ole highschool days....  (seems everyone knows of or has done a<BR>
VW bug stunt already).  We also had a rather unliked teacher, whose VW was<BR>
carried up onto the gymnasium stage on the last day of school.  Needless to <BR>
say, every year  after that he arrived on the last day of school driving<BR>
the cab of his brother's semi.

This is more of a practical joke WITH a Beetle . . . . MIT has some very wide,<BR>
very long corridors that turn out to be VW-accessible.  One night a guy I knew<BR>
started cruising the corridors.  The practical joke came when the campus police<BR>
started chasing him.  He whipped around a corner, into a freight elevator, and<BR>
away.  They never found him.

My favourite practical joke involves on of those long line-ups<BR>
for tickets to a concert or something. First you go to the front<BR>
of the line and then walk the entire length, looking over everyone<BR>
as if you were trying to find a friend. When you get to the back you<BR>
walk back to the front doing the same thing, but this time even<BR>
slower. Then when you reach the front you turn and quickly run<BR>
to the back again, machine-gunning everybody as you go. Then you<BR>
go up to the ticket office and say "Get it?" This is a classic<BR>
joke and as you can see it is also quite practical, since it gets<BR>
you to the front of the line very fast.<BR>

If you live in a dorm with tiles on the bathroom door, pour rubbing alcohol<BR>
in the cracks, wait for your victim to go into the bathroom and seat<BR>
himself, and light the alcohol.
<P>
If you can get into your victim's house, staple the sides of many paper<BR>
cups together so that they are in a ring or matrix configuration (anything<BR>
too large to drag out the door), and fill them all with water.

A friend who lived in Durham sent a postcard to his girlfriend in Milwaukee<BR>
that said "Here is a check for the twenty dollars I owe you." and had a<BR>
blank spot and a piece of tape on it.
<P>
Six letters came to him from Milwaukee, some with photos, none from people<BR>
he knew, and all expressing interest in a personal to which they alluded.<BR>
One was from a male.  He assumed that his girlfriend had placed a personal<BR>
with his address in the paper there;  she had just enlisted help in letter-<BR>
writing.

One good practical joke that I've seen done to somebody:
<P>
1) Take an old record album cover.
<P>
2) Fill the insides with shaving cream.
<P>
3) Place it halfway under a locked door to the victim's office, home, room,<BR>
etc. with the open end inside the room.
<P>
4) Jump on it.
<P>
Another, if you can get access to the victim's key chain is to switch all<BR>
his keys for keys that look exactly the same, but don't fit the locks he's<BR>
trying to open. If you can be around for this one, it's much more fun to<BR>
watch the person go crazy as he cannot open anything he owns.

This reminds me of something a friend of mine did to get<BR>
even with a landlord that evicted him. There was a hole <BR>
in one of his walls so he put a couple of dead fish in<BR>
in the hole. He then plastered over the hole and repainted<BR>
the wall. Can you imagine the smell after a month of summer<BR>
heat? Nobody could tell where the odor would be coming from<BR>
until the bottom of the wall would start to rot. He did some<BR>
other things to the house but this was by far the most <BR>
subtle and undetectable until some time later.<BR>

	One of my favorite practical jokes is to get a somewhat long<BR>

a corner , go around, and find another person to hold the other end of<BR>
the rope. Go across the street and just wait...

Buy a BIG pile of magazines of every conceivable sort, and clip every<BR>
coupon for a catalog, trial product, free brochure, etc.  Specialty<BR>
magazines have the most, such as hobbies or sports (or computers).<BR>
Your victim should be deluged with junk mail (and since most such<BR>
lists get sold to other lists, the response will be a geometric<BR>
function of the number of clips you send).
<P>
A friend of mine and I once almost started a junkmail war, but formed<BR>
a truce before, because we knew it would follow us around for years...

It should be noted by people wishing to play practical jokes, that <BR>
some people take them dead seriously. Such people tend to escalate <BR>
the level of jokes by a couple of magnitudes. My three favorite stories <BR>
are from different colleges. 
<P>
One joker sprinkled finely ground powdered milk underneath his <BR>
victim's sheets. It acts like powdered sugar in the sense that, as you <BR>
sweat in your sleep, it dissolves and comes up through the sheets onto <BR>
your body and into your pores. But your sweat makes it sour, and when it <BR>
gets into your pores, it stays there. You smell very strongly of sour <BR>
milk for about a week (4 days if you shower and sauna every day). The <BR>
next weekend, when the joker was walking back from a party, three guys <BR>
jumped him. They were dressed in ski masks and painter's suits (those <BR>
light paper/cloth jumpsuits that people wear to paint autobodies). They <BR>
stripped, tied, blindfolded and gagged the joker, and spraypainted <BR>
him blue. No one was ever caught.
<P>
In another case, a yuppy practical joker taped a guy's car closed with <BR>
strapping and duct tape (the thing apparently looked like a ball of tape <BR>
when he got through). For those of you that don't know, the adhesive on <BR>
such tapes ruins a car's paint job, and can, if you try to remove it en masse,<BR>
even take off chips of paint and door guards (especially in winter). Two days <BR>
later, the yuppie's BMW was found with all four of its racing radials slashed <BR>
to ribbons. The yuppy of course, called the police on the guy who's car he <BR>
taped. The guy did not admit to slashing the tires, as opposed to the yuppie, <BR>
who told the police why he thought the other guy was responsible (ie: he <BR>
admitted to the police that he taped the other car). Charges were never <BR>
pressed about the BMW (lack of evidence), and charges were pressed about the <BR>
car taping. Did the guy actually slash the BMW wheels? He always claimed <BR>
that he didn't (of course the last time I knew, the statute of limitations <BR>
wasn't up yet).
<P>
Then of course there's the people who take the direct route to revenge. <BR>
Some guy thought he would make a very large, easy going, farm boy feel more <BR>
at home. So he got some fresh pig manure and dumped it in the farm boy's room.<BR>
The very large farm boy, apparently lacking a cultured sense of humor, <BR>
beat the living shit out of the joker. Then he told the joker that if it <BR>
happened again, the joker would eat the pigshit. Nobody doubted him. 
<P>
So be very careful who you decide to pull a practical joke on, because they <BR>
may not think it's as funny as you do.

<P>
Call a mortuary and report the victim dead.  Arrange to have his body picked up<BR>
at his house sometime when he is at home.
<P>
*********
<P>
One of my favorites is to put a couple of ping pong<BR>
balls in someones gas tank. The car will start just<BR>
fine and will run for a couple of blocks. Then the<BR>
balls will get sucked into the gas feed and cause<BR>
the car to die. The balls will now float back to the<BR>
top of the tank and he will be able to restart the car.<BR>
This will be very frustrating to the car owner, espiality<BR>
if he works on his own car. First he will replace the<BR>
fuel filter then maybe the fuel pump. From there on out<BR>
he will be pulling his hair out to figure out what to do<BR>
next.<BR>

Another door-related practical joke, good in dorm-life scenarios:
<P>
1.  Locate undesirable LP record w/ jacket.  I recommend "Mystic Moods".<BR>
2.  Fetch cardboard jacket-- should be in good condition, no split sides<BR>
or the such.  (Save disc for frisbee-- they shatter in fine fashion when<BR>
hurled in a room.  But I digress.)<BR>
3.  Fetch can of shaving cream, e.g. Gillette Foamy or the like.  Fill<BR>
album cover with shaving cream.<BR>
4.  With accomplice, go to room of victim.  Their door should be closed.<BR>
5.  Fit open edge of cream-filled album cover under bottom of door.<BR>
6.  Accomplice braces album cover.<BR>
7.  Jump on album cover, ejecting shaving cream into dorm room.<BR>
8.  Run like hell.
<P>
Note that if the intended victim's door fits the frame very tightly,<BR>
leaving little or no room for the escape of the shaving cream, step<BR>
number 7 will instead result in a shaving cream explosion in the<BR>
faces of the would-be jokers.  This suggests an obvious alternate<BR>
"patsy" scenario...
<P>
This was funny when tried.  Of course, most things are funny at 4 AM.
<P>

My favourite was one I heard that someone at Boston University did to his<BR>
roomate, who he hated.  Late one night, while the roomate, a very sound<BR>
sleeper, was asleep, this chap superglued his...er...male organ...to the<BR>
inside of his leg.
<P>
The roomate must have been a sound sleeper.

I guess I am too restrained to perpetrade anything that might get<BR>

Second prize goes to the chubby girl eons ago in high school.<BR>
A single teacher had made out of line remarks *during class* about<BR>

We once pulled the reverse trick.  The victim's room had a door whose latch<BR>
was of the pattern: handle each side; latch mechanism in middle; square rod<BR>
passes through latch mechanism and seats in handles (invisible from outside).<BR>
We removed the outer handle, took away the rod, and replaced the handle.  In<BR>
the morning, he couldn't get out of his room.  Took the maintenance person<BR>
TWO HOURS to figure out what we had done; by which time the victim rather<BR>
badly wanted a trip down the corridor!

<P>
To be done in warmer climates:  break apart oreo cookies so that<BR>
white, creamy filling sticks to 1/2 of cookie (the way most kids<BR>
eat them).  Discard or eat other 1/2 of cookie without filling.<BR>
Place cookies (filling side down) on victim's car -- this should<BR>
take several bags of cookies.  When the warm sun hits the victim's<BR>
car, the cookies ooooooooozzzzzzzzzzzzzzeee down the car, leaving <BR>
opaque stripes.  Really quite a sight! Really!
<P>

<P>
We did something like this, the night before a friend got married.<BR>
To keep him from waking up, we covered his face with a rag soaked<BR>
in ether or chloroform (I'm not sure).  We proceeded to shave off<BR>
*half* his mustache.
<P>
His intended was slightly disturbed when she heard the news the next<BR>
morning, so she decided to get us back.  While we were in the ceremony,<BR>
she had someone sew up the pants legs to our clothes.
<P>
We got the last laugh though.  As the newlyweds were getting into <BR>
the car, we pulled up in a truck, kidnapped the groom, and drove away.<BR>
We took him a few miles out of town, stripped him, and hand-cuffed<BR>
him to a road sign.  Taught her.

At one of the dorms here (Techwood) I remember when lots of practical jokes<BR>
were played on people.  Of course there was the 'penny in the door frame' to<BR>
'penny' them in (keep the door from opening).  But i always liked the more<BR>
original versions.  Cover the door with paper, just paper.  Let the mark<BR>
open the door, find the paper, and break it all down... do this as many times<BR>
as you wish.  The next time, paper the door and either place a wall of bricks<BR>
or cement blocks behind the door (by this time, he just walks thru the paper)<BR>
or even prop a trashcan full of water against the door...  
<P>
These and other jokes became quite popular, but, alas, a new class of students<BR>
seems to have moved in (they actually **study**) and these jokes became out-<BR>
lawed by the RA's (hall monitors)...  (RA's used to help...  and were usually<BR>
helpful with their pass key)... But these jokes were called a fire hazard (i.e.<BR>
would block people in, in a fire...)  "so it goes..."

In the afore-quoted book, such a trick is suggested as a way of getting<BR>
even with your bank. Rent a safety-deposit box and fill it with fish. I <BR>
don't know how you can prevent them tracing it to you, though...
<P>
The oft-quoted "Volkswagen-in-the-bedroom" schtick is good. A simpler variant<BR>
avoids the hard labor involved here by subtituting a self-propelled obstacle<BR>
for the VW. In this case, one or more sheep.

While the animals themselves are easily removed from the abode, they do<BR>

I remember a practical that failed -- or I guess you could say<BR>
that it succeeded too well.  In Philadelphia, 10-15 years ago,<BR>
a man decided to play a practical joke on his best friend.  He<BR>
took out an add in the "help wanted" section of the Bulletin,<BR>
advertising job openings for demolishing houses.  Applicants<BR>
were to meet in front of the site at 6:00 AM Saturday morning.<BR>
Naturally, the site was the friend's house.  The perpetrator imagined<BR>
a couple of hundred men waking up his friend and asking to<BR>
demolish his house.  Alas, the friend was not home.  Another<BR>
problem was that this was during a recession, with high<BR>
unemployment.  About 2,000 men showed up.  It was apparent<BR>
that only a small percentage would be hired, so a few<BR>
decided that if they could present the employer with<BR>
an accomplished deed, they would be the ones to get the jobs.<BR>
Everybody joined in.  A few minutes later, they sat down to await<BR>
the coming of the employer.
<P>
I can't remember what happened after that, if I ever knew.  I imagine<BR>
it got pretty unpleasant.  It made the evening news.
<P>
*********
<P>
This is a very simple trick, but you'd be surprised just how effective it is.<BR>
When the victim is sleeping, make a shallow paper tray and scotch tape it to <BR>
his door AND to the door frame near the knob.  Fill it with unpopped popcorn.<BR>
When he opens the door (from the inside, obviously) he'll have popcorn flung<BR>
all over the place.  Not only does it pack quite a little surprise, it also <BR>
takes forever to find all of the popcorn afterwards.
<P>
It works!  Someone tried this on me when I was in first-year of my undergrad<BR>
days.

My favorite practical joke was performed back in high school on the director<BR>
of our Audio Visual Dept.  Upon purchasing a brand new, expensive video<BR>
camera, he set it up in the AV lounge so he could watch us hoodlums <BR>
on a monitor in his office.  While he wasn't looking we taped a clear<BR>
piece of plastic over the lens of the camera.  Then the designated <BR>
provacateur made sure that he was watching while another went up to the<BR>
lens with a squeeze bottle of highly caustic liquid, and crusty, grime<BR>
laden rag, to "clean the lens".  Fred jumped over his desk and knocked <BR>
over a couple of onlookers before realizing what was going on.

When I was living in the dorms on campus, frequently someone with<BR>
a car would offer to drive into town on a rainy day, to save a<BR>
wet bike ride.  There were always takers.  I have a car, so <BR>
I took many friends to the store, post office, or Bank.  If<BR>
someone  banked at the same place as I did and I knew they were<BR>
going to make a deposit, sometimes I would get a few bucks together and<BR>
also make a deposit.  BUT, as I was standing at the little table<BR>
(you know with the little chained pens) I would take a deposit<BR>
slip and write THIS IS A STICK-UP  GIVE ME ALL THE MONEY IN YOUR<BR>
DRAWER on the back.  Then I would casually slide it over to my friend<BR>
and hand it to him, face up.  After making my deposit I would<BR>
leave the bank.  The friend would step up and hand the teller<BR>
the deposit slip.  They always check both sides to see if any<BR>
additional checks are listed.  Sitting across the street was<BR>
a good place to see the cops pull up.  Usually things took<BR>
about 20 minutes before he convinced them he was not a bank<BR>
robber.  You have to pick a friend with integrity and<BR>
a quick mind though.  If he panics and gives your name,<BR>
you are history.  I only tried it twice.

Practical Joke 1: After making sure that the victim is out or sound <BR>
          asleep (if the victim is in make sure he can't get out),<BR>
          put a line of baby powder along the bottom crack of the<BR>
          door (or on a piece of paper and slide it under the door --<BR>
          hold onto one end). Then use the blow-dryer to spray the<BR>
          powder into a fine mist that will cover everything in the<BR>
          room.
<P>
Practical Joke 2: Make a small, off-center hole in a can of shaving<BR>
          cream and then heave the can into the victims open door.<BR>
          As the pressure spews the cream out, it will spin the can <BR>

Do it the Caltech way.  Dump water on the victim's bed until it's soaked, and<BR>
pour liquid nitrogen on the bed until the water freezes.  You're right that<BR>

can get rid of it.

Back in the OLD days while in college, a "friend" of mine one day used the<BR>
pointed end of his umbrella to knock on our dorm room door.  He poked so<BR>
hard that the point went all the way through the door (cheap door).  A<BR>
couple of days later, a janitor noticed the "bullet" hole and called the<BR>
police.  My room mate and I decided just to play it dumb; "Gee officer,<BR>
we didn't notice a hole there", "We never heard a shot", etc.  The police<BR>
never did find the bullet nor where it hit the wall on the other side.

I think Bryan also tells of the time Robert Benchley and a fellow<BR>
Harvard undergraduate, dressed in work clothes, went to the door of<BR>
a house on a veddy nice square in Boston and said to the maid,<BR>
"We're here for the sofa."<BR>
     "Which one?" she said.<BR>
     This was a dangerous moment, but Benchley saw a sofa in the<BR>
corner of the living room and said, "That one."<BR>
     They then walked, carrying the sofa, to another house on the<BR>
same square, rang the bell, and told a second maid, "We're here with<BR>
the sofa."<BR>
     "Um, I guess you can put it there," she said; and so they did.

     Benchley heard, in a roundabout way, that the lady of the<BR>
first house visited the lady of the second one some six months later<BR>

   A small box was filled with the punch-holes from paper tapes.<BR>
The bottom was removed and it was placed on my bookshelf at work, with<BR>

pick it up.  Needless to say, the little things were everywhere for <BR>

   I have never tried this, but a chemist friend of mine told me of a<BR>
practical joke.  Get a hold of the victims coffee cup.  Make sure its <BR>
empty.  Put one drop of phenolthalien ( excuse the spelling, I'm refering<BR>
to the acid/base indicator) in the cup and fill it with water. Empty the <BR>
cup and let it dry.  When the victim fills it, their is still residue of<BR>
the phenolthalien in the cup.  The effect!, the victim will not be able<BR>
to make it to the bathroom in time.

A nifty, if difficult, practical joke:<BR>
 <BR>
This only really works with friends<BR>
(preferably the trusting type).  Get the victim to<BR>
your house, then talk (or do whatever you normally<BR>
do together) for a while.  Then mention an<BR>
interesting effect you read about recently and<BR>
wanted to show him/her.  Fill a glass (preferably<BR>
a short, squat glass) with water, and have a<BR>
baseball bat or a similar long, cylindrical object<BR>
handy.  Stand on a chair with the glass, and press<BR>
the mouth of the glass against the ceiling.  Have<BR>
your friend/victim press the bat/whatever against<BR>
the bottom of the glass hard enough so that the<BR>
pressure will hold the glass to the ceiling.  The<BR>
theory is that if you keep the glass against the<BR>
ceiling long enough, it will adhere to the ceiling<BR>
without the bat holding it up.  Then put the chair<BR>
back, and tell your friend that it'll take about<BR>
five minutes or so for the bond to form.  Take<BR>
turns holding the glass up with the bat to avert<BR>
suspicion.  When the victim is "on duty" once<BR>
again, casually mention that you have a few things<BR>
to do.  Put your jacket on and leave the house.<BR>
(Of course, you're going to come back, aren't you?<BR>
You just wanted to see the look on his face,<BR>
right?)  If you can get this to work (which you can, <BR>
if you are convincing and the victim is gullible), it's a<BR>
marvelous joke.  I pulled this on my roommate -<BR>
but there was one small problem - when I left our<BR>
room, the door was locked and I had forgotten my<BR>
keys.  My other roommate showed up in about ten<BR>
minutes, but it was not a happy scene...

Yet another answer to that silly revenge problem:<BR>
Tape down the little white things that spring up when you lift the<BR>

come up at all.)  Of course all this should be done in the victims<BR>

Good for aracniphobics (check the spelling on that one.)<BR>
Get approximately 20 pieces of 1 metre or yard long white string.<BR>
Tie a knot at one end and temporarily secure it to the centre of a closed <BR>
door.  Begin to tape the ends to the door frame being careful not to close<BR>
the door itself.  It should begin to resemble a large spider's web.<BR>
Get the rest of the string and start weaving spirarally just like <BR>
Charlotte would.  Complete the masterpiece by purchasing plastic<BR>
creepy crawlies and attaching them also to the string (eye level,etc.).<BR>
Unsecure the centre knot and instant spider web.<BR>
You might want to try it with fishing line and smaller creepies if you're<BR>

A friend and I pulled a similar stunt on a co-worker some time back.<BR>
After a long series of joke-perpetrating back and forth, we procured<BR>
a rather large box and filled it with packing 'peanuts', then proceeded<BR>
to cut a large hole in the bottom and invert the box on the victim's<BR>
desk.  We then took a short length of string and fed it into a tiny hole<BR>
in the top of the box, taping the other end to the side of the box.<BR>
This 'red herring' was easily mistaken for some type of trip-wire to<BR>
be engaged if the box was opened.  When the victim saw the parcel, he<BR>
immediately knew the source and, wary of opening the box, followed his<BR>
initial instincts and quickly grabbed it to move it off his desk ...<BR>
the rest is fairly obvious ...

  I had a mischevious roommate in college.  Fortunately, I was the object<BR>
of his machinations only once.  It didn't take long to track down my furniture<BR>
>from the ten places on campus where he had distributed it over spring break.
<P>
  His masterpiece, however, was a concerted effort that involved everyone<BR>
on my hallway.  The victim:  our "sponsor" (at Pomona College, an upper-<BR>
classperson in charge of a gaggle of fledgling freshpeople).
<P>
  This one takes some preparation.  Wrap very thin filament wire (high<BR>
resistance, low flash point) around the fuse of an M80 firecracker.  Imbed<BR>
this assembly in a box of cornflakes, leading the wires out of the box.
<P>
  Next, wire several old-fashioned camera flashbulbs in parallel, and put<BR>
them in a circuit with the firecracker wire and a 12 V lantern battery.  Rig<BR>
a solenoid to close the circuit (we used an old clothespin).
<P>
  Now you're ready.  When the victim is out of his/her room, hang the<BR>
cornflake box in the middle of the room.  Arrange the flashbulbs near the<BR>
door.  Place the solenoid so that opening the door will close the circuit.<BR>
Lounge nearby and watch the fun.
<P>
  When the victim opens the door, s/he thinks that the room just exploded.<BR>
Bright light, loud noise, and the burnt cornflakes feel like a bomb-blast<BR>
concussion as they hit your body.
<P>
  Boy howdy, that woman could run.  Caught up with her somewhere around<BR>
North Campus.  Being dutiful sponsees, we helped clean up the cornflake mess<BR>
later.

This sounds suspiciously like one of David Brenner's "Best Practical Jokes<BR>
In The World".  He claimed to do this and put the slip back, three or four<BR>
slips down.  The lucky recipient was a kindly-looking little old lady who<BR>
had a habit of smiling vacantly and nodding.  When the bank teller read the<BR>
back of the slip, and saw this little old lady smiling and nodding, he tripped<BR>
the silent alarm, the doors slammed shut, the guards all pulled out their guns,<BR>
and the only two customers in the bank were the little old lady and David<BR>
Brenner in the corner laughing his ass off.  Naturally he recommended that<BR>
against trying this little stunt.
<P>
The other practical joke of his that I remember involved getting a friend with<BR>
a car to help you.  Pick up about a dozen cheap brooms, and get on a local<BR>
(downtown) bus.  Of course, the brooms will be impossible to manage as the<BR>
bus bounces and sways, and will annoy passangers and driver alike.  But, as<BR>
you've paid your fair, the driver figures you'll be off the bus soon enough<BR>
and he'll be done with you.  Get off at the last stop, hop into your friend's<BR>
waiting car, and zip back to the stop you got on at, and get on THE SAME BUS.<BR>
Much yucks.

Back in my graduate days, I used to bring my lunch to school which consisted<BR>
of a sandwich and usually a hard boiled egg.  I kept a small jar of salt in<BR>
my desk for the eggs.  One day I dipped my egg in the salt only to discover<BR>
it was sugar.  It was easy to spot the prankster(s); everyone in the room was<BR>
snickering!
<P>
I used to bring my lunches in plastic lined paper bags with bend-over tabs<BR>
on the top.  The bags were very good and kept my sandwiches fresh.  I got<BR>
them for free from the pockets of airline seats.  One day as I was opening<BR>
my "lunch" bag in the lab, the same bunch of pranksters from above gathered<BR>
around my table and opened their own barf bag lunches (they had just gotten<BR>
back from an out-of-state conference).  However, the joke was turned around<BR>
on one of them.  He was spooning yogurt out of his bag and eating it.  After<BR>
I told him what it looked like, he lost his appetite.
<P>
*********<BR>
You take the top off the standard sugar dispenser found at restaraunts<BR>
around the country.  You place a single layer of paper napkin over the<BR>
opening in the glass part, then put salt on top of that.  Put the top back<BR>
on and tear off all the paper showing around the edges.  The first victim<BR>
gets salt in his coffee, which I suppose is funny to some people.  But what<BR>
is even funnier is this same guy, or the next, trying to get sugar out of<BR>
the thing.  They think the sugar may be caked and bang the dispenser on the<BR>
table, shake it, hold it up to the light and squint at it, etc. ...
<P>
Many years ago, before all the young studs started taking their dates to<BR>
motels for, er, recreation, there were always Lover's Lanes around.  On a<BR>
typical moonlit night there might be a dozen cars at one of these places<BR>
with the windows all steamed up from the activities within, and occasional<BR>
flashes of red as flailing feet inadvertantly hit brake pedals.  Some people<BR>
I knew used to get their jollies chaining the bumpers or axles of these cars<BR>
to the nearest fence or tree ...
<P>
The most elaborate joke along these lines was played by three friends of<BR>
mine, whom we'll call Tom, Dick and Harry.
<P>
On a moonlit night as described above, Tom came running out of the woods<BR>
onto the Lover's Lane screaming, "No! NO! Oh, God, Please NO!"
<P>
When Tom had everybody's attention, Dick stepped out of the woods with a<BR>
shotgun, yelled "Now I'll get you, you bastard!" and fired the gun over<BR>
Tom's head.
<P>
Tom dropped to the ground and lay there writhing and screaming until Dick<BR>
came over and fired a blast into the ground near his head, then went limp<BR>
and quiet.
<P>
Then Harry came rushing over, yelling "Jesus, Jack, why'd you DO it? He was<BR>
our FRIEND!!  Oh, my God! ..." and the like.  Then both Dick and Harry<BR>
grabbed Tom by the heels and dragged him back to the woods.  When they were<BR>
out of sight Tom got up and all three enjoyed the activity back at the scene<BR>
of the "crime", which needless to say had changed considerably from a few<BR>
minutes before.

Something I have done before is wire someones bed to give them a nice shock.
<P>
It was done as follows:
<P>
strip some stranded wire and use the wire to form a grid under the top sheet.<BR>
it works best to have this grid look like fingers that interlace but don't<BR>
touch.
<P>
this was then connected to the 110 V side of a texas instruments calculator<BR>
transformer.  to the calculator side of the transformer add a 12 or 24 Volt<BR>
DC supply (i can't remember which we used) connected through a normaly<BR>
open switch.
<P>
then press the button rapidly to cause a transient in the transformer.
<P>
It is funny as heck to watch someone wake up as they are getting the<BR>
shock.  if you stop while they are still partially asleep they really<BR>
have trouble figuring out whats going on.
<P>
i'm sure you could automate the process so the person has just enough time<BR>
to fall a sleep before the next shock.

When I was at Burroughs Corp., a couple of co-workers got into a get-even<BR>

<P>
--Filling toolbox with punched-card chad.

--Same as above, then pouring oil over everything! <<yuchh>>
<P>
--Wiring toolbox to 110 VAC. (I'm not endorsing these activities; simply<BR>

Here is a simple, but fun, practical joke you can try.
<P>
	You need a phone with a handset so that you can unscrew the<BR>
mouth piece and remove the pickup.  It's real easy, they are just sitting<BR>
in there and not wired down.  Replace the mouth piece and think up a good<BR>
excuse to get someone to use the phone.  This joke was done to me when I<BR>
was in college.  My roommate told me that this girl who I thought was cute<BR>
had called, and that she wanted me to call back.  I felt pretty stupid yelling<BR>
into the phone trying to talk to her.  And all I heard was her say 'Hello,<BR>
hello, is anyone there, hello?'  After I realized what had happened, we<BR>
went out and tryed it on some other friends, with similar results.<BR>
	It's a good joke because it is totally harmless, and even more<BR>
fun after a few drinks.
<P>
	For a quick laugh, try:
<P>
		zork | valspeak

	If you don't have valspeak, I would suggest getting a copy. It's a<BR>
great way to hand in weekly reports to your boss.

In the good ol' days of punched cards, every keypunch machine had a container<BR>
into which the square "chips" fell.  A favorite practical joke at a certain<BR>
famous Eastern Technological Institute, paralyzed around science, was to dump<BR>
a bag of these collected chips on someone taking a shower and shampoo in the<BR>
dormitory.  It could take weeks to get rid of all those wet chips ....

Other types of phone fun...
<P>
While we were in the other room, listening through a modem (we were in NY<BR>
State), a friend of mine, using his impeccable british accent, would<BR>
call a random number in London England..... collect; stating that he was <BR>
Sir so-and-so from the British consulate or some other such agency. <BR>
These people would almost all accept.  (It was about 2:00 AM for them,<BR>
so I guess that might be part of the reason...).  He then proceeded<BR>
to take an official telephone survey:
<P>
"1)  Do you believe Margret Thatcher's handling of the Falklands crisis was<BR>
  <BR>
    a)  Excellent<BR>
    b)  fair to good<BR>
    c)  fair<BR>
    etc...<BR>
.....
<P>
At least at the time, it was hillarious... especially his ability to sound<BR>
and act authentically enough for these people to accept the collect call in<BR>
the first place.. form the USA... and then stay on long enough to actually<BR>
do the survay!

Here is a classic which has been fading into a lost art.  It works extremely<BR>
well someplace like a military academy or such, where everything must always<BR>
be in impeccable order, but can be used for good effect in a dorm room, too:
<P>
It's the fine art of stringing up a room.  The idea is to string the room <BR>
(trough makeshift pullies and levers, etc.) such that as the victim turns <BR>
his door knob and opens the door, his entire room is upset.  One classic<BR>
example involved stringing the bunkbed so that it lifted itself up of the floor<BR>
and turned upside down, books would tumble off a shelf, in turn moving a <BR>
dresser across the room, emtying a wall locker, pulling the shoes up into the<BR>
light fixtures and otherwise creating serious havoc.  What's nice is that<BR>
the destruction itself is done by the victim; all you did was run a little<BR>
string....  This, however, can lead to serious counter-pranks.  Don't say<BR>
I didn't warn you!
<P>

<P>
Now to add my $.02...<BR>
(This works best if you have several people to work on it)<BR>
One night when one person in my dorm was away at a party, but for some<BR>
unknown reason left his door unlocked (trusting sucker!), several other<BR>
people removed all his furniture and belongings. Most of the stuff went<BR>
to a garbage/storage room, but some of the stuff (the more valuable)<BR>
went to other rooms. When he got back (at 3:?? AM), good and tired, he<BR>
was met with a nice floor lamp in the middle of the room and a telephone<BR>
in the trash basket.<BR>
 Then for the next several weeks, anyone who left their door unlocked<BR>
was asking for it...

Reminds me of when I was in first year at UVIC.  At that time, punch-cards<BR>
were used for programming still (They added terminals the year after I left).<BR>
The rectangular cardboard confetti had many uses :-)  That stuff was hard to<BR>
get off of clothes, out of your hair, etc.  One friend of mine decided to<BR>
collect the stuff, so every day he would go around and empty the confetti<BR>
>from the punch machines.  At a party he was going around tossing the stuff<BR>
at people and laughing as they tried to get it out of their clothes (it sure<BR>
itches if you get it in your clothes!).  He had collected a whole paper<BR>
shopping bag full - one of the big ones.  When he got around to me I reached<BR>
out and whacked the bag hard on the bottom as he was reaching in to get another<BR>
handfull.  Well he was looking down into the bag and had his mouth open.  The<BR>
confetti exploded upwards into his face and mouth.  We were practically rolling<BR>
around on the floor watching him trying to clean the stuff out of his mouth<BR>
an off his tongue.  A few days later he got me back by collecting more and<BR>
dumping it on my car, into the ventilation inlets.  To this day years after he<BR>
did this, an occasional rectangular cardboard piece of confetti will float up<BR>
out of the ventilation system every time you turn on the fan/heater.

Here are two of my favorites (which I've never yet performed: maybe I'm just<BR>
not spiteful enough.)
<P>
Prickly pear cacti have two kinds of spines: large ones and tiny reddish<BR>
hairs that are incredibly irritating.  Gather the tiny ones, and distribute<BR>
them into the clothing of someone you detest, perhaps the underwear.  They<BR>
will probably be noticed too late.  Caveat: this should make the clothes<BR>
permanently unusable.
<P>
Collect an engorged tick from a dog, and keep it until it produces an egg<BR>
mass.  Hide the egg mass at a spot where the victim sits.  Several hundred<BR>
tiny "seed ticks" will patiently wait their opportunity to swarm over the<BR>
first warm-blooded creature available.  They are too small to easily pick<BR>
off, and just large enough to see.  (This happened [by accident] to me in<BR>
Georgia this summer.  I wasn't disturbed much, but then I study ticks and<BR>
mites for fun.)
<P>
Don't make an enemy of an imaginative biologist.

Speaking of practical jokes, my wife pulled one several years ago...
<P>
For my wife's birthday several years ago, some people at the law office<BR>
where she works hired a male belly dancer to entertain her.  She swore<BR>
sweet revenge.  Six months later, the instigator of the belly dancer<BR>
incident had her birthday.  My wife arranged for the single brother of<BR>
another secretary to meet the instigator for lunch, etc.  The instigator<BR>
didn't know the brother before this, so it looked like someone had hired<BR>
an escort service for her to help celebrate her birthday.  The joke,<BR>
however, backfired.  The secretary and the single brother are now <BR>
married.  At the wedding, held at a large and famous Chicago hotel,<BR>
a gorilla handed out bannanas to the guests, courtesy of my spouse.

This reminds me of something I saw at our residence a couple of terms ago.<BR>
Outside one of the houses was an entire bedroom suite! (bed, desk, chair,<BR>
the whole bit - even the bed was made!) I don't know exactly from which dorm<BR>
it came from or whodunnit but I imagine somebody was not too happy!
<P>
*********
<P>
My favorites:
<P>
Dump a whole bottle of detergent into the<BR>
toilet tank.  This produces great billowing<BR>
suds out of the bowl on first flush.  Especially<BR>
great if first flusher is sitting at the time.
<P>
Use a clip lead to connect the brake light switch<BR>
to the horn relay on the targets car.  Every time<BR>
they step on the brake the horn blows.  It's<BR>
amazing how many people can't associate the horn<BR>
blowing with using the brake.  They just report<BR>
that the horn blows at random times.  This is<BR>
especially useful joke to watch in parking lots<BR>
when work lets out.
<P>
Carefully pick up sleeping targets bed and set it on<BR>
four coke bottles.  When target rolls over or makes<BR>
any significant move bed will crash 6 inches to the <BR>
floor and there will be bottles rolling all over the<BR>
place but not a soul in sight.
<P>
Steal a banana from targets lunch.  Use large sewing<BR>
needle to pierce skin at seam and move needle back<BR>
and forth to "cut" banana in half.  Continue doing<BR>
this along the seam and banana will be sliced when<BR>
peeled by target.
<P>
Saran wrap on reading glasses that have been left on<BR>
desk is good.  Trimming at edge of lens is hard but<BR>
effect is great.  Not usually noticed when first picked<BR>
up but optical quality of saran is spectacularly bad.
<P>
I know of a variation of the fake workmen digging the street<BR>
that worked well.  In the original (very risky) you<BR>
masquerade as real workmen and dig a hole in the street<BR>
and leave.  When this was first done in NY in the fifties<BR>
it was days before anybody realized something was wrong and<BR>
traffic was a disaster until the street department patched<BR>
the hole.  In the variation, the jokers observed real workmen<BR>
digging the street and reported to the police that college<BR>
students were again digging up the street as a joke.  The<BR>
police thanked the tipster and headed for the dig.  In the<BR>
meantime the jokers approached the workmen and toldthem that<BR>
the college had freshmen dressed up as cops as part of<BR>
fraternity initiation and that they would be around soon to<BR>
give the workmen a hard time.  The workmen thought this was<BR>
great and agreed to give the "cops" a hard time back.<BR>
It was a long time before this mess was sorted out.<BR>
(this was my all time favorite practical joke)
<P>
Another idea that I couldn't perfect might be of interest.<BR>
I got one of the air freshener gadgets that had a battery<BR>
operated timer that causes a brief push on a self-contained<BR>
can of air freshener every 10 minutes.  I guess you leave this<BR>
thing in the bathroom and get a brief pssssst of freshener<BR>
every ten minutes.  Anyhow, I tried to change the can of air<BR>
freshener (which is indeed replacable) with a freon horn.<BR>
Unfortunately the freon horns sold for emergency use in boats<BR>
etc. have a different cap on top that I could not adapt<BR>
to the freshener.  If you could make this work you could<BR>
plant this thing in somebodies shrubs or cellar or warehouse...<BR>
or office.

This supposedly happened a bunch of years ago, when deposit slips imprinted<BR>
with one's account number were becoming available, but banks still had<BR>
trays with generic deposit slips for their customers' convenience.
<P>
This gentleman opens an account, deposits a few thousand dollars.  He then<BR>
leaves _his_own_ deposit slips in the counter slots in various branches.<BR>
A few days before next month's statements appear, he goes in, checks his<BR>
balance, withdraws one hundred eighty thousand dollars in cash, and<BR>
disappears.  Seems the system credited his account with deposits that<BR>
others made (seemingly to their accounts) using his slips.
<P>
And one that doesn't involve banks, but allegedly happened...
<P>
College student returns to his room to find a bucket of water amateurishly<BR>
balanced above the door, ready to fall on him when he opens the door.  So<BR>
he lifts down the bucket and empties it into his sink.

Too bad the perpetrators also removed the drain pipe from the sink.

These were told to me by a friend who once attended Devry Inst. in<BR>
Arizona (a tech. school for electronics types).  Three favorite<BR>
practical jokes were:
<P>
(1) The access to the supply room (to obtain lab materials) was via<BR>
    a Dutch door (two-piece job where either top or bottom could be<BR>
    opened independently), where the top half was left open so<BR>
    students could lean over and request supplies.  The lab grunts<BR>
    wired a thin filament wire to a power supply and strung it across<BR>
    the top of the bottom portion of the door.  Normal instincts of<BR>
    students led them to lean or place hands there while waiting for<BR>
    materials, and were met with a small yet satisfying jolt.
<P>
(2) This one I've heard of from various sources.  Charge up a bell-type<BR>
    capacitor and tape the leads in such a way that they are almost<BR>
    but not quite touching.  Call to the victim with a rousing "Here,<BR>
    catch!" and lob the cap to them.  When they catch, the slight<BR>
    squeezing pressure will connect the leads and the capacitor will<BR>
    pop. (VARIATION: Leave 'loaded' cap on chair for them to sit on)
<P>
(3) The most common labs involved circuit design and troubleshooting,<BR>
    and students were forever wary as they applied power to a new circuit<BR>
    for the first time.  My friend's prank involved running some thin<BR>
    hollow plastic flex tubing from his lab station to a point below and<BR>
    behind the victim's station.  He would then light up a cigarette and<BR>
    wait.  As soon as the victim applied power to his circuit, he would<BR>
    blow ciggie smoke into his end of the tube.  Within a few seconds,<BR>
    victim would see smoke rising from his board and cut power.  He would<BR>
    examine board, find no trouble, and fire it up again.  Soon smoke<BR>
    would appear ... this can be stretched out for a good long time, or<BR>
    until he sees the tubing.
<P>
*********
<P>
Try this one out sometime.  While the victim is asleep<BR>
carefully put Vaseline between his/her toes.  What you will<BR>
obeserve is the person's toes starting to wiggle.  The<BR>
apparent mechanism is that when your toes start slipping against<BR>
each other, your mind insists on making them slip and slide<BR>
more and more.  The upshot of this is that the part of the mind<BR>
that's supposed to be getting rest is busy moving toes.  The<BR>
victim wakes up having had no sleep at all.
<P>
How 'bout this:  if the victim uses Head 'n Shoulders or Selsun<BR>
Blue shampoo, and a few drops of methylene blue (available in pet stores)<BR>
to a FULL bottle.  Over time (if the victim is fair-haired), you will<BR>
notice their hair turning blue, as methylene blue stains all organic<BR>
material.
<P>
Also writing things on someone's back with indellible ink is pretty<BR>
good. Use your imagination.  "Laugh, but don't tell me about it." is a<BR>
pretty good one.
<P>
Get a group of people to chip in 1 or 2 bucks, and bet the victim the collected<BR>
sum that he or she can't put a cue ball in his/her mouth.  Hint:  cue balls<BR>
go in, but they don't come out.  In fact, medical science has developped a<BR>
tool to aid in the removal of cue balls.
<P>
Take doors.  Just take them off the hinges and put them somewhere else.

<P>
	Another paper punch-hole trick that is even better is to take<BR>
a plastic 35mm film canister, paper punch-holes and a can of freeze<BR>
spray (at fine electronics stores everywhere).  Fill the film canister<BR>
with about 1/4" of freeze spray then add punch-holes until the film<BR>
canister is at least half full, replace the lid on the canister, set<BR>
the canister on a desk or shelf and then wait for the fun.  The neat<BR>
thing is that when the canister pops it shoots paper all over the<BR>
area (sort of like a party 8-)).  Before you try this with the con-<BR>
fetti, experiment with just the freeze spray and canister, different<BR>
amounts of liquid causes it to pop at different times.<BR>
	I know one person who filled one of those blue solder extractor<BR>
bulbs half full of freeze spray, sealed the end and put it under his<BR>
bench at work, he thought it might make a pretty good pop and after<BR>
30 minutes had completely forgotten about it.  It went off about ten<BR>
minutes later and could be heard all over the building (he later told<BR>
everyone that a power supply had blown).<BR>
	Bubble pack behind the wheels of an occupied chair also causes<BR>
some fun when the unsuspecting person rolls back.
<P>
	Actually I'd rather hear mind game type jokes which are<BR>
a lot more fun.  ex:<BR>
	Bet some one they can't eat a slice of bread in less than a<BR>
minute.  Conditions are, nothing on the bread and nothing with the<BR>
bread (like water).  There are people who can win the bet, but <BR>
watching them suffer is worth loosing, and I have won more money <BR>
than I have lost.

Back when I was in high school a friend of mine, Robert, hurt his back while<BR>
rolling his car and had to wear a plaster cast around his torso, from<BR>
just under his armpits to a few inches below the navel.  When he wore<BR>
a jacket it was impossible to tell he had on a body cast.  Now, for<BR>
maximum effect you have to picture Robert.  He was a tall beanpole with<BR>
hair down to his butt (this was around 1975), a scraggly beard, John Lennon<BR>
type glasses with blue tinted lenses, and old clothes.  One day we<BR>
decide to go on a picnic at a local park.  So here we have 4 hippies<BR>
in a park surrounded by families, when Robert grabs a large butcher<BR>
knife, jumps up, yells 'GODDAMN IT I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE', and<BR>
plunges the knife into his chest.  This was followed by some very<BR>
dramatic histronics as he fell to the ground, ending up on his back<BR>
with the knife sticking up in the air.  Well, the three of us knew<BR>
the knife was really in the cast, not his chest, so we double up<BR>
laughing as these families are looking on in shock.  I'll never forget<BR>
some of the looks on those people's faces.
<P>
Good ol Ray decides to do Robert one better.  He grabs the picnic<BR>
basket, yells 'lets go!', and runs off to the van.  Naturally we<BR>
followed, leaving Robert laying on the ground with the knife sticking<BR>
up.  Boy, this really got them families into shock!  Robert realizes<BR>
he's suddenly all alone and tries to get up and run after us.  If you<BR>
want to see something funny sometime watch someone with 50 pounds<BR>
of plaster wrapped around their chest, who can't bend at the waist,<BR>
try to get up unassisted off their backs.  Then picture this person<BR>
trying to run after a van, in which his 3 buddies are driving off.<BR>
Remember, Robert still has this knife sticking out of his chest.<BR>
Boy, them families didn't know what the hell was going on.
<P>
Anyway, we went down the road 100 yards or so, just enough to scare<BR>
the crap out of Robert, and stopped to let him get in the van.  I still<BR>
wonder what some of those families thought of that episode.

  I became a somewhat involved spectator in a similar incident...<BR>
The biology teacher at my high school, Mr. Evans, was an incurable wit. He<BR>
was the one teacher everybody liked. He was the one who made sure that we<BR>
dissected Ascaris worms (long white stomach worms) the same day the lunch<BR>
room served spaghetti. One day, he fished out a four-foot preserved boa<BR>
constrictor and laid it on the floor just inside the biology lab door. Then<BR>
he put a preserved frog in its mouth. Then he stood by the door waiting for<BR>
class to start, watching students' reactions as they opened the door. I had<BR>
the misfortune to arrive right behind one of the more excitable girls.<BR>
(click.) (door opens) AAAAAAAAAAAAK!       She ran right over me!

  Mr. Evans related tales of his college days. He said one of his professors<BR>
was a real joker (by HIS standards!) who let his pet tarantula roam loose in<BR>
the room during class. You could track its progress by watching people pick<BR>
up their feet. He made some ammonium tri-iodide and painted it on the floor<BR>
before class. People walk in. BANG! POP! POW! When you pick up one foot, you<BR>
have to put the other one down. BAM!

  I always wanted to put some inside the school bell. Ding-BOOM!

Apparently there is a well-known story in the television industry about the<BR>
early days, when parts were scarce and 'friendly competition' was just be-<BR>
ginning between the networks.  There was going to be an important speech by<BR>
someone important, probably President Eisenhower or someone of that stature.<BR>
Naturally, all (both?) of the networks wanted to cover this speech.  But on<BR>
the day of the speech, the tube in NBC's camera went dead.  There was no hope<BR>
to order a replacement in time, so the NBC brass called the CBS brass to ask<BR>
if they could borrow a tube until they could get a replacement (maybe they<BR>
borrowed a whole camera, I don't know).  At any rate, the good-natured guys<BR>
at CBS said sure, they would deliver a tube to them in plenty of time for the<BR>
speech.
<P>
Well they DID loan NBC a tube, but not before setting it up in a camera and<BR>
focusing it on the brightly lit door to the men's room.  To understand what<BR>
happened, you must realize that these early "image-orthicon" tubes were ex-<BR>
tremely sensitive.  So sensitive in fact, that a bright unchanging image would<BR>
"burn-in" to the face of the tube and remain for hours, or even permanently<BR>
if the damage was severe enough.   So to make a long story even longer, when<BR>
NBC brodcasted the speech, the president appeared with "MEN" emblazoned across<BR>
his forehead.  Of course they discovered it much too late to do anything about<BR>
it (this was live TV, folks).
<P>
(This was a story I heard from someone who worked at a CBS affiliate TV station<BR>
and may or may not be true, or the networks involved may be wrong.)

A little gentler trick that a co-worker pulled up here a few years ago<BR>
depended on the sound module from one of those dolls that cries unless<BR>
you rock it back and forth. He fastened it to the bottom of someone's<BR>
chair. The someone comes and sits down, and starts working on his<BR>
terminal. As he gets into it, this vague "wa-wa" noise starts up from<BR>
some unidentifiable direction. The victim looks around (moving the chair)<BR>
and the crying stops. Oh, well, who cares. Back to work. A little later,<BR>
the crying starts up again. This one was good for several minutes.

Oh yes, someone mentioned freon bombs. Things can get hairy with those<BR>

Now for a *harmless* practical joke.  My favorite telephone gag is to<BR>
call someone at random, and with an official tone rattle off this warning<BR>
before they can interrupt:
<P>
	"This is the telephone company calling.  There is some trouble with<BR>
	your line.  Please do not answer any calls for the next five minutes<BR>
	or the person on the other end may be electrocuted.  Thank you."

Hang up, and wait about two minutes.  Call them back.  When they answer, just<BR>
scream "AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!" and hang up.

My freshman year we had a trick that went around my old dorm.<BR>
Someone would put shaving cream on a phone receiver and a<BR>
confederate would call.  The victim would then answer the<BR>
phone and sploosh the shaving cream into his ear.  Worked<BR>
90% of the time.
<P>
One kid in particular got hit hard.  Once a day for two weeks.<BR>
Even when no one suspicious was around.  It became a challenge to see<BR>
how many times he could be had.  One day he was in another part<BR>
of the dorm, where the craze to get your roommate with the<BR>
trick had just begun.  The kid came into the room of a mutual<BR>
friend totally depressed about having been had *so* many times.  He<BR>
proceeded to demonstrate to everyone in the room what would happen:<BR>
"The phone would ring and I would pick it up like this"--<BR>
he picks up the phone and -- sploosh:  gets it again!  The phone<BR>
had been set up for my friend's roommate seconds before the kid had<BR>
entered.

A friend who works at a company I will all inhel for lack of a better name,<BR>

<P>
Being in the electronics industry, TAK-PAK is very common (for you S/W types,<BR>
tak-pak is thick super glue that comes with a bottle of 'accelerator' that <BR>
makes it stick VERY fast).  It was decided to wait until Ralph was far<BR>
enough away that it would be a long run to phone, but he would make it if<BR>
he was quick.  The 'handle' was then tak-pak'ed to the little white buttons<BR>
on top of the phone.   The call was placed.  Ralph goes running down the<BR>
hall full steam ahead, leaps for the phone, and snatched it off the desk!<BR>
The hole thing.  Now, he hased to try to answer the thing only he can't.<BR>
And if he sets it down it hangs up!

Practical Joke at a party.
<P>
Take a sheet of cardboard or a throw away magazine, form a cone with it.<BR>
Take the cone, a coin, and a liquid refreshment (water causes least damage)<BR>
 in a bottle or a cup, of course you will be pretending its your drink.<BR>
Challenge the victim (bet a sum), that they can not drop the coin, placed<BR>
on their forehead, with their eyes closed, into the top of the cone shoved<BR>
into their pants at the waist within so many tries.<BR>
To prove that it is possible, demonstrate the procedure a few times, you'll<BR>
be supprised that it is possible. (practice before hand)<BR>
When the victim tries it, as soon as the eyes close, pour the liquid down<BR>
the cone.

	In view of the large number of recent postings of college practical<BR>
jokes, I'll 'fess up that some friends and I were the instigators of many a<BR>
prank while undergraduates in college.  The following are some of the better<BR>
pranks:
<P>
1.	I lived in a three-story dorm during my freshman year.  Most everyone<BR>
listened to the same radio station, which played the National Anthem at the<BR>
stroke of midnight every night.  It occured to my roommate and I that there<BR>
should be some kind of stunt that could be arranged which could use the<BR>
playing of the National Anthem as a coordinating cue.  Finally, we hit upon<BR>
the answer: at the stroke of midnight everyone in the dorm would flush their<BR>
toilet!  Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending upon your point of view),<BR>
all of their toilets were of the tank variety so that a simultaneous "flush"<BR>
would guarantee a copious discharge of water into the sewer.<BR>
	We really didn't know what would happen when The Time arrived; bets<BR>
ranged from "no event" to blowing the basement rec room toilets off the<BR>
floor.<BR>
	The Time was a Monday evening, and I figure we had about a 90%<BR>
participation rate.  The results were not disappointing: a cleanout plug<BR>
(which upon retrospection must not have been properly secured) blew out<BR>
of the floor in a basement utility room, resulting in about 1/2 inch of<BR>
water over the basement floor.<BR>
	The campus maintenance people went apeshit the next day trying<BR>
to figure out what happened; as far as I know, no one ever told them the<BR>
truth.
<P>
2.	It somehow came to our attention that most of the campus street<BR>
and walkway lighting came on _simultaneously_ each night, the actual time<BR>
being based upon the actual level of ambient light.  It was obvious that<BR>
there was a central control point with a photoelectric sensor somewhere.<BR>
	After a few exploratory tours of the campus, we came upon a likely<BR>
location: two photoelectric controls mounted on the roof of a service<BR>
building directly across from the campus electrical substation.<BR>
	After "borrowing" an extension ladder from a telephone company truck<BR>
(which was always left parked near a service building), one Friday night<BR>
about 10:00 PM (peak campus traffic time) we climbed on the roof of the<BR>
service building and taped flashlights to each of the two photoelectric<BR>
sensors.  Instant blackness!<BR>
	Actually, the most amazing part was that it took OVER ONE HOUR for<BR>
the campus maintenance people to restore the lights!  I would have thought<BR>
there to be some kind of manual override for the photoelectric cells, but<BR>
perhaps the maintenance people thought there was some kind of underground<BR>
cable fault so they didn't rashly restore power.
<P>
3.	My father managed a soap manufacturing company ever since I was a<BR>
little kid, so I grew up with some knowledge of soap formulation chemistry.<BR>
There was a civic building near the campus with a large outdoor fountain,<BR>
and it occurred to be that the water in this fountain needed "treatment"<BR>
when the fountain was turned on in the spring.  While home for spring<BR>
break, I swiped from my father's plant two gallons of a surfactant called<BR>
Triton X-100 (a tradename of Rohm & Haas).  This surfactant _really_ foams;<BR>
like a few drops will fill a bathtub with suds.<BR>
	So one night, some friends and I carefully filled some thin plastic<BR>
bags with the surfactant, and then casually threw the bags into the fountain<BR>
(the bags broke upon impact).  The next morning, the fountain was a mass of<BR>
soapsuds.  The next evening, the picture of the fountain made the front<BR>
page of the local newspaper.  The caption beneath the picture attributed<BR>
the soapsuds to college "spring fever".  Since we weren't caught, I wonder<BR>
how they knew that???
<P>
4.	The father of my dorm roommate worked as a repairman for the Otis<BR>
Elevator Company.  One weekend, I stayed with my roommate at his parent's<BR>
home.  While talking with his father, we learned an _amazing_ fact: almost<BR>
all escalators are reversible for use in breakdowns or emergencies; there<BR>
is usually a key-operated reversing switch located under the handrail at<BR>
each end of the escalator.  We also learned a second _amazing_ fact: most<BR>
all Otis elevators and escalators use the _same_ key.  While my roommate's<BR>
father went out for the evening, we swiped his work keys, and were able to<BR>
get many of them duplicated.<BR>
	As soon as we returned to campus on Sunday evening, we went in<BR>
search of an Otis Elevator (we didn't have to go far - our dorm had one).<BR>
Sure enough, we had The Key.  Over the next few days, we found that The Key<BR>
worked on every Otis Elevator that we tried on campus.<BR>
	We were now ready for en escalator (there were none on campus), and<BR>
we readily found one in a five-floor department store in the heart of the<BR>
downtown shopping district.  It was an Otis, and sure 'nuff it had a reversing<BR>
switch at each end beneath the handrail.<BR>
	We came back on Wednesday night, which was the peak shopping night<BR>
of the week.  There were two pairs of escalators - one at each end of the<BR>
store.  After nervously waiting for the right moment when no one was on<BR>
the UP escalator, and no one was looking, my roommate inserted The Key, and<BR>
turned it.  Grrr-klunk-grrr.  The UP escalator came to a halt, and reversed<BR>
direction - it was now going DOWN!   We quickly went to the other escalator<BR>
pair, and I got the honor of inserting the key.<BR>
	We now had an increasingly crowded department store with four<BR>
escalators on the main floor, all going down!  We tried to act inconspicuous<BR>
as possible (not easy with half dozen 18-19 year-olds sporadically going into<BR>
fits of hysterical laughter!) and watch the action.  People would step on the<BR>
UP escalator without looking at direction, and then step back in shock.<BR>
Then shock would change to disbelief: an UP escalator going DOWN - impossible!<BR>
People in the store were forming an oval as they traveled from the front<BR>
escalators to the rear and back, trying to figure out how to get to the<BR>
second floor.  After about ten minutes of this, with the main floor crowd<BR>
growing larger, a _very_ agitated person wearing a suit (must have been the<BR>
manager) came by with a big ring of keys, frantically trying each key in the<BR>
escalator until he found the right one to operate the key switch.  Since<BR>
the manager was eying us suspiciously, we didn't stick around to find out any<BR>
more about the situation.

   The apocryphal friend-of-a-friend brought a can of chunky<BR>
beef stew on board an airliner.  At some point he emptied the<BR>
contents into the barf bag.  Later during some minor turbulence<BR>
he pantomined using the bag in the conventional way.  When the<BR>
flight attendant asked if she could dispose of the bag for him,<BR>
he replied, "Not yet, there are some choice bits that I haven't<BR>
finished with yet," and proceded to pick out chunks from the bag<BR>
and eat them.  According to my informant, everyone nearby immediately<BR>
tossed their cookies.

	Here's another way to have Fun with Sound:
<P>
	Several years ago, a friend who manages a large retail store gave<BR>
me an electronic bird call used to add "realism" to store displays.  This<BR>
device was about 4 inches in diameter and 2 inches high, with a speaker<BR>
on the top.  It was powered by a 9-volt battery, and had two controls:<BR>
a 5-position "voice" selector, and a time delay control to set the<BR>
interval between calls (up to 60 seconds).<BR>
	For a device which used just discrete transistor circuitry, the<BR>
bird calls were amazingly realistic - especially if the time interval was<BR>
long between calls.<BR>
	I have had much fun with this gadget, especially planting it in<BR>
people's houses (basement and garages are good places).  The unsuspecting<BR>
victims really believe that there is a bird trapped in their house - and<BR>
go ape trying to find it.<BR>
	If anyone wants one of these devices, they can be purchased from<BR>
any company which sells retail store display fixtures; I don't believe they<BR>
cost much money.

Another good practical joke taken from the "Tippy Turtle" series on Saturday<BR>
Night Live is as follows:
<P>
Take one of those musical grreting cards (the type that play a song when<BR>
opened) and carefully rip out the part that actually plays the music. This<BR>
is only about the size of a quarter. When the victim isn't watching, plant<BR>
this somwhere near him/her. Since it is so small, it is relatively easy to<BR>
hide in a pocket, purse, etc. Afterwards, watch the victim become maddened<BR>
by the recurrence of Jingle Bells, Happy Birthday, etc. in the background.
<P>
I was a victim of this one, and at first I thought I was hearing the muzak<BR>
at the restaurant I was eating at. After I was done, I returned to my car<BR>
and the music followed me. I thought I was going insane.

My sister was the butt on this one.... She had a box turtle who<BR>
lived in a terrarium in her room.  I haunted pet shops and bought a<BR>
series of turtles, as identical as possible, but getting smaller and<BR>
smaller.  She was quite concerned....
<P>
After a while, I got tired of the game, so I reversed the process till<BR>
she had the original (who was bigger by now) back, and took the rest<BR>
down to the woods and let them loose.

Gather a bunch of freshmen together at a party, telling them the punch<BR>
is spiked.  Observe for about half an hour while some of them get<BR>
high on the sugar.  Then bring out a couple of bottles of Everclear<BR>
and dump them in.  People will sober suddenly, then dip in and rapidly get<BR>
silly.  Let simmer for about an hour, preferably taking pictures.<BR>
Then announce that there is still no alcohol in the punch.<BR>
Make sure that film is safe first.  Everyone goes home safe and sober.
<P>
Not very funny you say?  Well, then use real alcohol instead of sugar<BR>
water and laugh hysterically while people get sick, slip on the stairs,<BR>
wreck their cars, etc.  Great fun.

Way back when, like before electric lights were invented, I worked in<BR>
an engineering department where the general-use computer was an IBM 1130.<BR>
This was a standalone computer of roughly PDP-11/34 power with a disk,<BR>
console typewriter, slow line printer.  Its primary I/O was a combination<BR>
card reader/punch.  Some things you ought to know before proceeding futher:
<P>
1. The card reader/punch had one input hopper and two output hoppers.<BR>
Cards came from the input hopper through the read station, through the<BR>
punch station, to whichever output hopper was selected.  Cards could be<BR>
read, punched, or both as the program saw fit.
<P>
2. The CPU had a "bootstrap" mode in which it read one card as the<BR>
binary image of a program and executed that program.  The standard<BR>
"coldstart" card had enough program on it to read in the operating<BR>
system's startup block which then got the whole software system going.
<P>
3. The user community used the machine mostly for applications written<BR>
in FORTRAN and was largely ignorant of the details of computers and<BR>
how they work.
<P>
Still with me?  Good.  Naturally, _any_ card without characters printed<BR>
on it and with lots of holes all through it looked, to the uninitiated,<BR>
like the "coldstart" card that people placed at the start of their decks.<BR>
So it was a small matter to leave a few spurious cards around the computer<BR>
room and wait for the results.
<P>
My favorite was the card that just ran the deck through the reader/punch,<BR>
placing alternate cards in the other output hopper.  What a delight with<BR>
long decks!  One fellow was so sure he'd done something wrong that he<BR>
took his cards, reassembled them into the right order, and ran them through<BR>
_again_ with the same bogus coldstart card.
<P>
I never did work up the nerve to write the one that punched all the holes<BR>
in all the cards following.

All this talk about practical jokes reminds me of one I heard about in high<BR>
school.   It seems that a psychology class decided to give their new found<BR>
knowledge of the "power of suggestion" a little test.  Some of the students <BR>
had another class together and decided to play a little trick on their teacher.<BR>
Whenever the teacher was on the left side of the room, they would act really<BR>
interested and when he was on the right side of the room, they would act really<BR>
bored.  Well, it seems that this behavior did its job on the teachers sub-<BR>
conscious and he was practically crawling on the left wall by the end of class.

At my high school (many years ago) over a dozen Polymorphic 88 S-100<BR>
computers were used to teach computer lit in the math department.  Now I<BR>
was the curious type and I took to reading the supplementary documentation<BR>
to the operating system and I implemented a number of nasty suprises for<BR>
the other students.
<P>
NOTE: These changes were never to the boot tape just to the currently<BR>
running copy, so the changes dissapeared when the system was rebooted.
<P>
1. Change the prompt to some strange greek character that no-one knew<BR>
existed in the machine before.
<P>
2. Change the opening logo to something humerious and strange like Muppet<BR>
Labs Operating System V.0.1
<P>
3. Change the (Go to Monitor) command to return.  To leave monitor a<BR>
command must be entered which is terminated by return, which is no longer<BR>
available from the keyboard and results with the screen clearing and the<BR>
monitor all fresh and ready to accept a command!  Very nasty!

A simpler variation was played on me when I was but a mere first-year at U of<BR>
Toronto.  One day, I was logged in at a terminal and I left for a few minutes<BR>
to go collect output from the printer.  A friend of mine leapt into action and<BR>
changed my prompt from $ to 'Login incorrect.  Login:'.  Then he logged me off.<BR>
He told me that the daemon had logged me off because I'd been on to long.  <BR>
Needless to say, when I tried (and unbeknownst to me, succeeded) to log on, I<BR>
was told that I hadn't logged in correctly.  Well as I said, I was a first-<BR>
year and thoroughly unfamiliar with UNIX so I became very confused.  My friend<BR>
did tell me what happened, however, since we were limited to 5 hours a week.

Incidently, he's no longer my friend (oohhh hint hint hint).

Many years ago, when some neighbors moved away and their house was<BR>
vacant for a few weeks, my brother installed an extra doorbell in<BR>
the basement, and ran the wires out along the rear sidewalk,<BR>
terminating them under a flagstone tile by the alley. After the<BR>
new neighbors moved in, if he was coming home late at night (1 A.M.<BR>
or later) he'd stop by with a lantern battery and connect it up to<BR>
the wires. After about 20 seconds you'd see the upstairs bedroom<BR>
light come on. Another ten seconds later the hall light would come<BR>
on, then a few lights on the first floor. At this point he'd<BR>
disconnect the battery and go home, and not repeat it for a couple<BR>
of weeks. He continued this for a couple of years.

He had also installed a loudspeaker in the attic, running the wires<BR>
outside, but either they found that one, or the wires broke, so he<BR>
never got to use it.

This is one that a friend of a friend of mine did to his mom.
<P>
This kid was going somewhere with his mom in the car.  The kid<BR>
was in the back seat, and the mom was driving.  It was summer<BR>
time, so the kid had the window rolled down.
<P>
Anyway, the kid see's this jogger comming up the side of the road,<BR>
so he starts motioning to the jogger.  The jogger didn't really<BR>
know what was going on, but just as the car passed the jogger, the<BR>
kid reached out of the window, and whaked the side of the car rather<BR>
loudly with his hand.  The jogger, getting the idea, dove in the ditch<BR>
and acted like he was in great pain (similar to the pain he would<BR>
feel, say if he just got hit by a car).
<P>
The mother obviously notices the loud noise and see's the dieing<BR>
jogger in the ditch, slams on the breaks to see if this poor guy<BR>
is dead or not.  Naturally she is worried sick.

A friend of mine, "BUX", recounts a tale of mirth caused to by two bored <BR>
hackers on a PDP/11 running RSTS/E.  They wrote a program which wandered<BR>
around the system looking for people in the editor.  Once found they siezed<BR>
control of the terminal.  On the bottom of the screen the program wrote
<P>
"I think there's a bug in your program!"
<P>
Then a cute little character'ature of a bug ran across the screen.  Then<BR>
the screen was repainted and they relinquished control of the terminal.<BR>
Leaving the poor victim cleaning his glasses, checking his coke can, and <BR>
rubbing his eyes.  This worked best late at night.

Ok, this forces me to tell one more of my favourites.  I worked once in an<BR>

shaped like inverted J's.  Over the years (old school) some of the<BR>
J-shaped pieces of pipe had broken off.  This was during the energy<BR>
crises years, and the schools shut the classroom's heat off after<BR>
school.  In order to prevent the pipes from freezing, they were drained<BR>
nightly.  The janitor would often forget to turn the water on until 4th<BR>
period, much to the consternation of us 1st period students when we had<BR>
to use the sinks.
<P>
I waited until a day when a substitute teacher showed a film.  After<BR>
everyone else filed out of the room, I simply opened a faucet or two<BR>
that led to a broken sink.  As luck would have it, the water was turned<BR>
on during 4th period *in the middle of the film*.  To make matters<BR>
worse, the broken pipes had been used to dispose of used gum at various<BR>
times.  All this old hard gum acted much like a finger on the end of a<BR>
garden hose.  Naturally, the first thing the sub did when utter chaos<BR>
broke out in the middle of the film was to turn on the lights.<BR>
Unfortunately, one of the lights was right over one of the `geysers,'<BR>
and the lights stayed on for about two seconds before going off again.<BR>
It was several minutes before everyone figured out what had happened,<BR>
the faucet was turned off, and the janitor had turned the circuit<BR>
breaker to the room on again.
<P>
No matter how hard the sub tried, she could never get anyone to confess<BR>
to doing it.  She even kept the class after school without success.
<P>
When a friend in 4th period told me what had happened, I almost died<BR>
laughing.

 Odd that no-one mentioned the fun to be had with all the new and<BR>
wonderful phone features available now.  None of the below are truly<BR>
destructive.  Adjust gender as appropriate (women's lib be damned, I'm not<BR>
going to type his/her, s/he every time).  Switching these on/off from time<BR>
to time can drive people nuts trying to figure out what is going on.
<P>
 1)  If call forwarding is available at your company, forward the<BR>
victims calls to an "appropriate" number (Highly moral people get<BR>
dial-a-sex, bosses get dial-a-joke, boring people get time/weather,<BR>
flamboyant ones get dial-a-prayer, etc).  Victim may go days without<BR>
figuring it out.  Spouse may get interested in what's going o at office as<BR>
well.  Forwarding to a VP makes for interesting reactions as well.
<P>
	2)  Variation on above is to get an answering machine, record an<BR>
imitation of victim's with outragous comments (busy right now with X-rated<BR>
move sound track going in background, inviting all callers out on dates,<BR>
denouncing whatever private beliefs they have, etc).  Forward calls OR<BR>
splice into phone line so only happens on occasion.
<P>
	3)  If someone is silly enough to put call waiting onto a line used<BR>
for modems, call it EVERY time they use it.  Vicitm will complain to phone<BR>
compnay about "line noise".
<P>
	4)  Reprogram all their speed calling to dial-a-sex, etc numbers<BR>
(as appropriate for victim).  Love to watch the face of someone who thinks<BR>
he is calling his wife and a sexy girl comes on the line demanding a credit<BR>
card so she can "talk dirty" to him...
<P>
	5)  If victim is out of office for an extend period (week+), answer<BR>
his phone and say "Oh, Mark doesn't work here anymore.  I think that the<BR>
company caught him stealing equipment/supplies/money; using drugs; sleeping<BR>
on the job; sexually harrassing the boss; etc."
<P>
	6)  If the phone system depends on * or # pound keys, reverse them.<BR>
Most confusing.  Even better, rewire 0-9 as well!  Interchange only 2 keys<BR>
for continuing wrong numbers.
<P>
	7)  Replace answering tape messages with something "more exiting".<BR>
Effects records make good backgrounds.  Barmaids and dancers will often<BR>
help you out on this one as well.
<P>
	8)  Call victim's answering machine.  Leave what sounds to be an<BR>
important message and, 3 digits into the phone number, end the message.
<P>
	9)  If the company tracks every phone call, have everyone in the<BR>
office make long distance calls from the victims phone whenever victim<BR>
leaves the room.  You need a spotter to keep from getting caught at this<BR>
one.  900 numbers that charge 0.50 per call are good for this.
<P>
	10)  One of my favorites works best in large office buildings:<BR>
Stay late one night.  Go through the building and forward EVERY phone to<BR>
victim's line.  Be sure to do yours also to avoid being suspected.
<P>
	11)  If victim keeps phone numbers online and you have write access<BR>
to database, scramble the numbers (Be sure not to mess with medical or other<BR>
emergency numbers.  You can't play as many pranks on dead/maimed victims).
<P>
	12)  Turn off bell on victims phone.  On AT&T phones this requires<BR>
a bit of disassembly to implement but may be corrected by just adjusting<BR>
the volume (there is a stop to keep bell from going off but lifting a lever<BR>
permits the dial to rotate past the stop.  Rotate back and no-one can tell<BR>
that it was done.  This is a design feature of the phones).

This is a good one for school or business.<BR>
It's probably been used in movies and TV.<BR>
It was used at this site, to the embarassment<BR>
of one of our department heads.
<P>
While he was chairing a rather boring department<BR>
meeting, the Manager (referred heretofore as Mr. Pid)<BR>
Wanted to emphasize a point using the conference room<BR>
blackboard.
<P>
Several meetings had been recently held in the same<BR>
room, and the last had used the pull-down projector<BR>
screen, which was now covering much of the blackboard.
<P>
With chalk in hand, Mr. Pid gave the screen a little<BR>
tug, and released it, sending it straight up and out<BR>
of reach.
<P>
The entire department almost immediately broke into<BR>
uncontrollable laughter.
<P>
Mr. Pid was at first surprised, thinking the group to<BR>
be amused by the action of the screen.
<P>
When he turned around to start writing, we were told<BR>
he turned the most lovely shade of beet red, as<BR>
taped to the blackboard was a luscious and smiling<BR>
Playboy centerfold.

To this day, the identity of the perpetrator is unknown.

    Several years ago at our site I had an argument with a<BR>

    argument was that menus were the ultimate in user-<BR>
    friendliness, and that he would always prefer them.
<P>
    A few days later I heard him holler from his office.<BR>
    Seems he started up the local editor, which gave him<BR>

One of my favorites is to go into somebody's room and turn EVERYTHING upside<BR>
down.  This was done to the cook at a summer camp I worked at (she was a lousy<BR>
cook; this was revenge for hamburger in white sauce for breakfast).  We invertedeverything in the kitchen; the stove, the refrigerator (both previously<BR>
disconnected) and everything in the refrigerator; everything on the shelves and which (i.e., top, bottom, middle) shelf it was on.  Best of all, there was a <BR>
table in the middle of the room with large JARS of ketchup, mustard, etc.; the<BR>
tops of all of these were hidden and they were inverted (place waxed paper over<BR>
mouth of jar, invert, remove paper) and the table rested on top.  We also<BR>
inverted several posters on the walls.<BR>
Of course, the cook wasn't very happy about this; after she'd gotten it cleaned<BR>
up she demanded that whever did it apologize and wash dishes for a week.  If<BR>
nobody claimed responsibility, she said, she would quit.<BR>
We cheered.

On the other hand:<BR>
one day some friends of mine and I were going to 7-11.  There were several<BR>
parking spaces open along the wall of the store.  We were in two cars: a 14<BR>
year old chevy wagon and an 10 year old dodge dart.  As the first car was<BR>
about to pull in to the lot, a brand new cadillac pulled in from another<BR>
entrance and PARALELL parked accross 3 perpendicular spaces.  Needless to<BR>
say we were not amused, and quickly retaliated.  Before the driver (a man<BR>
in his 60's) could open the door, my friend and I (in the wagon) drove up and<BR>
paralell parked alongside him 6 inches from his door.  The other car pulled<BR>
up so that he couldn't pull up past us.  This left him hemmed in by brick<BR>
walls on two sides and cars on two sides.  Of course, he could have slammed<BR>
his way out, but since his car had just cost 10 times the combined values of<BR>
our cars, he didn't try it.  We left both cars parked there (with doors<BR>
locked, brakes set, etc.) while we picked up some party supplies and left him<BR>
there fuming.

    There was a computer operator at a certain college (I don't know where),<BR>
who had been fired for something (I don't know what).  He acquired one of the <BR>
ten platter disk packs that the university was using on its mainframe computer<BR>
system, and took it home.  He disassembled the pack and replaced the disk<BR>
platters with phonograph records.  He then sneaked back into the computer<BR>
center one night, placed his new pack on the shelves, and wrote a script that<BR>
would prompt the operator to mount the pack.  Later, when the new operator<BR>
came in to do his job, he saw the message to mount the pack, so he did so.<BR>
Being new, he didn't know how heavy the disk packs actually were so he didn't<BR>
suspect anything, until he powered up the drive.  The phono records literally<BR>
exploded inside the drive and sent the spindle straight through the drive door.

One time a group of friends were working on an assignment for<BR>
their artificial intelligence class. It was the first machine<BR>
problem, it was due that day, and they hadn't started it yet.<BR>
Their task was to implement an expression analyzer - nothing<BR>
fancy, just a conversational calculator.
<P>
Their teacher had said many times in class that a program exhibits<BR>
"artificial intelligence" if you cannot distinguish it's reponses<BR>
>from those of a human being. They were asking me to help them do<BR>
it the other way around. They would type in the expressions and I<BR>
would use a calculator to simulate their homework problem and<BR>
type back the answers.
<P>
The first few problems were easy ones. Their teacher remarked<BR>
that their program seemed to be one of the slowest ones (I am<BR>
not notorious for my speed with a calculator). The last expression<BR>
was some really long thing involving lots of parentheses and<BR>
somewhere along the way I made a mistake and so their "program"<BR>
got the wrong answer.
<P>
You would think the gig would be up, but, being fast on his feet,<BR>
one of my friends typed in TRY AGAIN. So, I did, and this time<BR>
typed the correct number. Not to be outdone, my other friend said<BR>
"We still have a few bugs yet. We haven't taught it about long<BR>
division."

Everyone's heard about filling the victim's room with balloons, right?<BR>
(balloons are great, especially if the victim is your SO and you come by<BR>
later, acting innocently, and suggest...well, you get the idea.)
<P>
Unfortunately, inflated balloons are bulky to carry, and it can take a<BR>
dangerously long time to inflate them in the victims room. There is a <BR>
solution. (I've actually done this, it really *does* work, even if it <BR>
sounds ridiculous) Go out and get 2 or 3 styrofoam beer coolers. Inflate<BR>
the balloons in the privacy of your own room. Fill the beer coolers<BR>
with liquid nitrogen. (at 77 K it can liquify air) Stuff all 2 thousand<BR>
or so inflated balloons into the beer coolers. (don't worry, they will fit,<BR>
liquified air occupies *very* little space) You may need a refill or 3 of<BR>
liquid nitrogen. Get a friend or 3 to help carry the coolers to the victims<BR>
room. Make sure there isn't any paper or other water-damagable stuff on <BR>
the floor. Strain out the majority of the LN2 and dump the inflated balloons<BR>
onto the floor. Close the door. (if there is a window or transom, it's<BR>
great fun to watch the balloons reinflate to fill the room)

During my freshman year at OSU, Some of the guys in my floor<BR>
"discovered" this (on about the second day 8-).  The doors in the<BR>
"Tower" dorms have a lever shaped door handle, but the pennies still<BR>
work if the person has locked their door (for instance, to sleep).  I<BR>
discovered that if you flip the flashplate for the door over, and<BR>
re-install it, then the pennies only place pressure on the door handle<BR>
latch, not the deadbolt.  You should have seen the look on Chucks face<BR>

An OSU Architecture prof (I'll call him Dr. Jones) had a habit of telling his<BR>
students to "Go take a flying leap" when they gave dumb answers. One student<BR>
decided to take the prof to task;  the class was taught in a second floor room<BR>
so the student practiced jumping out the window (with the help of an<BR>
assistant who would catch his arms as he jumped). The two got this down to <BR>
an art, and one day provoked the "flying leap" comment from Dr. Jones. The<BR>
student said, "Okay, if you say so," turned around, and leapt out the <BR>
window. His partner (who was supposed to grab him but say, "oh God, I missed<BR>

Last year I had a job teaching an officeful of secretaries to use their<BR>
IBM XT.  Well, for April Fools Day, I inserted a Pascal program at the<BR>
beginning of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (runs on startup).  The program<BR>
essentially said "Hello, Department of Defense Missile Network..." and<BR>
gave instructions which led to "Missiles Launched", and "congratulations,<BR>
 you have just launched World War III.  Say goodbye to everything you<BR>
love." I slowed down the printing to match 300 baud, so it looked quite<BR>
threatening.  After the "say good-bye message", I had it tell the user<BR>
to hit RETURN, after which the program said APRIL FOOL and went on to<BR>
the normal programs.
<P>
The results were interesting.  The people who were comfortable with the<BR>
computer loved it.  The real computerphobe registered only that this wasn't<BR>

This is a simple, harmless, and hilarious practical joke, that has claimed me<BR>
as a victim.  The setting is a pool hall, bar, or anyplace else with a pool<BR>
(billiards) table.  Place any ball at one end of the table and give your victim<BR>
the cue ball.  Challenge the victim to focus on the cue ball while walking <BR>
around the pool table three times.  At the end of the third time, the victim<BR>
is to place the cue ball on the table, take a cue stick and hit the cue ball so<BR>
that it stikes the ball at the other end of the table.  This is very difficult<BR>
to do; not because of a loss of coordination from walking and staring at the<BR>
ball, but because while the victim is concentrating on the ball, you lick your<BR>
finger and wipe chalk off the end of the cue stick.  The victim will miscue<BR>
almost every time.  It gets funnier, because if the victim is like me,  he/she<BR>
will be determined and try it again.

Speaking of fun practical jokes with a car, I have a couple of<BR>
interesting ones.
<P>
1) Give the victims car an oil change, to 70 wieght oil.  This should<BR>
work very well in places where it gets cold because when it is cold<BR>
enough, the oil should more resemble a brick the oil, and the car should<BR>
be unable to crank.  I wonder how long it would take even a good<BR>
mechanic to figure out what has been done.
<P>
2) A Classic.  Stones in the hubcaps.  If done correctly, the driver<BR>
will hear something rattling in the hupcaps and check to see if it is<BR>
the wheel nuts, finding nothing, they will continue , only to hear the<BR>
sound again.
<P>
3) When expressway driving becomes boring.  This trick is been done with<BR>
a radar detector and a very fast (looking) car.  While driving on the<BR>
expressway, look for a fast car that looks like it may not have a radar<BR>
detector.  Accelerate hard to about 70 and see if the other car follows.<BR>
If it does, bring your car up as fast as you feel safe and pretend to be<BR>
racing him.  This should get the other car's driver to start going very<BR>
fast.  Continue this "race" until you come on a turn or hill.  After<BR>
going through the turn, hit your brakes hard and bring the car to<BR>
exactly 55.00 mph.  The effect is to make every one on the road start<BR>
doing 55.00 because they assume that if you are going that fast, youmust<BR>
have a radar detector, and it must have just gone off.  (I hope I don't<BR>
need to mention the illigalities with this joke, and the need for a<BR>
radar detector.)

When my girlfriend and I were in our early teens (the age is important) we used<BR>

While in grad school, I was an "assistant" in a lab which contained two<BR>
pdp-11/23's running UNIX System 3.  Much of my education came from<BR>
jokes played on me by my more knowledgeable friends.  I'm sure I<BR>
deserved them; I was into writing multi-player games, and I got a<BR>
kick out of writing special caveats that only I knew about; these<BR>
caveats could give other players invisible handicaps.  (Don't ask me<BR>
for the games; they're very terminal dependent and I don't even<BR>
know where they are anymore.)  We once wrote a multi-player version<BR>
of Walter Bright's empire from scratch.  I added H-bombs (like fighters,<BR>
but when they hit a city it goes neutral, and when they hit a neutral<BR>
city it goes away, etc)  Only, the program was rigged so that when<BR>
a certain friend completed an H-bomb, he got this dialogue that ended<BR>
with the H-bomb developers testing the bomb in his own city!  It was<BR>
VERY funny.
<P>
[1]<BR>
The lab contained two kinds of terminals; Zenith-something-or-other for<BR>
one pdp and TVI-something-or-other for the other.  The console for each<BR>
pdp was some other type (e.g., vt100 or somesuch).  I normally logged<BR>
in on a Zenith in a particular spot.  One day my first attempt to login<BR>
failed and my second succeeded. I thought nothing of it, and continued.<BR>
Later, I happened to be on the console when I did a ps and noticed a<BR>
program running in the background belonging to one of my friends, B.<BR>
Although it was not uncommon for real work to be done this way (and the<BR>
program had an innocent sounding name), I poked around in B's directory<BR>
to see if I could figure out what it was doing (I was root; what a feeling<BR>
of power!).  An ls revealed a very strange directory name; under that<BR>
directory lived some interesting looking programs and files.
<P>
It turned out that B had written one of those password-catching programs,<BR>
and had run it on my favorite terminal, apparently hoping that I'd login<BR>
as root there.  The directory name was an escape sequence that caused<BR>
an "up-cursor, carriage-return", so an ls on a Zenith would overwrite<BR>
the funny directory name with the next file/directory.  I had done the<BR>
ls on the console (different escape sequences) by pure luck.
<P>
I figured out the file in which B was writing the login name and password,<BR>
and replaced my login and password (yes, his program worked!) with:<BR>
"B is a bad boy".  Eventually he came in.  I casually asked him about<BR>
the background process, and he had a simple explanation ready.  I then<BR>
left him to the "Zenith" room, and went to the adjoining "console" room<BR>
and waited.  His reaction was quite rewarding.
<P>
[2]<BR>
B waited almost a year to try again, and this time he was nasty.  I was<BR>
working on a huge program, a dbms, for my Master's thesis.  I was having<BR>
some trouble debugging, and looking at the prospect of spending yet<BR>
another semester finishing it.  During a particularly frustrating session,<BR>
another friend stopped in to mention that B had done something to my<BR>
..profile; I thanked him and checked it out.
<P>
It was a very subtle change; I don't remember how I happened to notice it.<BR>
My PATH was set with /usr/bin in front of /bin (default on our system was<BR>
/bin in front of /usr/bin).  I looked at /usr/bin, and found an executable<BR>
cc, owned by B.  Further exploration revealed that B had written new<BR>
read() and write() primitives; his cc arranged that the resulting a.out<BR>
would get the bogus primitives.  These primitives read or wrote garbage<BR>
about 1/6 of the time.  Can you imagine debugging a dbms with this handicap?
<P>
So, how to get back at him?  I figured the first step was to pretend I<BR>
hadn't discovered his little trick, so I modified my makefile to run<BR>
/bin/cc directly.  After a day or so, B stopped in to ask how I was doing,<BR>
and I told him everything was going well.  He happened to notice my /bin/cc<BR>
lines, and asked why I did that.  I told him I had some simple shell<BR>
scripts named "cc" scattered about, and didn't want to accidentally pick<BR>
one up (this was before aliases).  He swallowed it.
<P>
The next day, /usr/bin had an executable make to go with the cc.  B's make<BR>
made a backup copy of the makefile, changed all the /bin/cc's to /usr/bin/cc's,<BR>
and ran the real make; when the make finished, it moved the original makefile<BR>
back.  I was amazed at the trouble he had gone to -- and got a good lesson<BR>
in shell programming as well!

all of these people were speaking a foreign language that she<BR>
didn't understand.  She was bound, gagged and blindfolded.  Then<BR>
while everyone drove to the resturant, she was driven around in<BR>
a car with three people speaking a foreign language.  BTW-she <BR>
new something was up and wasn't scared, because she knew something<BR>
was up. <BR>
Anyway, they bring her into this very nice resturant. We're all<BR>
waiting at the table, about 15 of us, and we proceed to start<BR>
dinner.  Her food was in front of her, but she was still bound<BR>
gagged, and blindfolded. After a few moments we untied her, she was<BR>
really embarrassed, because everyone in the place was staring at<BR>
our table, which was in the middle of the room.<BR>
She vowed revenge.
<P>
                       Joke 2<BR>
She wanted revenge. So I came up with the idea of getting a baby picture<BR>
of my friend, her boyfriend, from his mother, and printing up posters<BR>
of it and putting it up all over campus.  Out side of his classes, labs,   <BR>
and work.  His mother gave me the most adorable picture of him when he<BR>
was a baby with his teddy bear.  His features hadn't changed that much <BR>
and the way the picture was set up he looked as though he was in a <BR>
police line up.  So we made it into a "Most Wanted" poster, with a <BR>
concise discription, and his name across the top in 40 point type. I <BR>
printed up about 150 posters which we put up all over campus.  The next<BR>
day every where he looked and turned there was a poster, even in some<BR>
of the men's rooms around campus.  It took him weeks to find all of<BR>
the posters.
<P>
                       Joke 3
<P>
If you are wondering what all of this is building up to.  Here is the<BR>
ultimate joke that was pulled.  After several more *practical* jokes<BR>
which I was the ring leader on.  My friends realized that at the hub<BR>
of each of the jokes I was the organizer and brains behind the <BR>
opperation.  So it was my turn.
<P>
I really liked this one upper division Economics class that I was taking<BR>
that quarter.  I was the VP of one of the Econ clubs on campus and everyone<BR>
knew who I was including the professor.  Well, one Friday afternoon while<BR>
this class was meeting.  One of those warm afternoons where everyone in<BR>
the class is dozing, including the professor.  All of a sudden three <BR>
people enter the class in surgical grab, masks, protective gloves, boots,<BR>
green suits, the works and a wheelchair.(I learned later that they had<BR>
*borrowed* all of these items from the medical school.) Anyway, the looked<BR>
like the real thing.  They went up to the professor and told him that they<BR>
were looking for me because I had contracted a infectious disease, and <BR>
needed to be removed from class immediately. They handed him a very official<BR>
looking document and started for me with the wheel chair.  You could have<BR>
seen the people around me move, them my *friends* wheeled me across the<BR>
length of the campus screaming "out of the way infectious person." 
<P>
When I went back to class the next week, the professor looked at me oddly<BR>
and asked if I was OK to be out.  He really believed the whole thing.

Needed - Small wad of brillo pad.
<P>
   When friend is out sneek into his room. Take his lightbulb out (power<BR>
off!). Stick brillo into socket. Leave. When friend switches on light<BR>
the brillo acts like a fuse and blows up(small flash and quite loud noise).<BR>
Be careful with this one, it has been known to knacker the odd light switch.
<P>
*********
<P>
Needed - Cayenne Pepper.<BR>
     Electric Cooker.
<P>
   This is a very good one. Sprinkle a good dose of the pepper on the<BR>
ring element. Turn the ring on and leave the room, shuting the door behind<BR>
you with your friends in the kitchen not looking at the cooker (this is easy<BR>
if you have a joint kitchen living room, wait till they are watching TV).<BR>
This will result in the pepper burning into the air and your frends eyes <BR>
streaming and throats burning.
<P>

<P>
In our student hall we had those cheapo carpet tiles.  When a friend<BR>
went away for a long weekend, his `drinking pals' broke in, flooded<BR>
his carpet and spread about a sack full of cress seeds. One hour<BR>
before he returned they `borrowed' a sheep (fromm agric. or vet. -- I<BR>
can't remember) and put it in his room to grazed.  The they then set<BR>
up0 a camera to take a picture of the surrounding scene 3 seconds<BR>
after the door was opened.  You've never seen such a funny expression.
<P>

 <BR>
[This is childish, but harmless] Leave a fake phone message pink slip to call<BR>
a number. Give them the zoo's number, and ask for "Elli Fant" or "G. Raffe"<BR>
etc... make sure it is a department in the zoo who won't answer "DC National<BR>
Zoo" or something. BTW, the zoo gets tons of these calls every April 1st.<BR>

My cousin told me about a practical joke some of his friends played<BR>
where they had a white horse on the hill within view of their halls of<BR>
residence (this is one of those large white horses done in chalk on<BR>
hillsides - there are several in England) - they "painted" it with black<BR>
stripes one night so the next day it was a Zebra.  <BR>
( I think they actually used black plastic bags)

Years ago when I still lived (and went on my bike to work) in Bucharest,<BR>
Romania, I was often sprayed with mud by car and bus drivers who felt a<BR>
sadic pleasure by doing this. I used to note the license plates of the<BR>
culprits and in four instances I spotted those cars parked on streets<BR>
not too far from my home. I provided to their owners several mornings<BR>
of hard work to remove newspapers stuck on their windshields with a very<BR>
good glue. In one instance I filled the exhaust pipe with wet cement...<BR>
In all cases I left a note with "thanks for the shower".
<P>
*********
<P>
The best practical joke that we pulled was pulled on my friend's floor's<BR>
busybody.  I showed up at his dorm, went into his room, and proceeded to<BR>
yell at him (my friend).  He yessled back, and we got into a heated<BR>
arguement.  Eventually, I fired a few blanks, which this busybody was<BR>
sure to hear.<BR>
I then ran from the room, and when the busybody went to look, he saw my<BR>
friend lying in a pool of blood (we used fake stuff).  When he went to<BR>
call security, my friend quickly changed his clothes and put a rug over<BR>
the "blood" on the floor.<BR>
When the cops and the campus rent-a-cops arrived, my friend was sitting<BR>
quietly, studying.<BR>
It was suggested to the busybody that he take a nice long break from<BR>
college to let his nerves recover.
<P>

<P>
We were very proud of the following practical joke.  When we<BR>
were juniors at Williams, I lived in Agard House with three friends<BR>
of mine.  Several large and loud boors who lived there as well were<BR>
always taking over the TV when we were watching it (to the point<BR>
of them physically throwing one of us out of the TV room when he<BR>
was in there watching something they didn't want to watch ... that<BR>
is, something that wasn't a sporting event).  They would sometimes <BR>
call important house meetings without telling us, and so on.  <BR>
Suffice it to say, we didn't get along with them.<BR>
	Anyway, we got them back in the following way.  The <BR>
remote control in the TV room was usually ignored, because it was <BR>
always getting lost.  So a couple of weeks before the Super Bowl,<BR>
we purloined it.  We bought some supplies and set it up so that<BR>
an infrared (?) emitting diode was behind a curtain in the back of<BR>
the room, connected via wiring outside the house (which we strung)<BR>
to the lounge next door, where we sat with the remote control.  We<BR>
listened to the game on a radio, and every time something dramatic<BR>
would happen...<BR>
	"He's at the twenty!  The fifteen!  The ten!  The ..."<BR>
ZAP!  Masterpiece Theater!<BR>
	They would all immediately charge down to the cable hookup<BR>
in the basement, but no-one was there.  They'd look in the lounge<BR>
and there we were, studying quietly.  Ah, it was great.  (The<BR>
remote control was discreetly hidden by a window-drape.)<BR>
When they told us about this mysterious phenomenon, we said,<BR>
"You know, the same thing was happening to us the other day.  <BR>
Hmm, I wonder what could be wrong."<BR>
	They were sure we had done it, but couldn't prove it.  <BR>
They kept trying to goad us into revealing it, for example: <BR>
"No, they couldn't've done it; they're not smart enough".  We kept <BR>
our mouths shut and just grinned.  
<P>

<P>
My undergraduate advisor told me that when he was an undergrad at MIT,<BR>
he and his floormates performed this trick on a particularly obnoxious<BR>
guy who lived there.  The guy would regularly go down to the power<BR>
box and kill everyone's power, just for jollies.  Well, they papered<BR>
his room one day, and when he opened the door, he calmly lit a match,<BR>
threw it in, and left.  The building did not burn down but the student<BR>
was ejected.  He had been failing out anyway.
<P>
*********
<P>
This reminds me of another newspaper prank, which I heard of from an<BR>
old friend who attended the U. of Rochester in NY.  A guy who lived<BR>
on their floor had the Wall Street Journal delivered to his door<BR>
every day, and the others on the floor decided to poke fun at this<BR>
upscale practice by sealing off his door (from the outside) with <BR>
sheets of the Journal.  Every morning, the guy would open his door,<BR>
see the doorway blocked by the sheets, and leap through.  This <BR>
became a morning ritual.  One day, somebody got the bright idea to<BR>
put a Coke machine on the other side of the papers, and the guy<BR>
got a concussion when he tried to go through.  
<P>
*********
<P>
Something similar happened to me. The phone rings at 3:30am the night before<BR>
my calculus exam, the following conversation takes place:<BR>
Hello<BR>
Let me speak to Cindy<BR>
Who?<BR>
I said put Cindy on the phone<BR>
Sorry but you have the wrong number<BR>
Look ass*ole, put Cindy on the phone NOW<BR>
There is no Cindy here, what number are you trying to reach?<BR>
You f*cking b*stard, I know where you live, now let me talk to her.<BR>
Ok, Ok (long pause) can she call you back, she's in the shower with my roomate.<BR>
   CLICK.
<P>
*********
<P>
This can be taken to the extreme.  Once at Carleton U.  an entire floor <BR>
received a "leaner" as we call it.  There are three elevators, and late at<BR>
night another held all three elevators, placed trash cans filled with water<BR>
and leaning outward in each.  Then they pressed 4 and slipped out.  The result:<BR>
a big mess on the 4th floor.  Unfortunately the water also went pouring down<BR>
the elevators and caused some damage.  Housing was not amused.
<P>
*********
<P>
1) Take your Video camera (take someone elses if you don't have one)<BR>
2) Enter your toilet room <BR>
3) From the other side of the room to the toilet, stand on a chair and video<BR>
   a shot from near the ceiling of your toilet seat (about 5 mins should do)<BR>
4) Have a party !!<BR>
5) When someone leaves the room to visit the lav. put the cassette in your<BR>
   vid player.<BR>
6) Just before the person re-enters the room start playing the tape - with <BR>
   everyone in the room laughing at the TV screen.<BR>
7) WATCH THE FACE OF THE PERSON RE-ENTERING THE ROOM !!    :-)
<P>
*********
<P>
A practical joke I was witness to at Lancaster involved moving the entire <BR>
contents of some-one room. The peron concerned was taken out for the night by<BR>
his 'mates', who duly got him very drunk. A few of his other mates moved the<BR>
entire contents of his room from the top floor of the residential block to<BR>
an identical room on the ground floor. At the end of the night, all the merry <BR>
souls came back from the bar, carrying their, now ,very drunk friend. An<BR>
arguement broke out, and the friends grabbed hold of the drunkard, opened the<BR>
window and threw him out of the window. Imagine his alarm, he thought he was<BR>
three floors up!

                     What The Professor Really Means
<P>
                         By J. Timothy Petersik<BR>
                 from the Chronicle of Higher Education
<P>
You'll be using one of the         I used it as a grad student.<BR>
leading textbooks in the field.
<P>
If you follow these few simple     If you don't need any sleep, <BR>
rules, you'll do fine in the        you'll do fine in the course.<BR>
course.
<P>
The gist of what the author is     I don't understand the details<BR>
saying is what's most important.    either.
<P>
Various authorities agree that...  My hunch is that...
<P>
The answer to your question is     I don't know.<BR>
beyond the scope of this class.
<P>
You'll have to see me during my    I don't know.<BR>
office hours for a thorough answer <BR>
to your question.
<P>
In answer to your question, you    I really don't know.<BR>
must recognize that there are <BR>
several disparate points of view.
<P>
Today we are going to discuss      Today we are going to discuss my<BR>
a most important topic.            dissertation.
<P>
Unfortunately, we haven't the      I disagree with what roughly half<BR>
time toconsider all of the people  of the people in this field have<BR>
who made contributions to this     said.<BR>
field.
<P>
We can continue this discussion   1. I'm tired of this - let's quit.<BR>
outside of class.                 2.  You're winning the argument -<BR>
                                  let's quit
<P>
Today we'll let a member of the   I stayed out to late last night and<BR>
class lead the discussion.  It    didn't have time to prepare a<BR>
will be a good educational        lecture<BR>
experience.
<P>
Any questions?                    I'm ready to let you go.
<P>
The implications of this study    I don't know what it means either,<BR>
are clear.                        but there'll be a question about it<BR>
                                  on the test.
<P>
The test will be 50-questions     The test will be 60-questions<BR>
multiple choice.                  multiple guess, plus three short-<BR>
                                  answer questions (1000 words or
<P>
                                  more) and no one will score
<P>
                                  above 55%.
<P>
The test scores were generally    Some of you managed a C+.<BR>
good.
<P>
The test scores were a little     Where was the party last night?<BR>
below my expectations.
<P>
Some of you could have done       Everyone flunked.<BR>
better.
<P>
Before we begin the lecture for   Has anyone opened the book yet?<BR>
today, are there any questions<BR>
about previous material?
<P>
According to my sources...        According to the guy who taught this<BR>
                                  class last year...
<P>
It's been very rewarding to       I hope they find someone else to<BR>
teach this class.                 teach it next year.

Bobby Knight told me this: 'There is nothing that a good defense <BR>
cannot beat a better offense.'  In other words a good offense wins.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle comparing the <BR>
                   offensive capabilities of the Warsaw Pact<BR>
                   with the defensive system of NATO
<P>
Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable peace, a better<BR>
prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the first place<BR>
to have a reduction of offensive systems and an introduction to<BR>
defensive capability.  I believe that is the route this country<BR>
will eventually go.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
Republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and child.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
Mars is essentially in the same orbit... somewhat the same distance from the<BR>
Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are canals,<BR>
we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. If<BR>
oxygen, that means we can breathe.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific.  It is IN<BR>
the Pacific.  It is a part of the United States that is an island that <BR>
is right here.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle,<BR>
		   Hawaii, September 1989
<P>
What a terrible thing to have lost one's mind.  Or not to have a mind<BR>
at all.  How true that is.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle winning friends while<BR>
                   speaking to the United Negro College Fund
<P>
You all look like happy campers to me.  Happy campers you are, happy<BR>
campers you have been, and, as far as I am concerned, happy campers you<BR>
will always be.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle, to the American Samoans,<BR>
                   whose capital Quayle pronounces "Pogo Pogo"
<P>
Quayle stumbled in response to a question about his opinion of the<BR>
Holocaust. He said it was "an obscene period in our nation's history."<BR>
Then, trying to clarify his remark, Quayle said he meant "this century's<BR>
history" and added a confusing comment.  "We all lived in this century,<BR>
I didn't live in this century," he said.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
We expect them [Salvadoran officials] to work toward the elimination<BR>
of human rights.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
El Salvador is a democracy so it's not surprising that there are many voices<BR>
to be heard here. Yet in my conversations with Salvadorans... I have heard a<BR>
single voice.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and<BR>
democracy - but that could change.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
One word sums up probably the responsibility of any vice president,<BR>
and that one word is 'to be prepared'.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
If we do not succeed, then we run the risk of failure.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle, to the Phoenix Republican<BR>
		   Forum, March 1990
<P>
It's rural America.  It's where I came from.  We always refer to ourselves<BR>
as real America.  Rural America, real America, real, real, America.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
Target prices?  How that works?  I know quite a bit about farm policy.<BR>
I come from Indiana, which is a farm state.  Deficiency payments -<BR>
which are the key - that is what gets money into the farmer's hands.<BR>
We got loan, uh, rates, we got target, uh, prices, uh, I have worked<BR>
very closely with my senior colleague, (Indiana Sen.) Richard Lugar,<BR>
making sure that the farmers of Indiana are taken care of.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle on being asked to<BR>
                   define the term "target prices."<BR>
                   Quayle's press secretary then cut short the press <BR>
                   conference, after two minutes and 30 seconds.
<P>
Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable peace, a better<BR>
prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the first place<BR>
to have a reduction of offensive systems and an introduction to <BR>
defensive capability.  I believe that is the route this country<BR>
will eventually go.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
I not going to focus on what I have done in the past<BR>
what I stand for, what I articulate to the American people.<BR>
The American people will judge me on what I am saying and what I <BR>
have done in the last 12 years in the Congress.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
I want to be Robin to Bush's Batman.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
We should develop anti-satellite weapons because we could not have prevailed<BR>
without them in 'Red Storm Rising'.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
The US has a vital interest in that area of the country.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle Referring to Latin America.
<P>
Japan is an important ally of ours. Japan and the United States of <BR>
the Western industrialized capacity, 60 percent of the GNP,<BR>
two countries. That's a statement in and of itself.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
Who would have predicted... that Dubcek, who brought the tanks in in<BR>
Czechoslovakia in 1968 is now being proclaimed a hero in Czechoslovakia.<BR>
Unbelievable. <BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle<BR>
                   Actually, Dubcek was the leader of the Prague Spring.
<P>
May our nation continue to be the beakon of hope to the world.<BR>
                -- The Quayle's 1989 Christmas card. <BR>
                   [Not a beacon of literacy, though.]
<P>
Well, it looks as if the top part fell on the bottom part.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle referring to <BR>
                   the collapsed section of the 880 freeway after<BR>
                   the San Francisco earthquake of 1989.<BR>
                   [this may be a joke; the source is unclear.<BR>
                      but it's still funny]
<P>
getting [cruise missles] more accurate so that we can have precise precision.<BR>
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle referring to his legislative<BR>
                   work dealing with cruise missles
<P>
I can identify with steelworkers. I can identify with workers that <BR>

                   would do if he assumed the Presidency,1988
<P>
Lookit, I've done it their way this far and now it's my turn. I'm<BR>

	Don't forget about the importance of the family. It begins with<BR>
the family. We're not going to redefine the family. Everybody knows the<BR>
definition of the family. [Meaningful pause] A child. [Meaningful pause] A<BR>
mother. [Meaningful pause] A father. There are other arrangements of the<BR>
family, but that is a family and family values.<BR>
	I've been very blessed with wonderful parents and a wonderful<BR>
family, and I am proud of my family. Anybody turns to their family. I have<BR>
a very good family. I'm very fortunate to have a very good family. I<BR>
believe very strongly in the family. It's one of the things we have in<BR>
our platform, is to talk about it.<BR>
	I suppose three important things certainly come to my mind that we<BR>
want to say thank you. The first would be our family. Your family, my<BR>
family -- which is composed of an immediate family of a wife and three<BR>
children, a larger family with grandparents and aunts and uncles. We all<BR>
have our family, whichever that may be ... The very beginnings of<BR>
civilization, the very beginnings of this country, goes back to the family.<BR>
And time and time again, I'm often reminded, especially in this<BR>
Presidential campaign, of the importance of a family, and what a family<BR>
means to this country. And so when you pay thanks I suppose the first thing<BR>
that would come to mind would be to thank the Lord for the family.<BR>

Dan Quayle was in South America and was presented with an empty box<BR>
that was to contain a gift from a sailing team.  He was told<BR>
that the gift was not ready yet, and that it would be presented<BR>
to him when they arrived in the United States. <BR>
Qauyle said: "Ok, I won't open it until then."
<P>
During the White House Easter Egg Roll of 1991, Quayle signed autographs<BR>
using only his finger. He had prepared pre-signed cards which his aides<BR>
handed out while he made signing gestures. This allowed him<BR>
to move briskly and efficiently through the crowd, said his spokesman.
<P>
Dan Quale, in April 1991, was concerned that his advisors<BR>
may be getting out of touch with "Real Americans." In order<BR>
to combat this, he suggested that they read People magazine.

of little things that you could get for Christmas. And all the people that<BR>

George Bush."<BR>

Bobby Knight told me this: 'There is nothing that a good defense<BR>

        -- Vice President Dan Quayle comparing the<BR>
                   offensive capabilities of the Warsaw Pact<BR>
                   with the defensive system of NATO
<P>
Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable peace, a better<BR>
prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the first place<BR>
to have a reduction of offensive systems and an introduction to<BR>
defensive capability. I believe that is the route this country<BR>
will eventually go.<BR>

will always be.<BR>

                   whose capital Quayle pronounces "Pogo Pogo"

Quayle stumbled in response to a question about his opinion of the<BR>
Holocaust. He said it was "an obscene period in our nation's history."<BR>

I didn't live in this century," he said.<BR>
        -- Vice President Dan Quayle

        -- Vice President Dan Quayle
<P>
Target prices?       How that works?  I know quite a bit about farm policy.<BR>
I come from Indiana, which is a farm state. Deficiency payments -<BR>
which are the key - that is what gets money into the farmer's hands.<BR>
We got loan, uh, rates, we got target, uh, prices, uh, I have worked<BR>
very closely with my senior colleague, (Indiana Sen.) Richard Lugar,<BR>
making sure that the farmers of Indiana are taken care of.<BR>

overpressure threshhold of physiological damage for exposed<BR>
personnel."  In other words, if a 300,000-pound booster rocket falls<BR>
on someone, he or she is not likely to survive.

	A reader reports that the Army calls them "vertically deployed<BR>

How do you get out of a log cabin with no doors or windows? Only a mirror and <BR>

Answer:<BR>
You look in the mirror and see what you saw. Take the saw and cut the table in <BR>
half. Take the two halves and make a whole. Climb out the hole.

Proof that Horses have an infinite number of legs:<BR>
(1) Horses have an even number of legs.<BR>
(2) They have two legs in back and fore legs in front.<BR>
(3) This makes a total of six legs, which certainly is an odd number of<BR>
    legs for a horse.<BR>
(4) But the only number that is both odd and even is infinity. <BR>
(5) Therefore, horses must have an infinite number of legs.

(8) Pedestrians are<BR>
	(a) irrelevant.<BR>
	(b) communists.<BR>
	(c) a nuisance.<BR>

<P>
The correct answer is (a).  Pedestrians are not in cars, so they are<BR>
totally irrelevant to driving; you should ignore them completely.

	><BR>
	><BR>
	>This paper has been sent to you for good luck. The original<BR>
	>has been worn out from having passed through the hands<BR>
	>of so many people. It had travelled around the world 70<BR>
	>times [Dear Reader: please help keep this count current. If<BR>
	>this letter falls into your hands after just completing one<BR>
	>more circuit of the world, please add one to the count.] The<BR>
	>luck has now been sent to you.<BR>
	><BR>
	><BR>
	>You will experience great sex within four days of receiving<BR>
	>this letter, provided you send it on. Since the copy must<BR>
	><BR>
	>tour the world, you must make ten copies and send them<BR>
	>to others. This is no joke. Send no money. Send copies to<BR>
	>people who need to get laid within 96 hours.<BR>
	><BR>
	><BR>
	>After he passed this letter on, a Montana Spinach Control<BR>
	>Officer got his penis stuck in a cow-milking machine and<BR>
	>had the longest series of orgasms of his life. John Elliot<BR>
	>tried to pick up a prostitute, but, because he broke the<BR>
	>chain, was picked up by the police instead. When they<BR>
	>searched his home, they found magazines of little boys<BR>
	>which they showed to his neighbors. In a suburb of Paris,<BR>
	>Don Loray's trousers were ripped by an unsatisfied<BR>
	>erection, 51 days after failing to circulate the letter.<BR>
	>However, before this happened, a condom machine gave<BR>
	>him three condoms for the price of one. (was this the<BR>
	>consolation prize?)<BR>
	>Do note the following: Hebert Pudstrom received the chain<BR>
	>in 1953. He asked his secretary to make ten copies and<BR>
	>send them out. A few days later he encountered her in a<BR>
	>red-light district making more than he had ever paid her at<BR>
	>work. General George Patton, who sent the letter on, saw<BR>
	>what he thought was a quarter in the street. When he bent<BR>
	>down to pick it up, a beautiful woman in a miniskirt walked<BR>
	>by, and he got a great view. Heywood Daddit, an<BR>
	>unemployed chicken choker, received the letter and forgot<BR>
	>that it had to leave his hands within 96 hours. His wife<BR>
	>then went bowling with his best friend and never returned.<BR>
	>Later, after finding the letter again, he mailed ten copies. A<BR>
	>few days later he got a wife and discovered that his old<BR>
	>wife, who he thought was wonderful, had made love to<BR>
	>him like a dead salmon for all these years! Alan Fairchild<BR>
	>received the letter and, not believing, threw the letter<BR>
	>away. Nine days later he spilled hot coffee in his crotch.<BR>
	>In 1987 the letter received by a young woman in Texas<BR>
	>was faded and barely readable, so she did not realize that<BR>
	>this paragraph applied to her. She promised herself she<BR>
	>would retype the letter and send it on, but she put it aside<BR>
	>to do later. She was plagued with problems including<BR>
	>herpes and other venereal diseases she contracted in her<BR>
	>futile attempts to find Mr. Right in a singles bar. The letter<BR>
	>did not leave her hands in 96 hours. She finally typed the<BR>
	>letter and found a man with a 10-inch penis.<BR>
	>Beware   however of the fate of the E-mail user at Trent<BR>
	>University, Peterborough  ON, that sent this letter to<BR>
	>himself over five thousand times in one afternoon. Before<BR>
	>leaving the computer lab a strange woman came up behind<BR>
	>him, bit his ear and put her hand down his pants. The<BR>
	>ensuing surprise caused him to stumble forward and cry<BR>
	>out. As he attempted to arrest his fall by grabbing a nearby<BR>
	>PC, a gob of spittle that had been flung from his mouth (as<BR>
	>he cried out) landed deep into the inner recesses of the<BR>
	>computer, all three (student, strange woman and computer)<BR>
	>then experienced simultaneous Cyber-Orgasms of<BR>
	>exponential intensity before exploding in a puff of smoking<BR>
	>data.<BR>
	>You must distribute at least ten copies within 96 hours of<BR>
	>receiving this letter. Those who do will find their love lives<BR>
	>more fulfilling. Those who do not will be doomed to<BR>
	>one-night stands with mechanical devices.<BR>

        There were three Medieval kingdoms on the shores of a lake.<BR>
There was an island in the middle of the lake, which the kingdoms had<BR>
been fighting over for years.  Finally, the three kings decided that<BR>
they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would<BR>
take the island.<BR>
          The night before the battle, the knights and their<BR>
squires pitched camp and redied themselves for the fight.  The first<BR>
kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had 5 squires, all of whom were<BR>
busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food.  The second<BR>
kingdom had 20 knights, and each knight had 10 squires.  Everyone at<BR>
that camp was also busy preparing for battle.  At the camp of the third<BR>
kingdom, there was only one knight, with his one squire.  This squire<BR>
took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree.  He<BR>
busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own<BR>
armor.  When the hour of battle came, the three kingdoms sent their<BR>
squires out to fight ( this was too trivial a matter for the knights to<BR>
join in ).  The battle raged, and when the dust cleared, the only person<BR>
left was the lone squire from the third kingdom, having defeated the<BR>
squires from the other kingdoms.
<P>
I guess this just proves that the squire of the high pot and noose is<BR>
equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

                        How To Stay Stressed
<P>
                          ---------------
<P>
 Although the De Anza Health Office long been an advocate of stress<BR>
 management, stress, tension, and burnout are still common complaints of<BR>
 students, faculty, and staff alike.  On account of this, we have come to<BR>
 the following conclusion: YOU ALL WANT TO STAY STRESSED!  The following<BR>
 provides you with a few reasons why.
<P>
 STRESS HELPS YOU SEEM IMPORTANT.     Anyone as stressed as you must be<BR>
                                      working very hard and, therefore,<BR>
                                      is  probably doing something very<BR>
                                      crucial.
<P>
 IT HELPS YOU TO MAINTAIN PERSONAL    Anyone as busy as you are certainly<BR>
 DISTANCE AND AVOID INTIMACY.         can't be expected to form emotional<BR>
                                      attachments to anyone.  And let's<BR>
                                      face it, you're not much fun to be<BR>
                                      around anyway.
<P>
 IT HELPS YOU AVOID RESPONSIBILITIES. Obviously you're too stressed to be<BR>
                                      given any more work.  This gets you<BR>
                                      off the hook for all the mundane<BR>
                                      chores; let someone else take care<BR>
                                      of them.
<P>
 IT GIVES YOU A CHEMICAL RUSH.        Stress might be considered a cheap<BR>
                                      thrill, and you can give yourself a<BR>
                                      "hit" anytime you choose.  But be<BR>
                                      careful, you might get addicted to<BR>
                                      your own adrenaline.
<P>
 IT HELPS YOU AVOID SUCCESS.          Why risk being "successful" when by<BR>
                                      simply staying stressed you can<BR>
                                      avoid all of that?  Stress can keep<BR>
                                      your performance level low enough<BR>
                                      that success won't ever be a threat.
<P>
 STRESS ALSO LETS YOU KEEP YOUR       The authoritarian style of "Just do<BR>
 AUTHORITARIAN MANAGEMENT STYLE.      what I say!" is generally permissi-<BR>
                                      ble under crisis conditions.  If<BR>
                                      you maintain a permanently stressed<BR>
                                      crisis atmosphere, you can justify<BR>
                                      an authoritarian style all the time.
<P>
<BR>
 Are you worried now about how to stay stressed?  You'll have no trouble<BR>
 if you practice the following clinically proven methods:
<P>
 NEVER EXERCISE.                      Exercise wastes a lot of time that<BR>
                                      could be spent worrying.
<P>
 EAT ANYTHING YOU WANT.               Hey, if cigarette smoke can't<BR>
                                      cleanse your system, a balanced<BR>
                                      diet isn't likely to.
<P>
 GAIN WEIGHT.                         Work hard at staying at least 25<BR>
                                      pounds over your recommended<BR>
                                      weight.
<P>
 TAKE PLENTY OF STIMULANTS.           The old standards of caffeine,<BR>
                                      nicotine, sugar, and cola will<BR>
                                      continue to do the job just fine.
<P>
 AVOID "WOO-WOO" PRACTICES.           Ignore the evidence suggesting<BR>
                                      that meditation, yoga, deep<BR>
                                      breathing, and/or mental imaging<BR>
                                      help to reduce stress.  The<BR>
                                      Protestant work ethic is good for<BR>
                                      everyone, Protestant or not.
<P>
 GET RID OF YOUR SOCIAL               Let the few friends who are<BR>
 SUPPORT SYSTEM.                      willing to tolerate you know that<BR>
                                      concern yourself with friendships<BR>
                                      only if you have time, and you<BR>
                                      never have time.  If a few people<BR>
                                      persist in trying to be your<BR>
                                      friend, avoid them.
<P>
 PERSONALIZE ALL CRITICISM.           Anyone who criticizes any aspect<BR>
                                      of your work, family, dog, house,<BR>
                                      or car is mounting a personal<BR>
                                      attack.  Don't take time to<BR>
                                      listen, be offended, then return<BR>
                                      the attack!
<P>
 THROW OUT YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.       Staying stressed is no laughing<BR>
                                      matter, and it shouldn't be<BR>
                                      treated as one.
<P>

                                      second always produces a marvelous<BR>

This was posted earlier in the week in some other groups, but due to a<BR>
forged cancellation by Eric "follow-ups in real time" Olson, it didn't<BR>
get much propagation.  Anyhow, here's hoping it will see some light this<BR>
time.  If you enjoy it, let me know.  If you enjoy it, send flames to<BR>
ejo@ims.alaska.edu for cancelling it on the first go-around.  Also be<BR>
sure to send me any additions or corrections.  Hold on to this, Top Ten<BR>
Silly Newsgroups poll coming up very soon!  (Hopefully, if this doesn't<BR>
get cancelled real quick again).  Anyhow, here goes:

<TITLE>suicide</TITLE>

<BODY>
From: Gerry Harbison (gerry@wendigo.unl.edu)<P>
>                    1994's MOST BIZARRE SUICIDE<BR>
><BR>
>At the 1994 annual awards dinner given by the American Association for<BR>
>Forensic Science, AAFS President Don Harper Mills astounded his audience<BR>
>in San Diego with the legal complications of a bizarre death.  Here is<BR>
>the story.<BR>
><BR>
>"On 23 March 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus<BR>
>and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head.  The<BR>
>decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to<BR>
>commit suicide (he left a note indicating his despondency).  As he fell<BR>
>past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through<BR>
>a window, which killed him instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the<BR>
>decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the eighth floor<BR>
>level to protect some window washers and that Opus would not have been<BR>
>able to complete his suicide anyway because of this."<BR>
><BR>
>"Ordinarily," Dr.  Mills continued, "a person who sets out to commit<BR>
>suicide ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what<BR>
>he intended.  That Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories<BR>
>below probably would not have changed his mode of death from suicide to<BR>
>homicide. But the fact that his suicidal intent would not have been<BR>
>successful caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on<BR>
>his hands.  "The room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast<BR>
>emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife.  They were arguing<BR>
>and he was threatening her with the shotgun.  He was so upset that, when<BR>
>he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife and the pellets went<BR>
>through the a window striking Opus.<BR>
><BR>
>"When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt,<BR>
>one is guilty of the murder of subject B.  When confronted with this<BR>
>charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant that neither knew that<BR>
>the shotgun was loaded.  The old man said it was his long-standing habit<BR>
>to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He had no intention to<BR>
>murder her - therefore, the killing of Opus appeared to be an accident. <BR>
>That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.<BR>
><BR>
>"The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old<BR>
>couple's son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the<BR>
>fatal incident.<BR>
><BR>
>It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support<BR>
>and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun<BR>
>threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would<BR>
>shoot his mother.  The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the<BR>
>son for the death of Ronald Opus.<BR>
><BR>
>There was an exquisite twist.  "Further investigation revealed that the<BR>
>son [Ronald Opus] had become increasingly despondent over the failure of<BR>
>his attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off<BR>
>the ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast<BR>
>through a ninth story window.<BR>
><BR>
>"The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide."

<TITLE>toasters</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
From: Ric Dargusch (dargusch@dma.isg.mot.com)<P>

If IBM made toasters...<BR>
  They would want one big toaster where people bring bread to be submitted for<BR>
  overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six<BR>
  toasters.
<P>
If Microsoft made toasters...<BR>
  Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You<BR>
  wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it<BR>
  anyway. Toaster'95 would weigh 15000 pounds (hence requiring a reinforced<BR>
  steel countertop), draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up<BR>
  95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that<BR>
  let's you control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would<BR>
  secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them.<BR>
  Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy them since<BR>
  most of the good bread only works with their toasters.
<P>
If Apple made toasters...<BR>
  It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but 5 years earlier.
<P>
If Fisher Price made toasters...<BR>
  "Baby's First Toaster" would have a hand-crank that you turn to toast the<BR>
  bread that pops up like a Jack-in-the-box.
<P>
If The Rand Corporation made toasters...<BR>
  It would be a large, perfectly smooth and seamless black cube. Every morning<BR>
  there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would<BR>
  have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be<BR>
  highly classified government documents. The X-Files would have an episode<BR>
  about it.
<P>
If the NSA made toasters...<BR>
  Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in<BR>
  case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security.
<P>
Does DEC still make toasters?...<BR>
  They made good toasters in the '70s, didn't they?
<P>
If Hewlett-Packard made toasters...<BR>
  They would market the Reverse Polish Toaster, which takes in toast and gives<BR>
  you regular bread.
<P>
If Sony made toasters...<BR>
  Their Personal Toasting Device, which would be barely larger than the single<BR>
  piece of bread it is meant to toast, can be conveniently attached to your<BR>
  belt.
<P>
If Cray made toasters...<BR>
  They would cost $16 million but would be faster than any other single-slice<BR>
  toaster in the world.
<P>
If Thinking Machines made toasters...<BR>
  You would be able to toast 64,000 thousand pieces of bread at the same time.
<P>
If Timex made toasters...<BR>
  They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a<BR>
  licking and keep on toasting.
<P>
If Radio Shack made toasters...<BR>
  The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know anything about it. Or you<BR>
  could buy all the parts to build your own toaster.
<P>
If K-Tel sold toasters...  <BR>
  They would not be available in stores, and you would get a free set of Ginsu<BR>
  knives.

A Call for More Scientific Truth in Product Warning Labels
<P>
by Susan Hewitt and Edward Subitzky
<P>
   As scientists and concerned citizens, we applaud the recent trend<BR>
towards legislation that requires the prominent placing of warnings<BR>
on products that present hazards to the general public. Yet we must<BR>
also offer the cautionary thought that such warnings, however well-<BR>
intentioned, merely scratch the surface of what is really necessary<BR>
in this important area. This is especially true in light of the<BR>
findings of 20th century physics.
<P>
   We are therefore proposing that, as responsible scientists, we<BR>
join together in an intensive push for new laws that will mandate<BR>
the conspicuous placement of suitably informative warnings on the<BR>
packaging of every product offered for sale in the United States of<BR>
America. Our suggested list of warnings appears below.
<P>
WARNING: This Product Warps Space and Time in Its Vicinity.
<P>
WARNING: This Product Attracts Every Other Piece of Matter in the<BR>
Universe, Including the Products of Other Manufacturers, with a<BR>
Force Proportional to the Product of the Masses and Inversely<BR>
Proportional to the Distance Between Them.
<P>
CAUTION: The Mass of This Product Contains the Energy Equivalent<BR>
of 85 Million Tons of TNT per Net Ounce of Weight.
<P>
HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE: This Product Contains Minute Electrically<BR>
Charged Particles Moving at Velocities in Excess of Five Hundred<BR>
Million Miles Per Hour.
<P>
CONSUMER NOTICE: Because of the "Uncertainty Principle," It Is<BR>
Impossible for the Consumer to Find Out at the Same Time Both<BR>
Precisely Where This Product Is and How Fast It Is Moving.
<P>
ADVISORY: There is an Extremely Small but Nonzero Chance That,<BR>
Through a Process Know as "Tunneling," This Product May Spon-<BR>
taneously Disappear from Its Present Location and Reappear at<BR>
Any Random Place in the Universe, Including Your Neighbor's<BR>
Domicile. The Manufacturer Will Not Be Responsible for Any <BR>
Damages or Inconvenience That May Result.
<P>
READ THIS BEFORE OPENING PACKAGE: According to Certain Suggested<BR>
Versions of the Grand Unified Theory, the Primary Particles<BR>
Constituting this Product May Decay to Nothingness Within<BR>
the Next Four Hundred Million Years.
<P>
THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: In the Unlikely Event That This<BR>
Merchandise Should Contact Antimatter in Any Form, a Catastrophic<BR>
Explosion Will Result.
<P>
PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any Use of This Product, in<BR>
Any Manner Whatsoever, Will Increase the Amount of Disorder in<BR>
the Universe. Although No Liability Is Implied Herein, the<BR>
Consumer Is Warned That This Process Will Ultimately Lead to<BR>
the Heat Death of the Universe.
<P>
NOTE: The Most Fundamental Particles in This Product Are Held<BR>
Together by a "Gluing" Force About Which Little is Currently Known<BR>
and Whose Adhesive Power Can Therefore Not Be Permanently Guaranteed.
<P>
ATTENTION: Despite Any Other Listing of Product Contents Found <BR>
Hereon, the Consumer is Advised That, in Actuality, This Product<BR>
Consists Of 99.9999999999% Empty Space.
<P>
NEW GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: The Manufacturer May<BR>
Technically Be Entitled to Claim That This Product Is Ten-<BR>
Dimensional. However, the Consumer Is Reminded That This<BR>
Confers No Legal Rights Above and Beyond Those Applicable<BR>
to Three-Dimensional Objects, Since the Seven New Dimensions<BR>
Are "Rolled Up" into Such a Small "Area" That They Cannot<BR>
Be Detected.
<P>
PLEASE NOTE: Some Quantum Physics Theories Suggest That When<BR>
the Consumer Is Not Directly Observing This Product, It May<BR>
Cease to Exist or Will Exist Only in a Vague and Undetermined<BR>
State.
<P>
COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The Subatomic Particles (Electrons,<BR>
Protons, etc.) Comprising This Product Are Exactly the Same in<BR>
Every Measurable Respect as Those Used in the Products of Other<BR>
Manufacturers, and No Claim to the Contrary May Legitimately Be<BR>
Expressed or Implied.
<P>
HEALTH WARNING: Care Should Be Taken When Lifting This Product,<BR>
Since Its Mass, and Thus Its Weight, Is Dependent on Its<BR>
Velocity Relative to the User.
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PURCHASERS: The Entire Physical Universe,<BR>
Including This Product, May One Day Collapse Back into an <BR>
Infinitesimally Small Space. Should Another Universe Subsequently<BR>
Re-emerge, the Existence of This Product in That Universe Cannot<BR>
Be Guaranteed.

<A NAME="preface">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Preface</H2>
<BR>
The proponents of legalization can be divided into two main categories:

<OL>
<LI> The Liberal-Legalizers.  They want to see drugs legalized, while
the government heavily regulates their distribution and sale.  The
government would levy taxes on the drugs, and the tax proceeds would
go towards funding publicly-run rehabilitation clinics and other
social services.</LI>

<LI> The Anarcho-Legalizers.  They want to see all government activity
in the realm of drugs ceased immediately, not even goverment
regulations.  They believe drugs should be left entirely up to the
free market.</LI>
</OL>

Their main goal is the same: the legalization of drugs.  The only
difference is the details.  I will refer to these categories in the
following refutations.

<HR>
<A NAME="cl01">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #1</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #1: Legalization Will Decrease Drug Use.</I>
<BR>
This is a seemingly non-sensical claim: that by making drugs legal,
<I>less</I> people would be inclined to use them.  Yet it is a claim
frequently made by legalizers.
<P>
And here's what the legalizers themselves would claim would happen in
a legalization climate:
<UL>
<LI> Drug prices would fall.</LI>
<LI> Drug distribution would become safe and accessible to the average person.</LI>
<LI> Recreational drug use would become socially normalized.</LI>
</UL>
And yet they claim recreational drug use would decrease!
<P>
The legalizers point to many sources to justify their claim:
<OL>
<LI> The Dutch example.
(See <A HREF="anti-legalization.html#cl11">Claim #11</A>.)</LI>

<LI> People are not deterred by drug laws, and those who would
ordinarily use drugs do so anyway. 
(See <A HREF="anti-legalization.html#cl05">Claim #5</A>.)
Actually this argument is not used to show that drug use will
<I>decrease</I>, but rather that it would not increase.</LI>

<LI> The question oft-asked by legalizers, "If drugs were legalized
tomorrow, would you rush out and shoot up with heroin?"  I believe the
answer for most people would be "no", but I'm sure everybody knows
people who are rather uninhibited in their personalities.  They are
willing to try new things, yet they have much to lose by committing a
felony and risking getting caught.  Furthermore, minors who are
heavily influenced by peer pressure would be more likely to try drugs
should they be legalized.  Already when it comes to the glamorized
legal drugs of alcohol and tobacco, a vast majority of minors admit to
using these drugs.  Why should we expect things to be any different if
crack pushers were allowed access to the mass media?  Will we see
Chester the Crackhead next to Joe Camel and the Three Budweiser Frogs?</LI>
</UL>
<HR>
<A NAME="cl02">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #2</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #2: Legalization Will Lower The Price of Drugs,
Thereby Decreasing the Black Market.</I>
<BR>
The validity of this claim depends on the type of legalizer that
you're arguing with.
<P>
If you're arguing against an Anarcho-Legalizer, then this claim is
definitely true: the Anarcho-Legalizer wants only minimal (if any!)
regulations on drug sales, thereby reducing the price dramatically.
It would certainly eliminate the black market, but it would have other
negative consequences (see below).
<P>
However, if you're arguing against a Liberal-Legalizer, this claim may
not be wholly true.  Liberal-Legalizers want a heavy governmental role
in the distribution of drugs, along with high taxes to offset for the
negative consequences of drug use.  Typically they would want this tax
money to go towards publicly-funded rehabilitation efforts and
increased enforcement of the drug regulations.
<P>
Now here's the catch.  The taxes can't be too high, otherwise the
black marketeers would still be present avoiding the onerous taxes.
Witness the lucrative cigarette-smuggling trade occurring in Canada,
due to the exorbitantly high taxes the Canadian government places on
cigarettes.  And the taxes can't be too low, otherwise these public
programs will be underfunded.  The examples from legal drugs tend to
show that the taxes would be too low.  Consider that taxes on alcohol
can be as much as 45% of the price, yet these taxes only offset the
costs of alcohol-related expenses by an estimated 18%.
(<A HREF="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/legaliz/claim7.htm">Reference</A>)
<P>
In any case, we must consider what the total effect that lower drug
prices will have.  Undoubtedly it will make drugs more accessible for
all segments of society, since the economic barriers will be reduced.
This includes minors, who frequently have little problem today
obtaining legal drugs.
<P>
So this claim tends to be true, however it is not universally true,
and it would bring other negative consequences in our society which
should be avoided.  Should we merely trade one problem for another?
<HR>
<A NAME="cl03"><P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #3</H2>
<I>Legalization Claim #3: Legalization Will Drastically Decrease Crime.</I>
<BR>
This claim involves a linguistic sleight-of-hand.  Of course crime
would decrease, because drug possession would be redefined as legal!
<P>
But even if the claim is made with respect to other types of crime, it
is not at all clear that overall crime would decrease.
<P>
Crime associated with the drug trade, other than the purely
definitional aspect illustrated above, can be divided into four
categories:
<OL>
<LI><I>Psychopharmacological.</I>  This type refers to the tendency of drug
users to perform acts of crime because of the drug's influence on the
body, e.g., aggravated assault and murder.  It can be seen in usage of
crack cocaine.  This dimension of crime would not decrease under
legalization, since it is dependent on the drug itself.  Instead, if
drug use were to increase, which is likely, this type of crime would
be likely to increase as well.</LI>

<LI><I>Economic-compulsive.</I> This type refers to crimes committed
by drug users in the pursuit of obtaining drugs -- e.g., burglaries
and robberies.  Legalizers claim that drug prices will fall (see <A
HREF="anti-legalization.html#cl02">Claim #2</A>), thereby obviating the
need for drug users to steal to support their habit.  However, the
real reason drug users need to steal to support their habit is because
they are poor.  If the price of heroin were reduced to $1/dose, then
the penniless heroin addict would still need to steal that $1 to get
his fix.  Legalization does not address the economic conditions of the
class of people most affected by the drug scourge, and therefore we
cannot expect this type of crime to decrease very much (if at all).
Legalizers will sometimes counter this claim with the claim that
people don't rob and steal to buy alcohol, but this is patently false.
People do break into liquor stores to steal alcohol.  </LI>

<LI><I>Systemic.</I> This type refers to the crime associated with the
distribution of drugs itself, e.g., drug turf wars.  This category
basically represents the black market portion of crime.  It isn't at
all certain whether this type of crime will decrease, for two reasons:
<UL>
<LI> Can we genuinely expect that those associated with the highly
lucrative drug trade would so willingly give up their association with
it?  We might expect that a drug syndicate would attempt to control
drug distribution in a given geographical area and initiate violence
against those who fail to comply with their terms, much like the very
legal service of garbage removal is handled in New York City.
(<A HREF="http://www.alternatives.com/crime/ENV6.HTML">Reference</A>)</LI>

<LI>Many of those who enter the drug trade do so because it is the most
viable economic decision for them.  They have a choice between being
unemployed, getting a minimum-wage job, or doing some highly lucrative
yet illegal activity.  Can we expect those who currently choose
illegal career opportunities over legal ones, to suddenly choose a
legal career in a post-legalization world?  It seems much more likely
that those who have little to lose by doing something illegal would go
right on ahead and continue to do other illegal things.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

<LI><I>Corruptive.</I>  This type refers to the influence that vast
quantities of drug profits have on politicians.  The drug trade has
almost thoroughly corrupted the governments of Colombia and Bolivia,
and threaten to do so elsewhere as well.  But consider the fact that
up until very recently, tobacco companies were able to use the US
Trade Office to push their products in foreign markets.  Is this
corruption?  Not the overt kind, but certainly corruption nonetheless.
If drugs were legalized, can we expect the Opium Wars redux?<BR>

The real corruptive influence in politics is money, and wherever there
is money, it will find its way into politicians' pockets.  In a
post-legalization world we can expect drug profits to be transferred
from the average street thug, who knows little if anything about
politics, to the giant corporations who are virtual experts when it
comes to buying politicians.  Furthermore, Liberal-Legalizers argue
that there would be numerous regulations concerning the sale and
distribution of drugs.  How long would it be until drug profits found
its way into a change of these regulations?
</LI>
</OL>
Thus we can conclude that legalization will have, at best, a mixed
effect on crime.  Hardly the panacea of calm and tranquility claimed
by the legalizers.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #4</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #4: Recreational Drug Use is a Fact of Life,
and Legalization Merely Acknowledges This Fact.</I>
<BR>
There are many things which were considered "facts of life" which have
changed for the better.  At one time, African-Americans were
considered to be "inferior" to whites.  (Even Thomas Jefferson
believed this.)  Slowly we have changed our attitudes towards race,
and the society of today is far superior to the society of 100 years
ago when it comes to race relations.  It is possible to change human
nature for the better, and we should strive to do so.

<A NAME="cl05">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #5</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #5: People Are Not Deterred by Drug Laws, and
Legalization Merely Acknowledges This Fact.</I>
<BR>
There are considerable risks associted with the drug
trade; the drug laws are only one component of this
risk.  Below are ten specific risks:
<OL>
<LI> Injury and/or death due to drug overdose</LI>
<LI> Injury and/or death due to the drugs themselves</LI>
<LI> Injury and/or death due to drug impurities</LI>
<LI> Injury and/or death due to the location of drug distributors
(e.g., lower-class neighborhoods rife with crime)</LI>
<LI> The potential for drug addiction and its associated costs</LI>
<LI> Being caught in violation of the law</LI>
<LI> Being caught in a random drug test and fired from your job</LI>
<LI> Acquiring a record of drug use and its associated negative
consequences (e.g., becoming less employable)</LI>
<LI> Being fired due to mere suspicion of drug use</LI>
<LI> Suffering shame and public humiliation from exposure of
your drug problem</LI>
</OL>
Legalization of drugs would only <I>directly</I> address one of these
risks (#6).  Risk #3 would certainly decrease because professionals
would be making drugs instead of black marketeers.  Risk #4 would
probably decrease as drug distribution points became more ubiquitous.
Risk #9 would decrease because drug use would no longer be a crime and
the individual fired would have legal standing to sue to recover his
job.  Risks #8 and #10 would likely decrease as drug use became more
socially acceptable.  So we see that the illegality of drugs poses
several barriers to the casual drug user, both directly and
indirectly, which serve as a deterrent to drug use.  If drugs were
legalized, many of these deterrents would vanish.
<HR>
<A NAME="cl06">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #6</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #6: Legalization Will Bring About a Substitution
Effect For the Better.</I>
<BR>
The idea behind this claim is that if drugs were legalized, people who
do drugs today would naturally choose the less dangerous drugs over
the more dangerous drugs, thereby leading to an overall reduction of
harm.  But the problem is, a) drug use would likely increase among
those who currently don't do drugs today, and b) it's trading one
poison for another.  Is it preferable to be shot by a pistol or a
machine gun?  Which is more preferable, death by hanging or death by
lethal injection?  <I>Neither</I> is preferable, and both should be
opposed.
<P>
Furthermore, the data from the Netherlands, which has a decriminalized
marijuana policy, seems to belie this hypothesis -- alcohol use rates
among highschool students are comparable to US rates.

<A NAME="cl07">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #7</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #7: Legalization Will Bring About a Restoration of
Liberty.</I>
<BR>
The fact of the matter is, when it comes to ingesting foreign
substances, we already have the freedom to ingest well over 99.999% of
all substances out there.  When taken from a maximization point of
view, this is extremely good!  Legalizers want the freedom to ingest
the remaining <<0.001% of substances, and then claim that since they
are denied this freedom, we are living in a "police state".  Such as
with the fanatic RKBA (Right to Keep and Bear Arms) proponents, who
claim that the RKBA is so absolute that they should have the freedom
to purchase nuclear weapons and anti-aircraft missiles, and then when
realizing that this freedom is denied to them, that the government is
tyrannizing them.  I think it's rather obvious to most people that
this is an incredibly extremist viewpoint.  If the legalizers are
genuinely concerned about individual liberties, then their time is
much better spent arguing in fields where government action is a much
more credible threat, such as in the case of the CDA, or
anti-terrorism measures.
<P>
Furthermore, many of the assaults on individual liberty are done in
the <I>name</I> of the War on Drugs.  What is to stop politicians from
assaulting individual liberties in the name of something else?  Such
an argument is not one against the War on Drugs, but rather against
the politicians who come up with the excuses.
<HR>
<A NAME="cl08">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #8</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #8: The Government Should Not Enforce Morality, and
Thus Drugs Should Be Legalized.</I>
<BR>

This argument is designed to get you to equate laws against drugs with
laws which regulate behavior such as sex, since both are examples of
the government enforcing moral views via legislation.  But let's look
at the claim that the legalizers are making.  Legalizers believe the
government should not enforce moral views.  This belief cannot be
proven in any objective way, it must be taken as a fundamental tenet
-- a moral belief, if you will!  Legalizers are not really against
enforcing <I>morality</I> per se, they just don't want the government
to enforce a specific moral belief.  They'd much rather see the
government enforce their <I>moral belief</I> that government shouldn't
enforce <I>any</I> moral beliefs -- which is nonsensical.  The
government <I>cannot</I> enforce no moral beliefs because telling the
government to do so is an expression of a moral belief!
<P>
So legalizers here have simply pointed out that they want the
government to enforce their moral beliefs above all others, just like
everybody else.
<HR>
<A NAME="cl09">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #9</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #9: Legalization Will Make Drugs Harder to Obtain
For Minors.</I>
<BR>
If this claim comes from an Anarcho-Legalizer, then this claim can't
be further from the truth.  No regulations on drug distribution means
no barriers for kids wishing to purchase drugs.
<P>
If this claim comes from a Liberal-Legalizer, then this claim might
seem to have some validity.  But evidence from legal drugs in this
nation shows that it doesn't.  Consider that in the latest Michigan
survey, well over 90% of 10th graders said they have no difficulties
obtaining cigarettes.  And over 75% of highschool students said they
have used alcohol in the past year.
(<A HREF="http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/drug_stats/statistics/mtfmenu.html">Reference</A>)
Now Liberal-Legalizers will claim that all that is needed is increased
enforcement of the sale-to-minors regulations in order for this
problem to decrease.  But law enforcement officers are already free to
do so with currently legal drugs -- how can we expect them to do a
better job with more drugs to regulate when this is the terrible
example they set with only two drugs?
<P>
And even if you don't consider <I>sales</I> of drugs to minors, kids
will still have an easier time <I>obtaining</I> drugs, from friends or
relatives -- maybe even their own parents!  (Ever hear of swiping
bottles out of the liquor cabinet?)  Not to mention fake ID's, having
older siblings purchase drugs for them, etc., etc...  Kids are quite
ingenious when it comes to finding ways for circumventing the law.  It
seems clear that the way to convince kids not to do drugs is to
educate them properly, not to open up the floodgates and reduce the
barriers of access to kids.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #10</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #10: Legalization Will Decrease Drug-Induced Health
Care Expenses.</I>
<BR>
Legalizers will claim that the biggest health care expense associated
with drugs is the illegality of the drugs themselves, and if drugs
were legalized the health care expenses would plummet.  This claim is
not entirely true.  For starters, some drugs have some inherently
dangerous side effects.  With increased drug use, this area of health
care can only increase.  Furthermore, while drug impurities would be
reduced, drug overdoses would not.  Even with the legal drug of
alcohol, where everything is clearly labeled, there are an estimated
4,000 deaths per year due to alcohol poisoning among highschool and
college students, according to SADD.
(<A HREF="http://www.studorg.nwu.edu/daily/issues/15apr96/alcohol.html">Reference</A>)

<HR>
<A NAME="cl11">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #11</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #11: The Example of Holland Shows Legalization Works.</I>
<BR>
The example of Holland consists basically of separating the drug
market into "soft" drugs (e.g., marijuana) and "hard" drugs (e.g.,
heroin).  The Dutch have taken a look-the-other-way approach for soft
drug users while continuing to make hard drugs illegal.
<P>
However the Dutch model has some serious problems.  Holland suffers
from foreign relation problems; it seems that drug distributors from
across Europe (and the US!) flock to the Netherlands to purchase their
drugs and redistribute them in their native countries.  This of course
makes it harder for the native countries to do their jobs stopping the
flow of drugs into their nations.  Furthermore, organized crime has
not diminished in Holland; rather, it has multiplied, associated
mostly with the hard drug trade.
(<A HREF="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r104:E02MR5-142:">Reference</A>)
The Dutch government has responded by increasing penalties for foreign
visitors purchasing drugs, lowering the limit on marijuana purchased
at one time from a "coffee shop", and closing down some of the coffee
shops.
(<A HREF="http://www.calyx.net/~schaffer/other/neth1.html">Reference</A>)
One has to wonder why, if their policy is such an overwhelming
success, they are having so many problems with it still.
<P>
Legalizers claim that the way to solve the problems in the Dutch model
are to legalize drugs universally (thereby "solving" the drug problem
everywhere as well), and to legalize all drugs, not just soft ones
(thereby "solving" the organized crime problem).  Have you seen this
trick before?  I'm sure you have.  Suppose you have a headache, and I
offer to "solve" your problem by hitting you over the head with a
baseball bat for 10 minutes.  After I'm done, I ask you how your
headache is, and you say "well it hasn't gone away yet".  So would the
solution be to continue hitting you over the head with a baseball bat?
I don't think so.  The lessons of Holland point to the fact that a
different solution is needed.
<P>
The fact of the matter is, the Dutch simply do not have the same type
of society that Americans do.  Americans have a much stronger
anti-drug ethos than the Dutch.  The Dutch changed their laws to
comply with the social attitudes of their nation; if drugs were
legalized in the US, it would have exactly the opposite effect,
forcing change on the American social attitudes via the government.
As mentioned in <A HREF="anti-legalizatin.html#cl12">Claim #12</A>,
85% of Americans oppose legalization.
<P>
Legalizers will sometimes point to the examples in Zurich and England
as models which the US should emulate.  Zurich dedicated a park to
which they distributed clean needles and drugs to anyone, no questions
asked.  England also distributed clean needles.  However both programs
were terminated; if they were the models of success that legalizers
claim, why were they ended?
<HR>
<A NAME="cl12">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #12</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #12: Polls Show Increasing Support for Legalization.</I>
<BR>
Such a statement is ironic coming from legalizers, who often take
positions based on principle alone while ignoring public opinion.
Nevertheless, although it may seem like the anti-legalizers are in the
extreme minority on the Internet, according to a 1995 Gallup poll, 85%
of Americans oppose legalization.
(<A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/empower/ps-12125.html">Reference</A>)
<P>
And a 1990 Gallup poll showed that if legalization were to occur, a
majority of Americans believed that drug use among minors, drug abuse,
drug overdoses, and drug-related crime would all increase.
(<A HREF="http://www.calyx.net/~schaffer/GOVPUBS/fax1994.html">Reference</A>)
<P>
Some legalizers will retort that most people truly are in favor of
legalization, but have been brainwashed by the government propaganda
machine into believing all sorts of heinous lies about drugs.  If
these legalizers think it is possible for any propaganda machine to
brainwash the <I>vast</I> majority of the American people, along with
the <I>vast</I> majority of industrialized democracies in then world,
then you might as well ask them about the black helicopters they see
at night.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Claim #13</H2><P>
<I>Legalization Claim #13: All Major Studies Show Legalization Is The
Proper Solution.</I>
<BR>
This statement is made time and time again by the legalizers, and it
is false time and again.  What the studies show is that a non-criminal
approach should be taken towards drug use and abuse.  The legalizers
then take these studies as a justification for their pro-legalization
views.  But legalization is not a necessary prerequisite for meeting
the concerns of these studies.  By spending more on rehabilitation
clinics for chronic drug abusers, for example, we will begin to meet
these concerns.  We don't have to legalize drugs to do it.

<I>Legalization Claim #14: Implementation of Legalization is Immaterial to
the Debate.  What's Important is the Principle that Legalization is
the Right Thing to Do.</I>
<BR>
This is the legalizer's standard trick: to get you to agree that it
should be acceptable in principle for a heroin user to shoot up
legally, and then worry about the details later.  If this general
approach were valid, then we should be a socialist nation by now,
since the principles of socialism are far superior to those of
capitalism.  After all, wouldn't it be better if nobody were left to
starve, and if everybody had adequate shelter?  Then I wonder why the
number of socialist nations in the world is continually shrinking?
<P>
History has shown, though, that the devil is in the details.  If you
agree that it should be legal for heroin user to shoot up legally,
then you MUST also worry about the possibility that the user is a
minor; that the user is driving a car or operating heavy machinery
under the influence; that the user is a hopeless addict living off of
public assistance; that the user is poor and must rob and steal to
support his habit.  The details are important, and they should not be
discarded as irrelevant.

<A NAME="summary">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Summary</H2><P>
Essentially, the main goal of the pro-legalization crowd is to
liberalize American attitudes towards drugs.  They see no real
difference between simple drug use as a legitimate form of recreation,
and, say, playing sports.  They openly admit that the real purpose of
the medical marijuana and needle exchange program debates are to
gradually acclimate the American public towards tolerance of drug
usage.  They do not recognize society's mores as applicable to them,
and furthermore, seek to destroy society's capability of having values
worth enforcing.  It is a totally hedonistic point of view that
legalizers seek to impose onto our society.  As such it should be
resisted by all who believe that traditional values still have a place
in our society.
<P>
Yes, the War on Drugs has some serious problems.  Few people doubt
this.  But it is not necessary to legalize drugs in order to solve
these problems.  We can take common sense actions which do not resort
to legitimizing recreational drug use.  For starters:
<P>
<A NAME="actplan">
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Action Plan</H2>
<UL>
<LI> We should end international drug displacement programs, which serve
only to undermine otherwise stable governments.  Studies show that
focusing on demand reduction instead of supply reduction is a much
more worthwhile effort.  Instead we should concentrate our resources
on domestic programs.</LI>

<LI> We should treat drug addiction as a medical problem rather than a
social problem; drug addicts should be given medical attention in
rehabilitation clinics and should be exempt from criminal prosecution
as long as they stay drug-free.</LI>

<LI> We should treat responsible drug use of "soft" drugs as a minor
offense, say, analogous to speeding.  While it is wrong, it should not
carry the same penalty reserved for crimes like murder and rape.  Hard
drug use should still be punishable by jail time and/or
rehabilitation, and irresponsible use should also be prosecuted.</LI>

<LI> We should end mandatory minimum sentences, to give judges the
necessary discretion to handle special cases.</LI>

<LI> We should increase the penalties for drug distributors and pushers,
especially on those who push drugs on our nation's youth.</LI>

<LI> We should end asset forfeiture as a means for enriching local law
enforcement agencies.  Greed should never be a motivation for
enforcing the law, and it only serves to weaken the Bill of Rights
needlessly.</LI>

<LI> <I>Most Importantly:</I> We should concentrate more resources on
anti-drug education for our youth, so they won't get the desire to do
drugs in the first place.  Only when it is firmly engrained in
students' heads that drug use is not something they want to do, then
we will be able to declare victory.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
I believe that by enacting these simple changes, we can reform the War
on Drugs into a policy which can bring more positive results.

In the most recent Presidential election (1996), Libertarian candidate
Harry Browne received a whopping 0.60% of the vote.  Yet it is true
that Browne would consistently win, or at least come in a strong
second on, Internet polls.  It defies all common sense to think that
the preponderance of Libertarian thought on the 'net comes from such a
tiny minority in America, but apparently that is the case.  It
should give hope, though, to the other 99.4% of voters that the Libertarian
agenda is not going to be enacted anytime soon.

<hr>
<font color=#ff1493 size=+1>NOTE: I am not acquainted with any member of 
Black Happy.  I cannot and will not deliver messages from you to the band 
(your best bet of doing that is to write to them care of Capricorn 
Records).  I've been asked this several times recently, and want to clear 
up any confusion.  I don't know the band, they don't know me.</font>
<hr><p>This page is designed to be a repository of information
about the Couer d'Alene, Idaho band Black Happy, who broke up in
February of 1995.  Four former Black Happy members went on to form
Shoveljerk.  I haven't been updating this page much recently, admittedly, 
but wanted to point out that I am maintaining a Shoveljerk page, 
accessible at <a href="../shoveljerk/index.html">http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis/shoveljerk</a> 
and I am trying to keep up to date.</p>
<hr><p>For information about Black Happy, here are some 
resources to consult:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="bhappyfaq.html">FAQ</a> - this is a so-called Frequently 
Asked Questions file for Black Happy.  It is primarily a history, but if 
you have any questions, feel free to ask me, and I'll see about adding 
them to this list.  (there is a mailto: link at the bottom of this page 
to facilitate this)
<li><a href="solong.html"><u><b>So Long, Farewell:</b></a> Looking back at 
the illustrious career of Couer d'Alene's <i><b>Black 
Happy</b></i></u><br>This article was written by Dan Cossette for the 
free Spokane newspaper <u>The Inlander</u> and is here reprinted without 
permission.  It's basically a capsule summary of the history of the band 
up until the final week of the band, as they prepared for their final shows
in Spokane and then Seattle the following day.
<li>The <a href="gooff.html">Go Off!</a> 7" - I found this item here in 
Spokane, and it included a lyric sheet for the songs on it.  I don't 
pretend that this is completely accurate - a cleaned up version is 
included in the lyric sheet for <u>The Last Polka</u>.
<li><a href="bhfdslyr.html"><u>Friendly Dog Salad</u></a>: The 
approximate lyrics to the album.  These lyrics were not reprinted inside 
the CD booklet, and the mailing available from the band with the lyrics 
had numerous errors.  This is an attempt to correct the mailing, prepared 
by listening and listening and trying to figure out what everything being 
said was.
<li><a href="pghedlyr.html"><u>Peghead</u>:</a>  The lyrics to the album 
of the same name.  This time, the lyrics *WERE* released with the album, 
only minor changes have been made for this edition you see here.
<li><a href="polka.html"><u>The Last Polka</u>:</a> This album, part live 
album, part "unreleased" songs compilation, was released sometime in late 
'95.  (I personally did not find it until October of '95, but I hear it 
was out before that)  The final Black Happy album.  No lyric sheet was 
provided, so I pieced this together on my own.  I'm probably about as 
accurate on these lyrics as I am on the ones for <u>Friendly Dog 
Salad</u>.
<li><a href="geekclub.html">Black Happy Geek Club</a>: This is an archive 
for the old Black Happy Geek Club newsletter that circulated in Internet 
email.  It was put together by Don Jennings and Greg Hamilton.
<li><a href="../coolside/index.html">The Cool Side of the Street</a>: 
This is a new mailing list, dedicated to Black Happy and Shoveljerk.  
More information can be found on it's own web page.
<li>And here is a <a href="bandpic.html">picture</a> of the 
Idaho Spuds.  This picture came from a newspaper in the Everett, WA area, 
prior to Brewstock '94, which Black Happy had been scheduled to play at 
(but didn't, due to car trouble on the way).

<title>The Cool Side of the Street</title>
<body bgcolor=#0000ff text=#ffffff link=#ffff00 vlink=#00ff00 alink=#ff0000>
<center><img src="coolside.gif" alt="The Cool Side Of The Street Mailing List HomePage"> </center>
<hr>
<p>This web page is to chronicle the digests for <i>The Cool Side
of the Street</i>, the new <b>Black Happy</b> and
<b>Shoveljerk</b> mailing list.  Though Black Happy broke up in
February of 1995, that band's role in the creation of Shoveljerk,
in addition to the following it had in the Pacific Northwest, have
more than earned it the right to be included in the discussions on
this list.</p>
<p>The list and this web page are being maintained by
<a href="http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis">Daniel Aeschliman</a>, a 
Black Happy fan since February of 1994, and a Shoveljerk fan since the 
release of their album <u>Swarm</u> in February of 1996.</p>
<hr>
<p>The list is a digest, meaning that I will compile submissions
to the list and then send out digests.  The digests are sent out on 
Mondays, and are planned to begin distributing on every other 
Monday starting on 20 January 1997.  The discussion of the list 
is centered around the subject of Black Happy and Shoveljerk, 
their music, live performances, recordings, and news pertaining 
to the bands and their members, past and present.  
<hr>
<p>Debate about the demise of Black Happy and the formation 
of Shoveljerk will be accepted.  However, I will work as a moderator 
on discussions of this nature.  Statements that are simply 
"Shoveljerk sucks" will not be tolerated.  Why?  As I explain on 
the <a href="gydlines.html">guidelines</a> page, I feel that 
opinions need to be supported with some sort of justification.</p>
<p>I previously had stated here that I wouldn't publish something 
along the lines of "Shoveljerk is no good because they don't have the 
horn section."  It has been (politely) brought to my attention that 
I came off as a bit of a tyrant on this point.  (Well, "tyrant" may not 
be the right word, but "censor" is)  For that, I feel I should 
apologize.  While I still hold firm in my belief that music (or art in 
general, for that matter) should be judged on what it is and not on 
what it isn't, I have come to realize that I was advocating censorship 
in this manner.  As a moderator, it is a fine line that I tread, between 
moderator and censor.  I apologize again for having crossed this 
line, and I hope that anyone who had previously withheld words for 
the digest will now feel free to speak.</p>

Use either the above mailto: link or compose a message on your own.  BE 
ADVISED that if you send a subscription request from an address which

<p>To submit an article to the digest, send messages to me at 
<a href="mailto:kylis@olivier.dementia.org">kylis@olivier.dementia.org</a>.  
If you do not wish for your email address to be published with the 
article or wish to use an alias rather than your real name, please say so 
in the message.</p> 
<hr>
<p>The name for the list is currently a temporary thing.  I've
been having trouble thinking of what to call the list, and finally
decided that (at least for now) I would choose a line from one of
the few songs that Shoveljerk recorded and released that was
originally performed live by Black Happy in their final months.
The song, from the above-mentioned album <u>Swarm</u>, is entitled
"Summer," and happens to be one of my favorite songs on the album,
and the most recent single.  (Previous singles were "Killing My
Buzz" and "Unwind," both of which had previously been played as
Black Happy)</p>
<p>If anyone has a better name for the list, please feel free to
contact me and let me know.  Whatever the name is, though, I do
ask that it somehow have a connection between both Shoveljerk and
Black Happy, since both bands are fair game for discussion on the
list.</p>

<p>Well, this page is coming up a lot faster than I'd originally
intended.  Course, all of the sections of my web page are always under
construction, just like any web page.  And a number of sections still
have to be written.  But, I found someone who was linking to me from
*THEIR* Cure page, so I figure I should put the other pages aside for
now, and work on this one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Problem is, though, I'm still not exactly sure what direction I
want to go with this.  I think, for now, I simply want to put my own
personal Cure story on here.  And that is right <a

<hr>
<p>Breaking news time!</p>
<p>The first single from <u>ULTRA</u> is now out!  It's entitled <I>Barrel Of A Gun</I>, and personally, I think it's great.  The b-side is a really cool instrumental entitled <I>Painkiller</I>.  The various versions of the single include remixes by Underworld, One Inch Punch, United, 3 Phase, and Plastikman.  <u>ULTRA</u> is slated for an April release, and a second single is supposed to come in March.  Rumor has it that this single is entitled <I>It's No Good</I>, and backed with a song entitled <I>Slowblow</I>.

<hr>
<p>Yes, yet another Depeche Mode home page here on the WWW.  There's probably
already like 15 or 20 others out there, so why do we need one more, you ask?
Well, because, dammit, I wanted to make one!  :)</p>
<p>But we aren't here to discuss <b>why</b> I'm making this page.  We're here
to discuss the band this page is talking about, and that's a rather different
matter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Who is Depeche Mode?  Here is a brief <a

<hr>
<p>What about me?  How did <a href="mystory.html">I</a> get into 
Depeche Mode?</p>
<hr>
<p>There's also a Depeche Mode mailing list here on the Internet, known as
<a href="http://commline.com">BONG</a>.  It currently is unavailable (so
ignore that link!) but should be back up soon.  Also, here is the <a
href="bong112.faq">FAQ</a> created by BlackSun and the <a
href="apndx201.faq">appendix</a> I created (which is slightly outdated, 
but I'm currently too busy to update).  Also, here are the <a

official releases, and the <a 
href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~etaoin/DM/Append-1.16">appendix</a> to  
the discography, both maintained by Louis van Dompselaar (these are 
linked from his page, and I may not notice when the link changes, so just 
let me know, and I'll make the update).  These should be the most recent 
versions of each document.</p>

<hr>
<p>Okay, I'm going to start piecing this page together now.  To begin, 
let's take a brief look at the last <a href="erasure.html">album</a>.  No, we don't mean as in final.  It's just that the new one isn't out yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>Brief pause for breaking news:  The first single (<I>In My Arms</I>) 
for the new album, <u>Cowboy</u>, was released in January.  B-sides are 
<I>In The Name Of The Heart</I> and <I>Rapture</I> (yes, a cover of the 
Blondie song).  A second single, <i>Don't Say Your Love Is Killing 
Me</i>, is due in February.  The b-sides: <I>Heart Of Glass (Live)</I> 
(yes, another Blondie cover) and <I>Oh L'amour</I>.  No, I'm serious 
about this.  Go check out <a 
href="http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/">Mute's Web Page</a> to find out 
more.</p>
<p>Bad news for American fans, though.  It seems that Elektra has decided to drop Erasure, and they are now label-less in this country.  Attention Mute reps: Put them on Mute America!  We need local releases of this stuff!!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, back to the standard stuff for this page:</p>
<hr>
<p>How about my own <a href="mystory.html">personal</a> Erasure story?  
Here it is.</p>
<p>Also, here's the most recent version of the Erasure <a 
href="faq.txt">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>And lastly, I'm going to take advantage of my somewhat captive audience 
and provide you with my current Erasure "want list".  This is a list of 
Erasure items that I'm currently looking for to flesh out my collection.  If 
you can help me find any of the items on <a href="wantlist.html">this

<title>Pages For The Tempted</title>

<center><img src="../img/logo.jpg" alt="The 4 Of Us"></center>
<h3><center><pre><b>Pages For The Tempted</b></pre></center></h3>
<hr>
<p>Back in about 1990 or so, I was first introduced to a band named <b>The
4 Of Us</b>.  My brother had gone to some kind of music convention at the
Kingdome in Seattle, and come home with a free copy of their single <i>Drag
My Bad Name Down</i>.  On the b-side was a song entitled <i>One Strong
Hammer</i>.  (People who have been here before may remember that I had
listed <i>Mary</i> as the b-side of this tape - I had said that from memory
and recently discovered I was wrong on that detail.  This is the correct
song for the b-side of this cassette.  More info can be found in the
discography)  I kinda liked the a-side, but never really listened to the
b-side.</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple of years later, I believe in 1992, I found a copy of their debut
album, <u>Songs For The Tempted</u>, at the local library system.  I got it,
listened to it, and loved it.  My first year of college, I found the album
on cassette and bought it.  (I have now acquired the UK CD of <u>Songs For
The Tempted</u> but am still looking for an American copy of it.  Again, any
help would be appreciated!)</p>
<p>Also, since the beginning of the summer of 1995, I've managed to stumble
across two of their singles on CD, <i>Drag My Bad Name Down</i> and
<i>Mary</i>, and a promo CD for <i>Drag My Bad Name Down</i>.  &lt;SHAMELESS
PLUG&gt; Any help in finding additional material is welcome! &lt;/SHAMELESS
PLUG&gt;.

<h1>Welcome to the Dream Attack HomePage (tm)!</h1>
<hr>
<p><h3>NOTICE:</h3> I *DO* know that the radio station doesn't exist 
any more and hasn't existed for a while.  Hell, I'm the one that put that 
information up here.  :)  Why do I still have this section up here?  
Well, good question.  It's kinda as a testament to something that was.  
Think of this now more as a monument to the past than anything else.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here you will find all kinds of information about a
radio show you will never be able to listen to - since the student 
government at my school has decided to cut the funding for the station.  
Oh well.  :)</p>
<hr><p>Dream Attack aired almost every Tuesday night from 6 to 9 pm.  I 
play a variety of "Alternative" music.  Information about some of my
favorite artists to play can be found through links on my 
<a href="../music/index.html">music page</a>.</p>
<p>To make this page have *ANY* purpose whatsoever, I have provided 
links here to the logs for the 9 shows that were done under the name of 
Dream Attack.  And one last note... any song marked with an asterisk (*) 
means that it was a Dream Attack <i><b>exclusive</b></i>.  These are 
generally re-edits of songs that I do myself.  You'll catch on fast.</p>
<hr><p>Yes, KOOP died.  And it was not a pleasant experience.  Let's just 
say that the Associated Students of Eastern Washington University (ASEWU) 
had decided at some point that they didn't want us anymore.  So, the 
ASEWU found a way to get rid of us, and that they did.  Though they had 
over $50,000 in supplemental monies, they could not see it as plausible 
to fund us.  But I am keeping this section of my Web page open.  I just 
won't be adding to it any more.  It's sad that KOOP had to die in this 
manner, but things like that happen on occassion.  At least no one can 
say that we didn't try to save it.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color=#ff0000>Okay, okay...</font> I know, I say above that I 
"won't be adding to [this page] any more."  I lied.  <font color=#0000ff>Shame, 
shame, shame.</font>  The only addition is a commercial that I pieced 
together for the show that had been planned out before the show went off 
the air - but you can find more on that below....</p>

<p>Below you will find links to various pages I have created, consisting of links to music-related sites.  These include pages for bands, record labels, radio stations, and magazines (such as Billboard, Rolling Stone, Spin, and more).  These are in <b>ALPHABETICAL ORDER</b>.  Musical artists have been broken into five alphabetical categories,  in order to keep the size of each link page down.  Labels, Radio, and Magazines make up their own page, which I have labelled as "Industry".  Enjoy the sites, and let me know of any that I have missed (for artists that are listed here <b>ONLY</b>!)</p>

<title>Kylis' Biography</title>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 ulink=#0000ff vlink=#ff0000>
<center><img src="../img/biog.jpg" alt="[Kylis' Biography]"></center> 
<hr>
<p>My real name is Daniel Aeschliman.  Don't worry about trying to pronounce it - most people can't.  Makes it easy to identify the telephone solicitors, at least.  :)</p>
<hr>
<p>I was born on the 9th of September in 1974, I was born in Seattle, Washington, USA.  Great town, I think.   Course, since I was raised in the area, the rain doesn't bother me.  Hell, I'm living in Spokane, Washington right now, which is a lot drier than Seattle.  Actually, Seattle doesn't really get <b>that</b> much rain - it's just that it gets a constant drizzle, so it's developed a bit of a bad reputation for such things.</p>
<p>(Of course, in the recent (November '96 to January '97) snow and ice storm, I found myself feeling very glad that I was living over here in Cheney.  Why?  We may have had almost three feet of snow, but at least 1) my power didn't go out, 2) people here do somewhat know how to drive in that much snow, and 3) I didn't have to worry about anything collapsing on top of me.)</p>
<hr>
<p>I was raised in a Christian household, attending the First Christian Church of Kent (Disciples Of Christ) from the time I was born until the present.  I still go there when I'm at home (like during the summer) but that's about it.  Always helps to be on the same side of the state as the church you're trying to go to, you
know?  :)</p>
<hr>
<p>I went to school in the Tahoma School District.  Wonderful place - if you're a hick.  You'll notice that I don't have the highest regard for that place.  It wasn't exactly the best experience of my life to say the least.  Well, it was fine until I got into high school, then it really went downhill fast.  I don't want to depress or bore you with the details, so I won't.  Let's just say it wasn't exactly fun or good and leave it at that.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I was young, like about 4th grade or so, I got the wonderful little "Mr. Microphone" thing from my parents for Christmas (maybe a birthday - can't remember now) and was able to put my voice on the radio.  That first sparked an interest in radio, but that initial spark died out fairly soon.  It was rekindled in the Spring of '94, when I first started working at KOOP AM, an on-campus, closed-circuit radio station here at Eastern Washington University.  My first quarter on the air, I did a <i>techno-industrial</i> format.  I enjoyed it, but when I came back to Eastern in the fall of '94, I wanted to do a general <i>alternative</i> format - the <i>techno-industrial</i> format was a bit too limiting at that point, in my opinion.  I quickly got hooked up with a good friend of mine, Jason Hammond, and we did a show together that fall.  We simply called it <i><b>Dan and Jason</b></i>.  Didn't advertise for it or anything. By Winter '95, Jason had moved off campus and had a tough work schedule, so he was unable to do the show with me any more.  But I kept it going.  I didn't even bother to name that show.  In Spring '95, I finally named the show with a decent name to advertise it under: <i><b>Dream Attack</b></i>.  Yes, yes, I know, I stole the name from a New Order song.  But it sounds cool.  And since I was the last show on Tuesday nights (6-9 pm), it was somewhat fitting, wasn't it?  I wasn't going to start advertising the show until Fall '95, but before 
that was able to occur, the station was taken away from us.  More info can be found on the <a href="http://olivier.dementia.org/~jem/koop">KOOP-AM</a> web page, maintained by my wife.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I was in sixth grade, another interest was sparked.  That of writing.  I wrote some of my first (albeit, pathetic) stories at that time.  My teacher commented that I had a gift for telling stories like that, and that I should pursue that.  Well, I've never forgotten those words.  They stuck with me all throughout
high school, and I recently graduated from Eastern Washington University with a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing, and a minor in Radio-Television.  The Creative Writing degree is because I love it, and I want into the classes in that program that only majors can get into, and the minor is because I know I need something with which to pay the bills, and it's something else that I love.  I'm currently in the midst of a
number of various writing projects, all of which have been sitting for quite a while.  These include at least three novels (one Science-Fiction, the other two Fantasy) and numerous short stories.  I haven't, as of yet, had the privilege of having something published, but I'm still working on it.</p>
<p>And in the course of the last year, I've discovered that I also have a love for music retail.  I'm currently working with a music store in Spokane, designing and  setting  up a web page for them.  I'll then take orders from the site and process them for the store.</p>
<hr>
<p>Just a little earlier I made  mention of my wife, who maintains the web page for KOOP-AM.  It seems rather fitting that she take on this task, since KOOP basically depended on us (and primarily her) in it's final days.  In fact, it was this station that caused us to meet.  For almost a year, we basically knew each other by name and face only.  Then, in the Spring of '95, a friend of mine (named Craig) committed suicide.  This came right before finals, when my friend Jason and I both had music videos due in a Film Production class we were taking.</p>
<p>I was helping my friend Jason out with his video, which was for "In Penetration" by Controlled Bleeding.  We were supposed to meet up on Friday morning to shoot some footage.  I got to the Radio-Television building before he did, and picked up a copy of our school paper, <u>The Easterner</u>, and saw that it had a front page article on Craig's suicide (which I had only heard about on Monday of  that week).  I started reading the article about him, which seemed to be a tribute to Craig's life.  However, about halfway through the article, it started jumping into all kinds of speculation about what happened the night Craig killed himself.</p>
<p>It was too late for me to stop reading it, because at this point I'd already seen the speculations, and it didn't settle well with me, as I'm sure you can imagine.  Right about this time, Lesley came walking by, and 
said "Hi."  She could quickly tell something was wrong, and sat down and talked with me about the situation.  Jason finally showed up to shoot his video, and so we quickly whipped that out.  It felt so nice to just throw myself into a character in that video, even if it was supposed to be the "God of Heroin" or something like that.</p>
<p>For the next quarter, the one in which my radio show was actually named, Lesley sat in on most all of the shows.  Basic rule of thumb was that if I was on the air, she was probably sitting in there with me.  And 
during this time, we began competing against each other for the Station Manager position, along with our fight to try to save the station from being written out of the budget.  Unfortunately we lost.</p>
<p>But during all of that, she and I became good friends, and used Internet email to stay in close touch over the summer.  (For quite a while, we were writing 30 page emails to each other *A DAY*)  Well, I fell in love with her over the course of the summer, and when I got back to town for school, we started dating.</p>
<p>And the rest, as they say, is history.  A few months later, we announced our engagement, and on November  23rd,  1996, we were married.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not much else to the story at the moment.  But I'll try to keep this remotely up to date in the future, so those of you who want to live vicariously through me can... :)</p>

<h1>Pictures....</h1>
<h4>(yes, no funky little graphic this time... :)</h4>
<hr>
<p>What you will see below is a list of names, and each of those is a 
direct link to a picture of that person / thing.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../img/couple.jpg">ME!</a>  This picture was 
taken in January of 1996.  And the little dark haired girl there is my 
wife, Lesley.  What a cutie.  :)<br> 
And this is <a href="../img/mikendan.jpg">my brother and I</a> when 
we were much younger.  I think I'm between one and 
two years old, which would put him about five to six years old.  
Something like that.  But isn't we CUUUUUUUUTE??????  :)
<li><a href="../img/jason.jpg">Jason Hammond</a>, also known to the IRC 
community as <i>Godlike</i>.  That, or simply <i>Moron</i>.  (grin)  
Scary as it may sound, I've been friends with Mr. Hammond since... second 
grade.  (gasp)  And here's <a href="../img/dudes.jpg">another</a> picture of 
Mr. Hammond, along with myself.  This was taken exactly a week after the 
first picture of him here.
<li><a href="../img/rithy.jpg">Rithy Lu</a>.  In the foreground of this 
picture, you see a good IRC friend of mine (and fellow crazed-Depeche 
Mode-Fan) Rithy Lu.  In the background is his girlfriend, Carolyn, but I 
don't recall what her last name is.  :(  Rithy, wanna fill me in?  Rithy 
was a great friend to me during my hell week (for more info, see my 
biography) and honestly, one of the best friends I have.
<li>Another close friend of mine in IRC is <a href="../img/arlo.jpg">Arlo 
Burnett</a>, known to the IRC community and the Depeche Mode Mailing List 
as BlackSun.  We met in #depeche, became friends, and have educated each 
other in music (he introduced me to one of my current top ten favorite 
bands, Anything Box).
<li><a href="../img/interns.jpg">Interns</a>!  When I finished my year of 
school at Northwest Christian College, I followed it up with a summer at 
Central United Protestant Church in Richland, WA, where I was a 
Children's Ministry Intern.  This is a picture of the entire intern team 
from that summer.  I'm on the far left of the picture.  In the back row 
are Karen, Gwen, and James, and in the front row are me, Glenn, Kristie, 
Sarah, Karen, and Stacie.
<li><a href="../img/steve.jpg">Steve Eddings</a>, my first college 
roommate.  This was taken on the day we moved into the dorm at NCC.  In 
the original picture, I'm standing next to him, but I had Lesley (who 
scanned a lot of the pictures here) edit me out, because I do <b>not</b> 
like that picture of me. 
</ul> <br>
<p>A brief word of thanks to the people who helped me with this section.  
I scanned the picture of Lesley and myself.  The baby picture was scanned 
by my brother, Mike, using the scanner he just recently bought.  Thank 
you!  Every other picture here were all scanned by Lesley.  I just want to put a 
word of thanks here to Lesley for the time she spent on these scans.  
Thank you, my love!</p>

<title>What's New?</title>

<center><img src="img/whatsnew.gif" alt="[What's New?]"></center>
<hr>
<p>7 January 1997</p>
<p>So, this list is suddenly a lot shorter.  What gives?</p>
<p>I'm currently doing a huge revamping project to my web page.  I want to make the thing look better, clean out files that aren't actually being used, various things like this.  I assume if you're reading this, you've already noticed some of the changes.  But, for those who somehow came right here, here's a brief rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Depeche Mode <a href="dm/dmtable.html">Track Collector's Reference</a> has had a number of clean-up revisions done to it.
<li>Redone graphics on the <a href="index.html">main index page</a>, and slightly different organization to the links on that page.
<li>A <font color=#ff1493>NEW</font> section, of <a href="links.html">various links</a> that don't fit under the general category of "Music" - this includes TV, movies, anime, government, Internet, and much more.
<li>Clean-up to a lot of files on the page that had some odd coding (due to being among the first HTML documents I ever created and having changed my style a bit since then) or had abnormally large margins on them (in the case of some text files).  <font color=#ffff00>Some of this is still under development.</font>
<li>Updates to my <a href="biog/index.html">biography</a>, including the fact that I'm now married.  And no, she ain't no ball and chain.  Who do you think inspired some of the <a href="writing/mypoems.html">poems</a> I've written, huh?
<li>Updating to the <a href="music/index.html">Music Links</a> page.  <font color=#ffff00>Some of this is still under development.</font>
</ul>
<p>And that's about all that I can think of right now.  You'll also notice that I decided to remove all the revisions that were previously listed on this page - well, that's because I figure it's a new year and time to start with a clean slate, as it were.  So, all the previous revisions have been "erased" (from this document), as they are no longer "new".  Watch for this document to change over the next year, and be erased again at the start of '98!</p>

<center><h1>Mail Me?</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>At the bottom of this page you will find the actual mailto: link from 
which mail can be sent to me.  Why am I setting this little hurdle first?</p>
<p>Recently, I've gotten a rash of emails from people that I can only 
attribute to coming from here.  Normally, I wouldn't mind.  I have no 
problem with people writing to me.</p>
<p>The problem is that this isn't a case of people writing to me.  This 
is a case of people seeing my address here on the web and deciding that I 
would be a good target for their advertisements.  I would like to state 
something:</p> 
<hr> 
<font color=#ff0000 size=+1>
<p>I HAVE NO INTEREST IN GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES, DIETS, OR MERCHANDISE 
THAT YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO APPROACH ME WITH IN ORDER FOR ME TO BUY IT.  IF 
I HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE MERCHANDISE, I WILL SEARCH IT OUT MYSELF.  I AM 
INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO DO THIS AND AM INCREDIBLY OFFENDED, TICKED OFF, AND 
IRATE EVERY TIME I RECEIVE ANOTHER EMAIL FROM SOMEONE TRYING TO SELL ME 
SOMETHING.  IN OTHER WORDS: <B>DO NOT SEND ME COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS 
OR GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES OF ANY NATURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</B></P></font>
<hr>
<p>Now, for those of you who are actually wanting to email me with a 
question or comment, feel free to use the mailto: link below.  The rest 
of you can just take a long walk off of the next available short pier.

<title>Black Happy FAQ</title>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 vlink=#ff0000 ulink=#0000ff>
<h1><center><img src = "../img/bh-logo.jpg" alt="[Black Happy]"></center></h1>
<h4><center>Frequently Asked Questions</center></h4>
<hr><h3>Who was Black Happy?</h3>
<p>Black Happy was a band comprised of 8 people.  Scott Jessick
and Jim Bruce shared drum duties, Paul Hemenway and Greg Hjort
shared guitar duties, and Jay Carkhuff and Mike Hasseries shared
trombone duties.  Also, Mark Hemenway played bass, Daryl Elmore
played saxophone, and the aforementioned Paul Hemenway was the
lead singer.  And yes, you read correctly above.  There were two
drummers, plus a horn section comprised of two trombones and a
saxophone.</p>
<hr>
<h3>How did Black Happy get started?</h3>
<p>Black Happy started out as a four piece Christian heavy metal
band named Sacrament.  As a joke, they brought in a few friends
and wrote a little novelty song (entitled <i>Raging Black
Mouse</i>) in which they incorporated a horn section into the
heavy metal line up.  When the band noticed that this song was
getting more reception at their performances than their standard
material, they decided it would be a good idea to make the horn
section a part of the band and reinvent themselves a bit.  Hence,
Black Happy was born as a nine-piece band.  One member left,
creating the Black Happy line up listed above.  (Anyone know who
the ninth member was and what they did?)</p>
<hr>
<h3>What was their first recording?</h3>
<p>Their first recording was a 7" vinyl entitled <u>Go Off</u>.
There were only 500 copies made of this, and it regularly sells
for around $30.  It features two songs, both of which are
currently unavailable elsewhere, <i>Dry & Confused</i> and <i>Up
The Faith</i>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Okay, so what followed that?</h3>
<p>Soon after the <u>Go Off</u> 7" was released, Black Happy
signed to Pacific Inland Records, and recorded the album
<u>Friendly Dog Salad</u>.  This album is a collection of the
material that they performed during their early tours.  The songs
on this album are:</p>
<p>Garlic, Washcloth, One Fine Automobile, Basically Wrong, Such
Much Suck, Black Radio, Two Hands And A Hat, Moflo, The New One,
F-Word</p>
<hr>
<h3>What was next?</h3>
<p><u>Friendly Dog Salad</u> was released in the midst of touring
in 1991.  Sometime in late 1992 or early 1993 (can someone fill
this in for me?), the band wrote and recorded their second album,
<u>Peghead</u>.  This album contained the following songs:</p>
<p>Bubbles, Bullmonkey, Shoveljerk, Spirit, Holly Would, Chicken
In A Biscuit, Home, Three-Day Weekend (At Rancho Bebop), Mrs.
Berri, Shuckin' The Jive, A. Bedini, Yes... And It Counts, Myself,
The Life And Times Of...</p>
<p>The Life And Times Of... has also been released under the title
of "Paul Larsen" - however, the tracks are identical.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Were there other songs they played?</h3>
<p>As with most bands, Black Happy did do some songs live that (as
far as is known) were never recorded in the studio or hadn't been 
released while the band was together.  Some titles:</p>
<p>Mambo Jambo (I Don't Wanna Rule The World), Summer, Looper,
Toys In The Attic (a cover of the Aerosmith song), Country</p><br>
<p>And there are probably others.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Is there any material that hasn't been released?</h3><br>
<p>This is highly possible.  The chances of any additional unreleased 
material seeing the light of day, though, are very small.  Unless, of 
course, Shoveljerk decides to rerecord some of those songs, though this 
is unlikely.  On <u>The Last Polka</u>, the following songs finally saw 
the light of day:</p> 
<p>Country (live recording), Parenting, Straight, Sweeping Where The 
Carpet Used To Be, Mambo Jambo, One Time, Toys In The Attic, Hitting The 
Floor</p>
<p>There is probably more material in the vaults (such as (possibly?) the 
song "Raging Black Mouse") but again, the chances of these tracks being 
released now are highly unlikely.</p>

<title>Black Happy: So Long, Farewell</title>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 vlink=#ff0000 link=#0000ff>
<hr>
<h5><i>Reprinted without permission from <u>The Inlander</u>,
Week of Feb. 22-28, 1995, page 14.</i></h5>
<hr>
<h3>The Inland Way</h3>
<h1>SO LONG, FAREWELL</h1>
<h4>Looking back at the illustrious career of CdA's Black Happy</h4>
<br><h5>by Dan Cossette</h5>
<hr>
<p>Black Happy is many things.  This is what you hear the most: they're the 
biggest band from anywhere near here.  They just played in front of X number 
of people.  <u>Peghead</u>, their last release, has sold X number of copies.  
Hey, they're playing Alaska again.  They're gonna get signed any day
now.  Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It's become hard to respect those achievements without losing track of what
got the band where it is today.  That would be the music, Jerome.  The bottom
line remains the same.  When you strip away the fans, the venues, the tours, and
the rest of the hullabaloo, you get the self-proclaimed "eight geeks from
Idaho," a handful of recordings, and a lot of jumping around.</p>
<p>The purest aspect of the sadly overanalyzed Black Happy is a bunch of tasty,
well-crafted songs that a lot of people happened to take a liking to.  They are
not a funk band.  They are a rock band with great pop sensibilities and an even
better sense of how to incorporate elements of funk without sounding like a
Chili Peppers clone.  They are a Christian band that knows better than to cram
religion down your throat.  They're a fun band for fun people, and that's about
as seriously as anyone should think of them.</p>
<p>It all started with a Christian-metal band called Sacrament.  A song called
"Raging Black Mouse" was conceived with horn accompaniment.  When both band and
listeners found this novelty tune to be better than the rest of the set, Black
Happy was born.  Originally a nine-piece, Black Happy played tons of gigs,
wowing thousands of people with, if not their songs, their live intensity, which
to this day is the band's greatest asset.  Whether performing in front of 10 or
2,000, BH plays the same set with the same energy, every time.</p>
<p>While it should not be a main focus, it is certainly wise to reflect on Black
Happy's many successes.  Their first recording, the <i>Go Off</i> single, sold
out quickly, and is now a trophy for those who were there first.  The 7"
currently fetches upwards of $30 in Seattle.  By early '92, Black Happy drew too
many people for the established bar venues to hold.  Large, all-ages shows
became the mainstay for the boys from Coeur d'Alene.  In Spokane, the emergence
of Gatsby's Tavern as an alternative playground gave Black Happy the means to
play in front of nearly a thousand folks at a time, and every show would bring
just about that many.  Sellouts at the Met became an unparalleled achievement
and a routine event simultaneously.</p>
<p>By that time, their first album, <u>Friendly Dog Salad</u>, had sold over
10,000 units.  This album encapsulated almost the entire '90-'91 set list, but
suffered in the production area.  Still, tracks like "Black Radio" and "Garlic"
gathered tons of radio play and turned many a curious ear.  The follow-up,
<u>Peghead</u>, enjoyed a much richer sound, especially on such key tracks as
<i>Three-Day Weekend</i>, <i>Shoveljerk</i> and perhaps their best recording,
<i>Yes and it Counts</i>.</p>
<p>Both albums remained on The Rocket's Northwest sales charts for literally
years, beating out almost all of Seattle's major-label acts.  Still, the live
Black Happy sound has yet to be captured, which will leave fans drooling,
waiting for the posthumous live album, which will feature several unreleased
songs as well as new studio tracks.</p>
<p>So here we are, at the end of the road.  Black Happy has fallen prey to that
famous, incurable virus, "Musical Differences."  Already the first offshoot-band
is in the works, promising a harder sound.  A hardcore-rap act emerging from the
horn section is a likely possibility.  The future for the separate band members
is bright, but for Black Happy, it has actually been over for a little while
now.  For the local following, the RKCNDY show on Saturday be damned.  The real
last show is at The Met on Friday.  Seattle gets the tired, been-in-a-van-all-
day set, and who wants that?  The only real shame is that the place can only
hold about a third of the crowd that would happily enter the building.  Not a
bad score for eight geeks from Idaho with good pop sensibility.</p>
<hr>
<center>Dan Cossette rarely admits he likes pop music.<br>
Black Happy brings out the best in him.</center>

<h3><i>Dry And Confused</i></h3>
<br>
<pre>
For what we are about to receive
May the good lord help us :x8

I got so much on my mind
I can't afford to lose
Take the hell and stick it
Hear the drummer get wicked
Anyway I'm defending the mic
Who gives a hell about what they like
Were gonna do this anyway

Hey L.A.
Look at yourself and ask yourself
What have you done today?

C'mon x 1,965
Head Check

Bass How low can you go
Death row what this worlds gonna know
Once again back is the incredible
Rhyme animal the untameable
Beat Black Happy #1
Flakeboy said freeze and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I never really 
Had a gun but back to the Hemenway x-1's

Hey L.A.
Look at yourself and ask yourself
What have you done today?

C'mon x 1,000,00
GO OFF!

Explain Myself Again
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>UP THE FAITH</h3>
<br>
<pre>
I thought I knew you and
I guess that I was right
Well I've never done this before
But the last time I did it
The vibe was tight
Good morning consumers you know
You can't bowl without a lane
We've eaten and we've eaten well
Now we wear the change

I'd love to see you live
UP THE FAITH

This is a story about ballads and salads
About the beat we know so well
Mother of all creatures
Don't damn their feet to hell

Today we dance
Today we sing
Tomorrow we pay for everything
Fools too wise and wise two fools
History proves the Cardinals rule

James Brown, James Hetfield, Chuck D
Show us where we get our rhythm from
Davide Bowie, Dave Mustaine, R.E.M.
And the Roses with the Guns
Dan Reed, The Young Brians, Prince
Rush, Sabbath and Fishbone
Spike Lee and Parliament
The Chili Peppers, Faith No More
Sound Garden, Janes Addiction
Sacrament in Living Color
Deep Purple, Iron Maiden
Steely Dan and the 70's brothers
Mudhoney, Nirvana some of the
Faith that we all like
But the coolest brother we've
met so far is the man with
the suffix of the name of CHRIST

THE POINT IS MOOT I GET THE CAR

I'd love to see you live
UP THE FAITH

<br><p>Too much talk has been going on
<br>And when I get done, there's some people gonna hate me now
<br>I can only smile when I'm watching you shout
<br>There's too many people moving in a frame they don't know about</p>
<p>I keep hearing about this line, you keep saying that all is fine
<br>I read about and watch you every day
<br>But that doesn't mean I gotta act that way
<br>I watch you shout to make some change
<br>I watch you promise to rearrange
<br>You're marching hard to prove your point
<br>Your token affection is new in this joint
<br>Time and time and time again
<br>We're finding out who's your own best friend
<br>If we criticize anything you say
<br>You tell us we're wrong and get out of the way
<br>You think we're living in '84
<br>When you don't know it's sad and what's more
<br>Big Brother's coming not blind or deaf
<br>Didn't you know that he's coming from the left?</p>
<p>We gotta clean this up, we gotta make this stop
<br>We need to walk in another way, we need to watch what we say
<br>We gotta forget all that, we gotta drop our bats
<br>Everything you're walking is unclean junk
<br>(We don't play that game punk)</p>
<p>I'm sick of hearing you speak your mind
<br>It's the same old chatterbox every time
<br>Every time we offer something new
<br>You shoot it down and say we haven't got a clue
<br>I hear you say our minds are shut
<br>What's your definition of trust?
<br>Another person another bed on another day
<br>Your lame excuse is that we make it this way</p>
<p>I know that there's a place, I know that there's a race
<br>I washed my hands in dirt, I prayed it wouldn't hurt
<br>I couldn't even look, I watched the hands I shook
<br>I needed so much more (and now my voice and throat are sore)</p>
<p>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Here's mine, here's mine, here's mine, here's mine
<br>(EVERYBODY!)
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Here's mine, here's mine</p>
<p>You just divorced your 86th wife
<br>And you wanna talk about real life
<br>You're telling us about your grand world plan
<br>Which part of <i>I don't care</i> don't you understand
<br>You say we're wrong and that depends
<br>What do you see from behind that lens
<br>You say we're a world with all one voice
<br>But you're never gonna let me make my own choice</p>
<p>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Here's mine, here's mine, here's mine, here's mine
<br>(EVERYBODY!)
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Here's mine, here's mine</p>
<p>(9, 8, 7, 6, 5,    4 3 2 1!)</p>
<p>None of your ideas ever stick
<br>I must admit that's a real nice trick
<br>Your voice must hurt you should give it a rest
<br>Add to the fact you're a creep at best
<br>I'm sick of watching you eat your own
<br>The fact remains that you've never grown
<br>We're wearing body bags not body gloves
<br>And none of this would happen if we talk about love</p>
<p>I hope that this will end, I pray I find my friends
<br>I know that I have one, ending time has just begun
<br>I still pray every night, that doesn't make it right
<br>This happened long before, it's always ripped and torn</p>
<p>(EVERYBODY!  LET'S GO, LET'S GO!)
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Here's mine, here's mine, here's mine, here's mine
<br>(EVERYBODY!)
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Here's mine, here's mine
<br>(EVERYBODY!)
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion
<br>Every everybody's got their own opinion, own opinion

<p>Do you want to see my true face and get to know my real place
<br>Do you really want to see how much I know and feel
<br>I know what I'm supposed to be, I'd rather feel than to see
<br>And when I run there's nothing that can hold me up
<br>I had a hot streak one time it helped to make up your mind
<br>And now it's showing everything I need to be
<br>My word does not mean a thing it only helps to get free
<br>So I can do as I please, I please, I please, I please...</p>
<p>What is hiding beneath my skin, it's just the costume I'm in
<br>It's changing colors anytime I want it to
<br>I need attention all day, I'm prone to make some mistakes
<br>But it's never my fault, my fault, oh no it's yours
<br>I make the other half see how blessed they are to have me
<br>How lucky they should feel that I'm around for them
<br>No matter what I can't fall, I'm always here for them all
<br>Just as long as everything is always geared to me
<br>I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
<br>I got what I want and I got how I need
<br>And I know that you will always listen to me
<br>I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
<br>I got what I want and I got how I need
<br>And I know that you will always listen to me</p>
<p>Do you think I can help the world, my tail is hidden and curled
<br>And I can lash back any time that I want to
<br>Ideas are none but my own, I don't care what I have sown
<br>I'm out of reach for anything to come back on me
<br>When all is finally done at least I know I have fun
<br>And by the way, how were things for you
<br>I really couldn't care less 'cause I don't clean up the mess
<br>Everything is always taken care of for me</p>
<p>I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
<br>I got what I want and I got how I need
<br>And I know that you will always listen to me
<br>I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
<br>I got what I want and I got how I need
<br>And I know that you will always listen to me</p>
<p>Mine is never to take the blame, my story's never the same
<br>I'll rearrange it to try and get away
<br>And when I go to my grave I don't care if I am saved
<br>I'll get the same treatment that I got down here</p>
<p>I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
<br>I got what I want and I got how I need
<br>And I know that you will always listen to me
<br>I'm a jerk, I'm a creep, I'm so shallow, I seem deep
<br>I got what I want and I got how I need
<br>And I know that you will always listen to me

<br><p>And if I'm not too sure about the state I'm in
<br>I watch the circles start to cross and join as one
<br>And when I'm asking for someone to begin again
<br>I hope that you won't turn around and run</p>
<p>Don't we ever think about the other side
<br>My soul and I are just looking for some time
<br>And if we ever get what we are looking for
<br>Maybe we'll get something that we can't ignore</p>
<p>I saw a lady whose feet were covered by the sand
<br>She won't maneuver into things she shouldn't be
<br>And as she raised her head I saw the face of a man
<br>I could only jump back and think of what I'd seen</p>
<p>Spirit rise, spirit rise, spirit rise, spirit rise</p>

<p>Looking past the point I reached out for my final chance to be
<br>Instead of turning past, I vowed for this to be my very last

<br>While a quiet laugh broke through things changed and I began to dream</p>
<p>Dream - I know your every move

All I've seen can't compare to this

And I'm about to get us something we haven't ever had

You know I hope that we don't ever stop that's why I say
I've got a three day weekend at Rancho Bebop
 
And I know what to say (I know, I know what)
To the sky today (I know what, I know what to say)
I said, I've been good, I've been bad
And I'm about to get us something that we haven't ever had
And I know this ones for sure
 
Well, I say, you know I hope that we don't ever stop falling in
You know I hope that this won't ever drop falling in
You know I hope we don't ever stop...  how's it go?

And on the street I heard somebody say
I have no use for the sky today
Yeah, it seems like we've been here before
The ideas running out the door
I know.... we're never gonna give it away
 
I say, you know I hope that we won't ever stop falling in

Get by, get by, get by, get by, get by, get by
 
Well, I kinda knew you and I, I guess that I was ready
Well I never did this before
But the last time I did it, the vibe was tight
Good morning consumers
You know you can't bowl without a lane
We've eaten and we've eaten well, now we wear the change
 
I'd love to see you live up the faith!
 
This is a story about ballads and salads
About the beat we know so well
Mother of all creatures
Don't damn their feet to hell
Today we dance, today we sing, tomorrow we pay for everything
Well, fools too wise, and wise two fools
History proves the Cardinal's rule, yeah
 
Redeemer, Holy Christ
Redeemer, Holy God
Redeemer, Holy Spirit
 
Eh, check this out...
James Brown, James Hetfield
Chuck D, show us where we get our rhythm from
David Bowie, Dave Mustaine, REM and the Roses with the Guns
Dan Reed, The Young Brians, Prince, Rush, Sabbath and Fishbone
Spike Lee and Parliament, The Chili Peppers and Faith No More
Soundgarden, Jane's Addiction, Sacrament in Living Color
Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Steely Dan and the 70's brothers
Mudhoney, Nirvana, some of the faith that we all like
But the coolest brother we've met so far
Is the man with the suffix of the name of CHRIST
 
Yeah, yeah

I got a new best friend and she's long and thin

She's got a jet black tan and I'm her only man

But any time I want to I can fire her up
 
Does anybody get it?  Does anybody see?
Does anybody feel it?  Why's this hurting me?
 
Sometimes she brings me out, sometimes she makes me shout
She can always blow my mind
Heaven only lasts a very short time
I love her in my death, well, in my dying breath
Until my face mask lies
Hell will only last a lifetime

<pre> 
And the bricks that once were standing, now are falling down
And the people who used to smile just sit and stare
And all the ideas that once meant something now have turned around
And what was once a small group, now has splitting into bands
 
I'm not just amusing myself, this is how I really am
I'm serious
The things that I would lie on now will never change
I know for sure
 
I used to cry when I realised our place on earth
But now I understand that no one's blaming me for this
 
I'm not just amusing myself, this is how I really am
I'm serious
The things that I would lie on now will never change
I know for sure
 
If we get one time, if we get one time          If we get one time
Again, if we get one time
If we get one time, if we get one time          If we get one time
Again, if we get one time
If we get one time, if we get one time          If we get one time
Again, if we get one time
If we get one time, if we get one time          If we get one time
Again, if we get one time
 
The bricks were all put back and I knew it was all for me
And they turned a circle and danced a dance in my sleeve
My desire to feel important quickly slipped away
And all my in-betweens and out of bounds called it a day
 
I'm not just amusing myself, this is how I really am
I'm serious
The things that I would lie on now will never change
I know for sure
 
If we get one time, if we get one time          If we get one time

So many things have changed in my short life
In my time that I thought would always be there
Yet when all that passes by my eyes
None of it will come as a big surprise, I'm expecting it
To tell the truth I know
That when my eyes are closed and shut again I'll be happy that way
Cause if I don't know where I'm going
If I don't know where I've been
Maybe you can show me now, can you tell me how
 
I'm going home, home, home
Mom I really wanna go home, home, home
Mom I really wanna go
I'm too small to see it all
I hold on tight so I won't fall and lose myself
Cause if I don't know where tomorrow is
How can I tell where today has been and when I'm going
 
I'm going home, home, home
Mom I really wanna go home, home, home

Just nodded it's head at me

That he is shining, rising in the face of man
Looking at everything he is holding while I am smiling at him
I'm free from him
Home, I wish I was homeward bound
 
If I had sight and I could feel would that finally make me real
Or can you answer that to me
 
You won't fall behind me anyway
So I've gotta watch you every day so I don't join you today

Geek Club</center></h1>
<hr>
<p>May of 1994 saw the release of the first Black Happy newsletter on the 
Internet.  This was put together, maintained, and edited by Don Jennings 
and Greg Hamilton.  The newsletter existed until the band broke up in 
February of 1995, then became ShovelSchtuff for a short time.  Soon 
after, the shoveljerk mailing list was created and has grown to be what 
it is today.</p>
<p>This is how Black Happy news was first distributed on the Internet, 
though, in this nicely crafted email digest.  Peruse the eleven issues, 
and see what you learn.....</p>

<hr><br><br><hr>
<p>It has been brought to my attention that people are putting up links 
to my Black Happy and Shoveljerk pages.  I just wanted to take brief 
moment to thank those people who have done it.  Can't give you anything 
in repayment, just my gratitude.  :)</p>
<p>Just makes me glad to think that enough people think my Black Happy 
and Shoveljerk pages are good enough resources to link from their own 
pages.  Again, thank you to all of you for the support!</p>

<title>Digest Guidelines</title>
<body bgcolor=#0000ff text=#ffffff link=#ffff00 vlink=#00ff00 alink=#ff0000>
<center><img src="gydlines.gif" alt="The Cool Side of the Street: Digest Guidelines"></center>
<hr size=4>
<p>I know, I know.  Putting down guidelines for a forum which should have 
freedom of speech.  Who do I think I am, a dictator?</p>
<p>No.  But I do believe that setting some simple guidelines for the list 
will help foster a better discussion forum.</p>
<hr>
<p>And really, the only rule that I will enforce without restriction is 
simply, if you wish to present an opinion, that you simply give your 
justification for it.  For example, let's say that you dislike the song 
"Home," because you think it doesn't make any sense.  If you state this 
reason, I feel that this is a valid justification for your position, and 
I would have no reservations about including this in a digest.  However, 
if you simply state that you dislike "Home", I would respond and ask you 
to provide a justification for the opinion prior to it being published.</p>
<p>I am taking this stance because I feel that it is impossible to truly 
have an opinion without understanding why you have that opinion.  I also 
feel that if you can't state why you have the opinion you have, then 
maybe you don't understand your opinion as well as thought you did and 
that you should reexamine it.  I take this stance with myself.  If I 
can't tell a person why I believe something, I take the time to think it 
out and figure out <b>why</b> I can't tell them.  It's a learning process 
I think we should all use.</p>
<p>By enforcing this rule, I hope to foster an environment in which we 
can all gain something from the list.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also ask that, when commenting on differences between the two bands, 
that they be discussed for what they are - and not for what they aren't.  If a 
message does not address one (or both) of  the bands for what that band is 
(and rather for what it isn't (the most obvious example: Shoveljerk's lack 
of a horn section)), I will publish it (as long as the above rule of justification 
is adhered to) without qualms.  However, you can rest assured that I will 
address the position in the digest.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind, this does not mean that you have to only say positive 
things about either act.  This simply means that the judgements be based on 
things that are a fact about the band.  Let's say, for example, that you don't 
like Shoveljerk as much as Black Happy, because you find Black Happy's 
material to be more uplifting than Shoveljerk.  This, I would consider valid.
Saying that you dislike Shoveljerk simply because of the lack of horns will 
raise questions from me about if there is anything else that you can say about 
them.  The reason I would do this is because we all know that the horns are 
no longer a part of the band.  But the horns were not the only thing that made 
Black Happy who they were.  I wish for people to evaluate Shoveljerk based 
on what they are - not in comparison to  Black Happy.  And vice versa.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope that I have made myself clear on these two points.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh, and the one case in which I will administer privileges of "censor" is 
in regards to messages that are completely off topic.  If a message has no 
bearing to the subject of Shoveljerk / Black Happy / Sacrament / or any of 
the former members and their current whereabouts (things such as the "Neiman 
Marcus cookie recipe" and "Craig Shergold's Greeting Card Wish" and the 
others), it will <b>NOT</b> be published in the digest, as that is not what 
the digest exists for.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am open to almost any topic for the list, ranging from:
<ul>
<li>Song lyric discussion / analysis
<li>Discographical Questions / new discoveries
<li>Helping others find particular merchandise
<li>Shoveljerk tour dates
<li>Concert / Album reviews (present & past)
<li>Up to date news about Shoveljerk and former Black Happy / Shoveljerk members
</ul>
<p>I wish for this list to be a network of friends, who can discuss the 
bands in an intelligent manner and keep each other up to date on the 
current status of these bands which we love.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you feel that I am being too harsh in requiring justifications of 
opinions prior to publishing articles in a digest, let me know.  There is 
a mailto: link on the main page for this digest which you may use for 
this purpose.  If I receive a reasonable number of complaints (which I 
will decide on myself), I will consider repealing this policy.</p>

<center><img src="fanpages.gif" alt="The Cool Side Of The Street Links to Fan Pages"></center> 
<hr>
<p>The links will be gathered below in the following manner.
Shoveljerk pages will be listed first (as that is the current
incarnation of the band), followed by Black Happy pages,
followed by personal homepages.  Within these sections, the
pages will be listed alphabetically by the title of the page.
To get a link added to this page, you must first be a subscriber
of the mailing list, then you must have a web page.  The
address(es) of the web page must be reported to me.  I will then
check the site for the exact title that you have given it (also
to verify the link wasn't mistyped and just so I can see it for
myself) and the link will be added to the page in it's proper
location.  Note that there is no kind of "ranking" given to the
pages - this is simply a listing.  A page could simply consisting of
"Black Happy is cool!" and as long as it was a valid web page
for a subscriber, it could then be listed here.</p>
<p>So let's begin...</p>

<center><font color=#1400ff size=+3>Welcome to the new Shoveljerk HomePage!</font></center>
<hr>
<p>You may have noticed some color changes here on the page.  While fiddling around with Corel PhotoPaint the other evening I created a (in my opinion) really cool logo graphic.  In order to put it 
into the page seamlessly, I had to make some color changes.  If you find anything difficult to read, or if I missed a page that the logo graphic is on and need to change a background color, please let me know and I'll work on it right away.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with the new background color - I don't want to hear it.  That's how it's going to be for a while, so just accept it and we can all get on with our lives.</p>
<hr>
<font color=#1400ff size=+1>NOTE: I do not know the band and they do not 
know me.  I cannot and will not deliver messages to the band (your best 
bet in contacting them is to contact Capricorn Records, their label).</font>
<p>Anyone have any tour dates they would like to share with us all?  I'm
interested in both forthcoming dates and reviews of past shows.  I'm going
to start putting together a "concert review" section under the "tour news"
page.  This will include reprints of reviews posted in the new <a href="../coolside/index.html">mailing list</a>
which I am building, with the author's permission of course.</p>
<p>I know, I've been a bit lax on the concert date stuff, but hopefully
I'll be a little more up to date now, as I've got easier access to my
Internet account now.  (grin)</p>

<title>Kylis' Personal Cure Story</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<center><h1>Kylis' Personal Story About</h1>
<img src=../img/cure.gif alt="[The Cure]"></center>
<hr>
<p>So, how did I get interested in The Cure?</p>
<p>I'm glad you asked, since that *IS* what this page is about.
:)</p>
<hr>
<p>I had heard of The Cure, of course.  But, as you may know from
other sections of my page, I had ignored popular radio during the
majority of the '80's, so I never heard "Just Like Heaven" or
"Lovesong" on the radio when they were getting massive airplay.
Basically, all I knew was the name "The Cure".</p>
<hr>
<p>A friend of mine, Eric Grizzle (dude, if you're reading this, drop
me a line!), had started listening to them during our sophomore year
of high school.  (This would be the '89-90 school year)  But it wasn't
until Fall of '90 that I actually got exposed to them.  He finally had
me listen to one of their songs.  He prefaced it by saying that it was
one of their "best" songs, and kept going off on how great it was.
And honestly....  I thought it was awful.  What song?  "I'm Cold", b-
side from "Jumping Someone Else's Train", first song on the b-side
portion of <u>Standing On A Beach</u>.  "I'm Cold" is still one of my
least favorite Cure songs.</p>
<hr>
<p>After this, though I had had a passing interest in The Cure, to be
honest, I wasn't really ready to give their stuff a shot any more.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, Eric and I both started getting interested in DJing,
particularly for dances.  And we would put together compilation tapes,
let the other person borrow them and listen to them, and critique our
choices and our presentation of the material.  (Combinations of songs,
things like that)  Well, on one of the tapes Eric put together, what
should appear but... "The Walk [Everything Mix]", which had just been
released.  And when I heard it, I fell in love with that song.  It was
easily the best song on the tape he had put together.  So I started
borrowing Cure albums from him.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first one I bought was <u>Mixed Up</u>, to get my beloved "The
Walk [Everything Mix]".  And I've continued building the collection
ever since.  It is by no means complete, and probably never will be
complete.  But I'm trying, and that's the important thing, right?
Right.  :)</p>

<title>Depeche Mode History</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#FFFFFF vlink=#00FFFF link=#00FF00> 
<center><h1>A <img src = ../img/dm.jpg alt="[depeche mode]" align=middle> History</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>The band originally formed in 1980 under the name of <i>Composition Of 
Sound</i>.  It was comprised of Vince Clarke, Martin Gore, and Andrew 
Fletcher.  After a fateful gig, at which their reception was incredibly 
poor, they decided to look into hiring a lead singer.</p>
<p>They found the man they wanted in David Gahan.  After hearing him 
perform David Bowie's "Rebel, Rebel," they knew that he was the perfect 
lead for them. Dave Gahan was brought into the band, and soon after, the 
name was changed to Depeche Mode.</p>
<p>Quick side note: Though Sire Records proclaims on it's CD releases of 
the first four Depeche Mode albums in America that the name "Depeche 
Mode" means "fast fashion," this is not true.  This was a sloppy job of 
translation.  The name properly translates to "fashion dispatch" - or 
"fashion news" - which makes a lot of sense when you consider that they 
took it from the name of a fashion magazine.  Yes, the band just liked 
the sound of the name, they didn't care what it meant.  :)</p>
<hr>
<p>So the original lineup of the band had been chosen.  Martin, Andy, and 
Vince played keyboards and Dave sang.  Vince wrote most of the songs, 
plus they performed a few covers.  The remaining couple of songs were 
written by Martin.  (There are also a few songs that are generally 
credited to Vince, but the validity of this is somewhat in the air, as 
they were never officially recorded)</p>
<p>The first song released by Depeche Mode was "Photographic."  It was 
released on a compilation album entitled <u>Some Bizarre Album</u>, on 
the Some Bizarre label.  Other artists on this compilation include Soft 
Cell and Fad Gadget (?).  (I personally do not own this album, so would 
like some confirmation on this point.  I should probably just check the 
FAQ... :))</p> 
<hr>
<p>Soon after this, Depeche Mode "signed" on to Mute Records.  I use 
quotes there, due to the fact that it would be about six years before the 
band would actually have a signed contract with the label.</p>
<p>Anyways, after signing to Mute, they released their first single, 
"Dreaming Of Me."  This song peaked on the charts at 57, but the band 
wasn't about to give up.  Their second single ("New Life") charted 
better, and the third one ("Just Can't Get Enough") broke into the top 
ten.  These were soon followed up with the debut album, <u>Speak & 
Spell</u>.  It featured nine original Vince Clarke compositions, along 
with two Martin Gore compositions ("Tora! Tora! Tora!" and "Big Muff").</p>
<hr>
<p>Soon after the album's release, Vince Clarke announced that he would 
leave the band at the end of the touring for it.</p>
<p>Vince left the band around the end of 1981.  But did this signal the 
end of Depeche Mode?  Not hardly.  The remaining trio decided to keep at 
it, and recorded a new single, "See You," written by Martin.  The song was 
quickly a hit in the UK, proving that Depeche Mode would continue on 
without Vince, who had gone on to form Yazoo.  (More information on what 
happened to Vince can be found on my <a href="../erasure">Erasure</a> 
page)</p> 
<hr>
<p>The single was followed by another tour, known as the See You tour.  
It was during this tour that Depeche Mode originally brought in Alan 
Wilder, for the benefit of filling out the stage performance only.  They 
needed the third keyboardist playing, so Alan was brought in, though he 
wouldn't officially join the band for a while.</p>
<p>The next single, "The Meaning Of Love," was introduced to the 
audiences during this tour.  One more single would be released, "Leave In 
Silence," prior to the album's release.</p>
<hr>
<p><u>A Broken Frame</u> was the only album released by Depeche Mode as a 
trio.  Officially, Depeche Mode was only Dave, Martin, and Andy on this 
album. Though the extent of Alan's influence is unknown, it is clearly 
present on this album.  During the tour for the album, Alan was announced 
to have officially joined the band.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first release by the band to officially feature Alan on it was the 
"Get The Balance Right!" single.  It featured, as a b-side, a song 
entitled "The Great Outdoors!," which he also co-wrote with Martin.</p>
<hr>
<p>After another single, ("Everything Counts") the band released it's 
first album with Alan, the aptly named <u>Construction Time Again</u>.  It 
seemed as if the band was again trying to figure itself out.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <u>Speak & Spell</u> was firmly in a "bubble-gum 
pop" sound, whereas <u>A Broken Frame</u> was slipping quickly into a new 
kind of melancholic pop.  <u>Construction Time Again</u> seems to follow 
this trend, but involves reconstructing the musical structures, since 
<u>A Broken Frame</u> was very stripped down.  The album also embraces a 
large range of topics, from political to environmental to sexual.</p>
<hr>
<p>The tenth Depeche Mode single, "People Are People," proved to be their 
biggest hit yet, even reaching the top ten in America.  To capitalize on 
this success, a "new" album was released in North America, entitled 
<u>People Are People</u>.  This album featured a selection of songs from 
the previous two albums and their associated singles, in addition to 
"People Are People" and "Get The Balance Right!" (which wasn't released 
on any album).</p> 
<hr>
<p><u>Some Great Reward</u> was the fourth true album from Depeche Mode 
and was released in 1984.  (Remember, <u>People Are People</u> was simply 
a compilation of some previous singles, b-sides, and album tracks.)  This 
album features such songs as "Somebody" (a classic Depeche Mode slow 
song) and "Blasphemous Rumours." (which is not looked on too kindly by a 
lot of more fundamentalist Christians), along with "People Are People".</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1985, two new singles were released, "Shake The Disease" and "It's 
Called A Heart."  Also released at this time was the greatest hits album 
package of <u>The Singles 81 --) 85</u> and <u>Catching Up With Depeche 
Mode</u>.  The former one was released everywhere but North America and 
Japan, and features the a-sides of all of Depeche Mode's singles.  The 
latter one was released in North America and Japan, and featured most of 
the a-sides plus a couple of b-sides.  <u>The Singles 81 --) 85</u> also 
featured various pieces of commentary from critical reviews of each 
single.  One of my personal favorites is the clip from an unfavorable 
review of "Leave In Silence":  "I've heard more melody coming from Kenny 
Wheeler's arsehole."</p> <hr>
<p>The next year saw the release of "Stripped" and "But Not Tonight", the 
first single (and b-side) for the <u>Black Celebration</u> album.  In 
America, "Stripped" wasn't doing very well, so Sire Records decided to 
flip the single, and made "But Not Tonight" the a-side and "Stripped" the 
b-side.  Ironically, though, "But Not Tonight" never even made it to the 
Hot 100.</p>
<p>"A Question Of Lust" reinstated Depeche Mode's chart success, at least 
as far as America was concerned.  Other bands wouldn't think this as 
being that big of a hit, but considering that in 24 singles, only 5 have 
made it into the American Top 40, and this was only the second one, it 
made a significant contribution.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next album would be the ironically titled <u>Music For The 
Masses</u>, which was preceded by the singles of "Strangelove" and 
"Never Let Me Down Again."  The title was intended as a joke about how 
the band had never achieved any kind of widespread popularity.  The joke 
was on Depeche Mode, however, as sales for the album soared.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next came the live album and video, <u>101</u>.  Recorded during the 
<i>Concert For The Masses</i> tour, at the 101st stop of the American 
leg. The set includes most of <u>Music For The Masses</u> along with a 
number of songs from earlier albums (though nothing from <u>A Broken 
Frame</u>).  It also marked one of the final performances of "Just Can't 
Get Enough," as this song was retired at the end of the tour.</p>
<p>Rumors abound about some of the circumstances surrounding this 
concert. Apparently, the weather was fine and clear (the show was 
recorded at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California) up until the beginning 
of "Blasphemous Rumours" when the sky suddenly opened with rain.  This 
rainfall then ended after the song.  Various technical problems also have 
been said to abound during this show.  However, that doesn't change the 
fact that this is generally looked at by most Depeche Mode fans as being 
the greatest of live recordings of Depeche Mode.</p>
<hr>
<p>Depeche Mode vanished from the scenes for a while.  Alan Wilder had 
released two solo albums, <u>1 + 2</u> (1984) and <u>Hydrology</u> (1986) 
under the moniker of <i>Recoil</i>, and Martin Gore had released his own 
<u>Counterfeit EP</u> (1988).  In 1989, the band returned to the scene 
with a changed sound.</p>
<p>"Personal Jesus" was the first single released from the 
<u>Violator</u> album.  Suddenly, Depeche Mode reached into the American 
Top 40 again.  But could this success be repeated?</p>
<hr>
<p>The question was answered with the next single, "Enjoy The Silence."  
Now, Depeche Mode reached number 2 in the charts - breaking their previous 
peak of number 8 with "People Are People". (Remember, we're talking about 
the <b>American</b> charts here.  The European charts differ somewhat)  
Had the American public finally decided to recognize the artistry of Depeche 
Mode, a band coming up on their tenth anniversary?</p>
<hr>
<p><u>Violator</u> then hit shelves and was a commercial success.  The 
third single, "Policy Of Truth," also did well.  The video almost reached 
number one on MTV (America), but fell just short at number two.</p>
<p>A fourth single, "World In My Eyes," was released, but didn't fare 
very well.</p>
<hr>
<p>The <i>World Violation</i> tour occured from 1990 until 1991.  After 
the tour, the band vanished from sight again.  Alan released another 
Recoil album, <u>Bloodline</u> in 1992.</p>
<hr>
<p>But where had Depeche Mode gone?  In 1992, they released their first 
new song since the b-sides for "World In My Eyes."  This song, "Death's 
Door," was featured on the soundtrack of the Wim Wenders film <u>Until 
The End Of The World</u>.  It was to represent how the band felt they 
would sound come the year 2000. (this was a premise that was told to all 
the artists that participated in the project)  Interestingly enough, this 
is one of those handful of songs that Martin sings, rather than Dave.</p>
<hr>
<p>In early 1993, a new single was released from Depeche Mode, "I Feel 
You," which was the lead off single for the new album, <u>Songs Of Faith 
And Devotion</u>.  Though it did break into the American Top 40, it 
didn't break into the Top 20.</p>
<p>"Walking In My Shoes" also fell behind the success of prior singles, 
not breaking into the American Top 40.  "Condemnation," the third single, 
went unnoticed by many, and even more people overlooked the release of the 
fourth (and final) <u>Songs Of Faith And Devotion</u> single, "In Your 
Room."</p> 
<hr>
<p>American MTV also went as far as to place a ban on the video for "In 
Your Room."  The reasoning behind this is yet to be determined, as they 
have since shown the video for Madonna's "Human Nature" which is 
definitely more explicit than "In Your Room."  (I'm sorry if any Madonna 
fans want to disagree, but spanking a leather-clad chihuahua is 
decidedly more sexually explicit (and deviant) than a person whose wrists 
are chained to the arms of a chair)</p> 
<hr>
<p>Then, on the first of June 1995, Alan Wilder officially withdrew from 
the band, citing that the band just didn't recognize his contributions 
to the songs and give him the credit he deserved and that he was tired of 
feeling like they were taking advantage of him.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the present, it is unknown what will happen to Depeche Mode, though 
rumors are abounding.  All that has been released by Mute Records is a 
simple statement that Martin is writing songs and that he, Dave, and Andy 
plan to continue recording as a trio.</p>

<title>Kylis' Depeche Mode Story</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<center><h1>Kylis' <img src=../img/dm.jpg alt="[depeche mode]" align=middle> Story</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>Yes, this is how I got into Depeche Mode.  Actually, it's probably a 
little different than some of the stories you would hear after talking to 
various dM fans.  But then again, it's rather similar at the same time.</p>
<p>Confused yet?  Yes?  Good.  :)  I love confusing people.  See, there's
certain similarities in my personal dM story to other people's stories, and
certain differences too.  But enough idle chit-chat.  Here's the story.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first Depeche Mode song that I heard on the radio (and knew it was
them) was "Personal Jesus," and I did <b>not</b> like it very much.  I 
thought it was a very poor song, not to mention the fact that I wasn't into the 
top 40 type of scene at that time.  (I was listening more to "album-oriented rock"
and oldies stations, though I was only 15 years old)</p>
<p>One of my good friends in high school, James, was a big Depeche Mode fan.
I remember he was talking about them one day in one of our classes, and I 
just started ripping the band apart.  Don't remember what I said, but I 
remember I didn't look on them too kindly.</p>
<p>I slowly started listening to Top 40 stations, and soon, along came "Enjoy
The Silence."  After I heard it a few times, I had grown to like it, then
found out who it was - Depeche Mode.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, change of heart time.  I went back to James, and asked if I could
borrow the album with "Enjoy The Silence" on it.  Of course, he had it, but
instead of lending me <u>Violator</u>, he lent me <u>Catching Up With Depeche
Mode</u> and I quickly fell in love with it.  I also realized that I'd heard
two of the other songs on it on the radio before and liked them - "New Life"
and "Just Can't Get Enough" - but had never known who'd done them.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, I borrowed a few more albums from him.  Namely, <u>Speak & Spell</u>,
<u>Some Great Reward</u>, <u>Black Celebration</u>, and <u>Music For The
Masses</u>.  On top of that, I got <u>101</u> and <u>Violator</u> from the
local library system.  And I loved it all.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first dM album I bought was <u>Violator</u>.  Though I looked at it
differently then, I now think of it as being their weakest album.  I also
looked on <u>Black Celebration</u> as one of the weakest albums at that time,
but think of it as their strongest now.  I think shifts in perspective like
that can be rather interesting.</p>
<hr>
<p>During my senior year of high school, I got a CD player for Christmas, but
my parents didn't get me any CDs to go along with it.  So, I had to go 
out and buy some CDs to give my CD player some sort of purpose.  And what was the
first CD I bought?  Well, it's actually a little hard to say, because I  bought
three CDs that day - <u>Construction Time Again</u>, <u>Black Celebration</u>,
and <u>Music For The Masses</u>, obviously all by dM.</p>
<p>Time marches on, and I started collecting the singles in addition to the
albums.  First picked up the <u>Violator</u> singles, then saw the singles box
set.  I wanted it, but my parents wouldn't let me pull the money out of the
bank to get it, so I settled on just picking up a couple of the discs separately.  
I got "Get The Balance Right!" and "Everything Counts" this way.</p>
<hr>
<p>By my first year of college, I'd stopped seeing the box set anywhere, and
realized I'd probably never see it again.  So, when I happened to come across
it at a record store near where I lived, I almost had a heart attack.  
$90 for 18 CDs?  I hesitated.  For one month.  Then, I felt I could afford it, so I
got it.  And it was more than worth it.  I was hearing songs I'd never heard
of before.  I was hearing remixes that were better than I could've imagined.
That set sated my appetite for new dM material for quite a while.</p>
<p>I must admit, though, that I made several dM collecting mistakes while I
was there.  Passed up several very nice 12" vinyls throughout that year, 
along with some very rare CDs, just because I didn't realize just how rare they
actually were.  Some of those I almost picked up, but thought, "Well, 
I'll see them again."  Wouldn't you know it, I haven't.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Well, that's really more than you probably wanted to know, now, isn't it?
:)  Ah well, I've got a somewhat captive audience, so I can get away with
it.</p>
<hr>
<p>But that really tells most all of the story.  Didn't hear about "I Feel
You" until a good month or so after it was released because I was living 
in an area of Oregon with no good radio stations and I didn't have MTV, so I only
found out about it when I came across the single in a local shop.  Snapped it
up and ran back to the dorm with it and tormented my roommate (who disliked
Depeche Mode) with it.  Got <u>Songs Of Faith And Devotion</u> as soon as I
could afford it after it was released.</p>
<p>That fall, I finally got to see a Depeche Mode concert, in Seattle, on the
first leg of the Devotional tour.  Even though I was practically at the back
wall of the Seattle Center Colliseum, surrounded by people who didn't know
"Everything Counts" from "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (well, maybe not that bad,
but you get the picture), I still enjoyed the show.</p>
<hr>
<p>I guess that finally wraps up the story.  Not much else to say now.  
I'm a collector, a hard-core fanatic, and this just seemed like an appropriate next
step.  :)</p>

<title>depecheMODE Track Collector's Reference</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffff00 link=#00ffff alink=#ff1493 vlink=#ff00ff>
<center><h1><font color=#da70d6>depecheMODE</font></h1>
<h3>Track Collectors Reference</h3></center>
<hr>
<p>Below is a table, covering the important items towards acquiring a complete collection of Depeche Mode tracks.  A few <font color=#ffffff><I><b>IMPORTANT</b></I></font> notes before we begin, though.</p>
<p>On a large number of the singles listed below, you will see a designation of "Box Set CD."  In the UK and in the US there were a set of 3 box sets released, each featuring 6 CD singles.  In the US, this box set is out of print and will not be reissued (based on what I've heard).  Also, these CD singles were all released individually in the US and (I believe) in the UK.  In addition, four singles had CD releases at the same time, designed to look like they were from the box sets, but in actuality are separate (these are "Strangelove," "Never Let Me Down Again," "Behind The Wheel," and "Everything Counts <i>Live</i>.")  These were all released in the UK and US.  It is rumored that these were intended for a fourth box, but this rumor is unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>Also, I have compiled this list based on trying to get as many tracks as possible on CD.  Some tracks, however, are impossible to get (officially) on CD, and therefore some vinyl releases are listed below.  Also, sometimes items exist on CD but are very difficult to get ahold of - in these cases, I have tried to provide additional ways to get the same tracks, hopefully on CD.</p>
<p>I have not taken the X1 and X2 box sets into consideration in this listing, since it is incredibly rare and it is a collection of tracks from singles rather than a collection of singles.</p>
<p>All releases on the below list are either UK, US, Japanese, or German (and one Canadian promotional 7").  No other countries releases are <b><i>NEEDED</i></b> to complete a track collection - however, when duplicate releases exist in other countries, feel free to substitute however you may  wish.  Just be careful of <b><i>NON</i></b>-duplicate releases, as they make the collection a little more difficult.  For assistance on this, please consult either Louis van Dompselaar's excellent discography (available from multiple places on the Internet) or Stephan Moernaut's Collectors Reference.</p>
<p>On the pages for these single releases, you will notice color-coded asterisks marking whether a track is an "exclusive" track or a "non-exclusive, needed" track.  This does not count tracks which are available on a regular pressing of an album.  Therefore, since the 7" version of "Dreaming Of Me" was included on the US version of <u>Speak & Spell</u>, it is not marked as an "exclusive" or a "non-exclusive, needed" track (even though I recommend the UK <u>Speak & Spell</u> over the US one).</p>
<hr>
<p>Also remember this note about UK releases: A "CD" release is a regular pressing of a CD, and is most commonly available.  An "LCD" is a limited edition release, and therefore is more likely to be difficult to come by.  And lastly, and "XLCD" is an "extra limited" release, and the hardest to find (usually).  In regards to the vinyl UK releases, the same pattern is used, just substitute the number "12" for the "CD".</p>

<hr>
<p>I believe this about covers it.  Books, posters, shirts, and other types of memorabilia are not covered here, because it would get really out of hand.  Also, I'm primarily only concerned with the music.  I also only list officially released items, as the availability (and quality) of bootlegs is incredibly variable.  I also have not included cover versions of Depeche Mode songs because (in my opinion) they don't count as being Depeche Mode tracks (since it is not Depeche Mode performing the songs in question).</p>
<p>In addition, there are other ways to achieve the collection than what I've listed above.  I'm simply listing what I believe to be the smallest number of items in order to accomplish a complete track collection for a beginning Depeche Mode collector.  So if you've already started a Depeche Mode track collection and find that I vary in my above listing from what you've done (which I myself have also done), don't worry.  It's still possible.  It's just that it'll mean acquiring more items for fewer tracks (in most cases).  If you can come up with a better combination of items for a particular release, please let me know, and I'll make any adjustments necessary.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyone with further information on any of these subjects may feel free to <a href="../mail.html">drop me an email</a> and let me know.  I wish to make this as complete as possible for music releases by Depeche Mode.</p>

<h5>Reviewed 31 December 1995 by Kylis</h5>
<br>
<p><u>Erasure</u> is the seventh full length album that Erasure has put
out in their ten years of existance.  1985 saw the duo hit the scene
with <u>Wonderland</u>, a classic synthpop album, featuring such songs as
"Who Needs Love Like That" and "Oh L'amour".  Vince Clarke, veteran of
Depeche Mode and Yaz, had partnered up with a new vocalist, who could
sing along the same lines as Yaz's Alison Moyet (compare Yaz's "Don't
Go" and Erasure's "Who Needs Love Like That") and The Assembly's
Feargal Sharkey (compare The Assembly's "Never, Never" with Erasure's
"My Heart...  So Blue").  (For those who don't know, The Assembly was
another of Vince Clarke's side projects in the time from the end of
Yaz to the inception of Erasure)</p>
<p>The band went on to release <u>The Circus</u> and finally had a
successful album in the US with <u>The Innocents</u>, which features their
two best known songs, "Chains Of Love" and "A Little Respect".  The
followup album, <u>Wild!</u>, would swing them back into the underground,
and <u>Chorus</u> would primarily serve to keep them there.  <u>I Say I Say I
Say</u> saw Erasure return to American charts with the brief success of
"Always", but it was a short-lived return.</p>
<p>Their newest album, <u>Erasure</u>, is a change of direction for the
duo.  Leaving behind the short and sweet, simple and catchy, songs of
previous albums, Vince and Andy are forging into new ground.  From the
stark beginning of "Intro: Guess I'm Into Feeling" to the gradual fade
out of "A Long Goodbye", one thing is clear: this isn't the same duo
that did "Chains Of Love" - time has passed, and they have changed.</p>
<p>The album opens with "Intro: Guess I'm Into Feeling", which is a
remixed excerpt of "True Love Wars", the b-side from the "Stay With
Me" single, which led off the album.  The vocal part has been
rerecorded, simply consisting of the line "I guess I'm into feeling
higher lately, higher than I've ever been, this thing called love."
From the slow fade in, through the slow addition of parts to the song,
all the way to the climax, we are reminded that this is not a typical
Erasure album.  This is not going to be full of short, simple, catchy,
pop songs - we are listening to a work of art.</p>
<p>"Rescue Me" harkens back to the Erasure of yesteryear, while still
keeping the feel of the new Erasure.  With an incredibly infectious
hook, this could do well as a single - however, American radio
probably wouldn't give it much of a chance.  Like most of the songs on
the album, this feels like it was originally written and recorded in a
three to four minute version, then remixed to a six minute length.
However, it works.  In fact, all of the songs on the album work in
this way.  None of them feel like they are *TOO* long.  "Intro: Guess
I'm Into Feeling" even feels like it's not long enough.  (And
considering that CDs can hold about 80 minutes, they had another 9
minutes worth of space to play with....)  Very upbeat song -
definitely worthy of being remixed.  However, considering the chances
of it being a single are so slight, this probably won't happen.</p>
<p>"Sono Luminus" hits us in the head with another reminder that this
is not the typical Erasure album.  The ambient opening strains of the
song seem unusual for Erasure.  And the gentleness of the music, even
for an Erasure ballad, is taken almost to an extreme.  This is also
the first spot on the album in which we hear any indication of the
power of Andy's falsetto.</p>
<p>Seeing as how this is an Erasure album, the fact that the next
song is an upbeat, disco-y, dancefloor number shouldn't come as a
surprise.  "Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)", the current single,
is an excellent reminder of just how well these guys can write a song
for the dancefloor.  It was originally released on the _Wigstock_
soundtrack under the title of "Cold Summer's Day", and had some
different lyrics to the version presented here.  As a single, "Fingers
& Thumbs" seems to me to be relegated to obscurity, though, which also
points to the idea that a "Rescue Me" single is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>But "Fingers & Thumbs" isn't only a disco-y dancefloor number.
There's also a slow middle-break in the song, in which the song starts
to go ambient for a minute or two.  And, to Vince Clarke's credit, the
transitions into and out of the ambient section come off flawlessly,
without sounding like a disruption to the song.</p>
<p>"Rock Me Gently" is the third (and most-likely final) single for the 
album.  And it is most likely doomed to completely miss the charts.  Not 
to say that it isn't a good song or anything - it is.  It's just hard to see
it having much commercial appeal.  Especially since the most distinctive 
part of this song, the thing that makes it sound out the most from the 
rest of the album, is the middle six minutes of the track which will be 
edited from a single version.  The entire track is over ten minutes long, 
which really excludes it from airplay on popular radio.  The middle 
portion of the song, which transitions into a very ambient realm, clearly 
the most ambient portion of the disc, is the most striking part of the 
disc, primarily due to the fact that Erasure has never gotten quite so 
ethereal.  Even Diamanda Galas' wailing can't truly diminish from the 
song.</p>
<p>After the epic "Rock Me Gently", "Grace" is a bit of a let down.
Having read the lyrics for this song and also hearing discussion of
the song prior to actually hearing it, it didn't match up to my
expectations of the song.  It's good, but it's probably the weakest
spot of the album.  The complaints I heard, which were primarily about
the line "Where's the sense in senseless violence?", didn't equal the
same complaints that I have with the song.  My problem is that I
expected a more upbeat track, and this is very laid back.</p>
<p>The lead off single for the album follows "Grace".  "Stay With Me"
is a very unusual arrangement for Erasure, featuring both synthesizer
and piano in an oddly syncopated rhythm.  This song feels the most
like it was intended to be a four minute track and then stretched to
seven minutes, with needless repetitions of the chorus at the end of
the song.  But this is probably due to the fact that a four minute
edit of the song was released about a month and a half prior to the
album, and about three months before I got the album.</p>
<p>Featuring backing vocals by Andy's lover, "Love The Way You Do So"
is an intriguing ballad.  It's hard for me to give a very strong
impression of this track, as it hasn't really sunk in for me yet.  It
seems like a song that you just have to listen to and listen to and
let it grow on you.  Not a bad thing.  In fact, it'll probably grow to
be one of my favorites on the album because of this.</p>
<p>My other favorite song on the album, ranking just under "Rescue
Me", is "Angel".  Diamanda Galas' vocals on the introduction to the
song are a wee bit annoying, but can be ignored without too much
trouble.  It's a very strong, upbeat song, and would actually be a
better choice as a single than "Rock Me Gently", due to the fact that
the ambient-esque introduction to the song really doesn't add anything
to it and could easily be removed without losing anything, unlike the
ambient portion of "Rock Me Gently".  The song also utilizes a trick
Andy makes use of in several spots on the album, adding lines into the
chorus, or changing the lines of the chorus, each time he repeats it.</p>
<p>"I Love You" is actually a somewhat misleading title for the next
song, in my opinion.  Thematically, the song seems to hold more in
common with their song "Waiting For Sex" (b-side to "Am I Right?" (UK)
or "Breath Of Life" (US)) than it does to, say, "Always".  This is
also the most obviously synthesized song.  ("WHAT???")  By that, I
mean that it is most obviously done using computers and synthesizers
rather than using, say, an electronic piano.  There are a lot of
anomalous blips and tweets in the background, particularly during the
first verse and bridge.  These blips and tweets are so clearly
artificial, that they couldn't have come from anything but a computer.</p>
<p>To end the album, we have "A Long Goodbye".  In some ways, it is
reminiscent of <u>Chorus</u>'s "Home", primarily in the vocal delivery.
Along with "Rescue Me" and "Angel", this song rounds out my top three
picks for the album.  "A Long Goodbye" also serves as a perfect song
to end the album on, being at once the most typically Erasure song and
at the same time, the least typical Erasure song on the album.  A
vague statement, true.  It is one of the most easily identifiably
Erasure songs on the album, yet at the same time, stays very distant
from any Erasure that has been seen yet.  Andy's harmonies are
stronger than ever on this song.</p>
<p>Overall, this album has, in the less than one week that I've had
it, quickly lept up into a three-way tie with <u>Wild!</u> and <u>I Say I Say
I Say</u> for my favorite Erasure album.  Only time will tell how my
rankings will proceed.  The main thing to remember with this album,
though, is that Erasure is not gone.  They are still here and stronger
than they've ever been.</p>

<title>My Erasure story</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<center><h1>My <img src="../img/erasure.jpg" alt="Erasure" align=middle> story</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>So, how did I get into Erasure?  That's what we're here to find out.</p>
<p>Unlike what I gather of a lot of Erasure fans, I was rather ignorant 
of Vince Clarke and his work prior to listening to Erasure.  So what 
happened?</p>
<hr>
<p>It goes back to 1987 or 1988, while Erasure was on tour for <u>The 
Innocents</u>.  I remember hearing a commercial for the tour on the 
radio, and hearing a couple of songs in the background that I knew and 
liked.  About a year later, after <u>Wild!</u> was released, I was at a 
local library, and saw both of the above mentioned albums.  Remembering 
the name and commercial, I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the songs I'd remembered was "Chains Of Love" - the other one, 
as far as has been determined, was by the opening act, as I've never 
heard it since.  But that was unimportant, as I loved the two albums.</p>
<hr>
<p>It actually would be a while before I bought them, but before long, I 
was collecting Erasure fairly rabidly.  My Erasure collection is only 
about half the size of my Depeche Mode collection, but primarily due to 
the sheer difficulty of finding Erasure stuff in this area.  Most of what 
I have (as far as singles go) are from <u>Pop! - The First 20 Hits</u> 
(the rereleased "Who Needs Love Like That" single) or later, and little 
before that.</p>
<hr>
<p>But, I keep looking, and that's the important thing, right?</p>

<h1>Want List</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>Okay, I'm going to take a chance, and post a list of some of the items 
that I'm currently looking for in order to fill out my Erasure collection.  
Maybe somebody that stumbles by can help me locate some of these items.  
Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>I guess thanks are due to Lazlo Nibble, whose amazing discography 
showed me just how much I was missing.  I appreciate it, Lazlo - I guess.

<p>This document is an attempt to put together a discography of
the releases of the Northern Ireland band <b>The 4 Of Us</b>.
However, I can only include items I have direct knowledge of.  So,
if you know of something that is not included on here, <i>PLEASE
LET ME KNOW!</i>
<p>Also, here is a <a href="discog.txt">text</a> version of this

<hr>
<p>All of the pictures are band pictures only.  The descriptions simply 
tell you where the picture can be found.  The band was nice and made the 
covers (at least of every item I've seen) simply state on it their name, 
the name of the item, and fill the rest of the space with a band 
picture.  Anyways, here's the pics:
<ul>
<li><a href="../img/drag1.jpg">Cover of UK "Drag My Bad Name Down" CD single</a>

<title>The 4 Of Us: Sound Files</title>

<h3><center><pre><b>Sound Files</b></pre></center></h1>
<hr>
<p>Here you will find samples of the work done by The 4 Of Us.
There are now three samples available - though two of them are
essentially the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="sound/drag.wav">Drag My Bad Name Down <i>Remix</i></a>.
This is the sample that has been here, of the single version of
"Drag My Bad Name Down."  It is also the version used on the
American release of <u>Songs For The Tempted</u>.
<li><a href="sound/drag1.wav">Drag My Bad Name Down</a>.  I've tried
to edit this one so it'll be as closely identical to the sample of
the remix as possible.  Why?  So you, the visitor to this page, can
compare this version with the remix and see what kind of things are
different.  Personally, I prefer this version to the remix.
<li><a href="sound/1strong.wav">One Strong Hammer</a>.  A live
studio recording of this song appears on both the "Mary" and the
"Drag My Bad Name Down" single - but in both cases there's a part
missing, namely one of the vocal tracks during the chorus.  This is
the album version, faded out as the second verse begins.

<title>Dream Attack - Unreleased Radio Ad</title>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 link=#0000ff alink=#ff1493 vlink=#ff0000>
<center><font color=#ff1493 size=+2>Dream Attack</font><br>
<font color=#ff1493 size=+1>Unreleased Radio Advertisement</font></center>
<hr>
<p>During the short time that Dream Attack ran on KOOP-AM, I toyed with 
the idea of putting together a commercial to promote the show with, for 
broadcast on KOOP.  I had chosen the music I would use, and had the spot 
entirely planned out, and was prepared to begin constructing the 
advertisement for broadcast in the fall, when I learned that the future 
of KOOP-AM was in trouble.</p> 
<p>I decided to shelve the idea until the future of the station had been 
decided.  Within a short time, it was decided - KOOP would not return to 
the airwaves.  And so, the commercial fell by the wayside.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently, though, I've been playing around a lot with sound editing 
and mixing, and decided that I would finally make the commercial, and put 
it up on this web page.  Why?  To prove I could do it, I guess.  I wanted 
this to see the light of day, and now it will.  Finally.  A year and a 
half has passed since I first created the concept for this spot, and it 
took me probably an hour to make it.</p>
<hr>
<p>So what you will hear (if you choose to download the ad, that is) is a 
commercial that never aired.  In fact, it never actually existed in any 
way until mid-November of 1996.  I feel pretty good about actually having 
done this.  It's like I can finally come to peace with the idea that 
Dream Attack doesn't exist any more.  In one shape or another, it was 
part of my life for 15 months (April of '94 until June of '95), and this 
is the conclusion of that.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some people may wish to know what the music contained in this 
commercial is.  Here is a listing (in order) of the songs used:</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>Depeche Mode - "Personal Jesus"
<li>Nine Inch Nails - "March Of The Pigs"
<li>Black Happy - "Three-Day Weekend (At Rancho Bebop)"
<li>Depeche Mode - "Rush <i>Spiritual Guidance Mix</i>"
<li>The Cure - "Disintegration"
<li>New Order - "Dream Attack"
<li>Smashing Pumpkins - "Disarm"

<title>Darkness</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>DARKNESS</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
The darkness comes again
Erasing my hope
  Erasing my dreams
    Erasing my love
      Erasing all that is dear to me
 
The darkness envelops me
Swallowing everything
  Destruction of all
    Complete annihilation
      Ruining the things I live for
 
It is getting darker
And the darkness
  Annihilates
    Destroys
      The darkness kills
 
The darkness grows stronger
I seek a way out
  I look around, searching
    I see nothing, nothing
      There is nothing to be seen
 
And the darkness overpowers me
I am left without hope
  All my dreams are dead
    My love has come to an end
      The things I hold dear have no meaning anymore

<title>Broken Hearts</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>BROKEN HEARTS</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Broken hearts and shattered dreams
Happens to me a lot, it seems
An endless cycle of despair
It seems that no one really cares
Sometimes.
 
A closed heart, it seems to be
Is my only defense from me
When I open up some more
The world quickly slams the door
Hurting.
 
We've known each other for a while
Now it will hurt when I see your smile
For I thought I knew you fairly well
But now I'm trapped in my lonely hell
Dying.
 
You know that we will stay friends
For true friendships have no ends
I made my heart as clear as glass
Now the hurt inside me will pass
Slowly.
          .
              .
 
I'm over the pain, but not completely
The fire smoulders and my heart beats weakly
The haze is gone, and clear are my eyes
What I felt for you is gone from our lives
Completely.
 
But the effects of this event
The aftershocks I can't prevent
They will never really go away
And I will always find it hard to say
Truthfully.
 
Because this has happened before
It's happened so many times before
And I'll never recover from anyone
It's hard to believe that I've never won
Honestly.
 
I've tried before and always been hurt
So many times been made to feel like dirt
I always seem to find the one who
Will always, without fail, say no
Destroying.
 
And now that it's over, now that it's done
I hope that someday I will find the one
That won't say no, that won't turn away
That will actually want me to say
"I love you."

<title>Always Remember</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>ALWAYS REMEMBER</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
         I will always remember the times that we have had
     Nothing can change what has been whether it's good or bad
      No matter what occurs next, we'll always have this time
     I have loved you for a while, you know my heart is thine
 
        I don't know what I can say to show my love is true
       I don't know how to express and not say "I love you"
    You see, the words do not express the depth of what I feel
        But there is no other way to show you it's for real
 
       I hope that that is enough and that it's not too much
    I don't want you to leave me - just want to feel your touch
        The more I learn about you the more it becomes true
           You know, it is hard to be separated from you

<title>Hidden Meaning</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>HIDDEN MEANING</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
It's hard for me to say some things.
Looking for my hidden meaning can
Occasionally tell you more than my words.
Very few, though, know me well
Enough to see that message inside.
You might have that special insight,
On-line with my mind, giving you a
Unique ability to see that
.

<title>Love 1</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>LOVE 1</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
It's been a while since I've seen your face,
Seen your eyes, or felt your embrace.
Sometimes I find it hard to cope
But my love for you gives me hope
That fills up the empty space.
 
If I seem to ramble on,
It's all because my logic's gone.
The mind has no place in matters of the heart,
I've known this from the very start.
Without a thought, love grows strong.
 
I'm writing this poem especially for you
And I hope it shows my love is true.
The bond we have is so great
That if we don't try, we won't escape.
The words do say it all when I say: "I love you."

<h1>FIRES</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
The fires of passion flare up inside
Burning up the kindling of friendship
And creating something new - true love
  A love that will stand the test of time
  A love that will survive the strain of distance
  A love that will steer through occasional storms of disagreement
It is only a true love that can do all this
And there is only one way to see if that love
Which you have is really a true love
  Be together for a long time
  Be together across a great distance
  Be together through disagreement
If you can do all of this
And if your love can survive this test
Then you have found your one true love
  I have found mine - that I know
  But before too long, I will have to go
  And for four years we will be apart
But I think my love for you will survive
I feel that it will stay - feel it deep in my heart
And I believe that, someday, the love we now have
  Will be stronger as it goes
  Will be renewed by separation
  Will be accentuated by trouble
And even all of this cannot stop our love
As long as we take the time to act on it
And as we do, it will never, ever die

<h1>CONTRADICTIONS</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I can still feel you in my arms
I will not let you come to harm
I care for you too much to do such a thing
I may not always be with you,
But you know that I do love you
And that love will help us to do anything
     To be together when apart
     To feel love instead of hate
     To feel joy instead of sorrow
     To look forward to each new day
The love we have will save us
It will always work to renew us
And our love can never die

<title>If I Closed My Eyes Tonight</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>IF I CLOSED MY EYES TONIGHT</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
If I closed my eyes tonight and never opened them again
The pain would still be there from what I did not want to hide
And if the world came to an end, if the stars fell from the sky
If the clouds ceased to exist and we never knew just why
If there was no one left but you and I
I still wouldn't be able to say it
Even if we both knew it to be true
I still wouldn't be able to say it
Couldn't even say that I love you
If I closed my eyes
 
I would be lost without you, even though I'm lost when you're here
When I can't be near you is when my feelings shine so clear
But once again I find myself lost with no words left to say
But if I could find those words we would find a brand new day
But I've no way to express... not today
I still wouldn't be able to say it
Even if we both knew it to be true
I still wouldn't be able to say it
Couldn't even say that I love you
If I closed my eyes
 
The pain would still be there from what I didn't want to hide
If I were to close my eyes tonight and never open them again...

<h1>I</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
              I never thought that this could happen
              I didn't think it would happen this way
            I never expected that I would feel this way
             I thought it impossible to happen so fast
              I didn't think if it did it would last
             I knew little then and have learned since
            I know that it can happen so fast, so soon
             I know that it is now, not in a blue moon
       I know that it is here to stay, at least, for a while
          I also know that it is what is making me smile
          I still can't believe what has happened, though
           I am glad that it did, hope that you are too
                I close my eyes - all I see is you
               I may not be the exactly perfect one
                I may also usually seem to be gone
           I am there for you, though, and I always will
             I hope you believe what I am saying here
          I hope that you understand that I hold you dear
           I wait for the day that I will see you again
              I know that I need to see you, and then
            I will be able to free my mind of problems
               I hope that I am right in saying this
           I hope that once again I shall feel your kiss
               I feel like I have been freed by you
                 I think that I really do need you
              I guess that's almost all I have to say
           I know there's one more thing to say, so true
                 I know that I really do love you

<title>Delusions</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>DELUSIONS</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I tell myself not to read between the lines
As there aren't always lines to read between
And I tell myself not to delude myself
But I never listen
 
I tell myself that there is more than there is
Deceiving myself seems to be my life's pursuit
But the truth always comes through
And I always hurt
 
I tell myself not to get involved, to stay clear
But it's harder than it seems, I always fall in
Ending up in hopeless situations, no way out
I get hurt again
 
I tell myself that there is always tomorrow
Tomorrow things might change, I think
But I am still in the pattern
Deluding myself
 
I thought I could break out of this self-defeatist mode
However it never seems to work that way, stuck here
Still I go along with it, always wanting out
Never getting my way

<h1>LIFE</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Life can be a futile mess
All it does is make us miserable
We pass through this life, thinking things may improve
But they never do
They never can change
It is an impossible thing for our lives to change
For our lives are us
And to change our lives, we must change ourselves
Then we are no longer ourselves, we are someone else
And then we are in their life
And we are still miserable
For life is a futile mess
And it can only make us miserable
And things can never improve
It will always be the same
We might try to change things, but we always fail
And so some think that they've found a solution
Though they actually haven't, as death accomplishes nothing

<title>"You"</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>"YOU"</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I promised myself I would not do this again
And once again I lied to myself
I do not know why this keeps happening to me
To know why, I must understand myself
And that is something that I am unable to do at this time
For the harder I try, the more I fail
And then I find myself falling into the same traps
Constantly reliving the same moment over and over
Though the fine details change the script stays the same
I always lose and "you" are always to blame
 
However, I may one day yet break the cycle
And then I shall be free
And then I will be able to see the truth about myself
And then I will be able to see the traps ahead
I won't fall again, that is my only hope
For then I will win, and "you" will lose forever
 
But is that really what I want?
Could I really want "you" to lose forever?
Maybe I do.  But it is only an image
For "you" are a stronger person than I and can easily return
And then I will face "you" on equal ground
And maybe then the charade will end
And maybe then I will see who "you" really are
And maybe then the knowledge will hurt me
But at least my mind will be laid to rest
And I will know that it is all for the best
 
But I may not truly understand, as emotion is a cruel master
Emotion can cloud our vision and show us a lie
When we try to see the truth, that's what it does to me
The emotion destroys reality and what is left
Is a self imposed delusion caused by a false emotion
A dismal picture, I know, but in my life
That has proven to be the one truly visible truth

<title>The Wall</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>THE WALL</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I wish that things would work out differently
I wish, but that changes nothing
I must come to grips with my own personal reality
However hard that that will be
I still must do it to retain sanity
And so I begin to build the wall
The wall that holds me in and keeps you out
The only way that I can remain safe and sane
Though alone
And the wall can never be broken, it will never fall
No one can tear it down and nothing can remove it
My soul will stagnate here inside
But that is the price I am willing to pay
To remain sane and safe and to never be hurt

You are my life

I can only sit here and hurt
My love has died
My life is gone
So what reason do I have to carry on?

The walls are built around me
Without your help I cannot break free
I cry out but you don't hear
I cry out but you're not there
The wall is immense I cannnot break through
And I'll be here forever without help from you
If you hear my cry give me an answer
If you hear me please let me know
I can only give my love to you
If I am released from this prison
But I cannot do this alone
I am forced to remain for you do not respond
There is no chance for me now
I am forced to die in this cell
You will never know the difference
To you I'll be unchanged
But inside there will be nothing

<h1>TIME PASSES</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Time passes
My heart burns brightly
But with it sheltered
It can only last so long
And so I speak
The shelter is smashed open
The fire flares up
And you put it out
Immediately I begin to rebuild
And the embers of my heart glow weakly
The shelter is rebuilt
The embers die
Time passes

<title>The Bond</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>THE BOND</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I am here, alone
Though I have friends, it changes nothing
For I am without you
And no one understands what that means
     Including me
Nothing like this has happened to me before
And though we have not known each other very long
We have known each other better than anyone understands
     It is on a level underneath everything
     A bond stronger than any I have known before
Things always have a reason for happening
And though we know not the reason
It will become clear
     This we know
No one understands our bond
It doesn't matter what people think
It doesn't matter that they don't understand
All that matters is what is

<h1>QUESTIONING</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I always thought
     How long must I wait?
And now I have that thought again
     How long will it be?
However, I am waiting for something else now
     How long until we see each other again?
Then it was waiting to meet one like you
     How long?
Now it is until I see you again
     How much must we bear?
It is difficult
     How heavy is this burden?
To be apart from each other
     How hard will it be?
For such a long time
     How much more?
No matter how difficult this is
</pre>

<title>Being Hurt</title>

<h1>BEING HURT</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I've been hurt so many times
However
I don't see you doing that to me
I know you better than anyone else
For we have this connection that no one understands
We can say anything
And know our secrets are safe
I can give you my heart
And know that it won't be broken
 
Our relationship is the most incredible thing in the world to me
And I know it is for you too
Know that you can trust me
I will not hurt you
I won't let you be harmed

<title>Love 2</title>

<h1>LOVE 2</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Why is it so hard
To be apart from you?
We've only known each other a short time
So why do I miss you
As much as I do?
It is hard to say
There is so much going on here that we do not understand
Why did things happen the way they did?
We can't tell
Our connection goes deeper than words
                    deeper than emotion
Down to the very core of our souls
How else can we explain this?
How else can we explain --
Why
  I miss you so much
Why?
I think I have learned the answer
 
I love you

<h1>TIME</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Time moves so slowly
   And all we can do is wait
      And all we can do is look forward
         And still we wait
            Until we can be together again
               Until I see you once more
                 And time moves so slowly
                   As if it moved not at all
                     And I wait
                       In breathless anticipation
                        I wait
                         And I know
                          That you do likewise
                          And I know
                           That all we can do is wait
                           And time slows down
                            And almost seems to stop
                            Yet it moves on
                            And soon
                                        We shall be together again

<title>A Hole In The Wall</title>

<h1>A HOLE IN THE WALL</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
There are many people that I know
But none of them know me
     Except for you
Why is it that I can show you things
That I won't let anyone else see?
 
The wall now has a hole in it
A hole which you are looking through
     To see the real me
And the others don't see that hole
And I feel like that is good
 
For it means that what we have
Is all the more special
For it exists only between us
And that keeps it alive

<h1>MILES</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Your arms are still around me
Even though we are miles apart
I can still feel the touch of your lips
Against mine - miles apart though we are
I hear your voice
During every waking moment
Though it has been a while since we talked
I see your face in my mind
 
But all of this cannot hope to replace
The actuality of you
 
I cannot wait to see you again
              to hold you again
              to kiss you again
              just to be with you again
That is all I care about anymore
To be with you
               the girl I love

<h1>DAZE DAYS</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I go through my days
In a daze
Concentrating on what I am here for
Is difficult at times
I do the work given to me
But it's harder than it used to be
You fill my mind
And I can't think of anything else
I see things
Which conjure images of you
I hear things
Which remind me of your voice
At times I can let my mind wander
But it doesn't leave you
When I left, part of me stayed with you
And part of you came with me
And though miles and miles apart
We are together
Every moment of every day

<h1>WINTER</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I walk along the streets
Through the bitter cold of winter
It is something I used to find comforting
But I have changed
I'm not that man anymore
I have grown
I have learned
And, most importantly
I have loved
And I am loved in return
By the one woman who appreciates me
One woman who understands me
I feel a chill
And I look into my heart
No
   The cold is not there
In my heart there is a fire
The fire of love
And it burns for her
    it keeps me warm
    it keeps me ALIVE
Without love
             we cannot live
But we are both alive
More alive than ever before
Because we love stronger than ever before
We may be physically cold
But we shall never again have cold hearts

<hr>

Love
Sleep pulls at my eyes
And if I close them, I see your face
                     I see you standing before me
Most importantly, though, I see you
 
You are the most important person in my life
I give you everything in me
I give you all of me
I can hold nothing back from you
 
I look forward to the day
When I will be standing at your side
     I can take your hand in mine
           put my arms around you
And, holding you close, give you a kiss
Like I should be doing now
 
I miss you so much, my love
And it grows more difficult with each passing moment
But I know that soon
The waiting will be over
And I will hold you
                    And kiss you
And I will tell you how much I love you

<title>Hope</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>HOPE</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
I lie alone in the darkness,
Wishing I could once again be by your side.
And in the passing night,
Something happens inside of me.
What is happening with us?
Reality crashes in -
Or does it just creep
Night after night, day to day,
Going further into the future?
More changes with every moment
And I find some things still the same.
I don't know what is going to happen -
Just what I would like to happen.
And that makes it harder.
But time won't let us forget.
Unless we face what has happened,
Then we can never truly be happy.
Is there more to what's happening here and now?
Looking around, I don't know for sure.
Only thing I know is how I feel -
Very confused at times,
Eager to see things resolved.
Yes, our lives are changing.
Over time, we have become new people.
Useless fighting has ended - and friendship has been renewed.
Some things don't change, though,
Till time has taken it's course.
I was wrong then.
Lots of things had me confused.
Life has cleared things and brought us to where we are now.

<title>Solace</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>SOLACE</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Sleep dances in the corner of my eyes
I lie in bed, thinking of things that must be done
Papers
Tests
Life
And though I'm tired to death
I cannot sleep
 
My mind is fixed on something
Something which keeps me from achieving
That peace
Found only in the quiet rest
 
I try to grasp what it is
I try to find what it is
Yet it escapes me
Slips through my fingers
Like the empty seconds in which I lie awake
 
It would be so much easier
If my love was here
So much easier to fall asleep in her arms
So much easier than when I'm alone
 
She brings a peace to me
A peace I cannot find alone
It rises from inside of her
Lifts itself from her soul
Encompasses me
And grants me solace in the storm
 
She is away from me
And the storm, such as it is
Rages silently in my head

<title>In Memoriam: Robert</title>
<body bgcolor=#000000 text=#ffffff vlink=#00ffff link=#00ff00>
<h1>IN MEMORIAM: ROBERT</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Several years ago, a man came into this boy's life
A man who was a teacher
              a father
              a friend
The man touched the boy's life
He gave the boy the will to live
                the will to fight
                the will to be himself
Things change fast over time
The boy is also a man
The man had grown older
                        but remained a friend to the boy
There was a feeling of love the boy had for the man
A second father, if you will
The boy stands on the verge of a new life
                                 new possibilities
But the man has passed from this world
The boy looks ahead, to see where to go
He knows in his heart
                      that the man would be proud

<title>The Life Of Riley</title>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 vlink=#ff0000 link=#0000ff>
<img src=../img/riley.gif alt="[The Life Of Riley]">
<hr>
<p>April 15, 2010</p>
<p>My name is Riley, and I am a chimp/human crossbreed.  My
friends, all crossbreeds, are Freddy Krougape, Billy Bob,
Cookaberra, and Whitey.</p>
<p>I'm a normal chimp/human, if you can call that normal.  We
chimp/humans stick together.  At least the ones I know do.
Freddy, Billy Bob, Cookaberra, Whitey, and I kind of stick
together.  This is evident when you consider what happened about
13 years ago.  This is when I met Whitey.</p>
<p>Freddy and I worked at the COA (<b>C</b>himp
<b>O</b>rganization of <b>A</b>merica).  We were tired of that.
Then it came.  The chance to become President and Vice-President
of the COA.  Freddy ran for President and I for Vice-President.
Since it was mainly humans voting, we were expected to lose.  At
the polls, only chimps entered.  We expected to win, but that was
for a short time.  Then the humans came.  Now we were afraid of
losing the election.  But, we won.  At the victory, I met Whitey.
As an albino chimp, he has white hair (hence his name) and pink
eyes.</p>
<p>Well, let's talk about the present.  Today was a weird day.
Every day follows the same schedule.  I get up at 5, and report to
work at the COA at 6:30.  At noon, I have lunch, and after lunch I
head to Yale University for classes, which are scheduled at
various times, but all are over by 7:00.  At 7 I have dinner, and
return to the COA.  I head back home at 10:30, and finally go to
bed again at 11.</p>
<p>What happened today, though, was not something I would like to
happen again.  Some company <u>bought</u> me.  They call
themselves the U.S.  Pioneers in Space Project.  The thing that
makes me mad is that they are not going to pay me, but the company
that <u>produced</u> me!  Another thing is that I'm being treated
like a piece of property!  My whole life will change!</p>
<hr>
<p>April 16, 2010</p>
<p>I have a new schedule to live by.  I have to get up at 4 now,
and be at work at Greyhawk Industries at 5.  I work for two hours,
then go to Cape Canaveral Training Center.  I get a break for
lunch at 3, dinner at 7, and get to go home at 10.</p>
<p>One thing I hate about this schedule is that I had to resign
from my position as Vice-President of COA.  Another thing about
this is that I now live in Florida.  I hate it!  It's too hot!
How would you like it if your body were covered with fur and you
<u>had</u> to wear jeans and sweaters in 100 degrees Fahrenheit
weather?  You wouldn't!</p>
<p>I made a mistake today.  The last time I ate at a public
restaurant, or even was <u>in</u> one for that matter, was about
ten years ago.  I was thrown out because my hair was too long.  I
can't help that!  It seems that humans want to do away with me and
the rest of my kind.</p>
<p>Anyways, I went into the restaurant, (Pierre's French Food.  I
<u>love</u> French food.  Especially French Fries!) and felt like
everyone was staring at me.  I started to sweat as I approached
the cash register.  "Whaddya want, Mac?" the teenage human said.
Then he saw that I was a chimp.  Now <u>he</u> was sweating
too!</p>
<p>"I'll have.." I started.</p>
<p>"<u>No Chimps Allowed!</u>" he yelled at me.  The bouncer
rushed up, grabbed me, and threw me out the door.  All the humans
laughed.  For once, I wished I was either fully chimpanzee or
fully human.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 17, 2010</p>
<p>The voting primary was tonight.  I didn't even care <u>who</u>
I voted for.  But it didn't matter.  I couldn't even enter the
polls.  They wouldn't even let me enter the polling building.  I
wish they would treat me as an equal.</p>
<p>I just hope nothing happens at tonights party.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 18, 2010</p>
<p>Disaster!  That's the only way to describe last night's party.
Me, Billy Bob, and Whitey were all there.  I'll try to recount the
events of the night.</p>
<p>When I got to the party, I saw Billy Bob and Whitey outside.
We joined company and (literally) squeezed in.  The place was jam-
packed to capacity.  Soon after entering, though, we got
separated.  The next thing I knew people were screaming over at
the refreshment bar.  I looked, and saw Whitey attacking the
table!  I groaned and moaned to myself.</p>
<p>Then Billy Bob was hanging from one of those globe things you
find in disco clubs.  You know, the balls with mirrors on them?
He was hanging from it with his right arm, and with his left arm,
he scratched his right armpit, as he screamed "AAA!  AAA!"</p>
<p>Talk about Party Animals!</p>
<p>That's all that happened.  Why's that?  Because we were thrown
out of the party.  Of all the chimp/humans I know, I am the most
civilized!</p>
<hr>
<p>April 19, 2010</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am going into space.  I am going on a large ship
called "Photon".  Why they chose this name, I'll never know.
Other than that, nothing out of the normal discrimination happened
today.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 21, 2010 (?)</p>
<p>If you thought I missed a date, you were wrong.  Last night I
was in suspended animation.  I came out of it this morning.</p>
<p>When I awoke, I noticed that I was floating.  I swam through
the air  to the rear viewing deck.  Earth was long gone.
Literally.  While we were launched, the planet was destroyed.  One
other ship escaped.  It was the "Galaxia", which was launched
right before us.</p>
<p>Our mission is to enter a black hole.  We're all scared, but we
can't go back.  There is nothing to go back to.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 22, 2010 (?)</p>
<p>We arrived at the black hole today.  Now we are so scared, we
want the things that destroyed our planet, to come and destroy
us.</p>
<p>We will enter the black hole tomorrow.  I am putting this
journal into a small cargo escape capsule, too small for a
chimp/human, and the capsule will rendezvous with the "Galaxia" in
two years.  I hope it survives the flight.  I won't survive
mine.</p>

<h5>Updated on: 4 February 1997</h5>
<hr>
<p>From Will Sperry:
<pre>
The names of some of the new songs are "Deliberate 
Freakout", "Sick", "California", "Howard Sprauge Must 
Die", and "When Dogs Collide". If you haven't heard them 
they are pretty damn cool!  The band is now on their third 
bassist. Burt left the band and they have picked a bassist 
named Jeff (I'm not sure of his last name), formerly of 
the Rhino Humpers. The band is really excited about him 
and played their first show with him after only a few 
days of practice.  I caught their show at The Cosmos in 
Belligham on January 24th, and it was one of the best 
shows I've seen them play. Finally I'm glad you updated, 
and Linda wasn't the one who sent you that last update! 
Good listening if you catch a show!
</pre>
<p>Oh, and apologies to Will for miscrediting him as my source
previously.  The information from the last news update is still available
below:</p>
<hr>
<p>Previous news:
<ul>
<li>I have decided to create my own mailing list thing for Black Happy 
and Shoveljerk.  For more information, go to <a href="http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis/coolside">http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis/coolside</a>.
<li>Excerpt from an email from (I believe) Linda Conroy (she was having troubles with getting her email address to me, so if you see this and object to my posting this, let me know, and I'll rewrite it.  (grin)<hr><pre>
Mark has left the band and gone back to Idaho. The new bassist 
is a guy named Burt (I don't remember his last name), formerly of 
Inflatable Soule.  Capricorn holds an option on their next album. 
There is a few new songs that sound really good. I'm sure you have 
heard them in concert, at least I hope so because i don't remember 
their names. I'll try and get back to you with them.</pre>
<hr>Hope you can get back in touch soon, Linda!

<hr>
<p>There are two mailing lists known of for shoveljerk.  However, I am only completely sure of the condition of one of these lists.</p>
<hr>
<p>The original shoveljerk mailing list was created by Don Jennings, to rise from the "ashes" of the old "Black Happy Geek Club" mailing list that he used to maintain.  This list was named <a href="schtuff.html">ShovelSchtuff</a>.  However, it appears to have vanished.  I don't know what the story is with it, and if anyone can fill me in, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<hr>
<p>The new mailing list is one that I have begun to maintain.  It is currently named 
<a href="../coolside/index.html">The Cool Side Of The Street</a>, and more information can be found on it's own homepage, located at 
<font color=#00ccff>http://olivier.dementia.org/~kylis/coolside</font>.

<p>Format for this document:</p>
<p>I have broken things down by the type of item.  Singles and promotional
only releases will be listed first, roughly in the order of release.
Albums will come after this, and will be followed by compilations.</p>
<p>Each section is broken down by the titles of the individual items.  After
this, you will see the abbreviation for the format of the release.  This
will be either CS or CD (Cassette or Compact Disc) right now, as I don't
believe they have released any vinyl.  Also, if the item is a promotional
item, the designation "PROMO" will come before the CS or CD designation.
A colon will be after that, followed by the country of release.  Then, in
parenthesis, the year of release, the label the release is on, and the
catalog number for the release.  Descriptions of front and back cover art
will be included, along with any additional information about the release.</p>

<p>From left to right:  Paul Hemenway, Greg Hjort, Mark Hemenway, Jim 
Bruce.  I have not yet had a chance to scan in a more recent picture of 
the band featuring Zia Uddin in Jim's place.  If anyone has a more 
recent picture and would like to donate it to this page, please let me 
know - particularly if it features the current drummer, Mike Tschigri 
(spelling?).  Or how about the newest bass player?</p>

<center><h1><font color=#1400ff>Thank You!</font></h1></center>
<hr>
<p>It has been brought to my attention that people are putting up links 
to my Black Happy and Shoveljerk pages.  I just wanted to take brief 
moment to thank those people who have done it.  Can't give you anything 
in repayment, just my gratitude.  :)</p>
<p>Just makes me glad to think that enough people think my Black Happy 
and Shoveljerk pages are good enough resources to link from their own 
pages.  Again, thank you to all of you for the support!</p>

<p>Note: There are listings on discographies and on the actual releases for "Rush <i>Wild Planet Mix - Vocal</i>" and "Rush <i>Wild Planet Mix</i>", in addition to "Rush <i>Amylnitrate Mix - Instrumental</i>" and "Rush <i>Amylnitrate Mix</i>" and "Rush <i>Nitrate Mix</i>".  There is only one "<i>Amylnitrate Mix</i>" (which is also the "<i>Nitrate Mix</i>") and there is only one "<i>Wild Planet Mix</i>".  There is no difference in the "Vocal" and "Instrumental" versions noted above.  What's the deal?  I'm not sure, but I believe that what is going on is that since these two mixes were done by the same people, that they (the mixers) had distinguished one as being "Instrumental" and one as being "Vocal".  Now, as I recall, the <i>Amylnitrate Mix</i> isn't a <b>pure</b> instrumental.  But it's definitely more instrumental than the <i>Wild Planet Mix</i> is.  The point is, there is no difference between "Rush <i>Wild Planet Mix</i>" and "Rush <i>Wild Planet Mix - Vocal</i>".  There is also no difference between any of the three named versions of "Rush <i>Amylnitrate Mix</i>".</p>

<p>Brief explanation of why I suggest this over the US version:
<ul>
<li>Only place you can get "I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead"
<li>Album versions of "New Life" and "Just Can't Get Enough" rather than the remixes (though the UK version also includes the "Just Can't Get Enough" remix as a bonus track)
<li>Slightly extended versions of "Dreaming Of Me" and "Ice Machine" included which are exclusive to this version of the album
</ul>
And the inclusion of "Shout" and the original instrumental "Any Second Now" don't hurt either.</p>

<p>For this album, the country of origin doesn't really make a difference - so go with whatever's cheaper, would be my call.  As a side note, some countries keep "Everything Counts <I>Reprise</I>" as a separate track, others put it on the same track as "And Then..." (such as the US version does).</p>

<p>This "album" was only released in North and South America and Japan.  It is a compilation of previously released tracks, which was designed to capitalize on a growing popularity that Depeche Mode were experiencing with the release of the single for "People Are People."  Also note that this release features the single versions of "People Are People" and "Leave In Silence," the album version of "Love, In Itself," the remix of "Everything Counts," plus non-album tracks "Get The Balance Right!," "Now, This Is Fun," and "Work Hard," in addition to album tracks "Told You So" and "Pipeline."</p>

</ol></blockquote>
<p>The UK version of the album features the UK <I>Extended Remix</I> of "But Not Tonight" rather than the 7" version featured here.  The UK version also includes "Breathing In Fumes" and "Black Day" as additional bonus tracks.  So, maybe the UK version would be better in some respects, but since getting the box set version of the "Stripped" single provides all four of these bonus tracks, it doesn't really matter.  Just go with whichever is cheaper/easier to get.  "But Not Tonight" is considered a bonus track because it was not intended by the band to be included on the album.  In the US, it was added on by Sire Records after they had flipped the "Stripped" single, making "But Not Tonight" the A-side.  After the US had added "But Not Tonight" to the album, the UK added their bonus tracks to their version.  (Or so I understand the story)</p>

The US version is missing some artwork that should appear underneath the CD tray - a graphic of the missing artwork is floating around on the 'net and isn't too hard to track down.</p>

<p>This cassette was released to fans after a riot broke out at a signing party for the release of <u>Violator</u> at a Los Angeles area Tower Records.  The "Interview" is more a "multimedia" program than it is an interview, piecing together song clips, interview bits, news clips, and KROQ commercials about the signing party.</p>

<pre>
Corrine, I want no opinion from you
Was it fun or just a bad thing to do?        Drag my bad name down
And while you play, I'm waiting for the day
I'll find some way to make you pay           Drag my bad name down

But then you come and you pull me around     Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
I need some food, some sleep, some company to keep
The sun, some shade, a word and a will made

And drink, my cabinet's open wide
I'll take something to make me go wild       Drag my bad name down
In truth, good fortune sets me free
Would vengeance make a killer of me?         Drag my bad name down

Wow!  Pull me around                         Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
I need some food, some sleep, some company to keep
The sun, some shade, and somebody's bed

Oh Lord, my friend's no open book
I think somebody misunderstood               Drag my bad name down
If anyone was a fool when I'm just like me
Who wants someone to make me bleed

Lull me around, drag my bad name down
And all the people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down
And all the people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down
And all the people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down

Oh Jesus                                     Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
I take some books, films
Change my ways, lies, tests, everybody

Jesus just pull me around                    Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
Would Jesus pull me around?                  Drag my bad name down
Oh Jesus

Drag my bad name down (repeat ad nauseum with lots of editing)

Lull me around

Lull me around, drag my bad name down and all the people say

Lull me around, drag my bad name down and all the people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down, oh!

<h2><center><pre><b><i>Fool For Temptation </i></b></pre></center></h2>
<hr>
<pre>
I'm just a fool for temptation, is that so wrong?
You can let go of that stand, I'm just an ordinary man
I'm just a fool for temptation, is that so wrong?
And I'll work to put it right, just don't ask me tonight

Look, relax the lectures, I'm no good at being good
Don't you think I really would resist it if I could?
I'm just a fool for temptation, is that so wrong?
You can let go of that stand, I'm just an ordinary man

When drink has done its turn
When it's much better fun to burn
When it's better at the edge of the road
When emotions run cold
When cynics cut you down
But it's much better fun to fool around
When indifference is all you've found
I'll be there, I'll be there

There's just a web of deception that ties you down
Can't you be honest with yourself as when you are with no one else?
There's just no sense of direction to steer you home
You know I'd like to stay and help
But I'm too worried about myself

It's the same old story, no, I don't need this life
And I don't care what anybody else says
I'm just a fool for temptation, is that so wrong?
You can let go of that stand, I'm just an ordinary man

When drink has done its turn
When it's much better fun to burn
When it's better at the edge of the road
When emotions run cold
When cynics cut you down
But it's much better fun to fool around
When indifference is all you've found

I'm just a fool for temptation, I'm just a fool, I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool for temptation, I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool, fool, fool, fool, fool
Yeah, yeah

You're so, you're so, you're so...

Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe
Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe
Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe

Lying here beside me, she kisses me once
I try to reach to find her but she's lost, lost
Thieves on the rooftops, police on the streets
Sometimes I can barely get to sleep

Come down from Jamaica, tired and sore
Why wake up at all when I can dream some more?
Oh, yeah
Lying in the sunshine, a wound in my side
Knights are heading for me, ride, ride

Home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is
Well, home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is

Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe
Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe
Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe
Maybe may maybe maybe maybe maybe

Why lost in our eyes
Heaven lonely with a hard road
If there's a way that will get me there
On the long distant height
I should leave it, no messing
And I'm just walking in the sun
Said oh, oh, I'm just walking in the sun
Said oh, oh, I'm just walking in the sun
Said oh, oh, I'm just walking in the sun
Said oh, oh, I'm just walking in the sun
Said oh, oh, I'm just walking in the sun
Said oh, oh, I'm just walking in the sun
Said walk, walking in the sun

<pre>
I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night
I get so tired, bored, before I go, well
There must be more to this I know
He says, "Son, won't you listen to me
Fun is fine but money is your need"
I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night

I've got a job, now I need two
Something to break this monopoly for good

I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night
I've been thinking of a way out
A way to redirect my aims
Desperation clearly starts to show
Now that things have come down to this I know
When the most laughs I've had so far
Is what goes on in the back of my car
I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night

I'm back here again
Drop pictures on the window frame
You know I was thinking
"What if I explain I need
Time off to reassess my game"
He'll say, "Son, won't you listen to me
Why not take time off permanently?"
I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night
I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night
I've got a job, it's alright
It keeps me out of town at night

I need someone to hold me tight
I need someone to throw off her clothes tonight
And when I'm sure that I've had it all
She'll have to show me what it's really like to have a ball
I need someone to drag me down
I need a soft girl, someone I can play around with

And if I knew just what's in store
I'll promise you the earth
If you promise to show me more

A little lower on the waistline
And pull me to the top once more
I can't take much more of this
And still contain my self-control

I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough

I turn on my TV                            I just can't get enough
I'm fed up with my books                   I just can't get enough
I don't know what to do                    I just can't get enough
To keep away from you                      I just can't get enough

I need someone to drag me down
I need a soft girl, someone I can play around with

And it's you that pulls me down
I'm a fool but I'm still around

A little lower on the waistline
And pull me to the top once more
Well, I can't take much more of this
And still contain my self-control

I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, sometimes I just....

Well, maybe, maybe, maybe, I just...

<hr>
<h2><center><pre><b><i>Jolene</i></b></pre></center></h2>
<hr>
<pre>
Raised in the heart of a small town
Brought up in a country torn in two
Indifferent to the plots and the people
She decided what to do, "Well, I've had enough of you"

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene and the rock machine
Jolene, Jolene, there's no mistake, don't underrate us

We met in London '82
She was broke and she knew it
But with her music she could prove that
Well, despite all she lacked
She could fight her own way back
But success doesn't breed conviction
And politics for her was just a tool
As a bluff to deflect self-interest
Publicize your care with words thrown here and there

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene and the rock machine
Jolene, Jolene, there's no mistake, don't underrate us

You know what they say of ambition
It turns the head of those that it knows
And as she was laid, her epitaph was read
She never gave a damn about the ordinary man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene and the rock machine
Jolene, Jolene, there's no mistake, don't underrate
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene and the rock machine
Jolene, Jolene, there's no mistake, don't underrate
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene and the rock machine
Jolene, Jolene, what had you found when you turned it all around?

<hr>
<pre>
When these hollow lights shut down
I'm alone in a lonely town
So many people, it's a heartache
Look over here

I could use a mallet
And a hard edge right on the head
Swing back, pull on and wallop
The chicken's dead

Two minutes flat I could be out the door
Race to the car and then drive to the shore
What will I do?  I'll kill you

Give me a minute, hey now, I could get rid of him here
A little bomb under the seat, he'll disappear
Now tell your friends that they've nothing to fear
But a sharp end to a glorious career
What will I do?  Hey now, maybe I'll kill you, I'll kill you

Don't, don't, don't turn around, don't, don't turn around
Don't, don't, don't turn around, don't, don't turn around
Don't, don't, don't turn around, don't stop to turn around
Don't, don't stop to turn around, don't, don't step around

Some enjoy it, some deny it, hang around and hide it
Strangle up and tie it
Now what, what will I do?  Hey now, maybe I will kill you

Swerve, swerve to the left side
And I swerve, swerve to the right
You better watch out, a bad bend up ahead
Looks like someone has really got it in for you
Doesn't look happy as he spins around
I'm not surprised it's a long way down
What will he do?

Some enjoy it, some deny it, hang around and hide it
Strangle up and tie it
Now what, what will I do?  Hey now, maybe I will kill you
I'll kill you

Boom boom
Boom boom

Move in
Move in
Move in

I stone your preachers and your Palestine laws
I burn your temples and your makeshift gods
Let's go, let's go and mess up this town
Tear buildings to the parched ground

Wait, now hold on a minute
I've got something to say, yeah
I tortured peasants in my cutthroat days
And murdered men on this grief-stricken land
Take me by your strong hand

And when the people are dragging you down
You keep on laughing as they kick you around
And now, who do you say that I am?
I say you're Lightning Paul
The ballad of a haunted man

The arts of seduction only gets in my way
I've got a method that I know won't fail
And don't defend those that don't understand
No, string 'em up and let 'em hang

Wait, now hold on a minute
I've got something to say, yeah
I beg forgiveness for my cutthroat days
And I'm kissed off with the state that I'm in
So give me all that faith brings

And when the people are dragging you down
You keep on laughing as they kick you around
And now, who do you say that I am?
I say you're Lightning Paul
The ballad of a haunted man

And when the people are dragging you down
You keep on laughing as they kick you around
And now, who do you say, say I am?
I say you're Lightning Paul
The ballad of a haunted man

                                        Who do you say that I am?
We say you're Lightning Paul
The ballad of a haunted man
                                                        Who do...

<hr>
<pre>
I'm in love with the TV
It's just something that makes good sense
And the key to my salvation is I don't love someone else
And I don't have a problem that I can't solve logically
I'm in love with Christine - who could blame me?

I'm in love with Christine
I'm in love with her
In love with Christine

I send post to the magazines those people keep my mind at ease
I explain my position and they all seem to agree
That I've been in a bird cage since I fell from the top of my tree
I'm in love with Christine - who can help me?

                                   You know there may be a problem
                                             One, two, three, four
                                   You know there may be a problem
                                             One, two, three, four
                                   You know there may be a problem
                                             One, two, three, four
                                   You know there may be a problem
                                             One, two, three, four
                                   You know there may be a problem
                                             One, two, three, four
I'm in love with Christine
                                   You know there may be a problem
Well, I'm in love with her
                                   You know there may be a problem

<h2><center><pre><b><i>Mary</i></b></pre></center></h2>
<hr>
<pre>
Mary's got a new job, she's working in the bank
Making lots of money and giving it to Frank
Frank's her married boyfriend, been that way for a year
Slapped her in the face once, but says he loves her dear

Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence

He's met another woman and travelling on his own
He wrote a loving message and left it by the phone
Mary still knows nothing, as innocent as snow
Everyone has heard the truth but no one lets it show

Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence

Mary's got a new job, she's working for herself
Making lots of money and thinking of her health
She's colder than November, as hard as she would will
There's times I lie there thinking I miss the warm days still

Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
Let it go

As she runs herself away
And I know
Stop and say hello

Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
                           Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
                      Please do something to restore my confidence
Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
                           Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
                      Please do something to restore my confidence
Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
                           Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
                      Please do something to restore my confidence
Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?
Please do something to restore my confidence
                           Oh Mary, why don't you have some sense?

Shoved on the highway, tossed on the motorway
This is the real world, welcome to the real world
And who put me down, this is not my kind of town
But in my mind, I'm having such a good time

There is nothing you could do that          You've got one strong hammer
Would faintly amuse me                              Use it while you can
It's sad when you accuse me             This is the hammer with which to
To hold all that and give nothing back                    Break this man
Take a change of scenery                    You've got one strong hammer
Something to release me                             Use it while you can
Bind me firmly and leave me cold        This is the hammer with which to
My body is weak but my mind is sold                       Break this man

I could drive out to the west coast, this is what I need most
Sing a lot and drinking Coca-Cola
Out by Wisconsin, yeah, over by the Pentagon

There is nothing you could do that          You've got one strong hammer
Would faintly amuse me                              Use it while you can

My body is weak but my mind is sold                       Break this man

Hurry up and get dressed, yeah, let's get out of this mess
Don't you know my car won't go too slow, no
Girl, we can't go too far until I find out who you are
Slow down and pull into the side lane

There is nothing you could do that          You've got one strong hammer
Would faintly amuse me                              Use it while you can

</i></b></pre></center></h2>
<hr>
<pre>
What's that you say?
He's on his own, always alone
An English man, you understand
Has he got a heart of stone?
Calm and yet, you can detect
Sometimes a frown
Not a sound, young Washington Down

Why be bold in an age of regret
If you're sure that your values are set?
At this fast rate, you've no need to run
Take it easy, young Washington

Wait for love, for you know love can wait
Look for danger before it's too late
You know from the past just how fast time can come
Take it easy, young Washington

If I seem so suddenly cruel
Know that jealousy burns as a rule
Try to struggle, you know you can't fight
Walk on silently into the night

<hr>
<p>After existing for several months as a manually-compiled digest, 
ShovelSchtuff moved to a reflector format.  This meant that rather 
than receiving one large message with everyone's correspondance in 
it, each member of the list would receive posts soon after they were 
made by each member.  It was then made into an automated digest, and 
it was in this phase that the list has appeared to vanish from the face 
of the Internet. I currently only have one of these issues of the 
original digest - anyone with copies of other issues, please let me 
know, so I can get my archive of them completed.</p>

<p>Additional note: This CD was released in a "digipack" cover.  On the 
inside of the cover is a short little bio of the band, as reprinted (without 
permission) below (formatted to recreate the original document as closely 
as possible):
<hr>
<pre>
Small towns have produced some amazing talent.  From Stockton's 
Pavement to Aberdeen's Melvins, geography does not inhibit the 
creative process.

That creative process is alive and well in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 
where Capricorn Recording artists <b>shoveljerk</b> have just completed 
their forthcoming debut release SWARM.

<b>shoveljerk</b> is Paul Hemenway (vocals & guitar), Mark Hemenway (bass), 
Zia Uddin (drums) and Greg Hjort (guitar).  The band formed in 
December 1994 after performing and recording for four years with an 
eight-piece, horn driven, rock ensemble named Black Happy.  Known for 
their energetic live show, these crafty tunesmiths toured and built 
a fan base that spanned from the Rockies to the West coast, with a 
predominant nich in the Northwest.  During Black Happy's four year 
association, their two independently released albums, FRIENDLY DOG 
SALAD (42045-2) and PEG HEAD (42044-2), have sold a combined 60,000 
copies.  Upon signing <b>shoveljerk</b>, Capricorn Records reissued Black 
Happy's two studio recordings plus a previously unreleased live CD, 
THE LAST POLKA (42046-2).

The 12 songs comprising <b>shoveljerk's</b> SWARM were recorded in Seattle
with producer Don Gilmore (Pearl Jam, John Doe, Temple Of The Dog).
And though this recording is the band's debut work, lyrically and 
sonically shoveljerk's songs convey maturity and a rock hard edge 
that will separate them from their run-of-the-mill, radio-formatted 
peers.

Their first single, "Killing My Buzz," from the soundtrack of NATIONAL 
LAMPOON'S SENIOR TRIP (42050), has been serviced to radio 
nationwide, heightening the anticipation for <b>shoveljerk's</b> February
1996 debut of SWARM.

Enough said.  Music will always speak louder than words.

<pre>
Just wanna crawl out of my skin
I don't like this one, I've gotten sick of it, oh yeah
The only thing that's left are the eyes and teeth
Because I don't trust the notion that you're selling me

There's too much creepy shit going on in this world
You're setting up the sides that I don't have to choose 
Oh no
The children of the weird don't know what they've seen
Because they don't trust the notion of the next big thing

The power and the glory are just pennies and scabs
The small g and the real trash couldn't care
You'll find out in the morning that it's not really there
The only place the poison cannot go is in my head
Is in my head, is in my head, is in my head

I'm dying, how could you do this to me
After all I've done for you?
I wish that it didn't have to be this way
But you knew what I was when you took me in 
When you took me in

It's really beautiful in a sad sort of way
Hammers and the pinpricks, bones and all
I'm never really angry but I'm always scared
It's tired and it's so predictable but I'm an easy hit 

I'm an easy hit, (yeah, yeah) I'm an easy hit
I'm an easy hit, (yeah, yeah) I'm an easy hit 
I'm an easy hit, I'm an easy hit 
I'm an easy hit, I'm an easy hit

In the show today, I could've thrown my time away
A human being or just a shell 
Was telling me how I should be
Tell me how to care, perfect halo, perfect hair
Pretty soon you know I got bored
Cause you're a liar and a whore
How many ribbons do you own
And do you wear them when you're alone?
I love to watch 'cause you're a half inch deep
In a thousand years, you're still a freak

Can you help me unwind?
Can you help me unwind?
Can you help me unwind?
I just can't take this one more time

I knew it all when I was four, now I can't tell anymore
I wish I could be blind again 
And figure out where you've been
Change is quick in these times, how can we tell the signs
Watch the headpiece coming down 
Doesn't matter how we drown

Can you help me unwind?                  Cut the paranoia
Can you help me unwind?                It gets in the way
Can you help me unwind?        And through all the static
Can you help me unwind?           Love to make that trade

If it doesn't kill us soon, will it leave us any room
My face is numb and my body's cold 
Every day I lose my soul
According to your mind, we get suckered every time
The holy bible or the rolling stone
We're dying, could you hold the phone?

Can you help me unwind?                   Cut the paranoia
Can you help me unwind?                 It gets in the way
Can you help me unwind?               And through all this
I just can't take this one more time

Can you help me unwind?      Split the difference with you
Can you help me unwind?               Same thing every day
Can you help me unwind?       Safe to clear the static (?)
Can you help me unwind?                    Hate to see the

Children only dumber I say
Children only dumber I say
Children only dumber I say
Children only dumber I say

Everyone's got something to hide 
Oh, not again, oh, not again
Cause everyone has taken this slide
And it's all the same and it's always been, yeah

Where's your revolution today?
So what's it called and what's it pay?

This one just killed my buzz
Maybe this will work next time instead
I've got no heart, I've got no spine
I've got no brain inside my head

What would you do if you could run
Well, the rope's on me and so's the hole
Would you leave here without your guns and try it again
Or would you never go?

This one just killed my buzz
Maybe this will work next time instead
I've got no heart, I've got no spine
I've got no brain inside my head

Has it really come down to this 
Oh, not again, oh, not again
If it left it's not something I'd miss
Cause it's gotten tired and it's always been

This one just killed my buzz
Maybe this will work next time instead
                            Maybe this will work next time
I've got no heart, I've got no spine
I've got no brain inside my head            Inside my head

This one just killed my buzz
Maybe this will work next time instead        
                                      Said ananananananana
I've got no heart, I've got no spine
I've got no brain inside my head

Waiting here for something, looking at the ground 
We let it fall
Can't express the feelings and this still is wrong
There's no belief in anyone
I know a lot of people but I don't have a lot of friends
Time's so insecure and it can be so selfish
But it wants your respect

Maybe I should stop complaining or maybe I should start
And I say 
What's the difference if I don't know what I'm saying?
Maybe I should start and I say

Do you want to be loved or do you want to be God 
Or do you know at all
Most of the generation has been at the deep end so much  
They embrace it
Funny 'bout the power and where it goes
In a perfect world, I wouldn't be so dumb
And everything would be like it's supposed to be

Maybe I should stop complaining or maybe I should start
And I say 
What's the difference if I don't know what I'm saying?
Maybe I should start and I say

Life's so overrated that I have to laugh
When I watch you shout and scream
But maybe one day you'll learn
I've already gotten over myself
And have learned how to deal with the others
And I know how they will act
If you listen to the point that I'm making
You could understand the only one I'm fooling is me
What fun would that be 
If your eyes and ears were opened up
If you could see, if you could see, if you could see
If you could see, really, what's the difference?

Maybe I should stop complaining or maybe I should start
And I say 
What's the difference if I don't know what I'm saying?
Maybe I should start and I say

Maybe I should stop complaining or maybe I should start
And I say 
What's the difference if I don't know what I'm saying?
Maybe I should start and I say
