LOBBYING ORGANIZATIONS PUT UNDER FEBRUARY 14
DEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH NEW REGISTRATION LAW

     Lobbying organizations are under a February 14 deadline to
identify their lobbyists and disclose their legislative or
regulatory interests under a new law which took effect January 1.
     Also, lobbyists who were active during the fourth quarter of
1995 are required to file activity reports, even though the law
requiring them has been repealed.
     The 1946 Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act was repealed on
January 1. Thus, its repeal didn't affect the quarterly activity
report for the period that ended on December 31.
     In a joint statement published in the December 22 edition of
the Congressional Record, Secretary of the Senate Kelly D.
Johnston and Clerk of the House Robin H. Carle said all lobbying
organizations must register under the new law.
     While individuals and lobbying organizations that were
registered under the old law must file a final quarterly activity
report, registrations under the old law are no longer valid.
That's because the new law's disclosure requirements are
different from those contained in the old law. Moreover, the new
law shifts the registration and reporting requirement to lobbying
firms and lobbying organizations.
     "All lobbyists active after January 1, 1996, must register
under the new Lobbying Disclosure Act," Johnston and Carle said.
The February 14 registration deadline, they added, applies "to a
lobbyist who has a retainer agreement with a client in effect on
January 1, 1996."
     A new registration form was to have been released on January
12. But, due to the snow blizzards that hit Washington in recent
days, the Government Printing Office was unable to meet the
delivery date. Forms will be made available later this month at
the House Legislative Resource Center, 1036 Longworth House
Office Building (202/225-1300), and the Senate Office of Public
Records, 232 Hart Senate Office Building (202/224-0758).

AN UNRULY LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE ITS OWN RULES,
APPEALS COURT SAYS RHODE ISLAND HOUSE CAN BAN LOBBYISTS

By Edward Zuckerman, Editor & Publisher

     Boston--Rhode Island might have an unruly legislature, but
it at least has the right to set its rules. So, the U.S. 1st
Circuit Court of Appeals held in a recent divided opinion, a 1993
rule that banishes lobbyists from their traditional roosting
place around the floor of the Rhode Island House of
Representatives is valid, no matter what other constitutional
issues it might provoke.
     The 2-1 opinion handed down in late November by a
three-judge appeals court panel overturned an earlier decision by
U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Pettine. He held the rule had to
be set aside because it didn't apply equally to all lobbyists.
While private sector lobbyists were affected, lobbyists from the
state's own agencies retained their access to the House floor.
     Instead of relaxing the rule, the Rhode Island Legislature
reacted to Judge Pettine's decision by extending it to the state
government's lobbyists, too. The legislature's action served only
to harden efforts by a coalition of lobbying organizations to
have the rule declared unconstitutional.
     Inexplicably, Judge Pettine wasn't asked to consider whether
the Rhode Island legislature was entitled to immunity from
judicial intervention. There is a time-honored doctrine, derived
from the Constitution's "speech and debate" clause, which allows
legislatures to conduct their affairs without judicial scrutiny.
     "Parties must speak clearly in the trial court on pain that,
if they forget their lines, they will likely be bound forever to
hold their peace," Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya noted in the
opinion he wrote for himself and Circuit Judge Conrad K. Cyr.
     But "foolish consistency is reputedly the hobgoblin of
little minds," Judge Selya continued, drawing upon the widsom of
Ralph Waldo Emerson to explain why he and Judge Cyr were making
an exception.
     "In our republican system, different institutions of
government occupy different spheres. Within its own domain, the
legislative branch of a state government is entitled to a
reasonable measure of independence in conducting its internal
affairs," they said.
     And they concluded: "As a rule, a legislature's regulation
of the atmosphere in which it conducts its core legislative
activities--debating, voting, passing legislation and the
like--is part and parcel of the legislative process and, hence,
not subject to a judicial veto."
     Failing to raise a "legislative immunity" defense, the two
circuit judges said, "had the regrettable effect of blindsiding
the district judge and prolonging the litigation."
     Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch, the panel's dissenting member,
felt the Rhode Island House wasn't entitled to immunity and that
its rule did extinguish a First Amendment right.
     "When the government chooses to listen only to its own voice
in the political process by excluding the voices of private
citizens, core First Amendment values are violated.
     "The First Amendment does not permit the government to put
its thumb on the scale in this way and favor itself in the arena
of political speech," she said.

     Connecticut journalist Charles Dudley Warner's century-old
aphorism that "politics makes strange bedfellows" remains true,
Judge Selya said of the "improbable alliance" that banded
together--social workers, school teachers, gun ownership
advocates, pro-life and pro-choice activists and the American
Civil Liberties Union--to protest the Rhode Island House's rule.
     To understand why such a disparate group of organizations
found fellowship, one merely must know that the Rhode Island
House of Representatives is a part-time legislature that meets a
few afternoons and evenings. Its members have their own full-time
jobs. They have no offices, no staff aides, just a chair and a
desk on the House floor. Sometimes, during long legislative
sessions, amendments are offered and approved in the same day.
     There is a gallery overlooking the floor, but there is also
an aisle with a few dozen chairs around the floor's perimeter
which have been occupied for many years by lobbyists. When the
House convened under new leadership in 1993, a rule was approved
that unceremoniously dispatched the private sector lobbyists, who
must be registered and wear identifying badges, to the gallery.
House Rule 45, besides leaving the state government's lobbyists
unaffected, also allowed floor access to the general public.
     House Rule 45 creates a hardship for lobbyists, particularly
when it prevents them from communicating their views on
amendments which are proposed and voted on in the same
proceeding, the trial court acknowledged. Even so, the circuit
court decided, "we think it is beyond serious dispute that
enforcing a duly enacted legislative rule which prohibits
lobbying on the House floor during House sessions is well within
the legislative sphere."
     Judge Lynch, in a dissent which gave First Amendment
concerns priority over a legislature's immunity to judicial veto,
cited several examples where the rule's enforcement gave the
state's lobbyists an unfair advantage.
     For example, when the House took up bills relating to public
funding of abortion, reinstatement of the death penalty and cuts
in public welfare spending, lobbyists from the Rhode Island Right
to Life Committee, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
National Association of Social Workers could only "wave from the
balcony" while the governor, attorney general and state welfare
department officials promoted their views directly to lawmakers.
     "Prison-related bills received the same treatment," Judge
Lynch said. "Department of Corrections officials were on the
floor with legislators during debate while ACLU lobbyists who
opposed the Department's position watched ineffectively from the
balcony. There were numerous other instances where the Governor's
Office, the State Police, the Department of Economic Development,
the Banking and Insurance Department, the Fire Marshal, the
General Treasurer's Office and the Department of Business
Regulation lobbyists spoke directly with legislators on the floor
regarding pending legislation."
     Even if legislative immunity had been raised earlier, Judge
Lynch said it wouldn't have foreclosed "a judicial determination
of the constitutionality of the defendant's practices."
     "The legislative immunity doctrine is not meant for the
protection of the legislators for their own benefit, 'but to
support the rights of the people, by enabling their
representatives to execute the functions of their office without
fear of prosecution, civil or criminal,'" she said, quoting from
a 1972 Supreme Court decision in a bribery case that involved
former Maryland Democratic Sen. Daniel Brewster.
     Lobbying is a form of political speech that deserves First
Amendment protection, Judge Lynch said.
     "The dangers...are plain. By simply excluding all voices
save the voices of government lobbyists, the government could
easily 'suppress support for a minority party or an unpopular
cause, or...exclude the expression of certain ideas from the
marketplace of ideas.' These effects are 'so plainly illegitimate
that they would immediately invalidate the rule,'" she said,
quoting from a 1984 Supreme Court decision.
     And, quoting a more recent Supreme Court decision, she said
the Rhode Island House "has no authority to license one side of
the debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the others to
follow Marquis of Queensbury Rules."
     "The point is that the government has permitted itself to
speak while prohibiting non-government speech. Speech from
non-government speakers, including lobbyists, is also valuable.
Indeed, while lobbying may be subject to registration and
disclosure, no case has ever suggested that lobbying, including
its information-gathering and providing component, could be
banned entirely," Judge Lynch said.
     And she added elsewhere in her dissenting opinion:
     "There is another danger, and that is that the government's
voice will not truly represent the interests of the public.
Government should theoretically represent the people and not
represent itself. Theory and reality often depart. The government
is not always a mirror of the people. Government employees today
are recognized as constituting their own interest group," Judge
Lynch warned.

COLORADO REPUBLICAN PARTY SPENDING CASE
IS NOW GOING TO U.S. SUPREME COURT

     The U.S. Supreme Court said it will review a 10-year-old
legal dispute involving political expenditures by the Colorado
Republican party.
     The case is being watched closely by Democrats and
Republicans. If a decision reached last summer by the U.S. 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals is overturned by the high court, then
the Federal Election Campaign Act's restrictions on political
party expenditures might become unraveled by enabling them to
make unlimited expenditures to elect or defeat federal candidates
without counting against contribution or expenditure limits which
otherwise apply to them.
     At issue in the case is a $15,000 payment by the Colorado
GOP for radio commercials that aired in 1986, fully eight months
before the general election and before the party selected its
candidate to oppose incumbent Sen. Timothy Wirth's (D-Colo.)
re-election. It described it as an "operating expense" in its
financial disclosure to the Federal Election Commission which
opened an investigation after a formal complaint was filed by the
Colorado Democratic party.
     The FEC filed a civil suit in Denver when the Colorado
Republican party refused to admit it violated federal law in a
conciliation agreement. But the FEC's effort to press the case
was dealt a setback when U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham
ruled the GOP expenditure wasn't subject to government regulation
because the commercials didn't contain an "express advocacy"
message.
     Nottingham cited election law cases dating back to the 1976
Buckley vs. Valeo decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court has
held that political expenditures are immune from government
regulation if they do not convey "express advocacy"--that is,
they don't expressly advocate the election or defeat of a federal
candidate with explicit words such as "vote for" or "vote
against."
     Last summer, though, a three-judge appeals court panel in
Denver held that the "express advocacy" standard applies to
independent expenditure activities. Because political parties
cannot engage in independent expenditure activity, the Colorado
GOP expenditures can only be treated as "coordinated
expenditures" which are subject to the FECA's requirements if
they are made "in connection with a federal election."
     "Any reasonable reading of the commercial would leave the
reader (or listener) with the impression that the Republican
party sought to 'diminish' public support for Wirth and 'garner
support' for the unnamed Republican nominee. The commercial
unquestionably contained an electioneering message.
     "We conclude that the anti-Wirth publicity was an
'expenditure in connection with' the 1986 Colorado senatorial
election because it named both a clearly identifiable candidate
and contained an electioneering message," the appeals court said.
     In its order, the three-judge panel ordered the case back to
the trial court with instructions to enter a finding in the FEC's
favor.
     Instead, the Colorado GOP sought an en banc review by the
U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. When its petition for review
was rejected by the appeals court, the state party applied for
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
     In its petition to the high court, the state party argued
that the election law violates its First Amendment right of free
speech. But the U.S. Justice Department, in an opposition brief,
said the appeals court decision complied with Supreme Court
precedent.

CONGRESS PAVES THE WAY FOR ELECTRONIC
FILINGS TO FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

     Congress completed action late last month on legislation
that will speed disclosure and pave the way toward electronic
submission of campaign finance reports.
     Effective immediately, the legislation eliminates the Clerk
of the House as the official filing point-of-entry for House
candidates. Instead, congressional candidates will file their
reports directly to the Federal Election Commission, thus
eliminating a two-day period for delivering copies of reports to
the FEC.
     The legislation does not affect senatorial candidates who
will continue filing their campaign disclosure reports to the
Secretary of the Senate.
     Also, beginning next year, the FEC will be allowed to accept
campaign disclosure reports without requiring a treasurer's legal
signature. By permitting other means for meeting the law's
signature requirement, the FEC will be enabled to accept
electronic submissions.
     Finally, the new law, when signed by President Clinton, will
waive a provision of present election law which requires
candidates, PACs and political parties to make duplicate filings
of their reports in states where computer terminals provide
access to the FEC public records.

MICHIGAN POLITICAL DONORS CAN BE
SOLICITED BY OTHER CANDIDATES

     Lansing, Mich.--Individuals whose gifts to state and local
candidates are publicly disclosed are fair game to other
candidates, Michigan Secretary of State Candice S. Miller said in
an interpretive ruling.
     The state's election law prohibits the use of contributor
information for "commercial" solicitation. But, unlike federal
law, the prohibition doesn't specifically cover "political"
solicitation.
     Miller noted that the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, in
a case involving use of federally disclosed contributor
information, ruled that the publication and sale of contributor
information by Political Contributions Data Inc. did not by
itself constitute a prohibited commercial use.
     Thus, Miller said, Aristotle Industries, the
Washington-based company which requested the ruling, can compile
and sell information about contributors to Michigan
officeseekers.
     "The interpretation of the term 'commercial purposes'
adopted by the 2nd Circuit espouses a rationale that applies
equally well to that same term, as used in the Michigan Campaign
Finance Act. The difference between Michigan's prohibition under
the Michigan Campaign Finance Act and the federal prohibition
under the Federal Election Campaign Act is that the federal
prohibition applies to 'all kinds of solicitations,' whereas the
prohibition of the MCFA applies only to commercial
solicitations," Miller said in her ruling.

DOLE, CLINTON LEAD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
IN PRIMARY MATCHING FUND CERTIFICATIONS

     While large portions of the federal government remained
closed, two agencies close to the hearts of most presidential
candidates--the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Treasury
Department--were open for business.
     As the 1995 calendar year came to an end, the FEC certified
$37.4 million worth of matching fund payments to 10 eligible
presidential candidates.
     They will receive 60% of the certified amount from Treasury,
due to a shortfall in the primary matching fund account, with the
rest to be paid later in the year when taxpayers begin filing
their 1995 federal income taxes.
     Republican hopeful Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) led all recipients
with a $5.6 million payment from Treasury. President Bill
Clinton, facing no serious opposition for the Democratic party
nomination, drew $5.4 million.
     Also on the recipients' list were perennial Democratic
candidate Lyndon LaRouche who received $156,740 and Natural Law
Party candidate John Hagelin who received $60,000.
     Under presidential fund rules, candidates lose their
eligibility 30 days after failing to receive at least 10% of the
vote in two successive primaries.
     Last week, LaRouche appeared to gain a few extra days of
eligibility by becoming the lone Democratic candidate in the
February 24 Delaware primary. President Clinton said he wouldn't
enter the Delaware contest after New Hampshire officials
complained that Delaware scheduled its election only four days
after their state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary.
     Delaware Democrats said last week they would draft
85-year-old former Gov. Elbert Carvel as a "favorite son" to
prevent LaRouche from gaining delegates to the party's
presidential nominating convention.

BOND DEALER ASKS U.S. SUPREME COURT
TO REVIEW CONSTITUTIONALITY OF RULE G-37

     Alabama bond dealer William Blount celebrated the New Year
by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review lower court decisions
that have upheld the constitutionality of a government regulation
that restricts political contributions by municipal bond firms
and their employees.
     The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Rule G-37
"places unprecedented restrictions on the First Amendment rights
of securities professionals and the Tenth Amendment rights of the
states," Blount claimed in a 21-page brief that was filed with
the high court on January 2.
     Under Rule G-37, which took effect in 1994 with U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission approval, a bond firm cannot
do business with a state or local bond issuing agency for two
years after the firm or an employee makes a contribution to the
campaign of a candidate or official who can influence the
agency's decisions.
     The rule hit particularly hard against Blount because he was
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party when it took effect.
Because he was expected to help candidates raise money for their
campaigns, Blount won a temporary order that suspended the rule's
application to him.
     Rule G-37, Blount charged in his petition, "does violence to
constitutional principles" and usurps the power of states to
enact their own campaign finance laws.
     Blount went to the Supreme Court after the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said it wouldn't
review a three-judge panel's conclusion that the MSRB rule was
constitutional.
     The appeals court upheld the rule, even in the absence of
evidence of so-called "pay-to-play" practices which the MSRB said
its rule was designed to prevent.
     "No smoking gun is needed where, as here, the conflict of
interest is apparent, the likelihood of stealth is great and the
legislative purpose is prophylactic," the appeals court said.

REFORMERS CRITICIZE USE OF STATE-OWNED
BUILDINGS FOR POLITICAL FUNDRAISING EVENTS

     Albany, N.Y.--Reform advocates think its "outrageous" for
New York state lawmakers to hold campaign fundraising events in
restaurants which are located in the state-owned Empire State
Plaza which has underground passageways to the state capitol and
its office buildings.
     Representatives of four organizations--New York Common
Cause, New York Public Interest Research Group, the League of
Women Voters and United We Stand America--criticized the practice
at a late December press conference.
     They said there was nothing illegal about holding campaign
fundraising events in the privately-owned, rent-paying
businesses. But they also said it was unethical to raise campaign
funds on state-owned property.

New problem for Mrs. Waldholtz

     Fees paid to a private detective who worked for Rep. Enid
Greene Waldholtz's (R-Utah) 1994 campaign do not appear in
campaign finance disclosure reports to the Federal Election
Commission, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.
     Malcolm Shannon, a private investigator, told the newspaper
he only provided personal security consulting services to Mrs.
Waldholtz. But sources in Waldholtz's campaign claimed Shannon
checked the backgrounds of people who were contributing to the
campaigns of her opponents, Democratic incumbent Karen Shepherd
and independent Merrill Cook.
     The newspaper said the Utah Democratic Party filed a formal
complaint to the Federal Election Commission last October,
alleging the Waldholtz's campaign violated the federal election
law by failing to disclose the fees paid to Shannon.

Eating words

     "PACs just try to buy influence and buy incumbents...(I
don't) accept PAC money and I'd like to see an end to this type
of money-funneling." That was Massachusetts Republican Gov.
William Weld speaking to the Boston Ad Club a few years ago.
     Last month, Weld said he would raise PAC funds for his
campaign against Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).
     Kerry doesn't accept PAC contributions but, the Boston Globe
noted, Kerry raised PAC funds while he chaired the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Disclosure compliance

     Baltimore City Council members Agnes Welch and Martin
O'Malley filed tardy campaign finance disclosure reports and paid
fines for missing the deadlines just in time for their December 7
inaugurations, the Baltimore Sun reported.
     Under Maryland law, elected state and local officials cannot
be sworn into office without certification by the State
Administrative Board of Election Laws that all disclosure reports
have been filed and all fines have been paid.

Wooing Catholics

     Christian Coalition, which mixes anti-abortion politics with
conservative social and welfare issues, has created a subsidiary
called the Catholic Alliance to increase its membership in
Massachusetts where voters tend to be Catholic, Democratic and
liberal.
     The Virginia-based political organization claims that
250,000 of its 1.7 million members are Catholic, even though the
church doesn't support its views on such issues as gun control,
immigration, welfare reform and budget cuts. Church officials
have remained neutral, allowing the Catholic Alliance to buy a
full-page ad in the Boston archdiocese newspaper to promote
attendance at a membership recruitment event.
     Catholic Alliance, described as a "wholly-owned subsidiary"
by Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed, will lure Catholics
into membership by focusing entirely on abortion and school
prayer.

Spinning out of control

     "Hopefully, they learned a lesson: not all politicians are
bad," State Rep. Alex Diaz de la Portilla said after fined $500
by the Florida Elections Commission for filing a false campaign
finance disclosure report.
     "We feel totally vindicated. They threw out five charges. To
not embarrass the elections department, they decided to find him
guilty of something," Portilla's brother and lawyer, Miguel Diaz
de la Portilla, told the Miami Herald.

Letter of the law

     Alaska Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles has come under fire for
refusing to disclose an estimated $300,000 worth of contributions
collected by his Governor's Fund at two fundraising events prior
to the February 15 disclosure deadline. Besides waiting for the
last minute, the gifts are expected to be treated as Alaska
Democratic Party receipts.
     "The governor's decision to delay disclosure, while within
the letter of the law, violates the spirit of the law. So does
his decision to report the fundraiser in the Democratic Party's
1995 report, which will not break out the information in a
quickly accessible separate report," the Anchorage Daily News
editorialized.
     "State disclosure statutes were designed so Alaskans would
know who contributed to elected officials and candidates...(T)he
law says the contributions must be reported by Feb. 15, not on
Feb. 15," the newspaper said.

Doctors' bill

     The Massachusetts Medical Society was fined $45,000 by the
state's ethics commission for providing at least $15,000 worth of
illegal gratuities to state lawmakers between 1989 and 1993. As
part of its settlement, the 214-year-old society which represents
15,000 physicians and medical students, admitted that its
lobbyist, Andrew Hunt, made gifts to lawmakers to ensure friendly
treatment of health-related legislation.
     Hunt, according to the Boston Globe, hosted key lawmakers on
a 1992 fishing trip to Puerto Rico and a 1993 golf trip to
Florida. Hunt submitted expense accounts to the society which
described the purpose of his expenditures as "medical
malpractice" or "Medicare" without identifying those who were
entertained.

UNITED STATES:  AT&T, MCI MOVE INTO DBS

With 1996 only a few weeks old and Congress poised to vote on a major
telecom deregulation bill, the two largest US long-distance telephone
companies have signalled that direct-to-home satellite broadcasts will
be a major strategic focus of their effort to build direct links to
American consumers.  Mitch Shapiro reports.

The long-distance/DBS alliance-making began on 22 January, when AT&T
announced an agreement to market and distribute Hughes' DirecTv DBS
service and the associated reception gear.

A few days later, MCI Communications, the number-two long distance
company, submitted the winning bid in a government auction of DBS
orbital slots that had been reclaimed from a company the government had
decided had waited too long to launch its DBS service.

As part of its deal with Hughes, AT&T is acquiring 2.5 percent of
DirecTv for $137.5 million.  The agreement also gives AT&T options to
increase its stake up to 30% over five years, depending mainly on how
many new DirecTv subscribers it enrolls over specific time periods.

AT&T, which is in the process of spinning off its telecom equipment and
computer divisions, is expected to begin marketing DirecTv service to
its long-distance and credit card customers by this summer.  According
to Joseph P.  Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&T's consumer and
small-business division, the DirecTv investment "in one fell
swoop,..establishes AT&T with a national presence in entertainment."

Though AT&T customers will not get a price break on DBS service, AT&T
hopes to lower the upfront DBS cost hurdle by offering financing
through its AT&T Universal Card.  AT&T customers, which will order
service and equipment directly from AT&T, will also receive a single
bill that will include both DBS and long-distance phone charges.

MCI's winning auction bid of $682.5 million topped competing bids by
Tele-Communications, Inc., the nation's largest cable TV operator, and
Echostar Communications, a smaller company which recently launched its
first DBS satellite on a Chinese-built rocket.

Not surprisingly, the long-distance company is teaming with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.  in the DBS arena.  It earlier had agreed to
invest $2 billion in News Corp.

In the wake of the auction, the two companies announced plans to create
a jointly owned company that will offer information and entertainment
services to both consumers and businesses.

The moves into DBS by AT&T and MCI follow several years during which
the two companies considered possible alliances with cable or local
phone companies.  No agreements ever resulted from these discussions
and Sprint, their chief long distance rival, eventually formed a joint
venture with three of the nation's largest cable operators, TCI,
Comcast and Cox.

The AT&T investment in DirecTv was generally welcomed by financial
analysts as a means to gain quick access to an established direct-to-
home broadband delivery system.  In contrast, there was considerable
skepticism regarding the potential payback on an MCI-backed DBS
venture.

In addition to the nearly $700 million it spent on spectrum, MCI will
need to spend as much as one billion dollars to build and launch its
satellites.  It will also come late to the market, lagging DirecTv and
Primestar by at least a few years, and Echostar and Alphastar - a soon-
to-be launched medium-power DBS service - by more than a year.

While some analysts believe the AT&T investment will help DirecTv
attract large numbers of cable customers - something that has yet to
occur despite rapid early sales of DBS receivers - others remain
skeptical, citing the still-high cost of DBS equipment, especially for
homes that want to receive DBS signals on multiple TV sets.

These analysts believe that while DBS may pose a serious threat to
weaker cable operators in smaller rural markets that are slow to
upgrade their networks, satellite technology is not likely to reach
double digit penetration levels in large metro markets, where cable and
telephone companies are expected to focus their network upgrade
investments.

ITALY:  STREAM LAUNCHES VOD GUIDE

"This monthly was conceived for the protagonists of a Great Adventure,
that of VideoMagic.  A unique service, a breakthrough in television
[...] For the first time in Italy, the television set loses its
traditional function as an electrical household appliance and becomes
an interactive tool." These lines introduce what is probably the
world's first VOD programme guide.

This slick, 80-page colour magazine is produced by Stream, the
subsidiary of Italian telecommunications operator STET in charge of
developing and distributing VideoMagic, the bouquet of on-demand
multimedia services delivered via the fast-expanding optical fibre
broadband switched network Italy is building.

Similar to a regular TV guide, the giornale della TV interattiva
introduces the customer to the various programmes and services.

With VideoMagic, Stream enters into the pre-commercial phase of the
service.  The magazine is distributed to the first 1,000 households
connected to the VOD service in Milan and Rome who are invited to test
the variety of products on offer, respond to questionnaires and whose
network utilisation will be monitored.  "It is the beginning, a dress
rehearsal," says Stream.  The information gathered will be used to
improve all aspects of the service, especially the navigation through
the various rubrics."

Presently, the VOD service is structured around a menu composed of four
service categories: Entertainment (Films, Your Television, Sports,
Music & Art); Children (Children's TV, How & Why, Cartoon & Telefilm),
Exploring; Shopping (Department Stores, Catalogue & Famous Brands,
Bargain Corner, Yellow Pages Rome/Milan) and At Your Service (Health &
Leisure, Citizens' Bureau, Kiosk, Financial/ Insurance Services).

Each service/title description is followed by a code, the length in
minutes and the session price.

The VideoMagic programme guide's index includes 65 movies and 70
Telefilms and series, out of a total of 230 programme entries
(excluding the numerous episodes of many TV series) - altogether 30,000
minutes of material.

GERMANY:  BERLIN DIGITAL CABLE TV

The first large digital cable TV project in Germany will start in
April, according to head of the Berlin media authority MABB, Hans Hege.
 The real start will not be until this autumn, however, as there will
not be enough digital settop boxes in the market, he revealed.

MABB reached a preliminary decision last November to give a digital
cable licence to telecom company Vebacom, together with local partner
EMG.  Vebacom, now a shareholder in the new digital TV alliance MMBG,
is talking to content providers, Deutsche Telekom and other cable
operators of the "Netzebene 4" in Berlin.

Hege is confident that the partnership of Vebacom and EMG will work.
"Pay-TV channel Premiere has got a lot of subscribers, for example,
while Vebacom has got a lot of know-how in subscriber management and
marketing and the EMG in digital technical operations, so these
companies could work together without there being any doubts of
gatekeeping.  Step by step the Berlin project will expand.  At first,
only a few Berlin cable households will receive the digital TV
programmes, but the number of cable households which can see the
hyperband-channels will increase in a short time to 10% (110,000)."

Fifteen hyperband channels and one normal-band channel will form the
heart of the new digital Berlin, while in other parts of Germany only
five hyperband channels are ready for digital broadcasting by Deutsche
Telekom.  Each of these channels can broadcast between six to ten TV
programmes.  "We need 35 digital cable channels, but 16 might be a good
start," Hege stated.

"We don't think that video-on-demand is possible yet for a mass cable
audience.  The bad experiences in Orlando have underlined this.
Bundling of channels, multiplexing and pay-perview are the future.  We
will establish the first real digital brand in Germany and, I hope,
that each of the German states will version our digital TV system on
their own cable systems."

On the technical side, the launch of digital TV in Berlin will be much
easier than in other states, because Berlin only has one central cable-
head station.  "Having only one cable-head station makes the digital TV
business in Berlin faster," Hege added.  Manfred Meier, network
developer for many foreign TV stations, also welcomed Hege's
initiative.  "We are having problems getting our foreign channels on to
German cable.  Digital TV in Berlin will be the first step in the right
direction to give more channels a chance to broadcast in Germany."

But Hege has not been not greeted with positive response everywhere.
The broadcasting organisation VPRT, the private cable operators of ANGA
and the biggest telecommunication rival Deutsche Telekom threaten to
sue the coming licensing decision of the MABB, if Vebacom gets an
exclusive digital cable licence in Berlin.  Said Hege, "It is
ridiculous that they are threatening to sue against our decision,
especially since Vebacom is still a member of two of these
organisations.  We don't want to create a monopoly, we want competition
in Berlin.  Each content provider can choose to distribute their
channels for themselves or to work with the service provider."

JAPAN:  NEW DIGITAL SYSTEM DEVELOPED

Researchers for Nippon Television Network, Matsushita Electric and six
other Japanese companies have developed a digital transmission system
that offers high definition resolution and multimedia applications.
Called Prog-ressive Digital Broadcasting, or 525P, the new system sends
and receives images via communications satellite at a rate of 60 frames
per second, twice the speed of conventional systems.  Like the current
NTSC system, the 525P uses 525 scanning lines, but the faster
transmission rate means that twice as much visual information appears
on the screen.  The resulting picture quality is equivalent to that
produced by NHK's Hi-Vision analogue system.  Also, like Hi-Vision, the
525P offers a 16:9 aspect ratio.

The partners on the NTV and Matsushita-led development team, which
include Texas Instruments, Toshiba, Japan Satellite System, DMC,
Hitachi and Sanyo, have successfully tested the system in transmissions
from Yokohama to receiving stations in Osaka and Tokyo, via the JCSAT-3
digital satellite.  The system was able to send from three to six
digital video channels using a single transponder.

The system's real-time progressive video decoder decodes compressed
signals at 60 frames a second, twice the speed of the MPEG-2's Main
Profile, Mail Level (MP@ML).  The system's settop box is installed with
a progressive digital decoder that can compress both digital, audio and
video signals simultaneously and offers a component output function
(Y,Pb,Pr) with a vertical scanning frequency of 31.5kHz.  Users of Wide
Clearvision or Hi-Vision sets are able to receive the system's digital
signals.

In addition to home receiving sets that include a parabola antenna and
a real-time progressive digital decoder or digital-decoder-installed
settop box, the system can transmit to PC monitors, opening the
possibility of multimedia services that allow users to receive and
process images and data on their PCs.

The 525P system is expected to play an important role in the ongoing
battle over Japan's transition to digital broadcasting.  NHK, which
spent more than two decades developing its Hi-Vision system, has long
advocated its use aboard the next-generation BS-4b broadcasting
satellite, which is scheduled for launch in 1997.  Given the planned
switch to digital by cable and communications satellite broadcasters,
beginning in the fall of this year with the start of DMC 50-channel
digital service, top officials in the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications have been advocating the rapid introduction of a
digital system to BS broadcasting as well.

In May an MPT advisory panel will issue a report recommending whether
the broadcasting system for the BS-4b satellite be analogue or digital.
 With the announcement of the new NTV digital system (see news story),
the balance has been further weighted against NHK's Hi-Vision analogue
alternative.

EUROPE:  EC AIDS NEW 16:9 BROADCASTERS

Under its Action Plan for the Introduction of Advanced TV Services in
Europe, the European Commission has granted ECU4.395 million ($5.520
million) to seven more television stations in five countries to support
a total of 2,000 hours of wide-screen programme transmissions.

The decision will enable Austria's public broadcaster ORF, Denmark's
Danmarks Radio, the Italian regional stations Telenuovo, Synthesia and
Videolina as well as Veronica from the Netherlands and Granada in the
UK to present wide-screen TV to their viewers for the first time.
Moreover, the Danish service will be the first wide-screen service to
start using the digital satellite TV standard developed by the European
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) Group.

"The announcement of a digital wide-screen service by Danmarks Radio is
of strategic importance because it shows that 16:9 really has the
potential to become the screen format of the Information Society,"
commented Martin Bangemann, European Commissioner in charge of
Industry, Information Technologies and Telecommunications, "Wide-screen
is a bridge between analogue and digital television for the consumer.
It works with either technology and therefore futureproofs consumer
investments in the most expensive part of the TV system, the screen
itself."

The overall objective of the Action Plan is to accelerate consumer
uptake of wide-screen TV by overcoming the "chicken and egg" problem:
broadcasters would not transmit 16:9 without TV sets while
manufacturers would not produce them without broadcasting.
Broadcasters in countries with no wide-screen services until now
qualify for funding up to 80% of their expenses, in other countries up
to 50% (see table on back page).

With the latest additions, it is no less than 41 broadcasters in 13
European countries who have received Action Plan support committing
them to transmit true 16:9 pictures - not letterbox.

If Danmarks Radio may well become the first broadcaster to offer
widescreen digitally via satellite, it is not the sole operator
interested in using digital transmission to provide wide-screen
programming.

In the UK, the BBC publicised its plan last April (see ATM May 95) to
make wide-screen television the centerpiece of its digital terrestrial
TV strategy.

CANADA:  SEGA CHANNEL CANADA UP

In late January Shaw Cable, Canada's second largest MSO, launched Sega
Channel Canada, a 24-hour interactive game channel on its basic cable
service.  The channel costs C$19.95 a month, almost the cost of the
basic cable service itself.  Shaw launched the service in Victoria, BC,
and in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta.

Shaw officials peg the high costs as being the equivalent of purchasing
or renting C$3,000 worth of games.  To access the system, Shaw
subscribers will need a 16-bit Sega Genesis console.  Shaw will provide
the adapter needed to hook up the game gear to the cable system.

Sega Channel Canada is a 50/50 joint venture between Rogers and Shaw.
Rogers has rolled out the system in Vancouver, BC, and Newmarket, Ont.

Sega Channel Canada will start with 50 titles a month, rotating within
the Sega library of 700 games.  About 70 percent of the games will
change each month.  Successful titles will remain in circulation.

The channel will come with a Password for Parents which will allow
parents to set a time limit on how long the games can be played and
which games children can play.  The content of each game has been rated
by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.  Once Password is turned on
prohibited games cannot be downloaded.

Shaw officials stated that the reason for the limited launch was
because of a shortage of adapters and a desire to practise their
marketing techniques before hitting major eastern markets, slated for
Easter.

UNITED STATES:  DIGITAL PIRATES STRIKE DIRECTV

Leading experts believe that American DBS service DirecTv is under
attack by digital satellite pirates and that the underground trade in
pirate decoders may soon be draining off subscription revenues from one
of every two DBS receiving sets sold.

Bob Sherman of Satellite Business News claimed, "Piracy could become a
huge potential problem here.  It could become the biggest problem
facing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because there
is a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding down
distribution."

Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consulting
firm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespread
at this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of these
chips require a 26-week lead time." Sherman previously worked at
General Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where he
helped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.  Sherman estimates that it
cost $50 million to put an end to big dish piracy.

At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to
10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Shelton
believes it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "It
could become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will see
advertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If it
continues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing
100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legally
authorised."

The black market access cards are being sold for between $500-700.

DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two steps
ahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electronic
countermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton and
Sherman believe that DirecTv is not doing enough to thwart the digital
satellite pirates, however.  "Electronic counter-measures are a form of
harassment.  The only way to do it is to do a redesign, find out how
they came in and redesign the locks.  It costs about $25 million."

DirecTv refused to comment on the piracy issue, maintaining that
anything it says may betray their intentions to the pirate community.

The case came to light when US immigration and custom agents stopped a
man crossing the US border from British Columbia.  He was detained on a
cellular piracy case and found to be carrying 113 DirecTv access cards.

Canada is one of the centres for the manufacture of the illegal cards
due to previously lax piracy laws.  Now that Canada's laws have been
tightened up, the pirates are settling in the Cayman Islands.  Calgary,
Alberta, however, remains one of the manufacturing centres.

"Typically there are three stages to piracy," said Shelton.  "The first
is a simple cloning of a card authorising all programming.  The second
is called the `Three Musketeers', which uses one authorised card to get
the monthly keys and updates being broadcast.  The third is the `Wizard
Key', whereby the key from a working unit is extracted and distributed
to pirate boxes.  They are already moving into the third stage, which
is very fast."

JAPAN:  DMC GETS ITS OWN WAY

An advisory body of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT)
has started deliberations on revising the limit on the number of
channels a single broadcaster can operate from two to 12.  The Radio
Regulatory Council is also mulling whether to allow an increase in the
number of channels to be beamed by digital satellite service provider
DMC from 50 to 70 and radio channels from 100 to 200.

The current regulations were designed to prevent domination of scarce
analogue channels by a few big media players, but with the launch of
the JSAT-3 digital satellite in August 1995, the number of potential
channels will grow enormously, making room for many more channel
operators.  Also, a major drawing card for the new DMC service is
expected to be NVOD and pay-per-view, which require a large number of
channels per operator to be profitable.

Partly motivated by last year's announcement by Hughes Communications
and four Japanese partners of a plan to launch a 100-channel service in
1997, DMC has told the MPT that it wants to expand its channel bouquet
from 50 to 70, with many of the additional channels to be allocated to
NVOD and pay-per-view services.  Among the operators will be Itochu,
Mitsui & Co.  and other major trading companies.  DMC will begin test
broadcasts this April and commercial broadcasts this September.

DNC won the argument with the cable operators.  Based on the
negotiations of a working group, the board of the Japan Cable TV
Association (JCTA) has accepted a proposal by digital satellite service
provider DMC to have its planned 50-channel service distributed over
cable as well.

The working group had expressed JCTA's concern that DMC's digital
satellite bouquet, which is scheduled to start in June and which
closely resembles current cable offerings, might harm the diffusion of
cable TV.

Although many of the JCTA's 300 member stations are now enjoying growth
in subscriptions after years of recessionary stagnation, more than half
are still operating in the red and TV households receiving multichannel
cable still account for only five percent of the total number of
households.  Prior to the start of talks with DMC in September, JCTA
representatives told the media that the cable industry in Japan could
not easily cope with competition from a digital satellite service.

DMC countered with an offer to provide cable operators with antennas
and other receiving equipment free of charge so that they could relay
DMC broadcasts to their subscribers.  After some hesitation, the JCTA
working group accepted this proposal in November.  Although DMC balked
at a JCTA proposal refraining it from marketing its service in areas
already served by cable, it agreed to negotiate its marketing
arrangements with individual cable stations, paving the way for a
cooperative agreement.

EUROPE:  TALISMAN: DIGITAL PROTECTION

Two pan-European research projects -Talisman and Okapi - are to address
the new challenges presented to creators and rights holders by the
widespread use of digital technologies in the audiovisual industry.
This research is being carried out within the framework of the European
Union's Advanced Communications Technol-ogies and Services (ACTS)
project.

Talisman (Tracing Authors' rights by Labelling Image Services and
Monitoring Access Network) aims to protect EC service providers'
digital products against large-scale commercial piracy and illegal
copying with a standard copyright mechanism.  The project focuses on
video services and will demonstrate the relevance of the mechanisms
around pilot demonstrations covering media like cable and satellite
broadcasting as well as ATM networks for multimedia interactive service
access.

Two technologies are being considered for protecting video sequences.
The first involved the labelling of a digital product, compatible with
the compression standards JPEG for fixed images and MPEG for moving
images.  The tampering of such a protected product will leave "traces"
which invalidate the encrypted label.  The second technology involved
the application of invisible and indelible "tattoos" on the images,
resisting digital compression and decompression and any manipulation.
Both techniques can be used simultaneously.  Furthermore the project
includes the design of monitoring devices connected to networks
allowing on-line auditing and accounting.

One of the research consortium's key objectives is to submit to DAVIC
and DVB a standard copyright mechanism for video protection.  "The
availability of copyright systems managed in a harmonised way will be
essential for all the end users in the field: TV broadcasters,
producers of movies, cassettes, video CDs and interactive CDs," says
the project prospectus.

The project has been awarded to a consortium of 11 partners led by
French company Thomson-CSF and including Hispasat (Spain), CSELT
(Italy), EPFL (Switzerland), ART3000 (France), Fraunhofer Institut
Darmstadt (Germany), Institut Superior Tecnico (Portugal) and four
Belgian partners, Universite Catholique de Louvain, RTBF/UER,
Belgarchive and SACD.

Access control to networked multimedia service is specifically
addressed by the research project Okapi (Open Kernel for Access to
Protected Interoperable interactive services).  The objective is for
the Okapi kernel "to ensure interoperability, openness, equity, user
privacy and evolutivity for opening the European multimedia market to
every potential service provider and user," says the project spec
sheet.  The consortium behind the project will elaborate a standard
kernel for access control systems to be submitted to DAVIC, DVB as well
as the EBU.

Given the synergy between both research projects, several of the 12
Talisman partners are also present in the Okapi consortium.  Its
members include University of Thessaloniki (Greece), Deutsche Telekom
(Ge-rmany), CSELT (Italy), Philips (Nethe-rlands), CCETT (France), EPFL
(Swit-zerland), Fraunhofer Institut Darmstadt (Germany) and four
Belgian entities, RTBF/UER, Pastel (Mons), Universite de Liege and the
Universite Catholique de Louvain, the team leader.

USA:  WILL STATIONS GET ATV SPECTRUM?

Ironically, as the Grand Alliance and Advisory Committee on Advanced
Television Service (ACATS) celebrate the US digital broadcast standard,
the political process threatens to take from broadcasters the spectrum
on which the new standard would be delivered.

Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has
emerged as the chief foe of broadcasters' digital aspirations.  In
recent weeks he has attacked plans to provide broadcasters with a
second advanced TV channel as "corporate welfare" and threatened to
block the pending telecom deregulation bill unless the spectrum is
auctioned or broadcasters are otherwise made to pay for it.

The White House, meanwhile, has expressed support for a different
approach, which would auction broadcasters' existing analogue channels
as early as 2002.  Neither approach is considered acceptable by the
National Association of Broadcasters, which has come out in support of
the telecom bill.

In late January there were signs that the House could vote on the
telecom bill in early February and that the spectrum issue might be
removed from the bill, to be considered separately at some later date.

FRANCE:  FRENCH STATIONS IN DIGITAL LINK

To face Canal Plus, CLT's and AB's digital projects, the French public
broadcaster France Television and its rival TF1 have surprisingly
decided to join forces by creating a common company to set up and to
market digital services.  Named STEPS (Societe de Television Europeenne
de Programmes et de Services), the 50:50 subsidiary will establish a
common subscription system and a compatible settop box.

A similar deal was expected between AB and TF1, rather than with France
Television, because the two companies have worked together for many
years.  The move therefore comes as a surprise at a moment when
competition between the two companies is fiercer than ever, with TF1
losing viewers and France Television's share rising proportionately,
recovering to the level achieved ten years ago.  It will be the first
time since it was privatised in 1987, that the first terrestrial
network is working with its former parent company.

France Television's chairman Jean-Pierre Elkabbach announced that the
launch of digital services will be in two stages.  The first will be
the launch, next March, of an experimental MPEG-2 multiplex of existing
channels such as TF1, France 2, France 3, La Cinquieme and the wide-
screen station Supervision.  The package will be transmitted in the
clear via Eutelsat's Hot Bird.  Elkabbach said that "the choice of the
future digital decoder will probably be decided during the spring,
after we compare the different existing offers."

The TF1/FT digital venture is planned for launch before the end of the
year.

It is understood that the offer will integrate TF1's `Hyperchaone'
concept of digital e la carte TV and the two channels that state-owned
companies Arte, France Television and INA are close to launch on cable,
La Chaone d'Histoire and France Telefilm.  STEPS will market the whole
offer but representatives at the new joint-venture declined to comment
how the parent companies will share the subscriptions to their own
services.

JAPAN:  MARUBENI'S CABLE PC SERVICE

Major trading company Marubeni is getting ready to launch a new cable
TV service that will allow subscribers to use their TV set to access
the Internet, as well as enjoy conventional cable television
programming via a high-speed cable TV LAN.  Marubeni-owned Town
Television Kanazawa, which will begin operations in April, will be the
first to offer the service, starting some time in 1997.  Eventually,
Marubeni intends to extend it to the network of 15 to 20 cable stations
that it plans to build, beginning this year.

To design content for the data transmission portion of the service,
Marubeni will link with a US partner this March to start a planning
company.  In April, it will join with another US company to launch a
planning company for supplying contents for the video portion.  Both US
partners are still unnamed.

At the end of last year, Marubeni, together with Tokyo Cable Network,
IBM Japan, Sumitomo Electric Industrial and other corporate partners
began a trial of a cable TV LAN with 100 cable subscribers in Tokyo's
Bunkyo Ward.

Among the free services on offer during the trial are on-line English
conversation lessons and Internet connections.  The trial is scheduled
to run until the end of the year.  Based on the results, Town
Television will launch a commercial version of the service in 1997.
Using its high-capacity lines, the station will also offer subscribers
a wide range of other services, including video, data, telephone and
games.

Currently the owner of six cable stations, Marubeni plans to expand its
cable network to a total of 15 to 20 stations, primarily in the Tokyo
and Osaka metro areas.  One of the country's largest trading companies,
Marubeni sees the new service as giving a major boost to cable TV
diffusion in Japan.  In association with supermarket chain Daiei,
Marubeni is also selling personal computers installed with Internet
software.

UNITED STATES:  SNET MOVES INTO CATV

As leading US long distance phone companies make investments in DBS
(see front page story), local phone companies continue to pursue a
variety of strategies in the advanced TV arena.

Southern New England Telecom-munications (SNET), for example, recently
asked the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for a
statewide cable franchise.

The action marks a shift by SNET - which provides phone service to most
of Connecticut - from the video dialtone (VDT) common carrier model to
a strategy of becoming a franchised cable operator.  Among other
things, the latter approach offers more direct control over the
programming carried on a telco's broadband network.

The statewide cable franchise would be operated by a newly formed
subsidiary, SNET Personal Vision.  It would use a hybrid fibre-coax
(HFC) architecture that delivers video, voice and data.  It plans to
offer 76 channels of TV programming.

SNET is currently running an FCC-approved VDT trial that serves roughly
350 homes.

In explaining the shift from the VDT to the cable franchise model,
Patrice Listfield, president of SNET Personal Vision, said "we think
this represents the best business decision for us and for our
customers.  We'll provide the benefits of real cable competition sooner
this way.  And we'll be allowed to give our customers a more
competitive, innovative service on a network with superior technical
quality without some of the encumbrances placed on telephone companies
in the VDT business."

In parts of the state where SNET is not the local telephone company, it
intends to work with Nynex and Woodbury Telephone Company to "develop
arrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cable
alternative in those areas, too."

According to Listfield, the company expects to offer service to 22% of
Connecticut homes and businesses by the end of next year and 36% by
1998.  By 2000, service will be offered to 64% of Connecticut and by
2003, to 81%.  She said the company expects to reach the entire state
by 2009.

In neighboring New Jersey, Bell Atlantic has been busy working on the
most extensive VDT deployment to date and, on 29 January, it officially
launched the commercial service.  Bell Atlantic will make its VDT
system offering available to about 1,000 to 1,500 households per month
according to the construction schedule, ultimately passing all 38,000
homes and businesses in Dover Township.  It is the first commercial
deployment of a VDT service on a fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC) network.

In this final phase of testing, participants will begin using basic
interactive functions, such as ordering "recipes-on-request" from the
TV Food Network.  The latter is one of a package of channels offered by
FutureVision, one of seven video information providers planning to
deliver programming on the Dover network.

FutureVision, which has reserved the most capacity on the 384-channel
FTTC network, will undertake an intensive marketing campaign, including
substantial price discounting, with the goal of quickly capturing large
numbers of subscribers from the incumbent cable operators.

Meanwhile, on the country's other coast, Pacific Bell began 1996 by
halting construction of an HFC network it had begun deploying in Los
Angeles and Orange County.

While the company will continue building HFC networks in the Bay Area
and in San Diego, it apparently will rely on MMDS, or wireless cable,
for its near-term video strategy in the L.A.  and Orange County
markets.  Among the factors driving the decision were problems in
dealing with local officials and the combination of capital constraints
and intense competitive pressures that demanded accelerated HFC
buildouts in the Bay Area and San Diego markets.

EUROPE:  DVB DIGITAL NORM AGREED

A high-performance, widescreen standard for digital terrestrial
television has been ratified by the DVB.  The specifi-cation combines
interactivity with digital sound and picture quality.  It also provides
broadcasters with a two-carrier transmission option.

Ratification of the terrestrial standard completes the DVB line-up of
digital standards, which also cover cable and smatv (DVB-C, using QAM
modulation), satellite (DVB-S, using QPSK modulation), and MMDS (DVB-MC
for under 10GHz systems, using QAM modulation; over 10GHz, DVB-MS,
based closely on the DVB-S spec using QPSK and potentially receivable
via the same settop box).  The new terrestrial option, DVB-T, retains
COFDM modulation, but offers broadcasters the flexibility to choose
between 2k and 8k carriers.  The DVB steering board says the 2k option
will allow an early start for digital TV services in the UK (1997):
broadcasters who begin later (for example, in Spain) will have the
option of using the 8k variant, backwards compatible with the 2k
system.

The decision to adopt COFDM modulation has gone down particularly well
with manufacturer Pace.  With COFDM incorporated into the standard,
Pace is free to develop its common platform settop box which will allow
digital reception of satellite, cable or terrestrial transmissions.

JAPAN:  NTT THINKS INTERACTIVE

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and TV Interactive
Corporation (TVI), a US-based high-tech venture company, will cooperate
in the development and popularization of a service based on TVl's TVIQ,
a one-way infrared communications interface technology.

TVIQ, which is still under development, allows users to simply touch
pictures or drawings in a specially-printed sheet or booklet to view
motion pictures and other multimedia information stored on CD-ROM or an
other medium via their TV sets or personal computers.

NTT plans to use the TVIQ technology to develop multimedia services
"for elderly persons, children, housewives and other people who are
relatively unfamiliar with multimedia."

In the case of a mail order system, for example, a user could hold a
catalogue linked to a CD-ROM, via infrared signals and, while sitting
in front of a TV connected with a game machine, touch pictures in the
catalogue to receive detailed voice and motion-picture information
about products.  The user would touch a "purchase" button in the
catalogue to place an order using a telephone line.

NTT will invite companies from various fields to jointly study how to
utilize the new interface technology for commercial services.  NTT will
also develop a variety of applications in collaboration with other
companies, including NTT affiliates.

GERMANY:  UNCERTAINTY OVER CLT PLANS

Since Leo Kirch gave up his d-Box project to join the MMBG group, MMBG
members have begun to cancel their original plans.

The latest set of cancellations came from Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT).  Employees have told ATM that their company has
put a stop on nearly all hiring for the new digital project studio and
its Cologne marketing arm since last December.

The reason for the delays are said to be disagreement between the two
main shareholders Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) and Havas, and their
heads Albert Frere and Pierre Dauzier and CLT's new manager Michael
Delloye, following Delloye's recommendation that CLT invests a total of
DM1 billion ($695 million) in launching dozens of new digital packages
on Astra.  GBL's chairman Albert Frere is said to be ready to enter a
partnership with the giant Bertelsmann group.

Havas chairman Dauzier was able to get the agreement of the other
shareholders to have CLT join the Canal Plus digital venture with a 25%
stake in the form of staff, studios and programmes.  Originally, CLT
was to have entered the French market on its own.

This still leaves CLT's considerable stake in the German market in a
state of uncertainty and initial plans for 1996 appear to have been
shelved.  Roland Steindorf, marketing manager for RTL-Direct - a CLT
digital package marketing project in Cologne, Germany - denied these
rumours.  "Nothing has happened to alter our plans to enter the German
market with a digital TV bouquet this year." He also denied that the
stop on hiring that his department has implemented since December has
anything to do with these rumours.

USA:  ALLIANCES IN SETTOP SECTOR

General Instrument, the leading supplier of cable TV converters, and
FORE Systems, a leader in ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networking
products, have formed an alliance to jointly develop a high-speed ATM-
based system for use in the hybrid fibre-coax (HFC) networks now being
built by cable operators and some telephone companies.

The move was seen as an endorsement by a leading cable equipment
supplier of the concept of delivering ATM cells all the way to the
home.  The ATM system being developed is designed to link computers at
speeds up to 25 megabits per second, which would enable delivery of
real-time full motion video to home PCs.  It could also be used to
deliver video and multimedia content in ATM format to TV settops.

According to Mike Ozburn, vice president and general manager of GI's
Telecommunications Network Systems Division, GI will work with FORE to
develop an end-to-end ATM system.  The development partnership was
applauded by Craig Mundie, Microsoft senior vice president Consumer
Systems Division.  Noting that "Microsoft has worked closely with FORE
on ATM technology and standards..and with GI on settop box technology,"
Mundie said the partnership will "help speed Microsoft's efforts to
bring new services to PCs and televisions."

Scientific Atlanta, GI's chief rival in the analogue cable converter
market, also announced some new allies in the digital arena.

The company said its PowerKEY digital conditional access system - to be
used in settop terminals and cable modems - will use software licensed
from RSA Data Security and Cylink Corporation.

RSA's license to S-A is the first to a settop manufacturer of the
company's patented technique for private messaging and digital
signature authentification.

JAPAN:  NIPPON TV GOES DIGITAL

Nippon Television Network, Japan's highest-rated commercial TV network,
is mulling the launch of its own digital broadcasting service using the
JCSAT-3 satellite.  Initially, NTV would beam the same programming as
the one currently broadcast nationwide on its analogue terrestrial
network, but it is also planning tests of data, telephony and other
multimedia services.

Although NTV was considering joining the 50 digital channel-bouquet to
be offered this fall by digital satellite service provider DMC, it may
instead lease its own transponder for a period of three years.  One
reason is that the broadcaster wants to conduct a wide range of digital
transmission tests.  Another is money: broadcasting via satellite is
at, Y300 million ($2.86 million) a year, considerably cheaper than
building masts and ground stations to upgrade its network of local
affiliates.  "We have not made a final decision, but this is an option
we are seriously considering," an NTV spokesman said.  "We have also
not yet decided how many channels or what kind of services we will
broadcast."

FRANCE:  REPORT SLAMS FRENCH TELCO

French minister for Posts, Telecom-munications and Space, Francois
Fillon, unveiled at the beginning of January the main points of the
report he ordered last September from Georges Vanderchmitt, a former
adviser of French audit body Cour des Comptes.  Fearing that France
could miss out in the digital race by having too many digital bouquet
projects, Fillon demanded a clear overview of the country's policy on
satellite telecommunications.

The Vanderchmitt report recommends the creation of a "digital super
alliance'' between all the major French players, (public and private)
with broadcasters' access to the settop boxes ensured "under fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions".  The report insists on
the necessity to guarantee competition among the players inside the
alliance while having a strong policy on an external offer.  Thanks to
digital technology, the latter should be adapted to the different
geographical zones it targets.

Vanderchmitt foresees that the digital market should be supervised
together by the CSA and the Conseil de la Concurrence (competition
body).

Fillon revealed that he has ordered another report from former TDF
general director Philippe Levrier on whether or not to develop digital
terrestrial television.

USA:  SI DIAMOND'S LCD ADVANCES

SI Diamond Technology (SIDT), which is developing a flat panel Diamond
Field Emission Display (DFED), has announced a breakthrough in high
intensity lighting that promises improved backlighting for LCDs (liquid
crystal display), which today dominate the flat panel market.
Northlight Displays, an SIDT subsidiary, has used diamond-coated
cathodes to produce a high luminance lamp without the use of a heated
filament.  The result, says the company, is a more efficient, easy-to-
manufacture high intensity lighting source.

Most high-intensity lights used in specialised applications provide
luminance in the 1,000-6,000 footlambert range.  High-luminance
backlights employing heated cathodes can reach about 10,000
footlamberts and are currently used for avionic AMLCD (active matrix
LCD) applications.  However, these devices are relatively inefficient
and have other environmental limitations.

According to SIDT, the lamp assembly tested by Northlight exceeds
luminance of 20,000 footlamberts.  Howard Schmidt, SIDT chairman and
CEO says the company is "currently in the process of developing sealed
units and evaluating our options for commercializing this technology,
while at the same time continuing development of the DFED."

UK:  UK LAUNCH FOR SEGA CHANNEL

The first dedicated end-to-end games delivery system in the UK is
expected to be Telewest Communication's roll out of the Sega Games
Channel in its South East UK franchise area, which had been forecast to
launch last year.

A formal announcement of a new release date is expected imminently
following renewed negotiations between TCI International (a major
stakeholder in Telewest) and Sega Enterprises over licensing and
royalties.

Some 25 leading Sega games will be available to subscribers who will
simply plug an adapter into the cartridge slot of the Sega Megadrive
consoles - or a special module into the new General Instruments 2200
settop box.  The Sega Channel module would cost around $200.  The
system incorporates parental controls and code to block transmission of
unsuitable titles.

Because the channel occupies a narrow bandwidth it can be used
alongside existing networked channels featuring a wide tuning range,
and narrow band data camers.  Cable companies would transmit the games
via their optical fibre cable on an unlimited access basis to
subscribers paying $15 to $18 per month, using a dedicated $22,500
headend server.

Sega games service set boxes are now available for European MSOs, and
the channels are expected to launch in Europe during Autumn.  Flextech,
controlled by TCI, would have the rights to launch Sega games channels
in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Denmark, and the move is in
line with Flextech's plans to develop new programming for cable and
satellite.

CHALLENGES OF SELLING 16/9 SETS

Widescreen television enthusiasts point to France where the installed
base of 16/9 sets accounts for half of the European total.  Of late,
the attraction of the product seems to be under question as falling
sales figures show.  Yves Dupre offers a personal, and candid, view of
the symptoms and remedies

It was in 1991 that 16/9 television receivers were first introduced on
to the French market by Thomson which, at that time, was a pioneering
and risky move.

However, at the beginning of the 90s, projects were still being carried
out in Europe on high definition television and this launch was to a
large extent linked to these.

16/9 receivers were initially quite expensive, starting at the same
price as a Fiat Panda car.  This did not stop them capturing the `early
adopters', customers who were wealthy enough to snap up new ideas, but
who were not representative of the actual buying trends.

A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then; high definition is
no longer news.  Television is now turning towards digital technology,
the "opportunity for the 16/9" (which has failed to touch the public's
imagination), as well as multimedia which has literally exploded, but
in which the large screen does not occupy a privileged position.  For
their part, consumers themselves have changed since the first 16/9 sets
appeared on the scene.  This is due to economic problems.  Their
motivations and habits have been radically changed.  Without high
definition, and despite these changes, manufacturers have kept their
ranges and even extended them.  Large screen TV sets can be found in
practically all retail outlets, and generally a specialist shop or
large store has several models depending upon size, from three to six
models on average.

Personally speaking and as a journalist specialising in retailing, I
visit points of sale practically very day.  Through the confidences of
contacts and friends throughout the business I began to suspect that
sales of large screen televisions were experiencing a few problems.
There are however signs which are not misleading.  For example, I
observed that a certain number of points of sale, not all of course but
enough to set me thinking, are displaying them at the back of the
store.  I am not saying at the front of the display but well to the
bottom of the shelf and I know that the items which sell well are not
generally consigned to the back of the store.

At the present time we professionals must not avoid the facts.  Despite
considerable efforts on the part of the manufacturers the results for
the sales of 16/9 sets are quite bad.  In France, the first three
quarters of 1995 were marked by an appreciable downturn for the 16/9
sets of at least 12%, perhaps even more - 15% say certain observers -
expressed in terms of the numbers of sets sold.  This information has
come from the best sources.  There is no point in saying that as far as
turnover is concerned and with the remorseless price competition, a
decline which is even more significant in terms of value has been
ascertained.  It is a phenomenon all the more disquieting as it is
happening at the same time as sales of the larger sizes of screen are
growing (the 27-inch model, for example, increased by more than 20%).

I should add that the social problems which are troubling France at the
present time are in the process of completely ruining the end-of-year
sales figures, at the most important time of the season.

In France, we must therefore face the truth that the large screen is
not managing to capture the hearts and minds of the public.

Some of you will find these figures amazing because we have heard other
speeches where larger amounts and considerable increases were announced
by the manufacturers.  The problem is that we must not confuse the
quantities being shipped by the manufacturers to the retailers and the
products being sold to consumers.  The number of models on sale had
widened to a large extent between autumn `94 and `95, but especially
towards the end of `94.  At the same time, a large number of points of
sale finally put the 16/9 sets on their shelves, particularly as, at
this time, the prices of the products had fallen significantly.  From
the price of a Fiat Panda we had reached that of a modest mountain
bike.  In France, there are about 1,000 hypermarkets, 2,000 specialist
stores and about 5,000 specialists points of sale.  That makes 7,000 to
8000 points of sale currently dealing with TV sets.  By supplying only
five display models per shop, throughout the whole of this retailing
sector, that makes between 30,000 and 40,000 sets sold to the shops,
but not necessarily sold to the consumers.  The manufacturers' figures
were therefore correct or just slightly overestimated.  But sales to
the consumer, that's another story altogether.

There is one important calculation to enable us to get a better picture
of what the 16/9 represents for the stockists.  Today, all the
observers acknowledge that the large screens do not exceed 2% of the
total television market.  If we estimate this market on the high side,
say 3.5 million sets, this means a maximum of 70,000 large screens a
year.  But if you divide this quantity by the number of points of
sales, you see that each of them on average only sells 10 sets a year
which is not even one a month.

A certain degree of caution is called for when examining the course of
action taken by the European manufacturers against what they say in
public: if Philips and Thomson are multiplying the initiatives for the
sizes already launched, Thomson has finally deferred the launch of its
"small" 16/9 whilst Nokia has quite simply temporarily withdrawn from
the large TV market.  Many eyes are now turned towards Germany as it is
expected that it will be the "trend-setter" with Palplus.

But let's forget the figures and look at the noticeable change in
consumers' habits.  We must unfortunately record that this
transformation is not favourable to the way in which 16/9 sets are
being offered for sale at the moment as economic difficulties and
unemployment are on the increase.  By and large, consumers are also not
quite as young, already quite well equipped and more mature in their
thinking.  They have become more moderate and attentive when making
their purchases.  They only go for sound values, and what is more, at
the best price.  They are well informed and remorselessly reject
products which do not bring them concrete and tangible benefits.  They
have dreams of the future, but buy in the present.

Large screens are present at the points of sale, but salespeople
testify to the fact that customers know little about them.  Often they
realise that new screens exist when facing the shelves.  And department
managers say that customers who come to buy a good television often go
away with nothing if they only start to hesitate between a widescreen
and a normal one.  Perhaps this hesistant customer must replace his
television which has suddenly broken down.  In this case, instead of
opting for an expensive set, he is happy with a cheap one which is not
good for the sales teams who make their living thanks to a percentage
on the sales realised.  In short, if a salesperson does not want to
lose a sale it is often better not to talk about the 16/9 set too much.

Even if the products are really superb, as far as the layman is
concerned this simple increase in the picture width is only considered
as very modest progress.

Consumer electronics equipment available in the shops today offers a
real revolution for everyone from the small telephones which can be
slipped into your pocket and which enables you to communicate
throughout Europe, right up to the fascinating applications made in
computers and CD-Rom, for example, where sales are exploding.  In this
instance it is not 10 sales a year, but 10 a day.  Even in the field of
pictures, video projectors and home cinema systems with Dolby sound or
THX, as in large halls, sales are high and are transforming people's
leisure time.

There is no point, here, to debate whether widening the TV screen is
justified or not.  Everything revolves round one unique problem: it is
the lack of programmes for the new format.  That is the crux of the
matter for the 16/9 format.

No programme can be picked up for the time being with just a receiver:
one needs at least a satellite or cable system, equipment which is not
very widespread in France.  And since our theme was entitled "what
marketing strategy for large screens", we should not hesitate to say
that the question boils down to the marketing of 16/9 programmes.

Well, then, what are we going to do about large screens? There is much
talk about modifying the size of films received in letter box, about
stretching them on to the screen to fill it.

I must say somewhat critically that I am very much against this myself
because the retail stores tend to use this zooming effect on a
conventional 4/3 set to fill in a demonstration 16/9 model.  Even if
certain manufacturers are tempted to convince us that many programmes
are "zoomable", this is incorrect.  Television does not just show
films.  The bulk of the programming is something other than films.

If the 4/3 picture is stretched, the characters appear squashed or the
heads and feet of the dancers are cut off.  Customers who wander around
the department see these faults.

And it is a poor solution: in intellectual terms no-one can say that he
can be satisfied with cocking a snook at logic.  We have not really
created such efficient products to resign ourselves to only showing
normal pictures in a deformed version.

The example of Japan is often quoted to me.  This formula seems to work
there but in Japan the 16/9 set also benefits from the large screen
video game market.  And for my part I know that European customers are
neither Japanese nor American customers.

Europeans are more demanding.  There is plenty of proof of this all
around us.  Our industries have been successful with products which are
largely more sophisticated than in many other parts in the world; our
fast trains, our planes, our numerical cellular telephones and even our
audovisual are much more efficient.

Returning to our theme of marketing for the 16/9, my thoughts suddenly
turn to vehicles which run on liquid petroleum gas, the famous LPG
which France is going to try to relaunch in 1996.  LPG is economical,
non-polluting, does not make the engine noisy, does not make our hands
dirty, does not smell bad.  With all these drivers said bravo but added
that LPG can be found practically nowhere; simply install the pumps
then we can adopt this mode of transport.  I believe we must similarly
install pumps for programmes.

To develop the 16/9 format the manufacturers must obviously get heavily
involved, as a matter of urgency, in a mass broadcasting of programmes
using the existing channels.  Manufacturers who are proposing large
screen television receivers are not so timid about programmes in many
other areas.

Some of them have bought film studios or are amongst the principal
phonographic editors in the world.  They have not hesitated to launch
programme divisions to create software intended for multimedia.

They will have to grab the market with both hands and do the same for
television as a matter of urgency; become creators and broadcasters of
large screen programmes (it can even be done profitably).

It is also necessary that they think about editing; films on cassettes,
when they are in cinemascope which is often the case, will have to
receive systematically a small logo indicating to the consumer "better
on 16/9".  Even a note for the videodisc.  What problem would, say,
Philips have in introducing the idea of a 16/9 screen on its CD-i or
even its video CD.

It is not providence which is going to enrich the 16/9 world.  As
things stand at the moment, I am very much afraid that the promoters of
the large screen will have to invest a lot of money over a long period
of time before they can impose the new form of screen.  And for how
long? It took between 15 to 20 years for colour television to become
commonplace in France.

I suggest that the industrialists and programme professionals get
together to create a world of pictures which can very quickly, and
without too much investment, become large enough to motivate the
customers.

This period should be considered as a time for pioneers and we must
live and act like them.  Don't wait for governments, committees or even
the Holy Spirit of favourable initiatives.

We must roll up our sleeves and I am sure that if things take off we
will be saying in one or two years time that consumers are becoming
increasingly worried about buying something other than a large screen.

In a word, television receivers are here to stay.  All it takes is for
the show to start.

NTT BREAK UP

An advisory body to Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
has agreed on a plan to break up the nation's largest telecom, NTT,
into a long-distance and several regional telephone companies.  The
members of the MPT's Telecommunications Council believe that such a
plan would promote greater competition and more effective management in
the telecommunications industry, which NTT currently dominates.  At the
end of February the Telecommuni-cations Council will issue a report
detailing how the divestiture should be carried out, including the
number of new regional telecoms.  However, a report by the Economic
Planning Agency, opposing NTT's divestiture, expressed concern that a
breakup of NTT will cause Japan to fall even further behind the US in
the race to build an information superhighway.

DAVIC VOTES TO APPROVE RELEASE 1.0

The 205-member DAVIC (Digital Audio-Visual Council) group voted to
approve Release 1.0, its first set of end-to-end ITV protocol
recommendations, at a meeting in Berlin in mid-December with the
intention of passing the data along to the International Standards
Organization for approval as a world standard.  Because of their
growing popularity, cable modems were the focus of attention of DAVIC
as well.  By the next meeting, slated for March in Seoul, South Korea,
DAVIC must achieve sufficient consensus on the cable-modem and data-
delivery protocols to issue a document for circulation among members.
Given the organization's commitment to meeting the needs of multiple
networks, this means the agreed-upon protocols must work in non-cable
environments, such as telco's fiber-to-the-curb and ADSL networks.

would also reply to the Consumer Council's report, just published.  The
Consumer Council suggested a number of changes including a new policy
secretary to handle broadcasting, telecommunications and communications
technology.  Officials admitted the distinction between broadcasting
and telecommunications was getting blurred but they stressed the two
branches co-operated satisfactorily.  Telecommunications are handled by
the Economic Services Branch.

BOB DOLE TO BLOCK CONTROVERSIAL MOVE

Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, is fighting to block a
controversial move that would set aside a valuable slice of the
airwaves to be used for a new generation of digital services, including
HDTV.  Dole argues that a provision in the new telecommunications bill,
backed by the Republicans, is "giant corporate welfare".  In effect,
the bill gives broadcasters new digital licences, which he values at
between $12.5 billion and $70 billion, for free.  The National
Association of Broadcasters is urging President Clinton to overrule
Dole's demand that they pay for the airwave space.

US MARKET FOR INTERACTIVE TELEVISION TO EXPLODE

The emergent US market for interactive television equipment and
software will explode, growing by more than ten times from $2.3 billion
in 1995 to nearly $25 billion by the year 2001, projects a new study
released by Frost & Sullivan.  Network equipment will form 52 percent
of the massive 2001 market, subscriber equipment 42 percent and
software 6 percent, forecasts the report titled; US Interactive
Television Equipment and Software Markets: Emerging Market With
Unlimited Growth Potential.  With ATM currently the only switching
platform usable by the interactive TV industry, the growth of private
ATM networks will in turn stimulate demand for interactive TV.

DTI PROPOSALS FOR DIGITAL TV

The UK's Department of Trade and Industry has published its proposals
for the regulation of conditional access systems - scrambling,
encryption and subscriber management - for digital television.  The
regulation of conditional access, as required by the EC Directive on
Television Standards, would be by way of licences issued under the
Telecommunications Act and enforced by Oftel, "in close co-operation
with the ITC." The government has refused the ITC's request to regulate
conditional access, saying this is because conditional access works
through data streams carried over telecoms networks, and that these
networks are a key part of the delivery of pay-TV.

PCTV equipment sales have been so bad in the UK that Time Computer
Systems has withdrawn its range.  Time - which claims to be the UK's
largest direct supplier of computers - has been selling PCTVs since
July.  Instead, it is now offering multimedia PCs with optional PCTV
cards.  John Clare, group chief executive of Dixons Stores Group, has
also found PCTV sales sluggish, although in line with expectations,
with TV cards the preferred option.  "Customers don't see the PC and TV
as the same product," he said.

Sales of video-on-demand servers will increase from $131 million in
1994 to more than $1.3 billion in the year 2000, according to Video-On-
Demand - Technology and Economics, a new report from Hodge Computer

and cable television operators, the report concludes.  Hodge predicts
that VOD server pricing will fall from $1.35 million in 1995 to
$797,000 in 2000.  NVOD deliveries are expected to drop from $350,000
in 1995 to $206,000 at the end of the decade.

a planned Taiwanese satellite television station, a spokesman for the
station said.  All People's TV, whose founders hope will become
Taiwan's first new television station since liberalisation of the

which the ruling Nationalist Party, the Taiwan Provincial Government,
the Education Ministry and the Defence Ministry hold major stakes.
Many of the founders the All People's TV are members of the main

TOUGH 1997 AHEAD, SAYS CHUA ROBERT CHUA SHARES HIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON
ASIA WITH NEAL WEINSTOCK

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

"It's very tough going now in Asia," says Robert Chua. Chua is the
founder and CEO of the Hong Kong-based, Chinese language, family
entertainment channel, CETV.

Though CETV's programming philosophy is, "no sex, no violence, no
politics", Chua is one of the more refreshingly candid TV industry
leaders in the region.

A Singaporean who felt he had to move to Hong Kong to work in the
industry, who then had a large part in building TVB's programming
dominance, and who now runs what a recent independent survey calls
the top-rated overseas satellite channel in China, Chua also has a
uniquely broad perspective on Asian TV.

On Western-based programme services in China: "I know that
(Disney's) ABC has had a lot of problems." The company's two
locally produced programmes, Panda Club and Dragon Club, "are going
downhill. Some stations are dropping them. That's going to be
happening to all the Western companies in China.

"The profits aren't what they thought it could be when they went
in."

On running an international satellite service: "I want to just
concentrate on mainland China now. To tell the truth, people are
not going to spend one single cent to advertise on us just to reach
an audience in Indonesia.

"Taiwan is weak for us, too they want to see more sex and violence,
when we have to focus on being a family channel. Even a family
channel means very different things from country to country, so I
don't think an international channel makes so much sense now."

CETV is a fascinating example in how ownership and programming
inter-relate, and how they often do not.

Chua sold a large minority stake in CETV last year to International
Family Entertainment (IFE), the parent of America's and Europe's
Family Channels and a large producer of programming. IFE is owned
by US Christian television preacher and conservative activist Pat
Robertson, who may seem a strange bedfellow for a mainland Chinese
channel.

Yet the only cultural conflict in the relationship so far, says
Chua, has been the one that would be most obvious to viewers - and
least obvious, perhaps, to international TV executives: "A family
channel in the West has very different values than in Asia.

To date we have not taken any of IFE's programmes. There are two
reasons for that. Number one, the family values are different.
Number two, what we are prepared to pay. We can only afford low
fees for shows."

Nonetheless, CETV carries many imported programmes: National
Geographic, films from Hallmark and ACI, Venezuelan telenovelas
from Coral Pictures, many cartoons, and an "edited version" of
NHK's business report.

"Content-wise, we are very much curtailed," he continues. "We have
to be very, very creative. We have to spend lots of time on
programming. Otherwise we'd become an educational channel. That's a
very close thing to a family channel in China, very different than
the West."

One new example of CETV programming is the two-part documentary,
"Hong Kong: Countdown to July 1, 1997." With a plan to focus on
visual changes and residents' feelings, Chua is resolute in
maintaining that this series on a most political event will be
"soft news, non-political." That's a hard balancing act to pull
off.

More on the Hong Kong changeover: "After '97, we'll consider a move
to mainland China. I want to establish and run a professional
outfit here (in Hong Kong) first, that can manage a move of part of
the operation to someplace like Guangzhou later on. We're running
160 staff now, you know. That's a very lean operation."

On international channels in general, and English-language channels
especially: "There are so many channels going now to Asia. We are
all having very tough going right now. There are too many English
channels now, really.

"Do you know where the market is for all these English-language
channels? I don't know where there are so many people who speak
English. Doing Chinese channels is not easy, though. There's not
enough talent. There's no way for new channels to get onto cable;
getting penetration is very difficult."

On advertising: Chua has a very happy story to tell these days,
with the China-based X&L Marketing Service having recently released
a 14-city study showing CETV to be the highest-rated overseas
satellite channel in Chinese cable homes.

Still, "The ad market is tough because of ratings in China; there
are no good ratings services yet. We are now putting our act
together. We've just changed our advertising and sales department;
it's 90 per cent changed from a year ago."

On why TVB's growth has slowed in recent years: "Maybe losing S.K
Fung (to NBC) was a big reason."

On Singapore's TV business environment: "Singapore's opening up.
There are a lot of benefits now for the industry, tax benefits, for
example. But there are not enough people in production. Hong Kong
has more than 10,000 local talent in the TV industry; 3,000 at TVB
alone, 3,000 in the studios. Well over 10,000. Singapore is still
importing people. It should have developed local talent a long time
ago. Now, there's no reason why it can't get there, but it takes
time.

"Also, Singapore in the past had too much government control. Even
now that TCS is supposed to be privatised, there can't really be
enough competition without separating control of channel 5 and
channel 8.

"There's truly not enough competition. I did ask three years ago
for a terrestrial licence there, and we've not yet gotten it. I'd
give them a run for their money."

On Asian stations and TV technology: "I don't think our level in
Asia is up to the West's. We're a new station and we need to keep
spending down, find ways to produce things cheaply. Not everyone
has that need, though. Look at CPN; they spent US$30 million on
just technology for everything digital.

"It's wonderful to have that, if you have the money. If not, well,
we don't do news, so we can get by cheaper. We don't need digital;
simple programmes don't require it. Instead, we spend on talent,
which is quite limited."  '

MINERVA INTROS DVD ENCODING SOLUTION

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Minerva Systems has introduced the Compressionist 250 for the
creation of digital video disc (DVD) video assets.

The DVD format expands the capacity of 5-inch discs to 4.7 Gb - or
133 minutes of high-quality MPEG-2 compressed digital video and AC-
3 or MPEG-2 surround sound audio with multiple language sub-titles
on a single-sided version of the back-to-back bonded disc.

The 250, based on C-Cube Microsystems' VLSI processors, offers both
Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) MPEG-2 encoding
technology combined with Minerva's video pre-processing and control
software tools.

Minerva's DVD encoding system also supports leading third-party AC-
3 and MPEG-2 audio encoders, and DVD authoring and disc formatting
tools.

When encoding film-originated content for NTSC delivery, the unit's
inverse telecine feature accurately restores the incoming video's
24 frames per second during the encoding process.

The 250's application control software, Minerva Studio, provides an
easy-to-use interface for both single-pass and multi-pass MPEG-2
VBR encoding.

In multi-pass mode, the Compressionist 250 first profiles the video
sequence by gathering statistics and determines the optimum
allocation of the available bits to the compressed sequence.

In the second pass, the Minerva encoder performs real-time encoding
while controlling the bit rate according to the bit allocation
strategy determined in the first pass.

Optionally, Minerva Studio control software enables users to
optimize and reencode the video source based on their artistic
judgment.

The 250 supports D1, YUV, S-Video and composite video input and
video resolutions up to the CCIR 601 digital standard for NTSC (720
x 240 at 60 fields per second) and PAL (720 x 288 at 50 fields per
second) and variable compressed data rates ranging from 2 to
10Mbps.

The unit is currently shipping with a base system price of
US$99,000.

QUESTECH 1012 DECODER NOW WITH SYNCHRONISER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

QUESTECH's 1012 composite to serial digital encoder is now
available with a plug-in synchroniser option which provides a
separately timed output from the decoder, effectively making it two
products in one.

As a decoder, the unit provides a quality interface between
composite and serial digital component video equipment. It accepts
both analogue and optionally, digital (D2 or D3 format) inputs and
outputs signals.

The 1012 is the first decoder from the manufacturer which handles
all variants of PAL and NTSC signals and complements the company's
existing range of interface products. The unit digitises incoming
analogue signals with 10 bit resolution.  All signals processing
and conversions are then performed digitally.

A full bandwidth adaptive comb filter decoder separates the
luminance and chrominance signals in the digital domain and the
signals are transparently rate converted, interleaved and
serialised to form the output signal. EDH coding is incorporated to
assist in system evaluation and quality control.

The synchroniser is controlled from menu-driven front panel
controls and can either be used to retime the unit decoder output,
or a separate auxiliary output.  It is compatible with 50Hz and
60Hz systems and allows freezing on either field.

Output timing can be adjusted throughout an entire video frame.

DPA4060 MINIATURE MIC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

POSSIBLY the smallest product launch of 1996, the new
omnidirectional DPA4060 from Danish Pro Audio has been designed for
use with wireless systems in theatres or on television, wherever
microphones need to be mounted on a performer.

It will fit most VHF and UHF systems for professional use, and is
rather robust.

The unit uses a new 5.4mm pre-polarised condenser cartridge with a
vertical diaphragm. It can handle SPLs to a maximum of 134dB, and
has an on-axis frequency response of 20Hz to 20kHz +/-2dB.

It has a dynamic range of 97dBA (THD = 1%) and there is 13dB of
headroom before clipping occurs.

Connection options include factory mounted connectors for the most
popular systems, or the 'pig tail' (without connectors).

HP TEST SOLUTION FOR DIGITAL SET-TOP BOXES, DEVICES

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Hewlett-Packard recently introduced at IBC 96, the industry's first
test source designed to help equipment manufacturers and cable TV
operators bring new digital-video products and services to market
quickly and efficiently.

The test source, the HP E4441A DVB QAM coder, is designed to help
set-top box and device makers develop and produce high-quality
Digital Video Broadcasting-Cable (DVB-C)-compliant equipment.

The new coder operates in conjunction with HP's latest family of
ESG signal generators to provide a reference radio-frequency (RF)
signal. This signal can be modified and impaired in a controlled
manner to test the limits of receiver design and improve
manufacturing process control. The HP E4441A also is designed to
help cable TV operators optimize network performance and manage
interoperability issues.

The manufacturers believe that the HP E4441A DVB QAM coder will
become an important part of any Bit-Error-Rate (BER) test system
because it can be configured to perform a variety of tests to give
users maximum test coverage. Users can easily change symbol rate,
constellation size and channel coding at the touch of a button.

The unit generates extremely accurate QAM (Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation) signals, which can be impaired in a calibrated manner.

The amount of noise, added to the signal internally, can be
controlled to characterize receivers and networks. Users also may
test DVB-C network equipment in ideal or non-ideal signal
conditions to get "real-world" test data.

The new coder is the result of HP's continued work within the DVB
Project, an industry consortium organized to set standards for
delivering compressed digital video.

The DVB Measurements Group, which develops measurement techniques
and definitions, is an important link for enabling the rapid
deployment of new digital-video services using DVB-C technology.

NEWSWORKS TURBO NOW WITH BETACAM SP QUALITY

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Delivering Beta-SP equivalent picture quality to newsroom users,
the new Newsworks Turbo editing system was launched recently by
Tektronix at IBC '96.

Fully integrated with the classic 'intuitive' user-interface
featured in all Lightworks editing systems, its major applications
include 'direct to air' operations. Immediately available, it is
targeted both as low-cost, low maintenance stand-alone replacement
for existing tape-based linear suites and as a key component of
large-scale automated and networked newsroom systems.

The new introduction is offered as a chargeable option for existing
Newsworks editing system customers. The system effective doubles
the first version's Hi-Res performance to the near Beta-SP level of
5 minutes per Gigabyte  - 10 minutes previously - or equivalent to
4:1 compression running at around 24 Mbit/s.

This is achievedby stripping alternative fields of video
information - and similarly audio channels - over a pair of
material hard drives. For the user, across a single pair, this
provides for a continuous recording of up to 20 minutes - or up to
40 minutes at the 10 minutes per Gigabyte standard.

Fully 'backwards' compatible with earlier 10-minutes per Gigabyte
non-striped material, Turbo will also support mixed compression
rates within the same project or edit.

It employs industry-standard storage options - 9Gb drives in a
variety of configurations up to 90 Gb in a standard unit and
expandable externally via SCSI driver cards to 180 Gb.

Central to the system's ability to deliver the full value of non-
linear editing to the newsroom and achieve significant gains in
operational speed, is the 'Edit-to-It' feature.

This allows direct editing of late arriving tapes with select, trim
and preview on tape under console control. Once selected, material
- with handles - is digitised via a simple commit command and is
available for immediate or future changes.

'Edit-to-It' will also now control a channel of Tek's Profile
Professional Disk Recorder (PDR). This allows Profile PDR-stored
material to be accessed directly and employed in an edit
immediately.

Other key benefits include further operational acceleration with
direct 'voice-over record'.

This allows recording of a single audio channel while playing other
picture and sound channels at an edit station simultaneously (or
recording a picture while sound is playing); direct 'Play-to-Air'
either under manual, newsroom computer or external control from an
automation system via RS422 emulating a BVW75 VTR. New as well is
'StripView', a visual timeline representing both pictures and sound
in the cut and allowing individual shot identification and dynamic
trims and changes.

In addition, the Turbo is supplied as standard with eight real
internal digital audio channels - expandable externally via one or
two Pro Sound boxes.

The Newsworks Turbo systems are immediately available world-wide.

NEW THOMSON PRODUCTS AT IBC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

TWO of several new products that Thomson Broadcast Systems
introduced at IBC were the Microcam split head compact camera and
4005 dockable Betacam SX recorder.

The Microcam, for ENG or EFP applications, is based on the 1657
camera, with the CCD block used remotely to provide a small and
very manoeuverable camera. The CCD block can be re-mounted on the
camera body for conventional use.

The Microcam is useful in many shooting situations, in particular
when the cameraman is in an awkward position, such as on a
motorcycle or concert platform, yet still wants to be creative with
shooting angles.

Its small size makes it suited to remotely controlled or robotic
applications such as parliamentary broadcasting, where it is
discreet in operation, as well as to crane and jib use.

The Microcam is the only compact camera on the market that is
available in 16/9 format today.

The new 4005 Dockable Betacam SX recorder is connected to the 1657
camera in the same way as the 3505 Betacam SP recorder, with
digital recording to maintain the quality of the picture produced
by the 1657.

Recording is 4:2:2 digital component at 8 bit resolution, using the
MPEG-2 4:2:2 Studio Profile level compression algorithm.

SGI DEBUTS MULTI-CHANNEL SERVER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Silicon Graphics has announced that it will debut its Multi-Channel
Playback (MCP). The MCP Server enables the management, scheduling
and playout of multiple-channels of stored MPEG-2 compressed
digital video, audio and data.

The MCP Server is designed to meet the needs of multi-channel
service providers such as broadcast, satellite and cable TV
networks and operators.

In addition to the expansion of the traditional broadcast market,
multi-channel playout is key to the growth of the emerging Near
Video on Demand (NVOD) market, which offers viewers closely
staggered start times of movies as well as special pay-per-view
events.

The enabling technology of the MCP Server is Silicon Graphics
multi-channel playback software. The software's open, object-
oriented architecture is completely scaleable, allowing from 10 to
over 300 output streams and more than 1,000 hours of compressed
video storage.

The MCP software is network-independent, supporting any network
topology. Networks supported include satellite and terrestrial
services such as Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services and
Hybrid-Fibre Coax .

The MCP Server will be generally available in January 1997.

TEK LIGHTWORKS VIP 4500 AT IBC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Designed to bring the benefits of the nonlinear revolution to the
owners and users of online suites, the Lightworks VIP 4500 editing
system - the first of a new generation of online broadcast editing
solutions from Tektronix - was launched at IBC '96.

Aimed at replacing conventional multiple-VTR online tape-based
editing systems in broadcast television and facilities companies
the Lightworks VIP 4500 system offers a smooth and cost-effective
migration path to the non-linear world.

The new system has full capabilities to control external devices -
such as DVEs, vision mixers (switchers) and character generators -
as well as offering its own complementary on-board titling and
effects. The system complements Tektronix' existing range of
offline and news editing systems (Lightworks Turbo, Heavyworks and
Newsworks systems - and the new Newsworks Turbo, simultaneously
launched at IBC '96. (See page 40)

Targeted initially at online finishing of broadcast television
projects, it features recording and playout configurable via
multiple fully-assignable broadcast-quality video channels. The
system also combines comprehensive offline and online facilities
suitable for all forms of editing. Priced at US$149,950 for its
core four channel configuration, key launch customers include
Sweden's TV4 and the UK's Central Television.

First shipments began after IBC, with world-wide availability by
end-1996.

IT'S A KIND OF CONVERGENCE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Neal Weinstock

Network computers" that incorporate digital video decoders. Full-
motion video on Internet sites. TV tuner cards and MPEG decoder
cards for home PCs. Video capture programmes that allow typical
home users to grab frames, customise still images, and build their
own digital photo libraries.

Consumer nonlinear editing systems from Avid Technology, Radius,
Fast Electronic, and many others. The PC and the TV are cross-
breeding in consumers' homes, mutating into multiple new forms, and
the TV industry may never be the same again.

Or, some of the new creations may not work at all in the
marketplace.

The Network Computer

Look at the new concept of the network computer (NC). It was
invented by Oracle chief Larry Ellison in a speech in 1994 - in
what he has said was a spur-of-the-moment inspiration - though
naysayers insist the concept of underpowered PCs relying on
mainframes to supply data has been around as long as the used
computer market.

Ellison challenged the hardware industry with the goal of building
a device with nothing more than a keyboard, lots of RAM, some ROM
chips to hold the small client side of a big client/server
operating system, and a very fast processor.

The unit would rely on a network for storage of all programmes and
on a TV screen as monitor, and could therefore sell for US$500, he
said.

The NC was embraced by IBM soon after Ellison's speech. After all,
it is essentially a re-awakening of the mainframe/dumb terminal
model that prevailed when Big Blue ran the computer industry.

From Receivers to Computers

It was also embraced by consumer electronics companies such as Sony
and Philips as a bridge from their stagnant TV receiver trade into
the home computer business. Sony and Philips became early
manufacturers of terminals for the start-up WebTV (which also sells
terminals under its own name).

For US$3300 to US$350, the three companies have just introduced
WebTV terminals that include V.34 modems, software for easy
Internet access (for a monthly fee of US$20), and the ability to
connect numerous add-ons such as a wireless keyboard, hard disk and
CD-ROM.

Ellison's call was echoed from a distance by the drive towards
digital TV decoders. As the needs of the rival systems aimed at
Europe and the North American hybrid digital/analogue standard
became clear, these decoders also were seen to require ROM loaded
with the client side of a network operating system and a very fast
processor. But they don't need much, or any, RAM, and they need
only a keypad, rather than a keyboard. They certainly use the TV as
monitor, though.

Linking Up With Decoders

So some of the companies that took Ellison up on his challenge,
including Sun Microsystems and Sony, began to confer with or even
join forces with the decoder makers, such as Thomson and Irdeto.

"We might combine the digital TV decoder and the network computer,"
says a Sun insider, "or we might just design them together and use
the efficiencies to drive down costs."

Sun has been drawn into these opportunities by its Java and Hot
Java software; that hot Internet stuff suddenly seems to make at
least as much sense for digital TV as similar software aimed at our
industry in recent years by the likes of Apple and IBM's now
defunct Kaleida co-venture, Microware's David, Irdeto, Philips, and
News Datacom.

But if digital TV decoders are to be like Internet terminals, they
also can be Internet terminals. And, as the bandwidth of the
Internet expands, as "applet" software such as Java improves, and
as streaming servers improve, TV programmes will increasingly be
delivered over the Internet.

TV Over the Internet

They already are, in low quality and quantity. As reported here
recently, such streamer software companies as Vosaic (in
combination with Microsoft and its Java-competitor Active X), Xing
Technology, VDOnet, and Vivo Software are already sending MPEG-
quality video at up to 15fps to ISDN connections anywhere on the
globe.

A network computer that is combined in one module with a digital TV
decoder could let viewers switch channels from broadcast to an
Internet video stream.

Some broadcasters are getting ready for this eventuality.

"Right now, a Web site is an ancillary service," says Steven Heyer,
president/CEO of Turner Advertising Sales and chief of Turner's
international networks. "People can find out TV schedules, more
about news stories or spots. At some point, the Web site becomes
the entertainment or the product, and the TV network is equally
ancillary."

Opening Up the Markets

Because of the Internet's global reach, wherever on earth wideband
Internet to the home happens, it's simultaneously an opportunity
for broadcasters anywhere and a threat to broadcasters in that
locality.

For example, hundreds of thousands of homes throughout California's
Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay area now have Internet
connections at least over 128 kbps ISDN.

Millions more are wired at 28.8 kbps or lower. According to media
buyers in the area, up to 20 per cent of the prime time TV audience
in the area - probably the most extensively computer-literate
region on earth - is lost to computer network usage on any given
night. Local TV advertising consequences are inevitable, even as
such new networking concerns as WebTV, C/net and @home base their
business plans on supplying Internet services with increasing
amounts of video to the "lost" TV audience.

Yet there are naysayers to the combined digital TV decoder/network
computer. Divicom, the MPEG specialist that is a subsidiary of
leading MPEG and JPEG chip-maker C-Cube Microsystems, has just
signed a contract to supply technology for Zenith Electronics' US$1
billion contract to supply digital set-tops to the Ameritech
consortium of US telephone companies.

The new decoders are to work on several digital video standards so
consumers can switch from the hybrid fibre coax (HFC) standard used
by American cable operators to the switched digital video (SDV)
used by telcos, to MMDS or DTH standards, too.

No Reasonable Price

There will not be room left in such a box to provide the Ethernet
node used for high-speed modems and the network computer, too - at
least not at a reasonable price.

"Advanced digital video delivery systems and services are difficult
to build and implement," says Divicom president/CEO Nolan Daines.

He emphasises a need to, "Minimise the complexity and reduce the
costs associated with implementing such systems, . . . and bring a
complete solution to the market in a fraction of the time."

Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bill Gates lambastes the idea of the network
computer. "If people really want underpowered PC's without hard
drives, why can't you even give away most used computers? It's a
fallacy," he said in a recent speech.

Yet Microsoft, too, has embraced the NC, especially for the home TV
monitor as display. It is backing the Florida start-up, Citrix, in
developing software for "thin client" client/server systems
compatible with Active X (formerly known as OLE).

This is to be the fulfilment of the model Microsoft bruited about
the cable industry a couple of years ago for interactive TV, then
called "Tiger." It is also meant to support home office workers on
NCs. The concept has been embraced, too, by several market-share
leaders in PCs, including the top company, Compaq.

By coincidence, however, this journalist just purchased his first
new desktop computer in five years, a Compaq, and was pleased to
obtain, for some US$500 less than his last Compaq four years ago,
not only a hugely faster processor but 80 times as much hard drive,
four times as much RAM, MPEG video, TV tuner, 8x CD-ROM drive, some
600Mb of software and all other usual bells and whistles.

A journalist does not need all of this stuff for work, but it does
allow a journalist to access all manner of graphical Internet
sites, and allow a journalist's family to learn from hybrid CD-ROMs
combining with Internet sites to supply video-like services with
interactivity.

The fat client competes with TV rather than augments it, and is
often preferable for those who can afford it (while becoming ever
easier to afford): my son has not watched television since the new
computer was delivered.

Merging Industries?

Clearly, Compaq places its bets on this kind of product as well as
NCs. So is Sony, which not only has just introduced its WebTV NC,
but also, just a few weeks before, its re-entry into the
traditional PC business.

Peter Dare, technology VP for Sony Business & Professional
Products, says, "When the PCs in Sony's booth at NAB outnumber the
VTRs, you know we should be selling PCs. These industries are
merging.

"There's going to be a continuum from PCs running home multimedia
to professional production systems on PCs, and we should be on both
sides of that."

In other words, just as Sony used its strength in home VCRs to help
it conquer professional recording.

Networked "Fat" Clients

The fully loaded PC (or "fat client,") poses other challenges and
opportunities for broadcasters. The challenges are mostly the same
as those offered by thin clients. But the fat client market seems
pretty clearly defined as likely to encompass just the top third of
most societies' demographic audiences (A and B demos, as TV
programmers put it), while home NCs, or thin clients, threaten
viewership at all but the least lucrative demos.

Fat clients may seem, on quick examination, to offer fewer
opportunities for broadcasters and more for equipment vendors. Not
many PC owners are likely to view TV entertainment at their
desktops; my son's TV-like usage of CD-ROM and Internet is not
benefiting any broadcaster.

But he is likely to graduate from his current diet of learn-to-read
games fairly quickly to learn- to-make-your-own-video devices;
Avid, Sony, Eastman Kodak, and others are now vying to supply him
with those devices.

The growth of the fat client business around the world will help
turn the home multimedia industry to the benefit of these TV
equipment makers, whose high-end nonlinear edit, digital recording,
and graphics creation software of just a few years ago now runs on
hardware within consumer budgets.

Even more than the large companies mentioned above, Radius, Fast
Electronic, DPS, Matrox, Autodesk, Adobe, and other smaller board
or software makers have predicated their business plans on bringing
broadcast post- production tools to home users.

What's Coming?

This strategy melds with a professional equipment strategy, too.
Says Pete Mountanos, marketing VP of Fast, "You don't know what's
coming in a year or two, but you know it's going to make your
$50,000 or $100,000 systems obsolete. So just buy a $1,000 board
from us and throw it out once you find something better."

One large software company is playing something of this strategy,
too. Microsoft has priced Softimage software at a third or less
than its 1995 levels, and expects to drive prices still lower, well
below its current US$10,000 to $20,000 level.

Softimage availability over Windows NT is a major factor in the
tremendous growth of Pentium Pro-based systems on the hardware
side. Dell Computer has just introduced a US$2,500 Pentium Pro
system running Windows NT, and capable of running Softimage. This
may be a very thin client compared to the Silicon Graphics systems
it may be used to emulate, but only a moderately fat client for the
average home PC buyer.

Buying Into Broadcasting

Combine it with a video camera and a very few thousand dollars
worth of Internet site creation and streaming software, and the
home PC becomes a small broadcasting station.

Surely it is significant that Microsoft has bought into
broadcasting, too, as half owner of MSNBC, a supplier of
programming to NBC's Asian networks and a 24-hour broadcaster in
the US.

The company wants its Microsoft Network online service and Internet
connection to mix and match ancillary and complementary programming
with MSNBC, and it is not shy about defining its programming as an
enabler for consumers' own programmes as well as for its own wholly
originated feeds.

For the traditional broadcasters, this is a new model which would
bear watching.

Of more long-term competitive effect for broadcasters, when
consumers get used to producing their own good-quality video, and
then distributing it on Internet sites as well as viewing video on
other 'net sites, they are likely to insist on demanding something
more from TV broadcasters than now available. What more? Only time
will tell.  '

PSN SHINES OVER THE ASIA-PACIFIC PT PASIFIK SATELIT NUSANTARA, ESTABLISHED
IN 1991 TO PROVIDE SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, CONTINUES TO FORGE AHEAD

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Thomas King

Ever since all systems were declared "go" and Palapa A1 was
rocketed into orbit in July 1976 Indonesia has become a leader in
satellite telecoms.

With that giant leap forward 20 years ago the nation joined an
exclusive high technology 'club' as one of the first Third World
countries to use space technology.

The plan then was to effectively and efficiently link all parts of
the lengthy Indonesian archipelago with a modern telecommunications
network.

Not only would the network have to support telex, radio, television
and data transmissions and serve the nation's burgeoning number of
telephone users, it would also have to rely upon the then
revolutionary idea of using a tiny satellite in stationary orbit
some 36,000km above Indonesia.

The sparkle of the 250kg Palapa A1 was superseded in the mid 1980s
with the shimmer of the B2 series of spacecraft which became the
second generation platforms for a highly sophisticated
telecommunications network.

Several 550kg B2 satellites were progressively launched into
different orbits and after extensive testing proved their value as
distant repeater stations equipped with enhanced capabilities and
agendas.

With the introduction of the more sophisticated Palapa B series it
was decided that its various footprints should be intended for end
users in the vast ASEAN region, in addition to its prime service
market of Indonesia.

The Palapa B series launched reliable satellite communications to
hundreds of millions of people living in the then six member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN):
Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. (Vietnam has since joined the organisation, which
regularly meets to discuss regional matters, including telecoms
issues.

1991: Forging Ahead

Until 1991 Indonesia had but one private satellite service
provider, the company now known as Satelindo. PT Pasifik Satelit
Nusantara (PSN) was established in June 1991 with a mandate to
provide satellite-based products and services to the Asia-Pacific
region.

The five-year old publicly-owned company not only compliments the
satellite-based portfolio of Indonesian sister company, PT
Satelindo, but has successfully forged ahead with interests in a
number of telecoms enterprises.

For instance, just one year after its establishment PSN acquired
the 'retired' inclined orbit B1 satellite at 134 degrees E, renamed
it Palapa Pacific 1, and began operating services with an expanded
coverage over Asia from India in the West to Guam in the East.

The second satellite in the B2 series, the inclined orbit B2P came
under PSN management in early 1996. Renamed Palapa Pacific 2 and
relocated to 144 degrees E, PSN's ten standard C-band transponders
on this orbiting relay station are predominately leased by the
Mabuhay Philippines Satellite Corporation for telecommunications
and broadcast purposes.

Third Generation Satellites

PSN is also actively involved in Indonesia's third generation of
satellites, Palapa C1 and C2, which were launched in January and
May 1996, respectively.

A number of innovations and advances were incorporated into the
high power C series which, like the B series, was built by the
Hughes Space and Communications Company of California.

For instance, each 1740kg, 21m long Palapa C has more powerful
transmitters and highly refined antennas. Satellite life for the C
series is estimated at 14 years, virtually double that of the B
series.

"Through a joint purchase agreement with PT Satelindo, PSN owns and
operates 12 extended C-band transponders, six on each of two Hughes
HS601 Palapa C series satellites," said Ron Pirolo, Manager-Sales &
CS, Pasifik Satelit Nusantara.

Palapa C2: More TV Traffic

The C1, at 150.5 degrees E, is primarily used to carry rural
telephony on PSN's burgeoning VSAT service. Positioned at 113
degrees E, C2 is dedicated to broadcasting needs. Pirolo estimates
that up to two million parabolic dish antennas are currently
pointed at this satellite, which is claimed to carry more TV
traffic - 30 major broadcasters - than any other satellite in the
region.

PSN's Palapa C customers include broadcasters such as NBC Asia,
Star TV, TVB Hong Kong and RCTI, the dominant broadcaster in
Indonesia.

Footprint flexibility is an advantage for users of PSN
transponders, noted Pirolo, as they can opt for either of Palapa C
coverage patterns, the Asean beam or the Asia beam. In combination
these span the distance from East Africa in the West to New Zealand
in the East.

More Transponders Soon

In a few months PSN will be able to offer additional transponders
to users on yet another satellite, the soon-to-be-launched Mabuhay
1, the first-ever Philippine satellite.

One of eight partners that make up the Mabuhay Philippines
Satellite Corporation, PSN currently owns two transponders with an
option to acquire an additional six.

Developed and built by Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) of  the US,
Mahubay 1 is scheduled for launch this December. It is expected to
become operational from 144 degrees E orbital position during the
first quarter of 1997. (This position will put Mabuhay 1 in a co-
location with PSN's Palapa Pacific 2 until the end of service life
for the Indonesian satellite.

Designed for a 12 year operational life, Mahubay 1, the largest
space craft in SS/L's FS1300 series, is equipped with 54 active
transponders in the C- and Ku-bands.

A total of 30 high power standard and extended C-band transponders
and orthogonally polarised antennas will provide coverage to the
Philippines, Eastern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Indo-China, Japan,
Korea, India, Bangladesh and Hawaii.

On the Ku-band, Mabuhay 1 will operate with 24 medium power/12 high
power transponders to cover the Philippines, coastal China, Taiwan
and northern Vietnam.

While PSN executives are actively involved in this pioneering
project others are deployed elsewhere to direct additional company
interests.

There are currently three other components in PSN's evolving
portfolio of satellite-related services: teleport services,
satellite network services and planned mobile satellite services.

Uplinking in Batam

In early 1994 and within three months after being awarded its first
satellite uplink contract, PSN technicians had designed, installed
and commissioned an uplink facility on Batam Island, near
Singapore. This signalled the start of the first commercial,
digitally compressed TV service in Asia.

The Batam Teleport was expanded in late 1995 to accommodate
additional operational requirements for the Palapa C satellites.
The facility now provides satellite monitoring, uplink and downlink
services, digital compression and editing services as well as
limited studio capabilities.

PSN's Teleport customers include clients such as NBC Asia which
uses the Batam complex for the downlinking of its broadcast service
off PAS-2, processing and uplinking to C2.

In the satellite network services arena PSN has teamed with Titan
Information Services to offer a "very cost effective, satellite-
based communications network".

Incorporating DAMALink software and hardware which actively assigns
frequencies to maximise satellite bandwidth efficiency, the Xpress
connection system is said to reduce costs by enabling more users to
be simultaneously served by a narrower bandwidth segment.

Voice, data and facsimile transmissions can be processed by this
system, which uses extended C-band frequencies and 1.2m earth-based
VSAT terminals.

AceS by 1998

While Batam Teleport and Xpress Connection are fully operational,
PSN's Asia Cellular Satellite (AceS) System will only come on-line
in 1998.

Conceived as a satellite-based, mobile communication system
providing fully digital voice, data, fax, alerting and paging
services to hand-held telephones anywhere in Asia, the system will
be seamlessly integrated with cellular networks and public switched
networks.

Apart from supplying cellular-like mobile services, ACeS will have
the ability to deliver telecommunications services to the
innumerable underserved and unserved rural locations throughout
Asia. Ericsson will develop and manufacture the satellite/ cellular
switched phones.

The workhorses of the orbiting system, currently under construction
by  Lockheed Martin, are the 2600kg A2100 AX spacecraft buses, said
to be the most powerful commercial communications satellites ever
built.

Dubbed 'Garuda' and sporting 12m long antennas and on-board digital
signal processing both of the 12 year service life satellites in
the ACeS system will have 140 spot beams focussed in Asia. The
footprints will cover in excess of 25 countries where a total
population of approximately three billion people live.

Each of the L-band satellites is designed to provide 11,000
simultaneous telephone channels and be capable of supporting up to
two million subscribers.

The Satellite Control Facility on Batam will contain the hardware
including a 15.5m tracking antenna, software and support facilities
necessary to manage and monitor the two massive Garuda satellites
of the heart of this revolutionary mobile communications system.

Towards 1999

In mid-October PSN announced plans to operate a multimedia
satellite by 1999.

Currently under constructionby the Lorel Corporation, the four-
tonne US$300 million satellite, to be called Palapa Pacific 3 and
positioned at 134 degrees E, "will not have any transponders,
although its capacity will be equivalent to that of a satellite
with 84 transponders.

The satellite is expected to be sent aloft in late 1998 or early
1999.  '

CHARISMATIC DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING: MARTYN GREEN TALKS TO QUESTECH'S GRAEME
FENEMORE AND ROBERT BILLING ABOUT THE CHARISMA X DVE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Situated in Wokingham, Berks, the heart of Britain's Silicon
Valley, Questech are the makers of such AV products as rate
converters, high quality decoders, and frame store synchronisers,
along with a solid-state video RAM recorder, and a solid-state
audio recorder.

But perhaps more than anything, it is known for its flagship
product, the Charisma X (Ten), a dual-standard and dual-aspect
ratio digital video effects device which they claim, "has the
highest frame-based interpolation in the industry, rendering
digital video effects images in real time".

According to Questech's sales support manager, Graeme Fenemore, the
Charisma X has been Questech's main product for the past year - and
by now Questech has sold, "a fair number" of them.

The basic model comes with an input and output mixer and a linear
DVE with three axis rotations. The input mixer comes as standard,
along with RGB colour correction, de-focus, luminance-chrominance,
and key.

Prices start off at about 37,000 (US$55,500) for the basic model,
up to 56,000  (US$84,000) for a single-channel device, although up
to three channels can be controlled from the same system.

Having three channels allows a display of three different video
sources on screen. "If you look at the news on TV," he explains
"sometimes they have two presenters, in different locations, in
different boxes on-screen - and that is two channels of DVE.

"We offer a third one also - all mixed over a background which can
be live."

The basic, linear model, has infinite expansion, and to this wrap
and warp effects can be added to do page turns and page rolls, or
oil drop ripple effects. "But it is all a 2-D image," explains
Fenemore.

"It appears as 3-D with the picture flat to the screen, but if you
rotate the picture around in 3-D space, it will appear as a flat
image.

"That also allows infinite expansion, because it is just an
additional board that is added to the system.

"If you want 3-D effects, where you have page turns, you can rotate
the image around in space and it will remain three-dimensional."

An extra board can be fitted to the entry-level CLEO, to allow
expansion on a flat picture up to eight times and three times on
CLEO effects.

"CLEO stands for the Curved Line Effects option - the 3-D stuff,"
explains Fenemore. There is a 5,000 pound add-on card that can be
added to the system to make it a super-CLEO.

This allows expansion of shapes up to eight times. "It also allows
you to fragment the picture, roll it into a cylinder or a cone,"
says Fenemore, adding "all real-time manipulation, as there is no
rendering involved with the Charisma system."

Saving Time In Rendering

He points out, "Unless you spend half a million pounds, with a lot
of the computer-based systems, you tend to find you have to set one
key frame, generate another key frame, and then let the system
render, going from one to the other on a frame-by-frame basis,
which does take time.

"But with the Charisma X, for instance you can set a key frame,
turn it into a sphere, and then rotate it around in 3-D space and
it remains 3-D.

"Or you can position it somewhere else, set a second key frame, and
when you run it, it will evolve from one shape to the other.
Normally on a computer-based system, you find it has to render
frame by frame.

"A lot of this stuff is done in hardware - it is not from
programmes that have been written to generate them, although
obviously there is software that is written to control the
hardware."

Operating Live-On-Air

Computer-based systems do work out cheaper, Fenemore admits, as a
lot of them come with other packages, like graphics and character
generators, all packaged with digital video effects.

"So you can have a complete editing system in a box, whereas the
Charisma X has to link up with other manufacturer's devices like
mixers, edit controllers and character generators."

However, he points out, "Where you wouldn't want to use a computer-
based system is when you are operating live on-air. If you want to
fire off an effect, like moving a picture away into the background,
then you'd obviously want to use a dedicated piece of hardware for
that.

"With the computer-based systems, you can't separate the DVE - it
is all in a box. You wouldn't use a computer-based system to
manipulate a picture on the TV screen on a live broadcast.

"Computer-based systems are used in post-production houses, where
speed of operation is not the most important thing, although
obviously a customer is paying by the hour for the use of the
product."

Disk vs RAM

The advantage of computer-based systems though, he agrees, are that
one can add graphics to the video. "But a computer-based system
uses disk drives, whereas our system has no disks - all the images
are stored in RAM memory.

"You are manipulating one frame of information, that's all. There
is one frame, or a field, delay, because you may have a pixel in
the top left which has to appear on the bottom right. It is frame-
based processing, which means that when you expand the image, you
don't have the slight flicker you get with field-based processing."

The Charisma Ten system comes as an input-output mixer, with the
DVE inside. "To that you can add the wrap or warp type effects
which are 2-D in plane effects, or you can have the CLEO and have
3-D effects, where you can manipulate the picture - like doing
page-turns, making into a sphere or cylinder etc., and it remains
three-dimensional."

Available Options

Options that can be added to the system include the ability to drop
images into a target frame store - what Questech call multi-freeze.

Says Fenemore, "You can build up montages by dropping in
information. Or you can generate a drop shadow effect, and de-focus
it. You can leave trails, much like you see on some computer
cursors, and you can decay the trail away or leave it on the
screen.

"You can also add a chroma-key, and chroma-key the DVE onto another
input source, and manipulate the combined images on-screen."

The Charisma has been around as a digital box since 1985. And
Fenemore claims that companies who bought one then, are still using
them nowadays. The earlier model to the Charisma X was an eight-
bit, field-based device, while the Charisma X is ten-bit frame-
based.

The internal architecture of the DV goes up to 24 bits and is
digitally transparent, "- so that with a full-sized centre, you can
freeze the video, and actually feed its output back into its input,
unfreeze it, and the picture will remain on screen."

What is new with the Charisma Ten is the input mixer, along with
the chroma- key option and the wrap or warp effects. "And with the
wrap system, you can get real-time morphing," enthuses Fenemore,
"so you can distort a picture in real time."

"You can do a two-channel morph, from one shape to another and you
can see it happening in front of you by moving a grid around, to
change it on the output screen, and then instantly run it, with no
rendering involved."

Unfortunately, he says, users cannot have both the CLEO and the
wrap systems in the same unit, as they are totally different
address architecture. "But you can combine channels so you have one
channel with the CLEO, and another with the wrap, because you can
have up to three channels."

Asked what sort of customers go for each type of system, he says,
"You tend to find that the morphing effects being used by post
production houses, whereas the wrap and CLEO effects can be used in
either environment."

"The multi-channel combining, and Z-axis information which allows
you to manipulate one channel behind another, without having to do
a priority select, or intersect other channels, has been around
since the launch of the first Charisma in 1985."

And he maintains that whereas Quantel were the first to generate a
three-axis rotate system, which Ampex followed with a three-axis
video manipulator, there was still no ability to do three-axis
rotations, and Questech is still "really the only manufacturer that
makes a DVE that can do all of these sort things in 3-D, in real
time."

Switching Between Events

Robert Billing, senior design engineer at Questech, feels the
Charisma X is useful, "for any sort of programme where you need
transitions.

"With sports programmes, for instance, the Charisma X can be used
most effectively to switch between all the different events during
the day. And we are now able to do 525/60 NTSC as well as 625/50
PAL, so we are getting into the American-dominated section of the
market."

Billings continues, " I don't think it would be easy for anyone to
try to copy us. We have extensive patent protection . . . "
Questech thus believes it has the market virtually cornered. And,
currently at least, it is sitting pretty on it.  '

THE GREAT OUTDOORS BECKON: UNTIL YOU START BATTLING TO BRING THE STORIES
IN, YOU MAY NOT NEED MUCH MORE THAN THIS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Neal Weinstock

Mobile facilities are starting to move across Asia, as audience
ratings begin to give a tangible edge to the immediacy of location
shooting. Advertisers are taking notice, too, which leads
broadcasters to add yet more outdoor broadcast (OB) vans to their
technology resources.

In cold countries, this is called a snowball effect; but the OB van
trend is rolling and gathering size largely in places that never
see snow. What's a mobile facility? At its least, it's simply a van
- even a car -  used to hold portable production equipment.

"Until you get into a situation where you're battling competitors
to bring stories in," says Rob Braun of Phoenix ENG, a small US OB
van specialist, "You don't need much more than that for news."

Sport, however, is a different arena. Yet another is fiction
production. Broadcasters with rights to sporting events in more
than one or two venues in a typical year, and producers of
entertainment programmes that might experience a ratings boost from
a bit of outside-the-studio scenery, have differing and immediate
needs in OB vans.

That is why mobile facilities are best designed to order and
crafted for each special need. That is why, as much as large system
integrating vendors such as Sony, BTS, and Harris seem to dominate
the business, well over 50 per cent of the world's mobile
facilities are built by small local vendors.

There tends to be as much individuality among properly designed OB
vans as between in-house studio facilities. The differences are not
merely a matter of budget.

Do you need (and can you get government permission for) a microwave
link to the studio? Are you rolling the OB van into or just outside
of large arenas, concert halls, or night clubs? Or are you using it
to navigate narrow streets, pedestrian districts, off-road
countryside?

Depending on what programme is being shot, the same location may
require a different sort of vehicle.

In this author's photogenic and news-generating neighbourhood, we
are continually visited by every sort of mobile production. The
differences and similarities are highly instructive.

Frequent fiction film crews bring a dozen or more caravans (for
people only) and lorries (for equipment only), and no on-board
control room; all is set out in the open on the street.

The shoot costs millions, costs all of us locals our parking spots
and makes us occasionally wait to get in or out of our houses while
we gawk at actors, but the vans cost little; they are unimproved
trucks and mobile homes.

There are always local TV news vans around, their corkscrew-shaped
microwave antennae raised up to 30m to transmit video from the
squares in front of courthouses and government offices (or
sometimes from a waterside location for a weather report) to
studios.

Usually these are vans about four or five metres long, with room
inside for an AB roll editing system, driver, cameraman, editor,
and journalist, a portable light kit, a couple of camcorders, tape
and accessories, and a football field's length of cables.

Added on to the cost of a normal delivery van are an improved
electrical system, built-in microwave, countertops and cabinets,
and endless coffee spills.

Foreign TV correspondents based here are frequently out shooting
video in the neighbourhood, too. Typically, they stand in front of
a vista that tells the world where they are and deliver monologues
that may have been written without ever coming here.

Or they stand on the street interviewing celebrities from their
homeland who now live here, inadvertently demonstrating that no one
in my neighbourhood recognises them. For these applications,
unobtrusive politeness is needed in any OB van; usually, they use
station wagons well stuffed with camera, tripod, mini-lighting kit,
VTR, tape and accessories.

Lately, we are seeing more sport-utility vehicles used; they more
easily handle a bounce over a curb in the wilds of our
neighbourhood's pedestrian walkways, especially when heavily
loaded.

We have seen NHK crews with a hand-held microwave link stuffed into
the wagon, too; they can use it only in locations with a clear shot
at a receiver mounted high on an office building.

The inexperienced try to get away with packing only cameraman and
journalist in with all this; older hands include a driver, useful
mostly to guard against thieves and tow trucks.

TV commercials, fashion videos, and music videos are another
menagerie. Typically, all three travel in a four- or five-metre OB
van for video gear and online control, a caravan or two for talent,
and a big truck full of lights and often audio.

We know as soon as the truck doors open if the shoot is on film or
video: film shoots fill trucks with so many lights and generators
and reflectors and scrims and big gel filters that little else is
apparent, and they need no other van for video control. Video set-
ups can be pretty similar to TV news crews', with the addition of
roughly the same lighting gear as a film crew's. And no microwave,
of course.

For fashion and music video shoots, too, there's usually a full
complement of hi-fi audio gear; less often, performance sound
reinforcement gear. Though performers in music videos usually lip-
sync sound tracks in the studio to mimed singing on location, they
need loud enough audio to dance to.

Models in fashion shoots, likewise, need loud enough audio to walk
to. Actors in commercials may need this, too. Or they may need no
more audio than a wireless body microphone.

Given the diversity of needs and the relative infrequency of work
for all participants (compared, say, to TV news), these
applications almost always are serviced by rented vehicles; an
extra reason to keep the OB video control van separate from the
lighting equipment truck.

Crews that tend to be unfamiliar with equipment resources need
more, and more clearly defined, space to work with.

Location Shoots For Concerts

Then there are the location shoots for music concerts. MTV had an
all-star concert in the park where I like to run a few weeks ago.
Small crews from a non-profit channel sometimes come to shoot
chamber music concerts in a little hall just next to that park.

The two shoots' OB van needs could hardly be more different and yet
alike in concept. Both require trucks holding fully equipped
control rooms for multicamera shoots. The trucks must be parked
some distance from the stage, in both cases, so that the director
sees talent only over video.

In the case of the chamber music hall, a five-metre OB van sits in
a nearby parking lot and runs cables to a three-camera set-up in
the hall. Within the single OB van are stored precisely all the
lights, camera, and other portable gear needed for the shoot.

Since the crew comes here with some frequency, they know just what
they need and are able to transport most of it in a van that also
holds the three-camera control set-up, switcher, VTR, et al. Some
additional gear they are able to store in a closet in the little
hall.

In the case of the rock concert, two huge tractor-trailers,
accompanied by several vehicles for performers' dressing rooms,
filled a cobbled no- parking zone.

As many as a dozen cameras were used, necessitating a huge control
room that filled one of the trailers, taking up more space than
most control rooms in permanent, indoor facilities.

Of course, the trailer is a permanent facility, too, used for
sporting events if not rock concerts, and costing many millions of
dollars. The second huge trailer, filled with generators for
lights, stood farther from the stage to minimise the generators'
noise.

Other lorries that had brought other gear probably were parked far
away during the show. For days before and after, running through
the park was a challenging obstacle course. If most of these OB van
applications have not been seen in your neighbourhood, rest assured
that many soon will be.

"Anybody would rather watch anything that comes from outside the
studio," says Moses Znaimer, founder and chairman of Toronto's City
TV. "There's always the slightest possibility for surprise, for
some kind of life sneaking into the bleak, pre- programmed dead
zone of television."

City TV was a little independent upstart broadcaster a decade ago;
it made its mark against the established stations (and saved vast
costs) by not having any studios at all. Everything it did was
location work, even within its own offices.

The company now sells its expertise to other broadcasters, to help
others work the same formula. But nugget of City TV's strategy is
not patentable and inescapable: many viewers would rather see OB
video than studio video. As more and more competition comes to
Asian TV, the great outdoors beckon.  '

THE REALITY OF VIRTUAL STUDIOS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Virtual Set technology at IBC 96 did not have quite the 'must see'
quality it certainly had when the first blue screen sets startled
visitors back in 1994 - but there have certainly been some advances
this year which go some way to solving some of the complex
technical problems of virtual production.

There are buyers around - and at least one manufacturer confidently
claims 1997 will be the year of the virtual set - but didn't
someone say that about 1996?

There also has not been quite the shake-out of virtual set
companies yet, although Electrogig has vanished from the pantheon
of names, Its Reality Tracking technology has been acquired by
Triavest, a new company set up by former Electrogig chief executive
Mike Dilworth, and largely staffed by ex-Electrogig virtual set
specialists.

Triavest plans to spend far more time building the specific
requirements of its customers into the virtual set systems it
delivers - more of a custom-made approach. It was acknowledged last
year that there were too many companies chasing a fairly small
market - since that market was limited by the high cost of entry.

Now the market is being segmented into high and lower cost systems;
broadly the split between a 2D virtual studio without a tracking
camera, with pre-rendered sets manipulated by a high resolution
DVE; and the full 3D real time rendered virtual set, which in most
cases still requires a Silicon Graphics Onyx supercomputer - now
available with the Infinite Reality graphics engine which is some
ten times faster than SGI's previous model, the Reality Engine 2.

It was notable that Discreet Logic did not have a virtual set
display at IBC. It made great play of its Vapour, Frost and Glass
product lines at NAB this year, but following DL's re-structuring,
the IBC focus was on editing with Fire, and mid-price effects and
compositing with the Flint RT (for real time), helped by DL's first
hardware product, the Pebbles fast video i/o device.

However, Discreet says the absence of a Vapour demo does not imply
any less commitment towards virtual sets. It's still an important
part of its strategy for broadcast products, according to
Discreet's director of product marketing Marc Nadeau.

"Vapour and Frost are a key part of our development into production
for broadcast and we're currently transitioning the technology
research from Innsbruck to Montreal as part of the re-structuring.

"We just didn't have enough time to organise a blue screen
demonstration at IBC, but we showed the software and rendering
environment - and this year we've had 1500 hours on air generated
by Vapour, including the Eurovision Song Contest and 22 hours a day
from the Olympics for Canal Plus."

RT-SET has just signed a deal with SZM Sendezentrum Munchen for
three licences for its top end virtual studio system Larus, which
makes SZM the biggest user of virtual set technology yet, according
to RT-SET president and CEO Shalom Nachshon.

SZM acts as a production centre for four TV stations in Germany -
Pro7, the DSF sports channel, Home Order Television and the Kabel 1
movies and entertainment channel. SZM will be using three studio
cameras and a crane camera in its virtual studio facility.

"We've turned concepts into real production tools this year, and
proved it with productions like CBS TV's Tales of the Crypt, where
we did 26 episodes of the show in eight days," he says.

This involved RT-SET virtual sets mixed in with live action and
ainimation for a part of this children's show from the Samuel
Goldwyn Company called Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House.

"We've completed the development of centralising the entire
function of virtual set control room into one point - the virtual
studio operator - so the switching of cameras, controlling VTRs,
lighting, sound are all controlled by one guy who controls the
show," says Nachshon.

RT-SET has also completed development of software to generate
shadows from the talent and cast them not only on the floor, but on
virtual objects too, according to Nachshon.

"We don't have to use any blue boxes for this, and the cameras can
move too," he says. RT-SET has also devised a 3D prompter as
guidance for the talent, so they can watch where they are supposed
to move without the use of a monitor.

Orad Hi-Tec Systems has continued to export its technology to other
virtual set companies. Several now offer Orad's pattern recognition
system as an alternative to using memory head sensors in deriving
the co-ordinates to generate the right perspectives for the
computer graphics backgrounds.

Accom, Digimedia and Discreet Logic have all agreed with Orad to
interface its camera tracking system with their virtual set
systems. Orad now has a range of its Cyberset virtual set systems
at different price points, some entirely in-house systems, some
with partners like FOR-A, Vinten and Evans and Sutherland, which
offers a Windows NT based system.

"When we started developing a virtual studio system, we began using
a sensor-based system, but got so frustrated with it, we looked at
other methods and developed pattern recognition, where the camera
parameters are extracted from the video itself, not from any
associated mechanical devices.

"It means you can use ordinary studio cameras, you can dolly them
freely and even use shoulder mounted cameras or a Steadicam. And
since our video processor is located downstream of the switcher,
one system can service any number of cameras and there are no
calibration procedures required for them," says Orad's technical
director Dr Miky Tamir.

At IBC, Orad showed the use of virtual actors, integrating virtual
characters animated with motion capture in real time, which was
integrated into the virtual set system using the same Onyx CPU that
performs the set rendering.

The company also showed virtual presence, which means a person
recorded in a remote location can be immersed into the virtual set
as a 3D object.

Orad has also developed a feedback mechanism for the talent, which
renders the virtual world from above, calculating the footprint of
all virtual objects in real time and projecting them, tying them in
with the script and projecting them on to the studio floor.

Tracking the Camera

One of the drawbacks of virtual set technology is the high cost of
real time rendered 3-D systems, but the 2-D systems are attracting
some interest, including the BBC-developed DVE at the heart of the
Virtual Scenario system which is sold by Radamec.

Radamec showed the system at IBC with two Scenario units controlled
from a single camera channel, which adds flexibility to the system
enabling both inlays with virtual sets as well as animated graphics
which can interact with the presenter.

Radamec has sold the Scenaria system to ITN and BBC TV Centre. ITN
will be using it for a special project for the General Election,
while BBC TV has begun using the Scenaria on its first mainstream
programme to use a virtual set - Football Focus -  on Saturdays.

The main difference in use of the 2-D system as opposed to 3-D
systems is it cannot handle tracking of the camera, although it
does allow the camera to be panned, tilted, zoomed and focussed on
any virtual background.

The system can also be used as a direct replacement for back
projection and video wall systems. Asia Business News has also
bought a Scenaria system, which will be installed in December with
advanced robotic control and a touch control panel.

There are now other systems on the market which do not need a
supercomputer. FOR-A showed its digiWarp system at IBC, which
combines its own MF 3300 DVE with a video processor it has
developed, called a dimensioning processor which gives 2k x 2k
resolution in the DVE.

This works with the Orad Cyberset video processor to offer a system
using pattern recognition that can offer another two levels of live
images as well as the chroma key signals, and it will handle a
moving camera.

Photron showed its Pseudio virtual studio system, which is based
around the Primatte Pro 100 chromakeying device Photron developed
from technology used by its parent company, the Japanese post
production house Imagica.

Pseudio uses pre-modelling and pre rendering of virtual
backgrounds, which are stored in a disk array. The prerecorded D1
quality images are played back in real time, reflecting the camera
moves fed in by a camera head and tripod system that reads the
information on pan,titl and zoom positions of the foreground image
shot by the video camera.

The Primatte chromakeyer is used to composite foreground and
background images. There are four basic configurations of the
Pseudio system, from a 2D system with single camera configuration
using just a frame buffer, to one with the disk array and versions
using a single camera on rail and dolly, which feeds into two disk
arrays, and a system that combines all the options.  '

NONLINEAR ONLINE REACHES PINNACLE: YOUR GUIDE TO IBC NONLINEAR VIDEO
EDITORS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by David Fox

There are now at least 77 manufacturers offering nonlinear editing
systems, according to Pinnacle's vice president for Europe, Brian
Conner, who claims 74 of them use Pinnacle DVEs within their
packages.

In reality, there are five key nonlinear manufacturers: Avid, D-
Vision, Media 100, Scitex and Lightworks. Quantel's Editbox is also
a serious player, but for high-end use (as is Discreet Logic's
Fire), while most of the traditional edit controller manufacturers
have gone for hybrid (tape and disk) systems, to protect their (and
their customers') investment in existing kit.

It does, however, mean broadcasters have a lot of choice. There is
a system to suit all needs and all price brackets, whether you want
to upgrade in one fell swoop, or merely add nonlinear capabilities
to your existing suites.

With the price of storage dropping so quickly, and its speed
increasing, online nonlinear editing is attainable for all but the
very lowest budgets.

There are still doubts about compatibility of formats and
compression systems, but even here the move towards more open
systems and standard compression formats means that your investment
should be a lot safer.

Scitex claims to offer the broadest range of nonlinear editing
systems on the market (although Avid, Media 100 and D-Vision might
disagree). Every function operates under the "real time, all the
time" banner. The whole Sphere range, launched in PAL at IBC,
offers Dveous effects and mixing technology based on the Abekas
8150 switcher, including keying, wipe generation, and colour
correction.

All effects are key-frameable. The compression rates are better
than 3:1, with variable image resolution, using Apple's Quicktime
file format.

The Sphere line has moved to using Motion JPEG, from the Cube's
wavelet compression.

Avid, which has sold 5,100 editing systems in Europe, showed
version 6.5 of the Media Composer at IBC.

It introduces a new picture resolution (AVR 77) at 2:1 compression.
It also allows live voice over recording, the linking of script to
pictures, eight channel audio, real-time effects, serial digital
i/o and various open system enhancements.

Newscutter's image quality is claimed to have been improved by 60
per cent. It can now also access the AvidNews database, so that
operators can look at scripts or playlists. Other features include:
drag and drop clip management, multiple levels of undo/redo and
title tool templates.

But probably the most impressive debut was MCXpress 1.5 (for Mac
and Windows NT). It is aimed at industrial and corporate use, but
is certainly powerful enough for many broadcast users.

It can create real-time wipes, dissolves and effects at 3:1
compression (the machine can go as low as 2:1) and Pinnacle's
Geniefusion card can be added for real-time 3D effects. It has a
fully integrated film matchback option for negative cut list
generation and the user interface has been simplified.

Vincent and Theo

Media 100 has a new logo and a lot of new, improved editing
products. Its base system, the 100qx, runs under the Adobe Premiere
package. Next up is the new 100le, which delivers real-time video
and audio editing and effects for about 7,500(US$11510).

At the top of the range, the 100xs has been brought in to aim for
high-end production, above the 100 2.6. Gaudi, an optimised version
of Pinnacle's 3D DVE, has also been introduced.

Further developments include the introduction of the Vincent 601
Digital Video Engine and the Theo Superprocessor 'brotherboard',
which it claims make up the first PC-based digital video system
fully compliant with CCIR 601. Features include two video streams
and a real-time alpha channel. They will boost the speed of editing
and effects under Media 100 software.

Media 100 is committed to using Quicktime as its core technology
for all its products for both the Mac and Windows, and is now
working with Apple, Macromedia and Truevision to develop Quicktime
for Windows 95 and NT.

Since Tektronix bought Lightworks, it was expected it would
integrate its disk recorders and Grass Valley effects with the
editing system. Now it has. The Lightworks VIP 4500 is based on the
Profile hard disk recorder and offers four independent video
channels, and Grass Valley DVE technology, for under US$150,000. It
features variable 3:1 compression, 16 channels of audio, between 32
and 96Gb storage (80 to 240 minutes), and Pal/NTSC switchable
software, both of which can be used in 24-frame film mode.

It has a built-in real-time mix/effects board, external device
control, multi-camera editing capability (as on Heavyworks) and can
digitise direct to edit without pre-digitising (as Newsworks).

Newsworks Turbo editing system was also launched at IBC, boasting
Beta SP picture quality at 4:1 compression. It is targeted as a
lower-cost stand-alone replacement for existing tape-based linear
suites and as part of a large-scale automated and networked
newsroom system.

It supports mixed compression rates within the same project or
edit, and can access up to 90Gb in a standard unit, expandable
externally to 180Gb, and eight digital audio channels, also
expandable. It can also control a channel of Profile.

Adcom's Night Suite is a nonlinear D1 and offline editor running
under Windows 95, with up to 2:1 compression, although the dual
channel effects have to be rendered at 4:1 or better. It comes with
a 27Gb drive which gives up to 15 minutes at 2:1 or 2.5 hours at
5:1.

Its audio features are a strong point as an eight channel, 16-bit,
Sadie audio editor is built-in, and its control panel has motorised
faders. Its basic effects include more than 200 wipes, chroma,
alpha and luma keyers.

The Inscriber character generator is included, along with a 2-D DVE
and an optional integrated Aladdin 3-D DVE. The graphical interface
seems nicely designed and clearly laid out and the most used
functions are one button push away on the control panel, as are 24
user definable softkeys.

It has a "soft delete" feature which will remove a shot, or shots,
from playback, but leave them in the timeline, which is useful for
trying different options. It costs about US$58,000, plus options
which include more storage and serial digital i/o.

Waving, Not Drowning

The Philips BTS Newswave has a dedicated control console for high
speed news cutting. Based on Media Pool, it can be uncompressed or
compressed, has a single video channel, and four independent audio
tracks, and a picture-based timeline.

It can be stand alone or networked, with up to 16 workstations
working on the same material at one time, and should be available
next year for about US$20,000 for a server and workstation, plus
Media Pool.

Newswave is cuts only as Media Pool cannot yet handle effects,
although that facility will be added. There is also Wavelite for
loading and logging material, although both applications can run on
the same machine.

Adobe's editing package is Premiere (for the Mac and PC), which can
edit up to 99 video and 99 audio tracks, at a cost of about
400(US$614), for the software only. It is claimed to be highly
customisable, with a wide range of transition effects (wipes,
etc.).

It can also create titles, with crawls and other motion controls
(or import titles from Adobe Illustrator). Its audio effects are
more basic (although still include limited time stretching), but
all the Adobe products benefit from being able to work with plug-in
software modules, which add audio filters or visual effects.
Depending on the hardware it is run on, it can be used as an on-
line editor, or will generate various EDL formats for use off-line.

For more high-end applications, Adobe also has After Effects, a
resolution independent effects package for the Mac, and coming for
Windows NT. Indeed, after years of supporting the Mac platform,
with some products also running on SGI, Adobe has embraced the
Windows PC, thanks to the arrival of Windows NT, which has added
performance and stability to the PC's normal main attraction of low
price.

Quantel's Editbox '96, launched at IBC, is a range of four systems,
costing from about 120,000 (US$184,200), for short or long-form
editing for top-end broadcast and commercials production.
Improvements include faster keying, moves and colour correction.

More editing and paint facilities are built in, and Quantel's Open
Platform Exchange Network (OPEN) is supported, allowing editors
access material on other Quantel systems and from other platforms.
Existing Editboxes, of which more than 250 have been sold, can be
upgraded to Editbox '96.

The New Entrants

Pixel Power's Collage EDit is a non-compressed nonlinear editor
which integrates with existing Collage CG systems (which can be
upgraded for about 45,000, or US$69,100). A complete package,
including CG, costs about 70,000(US$107,450).

Basic storage is 35 minutes, which can be expanded for about
500(US$767) per minute, and compression can be added if users
want. The interface is less graphical than some rivals, but is
reasonably simple.

Clips have to be pre-digitised before editing, but Pixel Power may
bring out a lower cost digitising workstation. The machine was a
crowd-puller at its IBC launch IBC, and picked up eight orders in
the first two days. Deliveries start in December.

ASC's VR NLE is being updated to run under Window's NT. The company
admits its existing DOS version (costing from US$25,000) has not
taken off, partly because of the lack of real-time effects.

The new version, will rectify that and add keying, titling
character generation and Pinnacle Aladdin 3D effects. It will be
based on ASC's VR 300 high quality disk recorder.

As the company has a lot of video servers installed, it will
probably also bring out a news editing system to run on them.  '

MAKING CONTACT WITH INDIA

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The world's second largest (behind China) and least tapped middle
class. India's increasingly affluent middle-income group currently
numbers nearly 250 million people, many of them with at least two
sources of disposable household income, and all looking for a
better quality of life.

The booming economy and the fast pace of development, combined with
a thirst for modernisation and technological expertise, have opened
up India's broadcasting and telecommunications markets as never
before.

Latest estimates show that radio reaches as much as 94 per cent of
the 950 million strong population, the bulk of it living in rural
areas which would be difficult for any other medium to reach.

Television now reaches as much as 84 per cent of the population.
It is axiomatic that, with the kind of headstart that the state-run
terrestrial broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) had, and the effective
monopoly it enjoyed until the start of the 1990s, its national
network and Metro channels (which reach the four metropolitan
centres) should have the maximum reach.

However, Zee TV, which is uplinked via satellite from Hong Kong, is
fast catching up; and there is vigorous competition from a host of
other channels. In comparison with 42 million homes that have DD,
there are 13 million homes today that boast cable and satellite;
and it is this latter segment which is showing signs of growing at
a much faster rate than the former. Official estimates place the
number of cable and satellite homes at 53 million by the year 2005.

TV stations cannot run without adequate software back-up; and
hundreds of companies that offer programming, production and post-
production services have mushroomed in the country over the last
five years, all on the lookout for new technology, both at the
production and post-production stages.

325 Companies Expected

Little wonder, then that some 325 companies are expected to
participate in Broadcast, Cable and Satellite India '96 (BCSI),
India's largest annual broadcast exhibition, which will run
concurrently with Communications India '96 at the Pragati Maidan,
New Delhi, from December 8 to 11.

"We had wonderful response last year for BCSI '95, with our
exhibition and conference providing an ideal forum for the
convergence of broadcasting, cable, satellite, communications and
multimedia packages," enthuses Prem Behl, president of Exhibitions
India, organisers of the event.

"That exhibition, which was the third in the series, paved the way
for several new joint ventures in these sectors, and provided the
ideal opportunity for Indian professionals to discern technological
advancements and gauge the latest market trends.

"The majority of the 121 exhibitors we had were pleased with the
outcome of business at the event, and 62 per cent confirmed their
participation in the following year's event, on the spot!"

Founded in 1987 to promote and organise international trade shows,
exhibitions and conferences, the organisers do much homework before
each event. Adds Behl, "We are not involved in trade, and therefore
have no conflict of interest with our exhibitors.

"In fact, we are a catalyst within the industry that we service,
bringing buyers and sellers together . . . we supplement our
exhibitors in the market by arranging and making it possible for
them to meet qualified, targeted buyers in a cost-effective way."

Catalyst to Contacts

The organisers remain in contact with leading international
associations, standards organisations, legislators, exhibitors,
manufacturers and service organisations worldwide, to facilitate
their participation at forthcoming events.

BCSI '96 is seen as India's official annual broadcast show, since
it is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,
and has the official approval of the India Trade Promotion
Organisation and the ministries of Home Affairs and External
Affairs.

Whereas BCSI '95 ran in October (attracting 121 exhibitors from 14
countries, and 14,203 visitors), and Communications India '95 was
held in December (133 exhibitors from 17 countries, and 16,677
visitors), the two shows have been combined this year to give
exhibitors and visitors the opportunity of witnessing complementary
advances in both fields.

Also running between December 8 and 11 at the same venue will be
Pro-Audio India '96, Lighting India '96, TV India '96, Networks
India '96 and Wireless India '96.

The stalls will be spread over a massive area of 7,000 sq. m on
Pragati Maidan, and are expected to attract 325 exhibitors and more
than 27,000 trade visitors from 30 countries.

In the broadcasting arena, professional camera, lighting, sound,
movie and video production and post-production products, cable and
satellite broadcast systems will all be on display.

Telecommunications product manufacturers will show off both voice
and data communications equipment and value-added services; local,
medium and wide area networks, and mobile systems including
cellular phones and pagers.

"Last year, a little over 50 per cent of the exhibitors were from
overseas," claims Behl. "This year, the ratio of overseas to
domestic exhibitors should be even higher. In addition, we expect
more than 2,000 attendees at the high-profile international
conferences covering all broadcast sectors and communications
technology and practices."

Conference: Digital Focus

The conference will focus on one of the industry's most challenging
issues - the transition to digital technology. It will focus on the
future of cable and telecom networks in India over the next few
years, and the expansion of production and post-production
facilities in the country.

Previous conferences have had delegates from India, the SAARC
countries, Africa, Australia, Europe and the US.

Says Behl, "While each exhibition makes headlines because of its
scope and focus, the conference components are just as important.

"It establishes the environment in which the industry will operate,
from both a technical and regulatory point of view, and defines the
intellectual grounds in which new applications, services or trends
are being utilised."

Visitor Profiles

The visitor profile is expected to include people from senior
levels of central and state governments, and from public and
private sector trade and industry. "We expect a cross-section of
people from all sectors - the government and administration, public
service organisations, the financial sector and management
executives," says Behl.

"In 1995, when we did an analysis of the visitor/buyer attendees,
we found that over 77 per cent visitors were the decision-makers of
their companies, who were involved in purchasing or recommending
the purchase of equipment or services."

Among the confirmed exhibitors at BCSI '96 are Panamsat, Intelsat,
PPC, Scientific Atlanta, General Instruments, Harmonic Lightwaves,
Dielectric Communications and Zenith Electronics (all US); Trans
Electric (Taiwan); Turner International, and Tektronix  (Hong
Kong), Technosat (Dubai); Federation of the Electronics Industry
(U.K), Belden International (Singapore); California Amplifier
(Thailand), EVS Broadcast Equipment (Belgium) and Deviser
Electronics (China).

Some of the prominent exhibitors from the host nation are C-Net
Communications, Prince Electronics, Miraj Marketing, Bhansali
Udyog, Network Limited and Real Image (who will demonstrate the
latest Avid media composer systems, audio-visual systems, airplay
systems, QFX sound effects organisers, media fusion systems,
digidesign session and proloops systems, etc).

"It is the ideal time of year to hold such an important exhibition,
since New Delhi will be cool and pleasant," asserts Behl.

"We are confident that it will be India's biggest show ever."  '

COURTING THE ASIAN BROADCASTER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The Asia-Pacific region now represents a key market for UK
manufacturers looking for untapped areas of growth. But what's in
it for the customers? Simon Croft reports

While the European hifi market is dominated by major Eastern brands
such as Sony and Pioneer, the Asian broadcast market frequently
adopts equipment made in the UK for audio production.

UK-based pro audio manufacturers including SSL and AMS Neve
increasingly regard the Asia-Pacific region as an important and
fertile area for new sales.

The evidence for this can be seen in the growing number of UK
manufacturers providing direct sales and support in Asian
countries.

New Sales Opportunities

The attraction for manufacturers is easy to understand. Major
brands which have achieved a large market share in North America
and Europe find it difficult to perpetually sustain the growth they
once enjoyed in these territories.

By contrast, the Asia Pacific broadcasting sector is undergoing
massive growth and continues to present new sales opportunities.

UK manufacturers can see that broadcasters in the Asia Pacific are
not only buying more equipment: they are also increasingly
demanding state-of-the-art systems to help them achieve a
competitive edge.

But it is by no means a one-sided situation. The UK has a very well
respected pro-audio manufacturing industry and Asian broadcasters
which invest in UK-built products today can be certain that the
solutions they buy into have been refined by a steady stream of
user feedback in the past.

SSL's Experience

Solid State Logic has been notably successful in the region and
recently opened an office in Singapore, which handles sales for a
number of countries as well as technical support for Asian
territories excluding Japan.

The manufacturer has for some years maintained an office in Japan
itself.

In addition, distributors in countries including Korea have been
gaining new contracts. Korean distributor Daiyoung Industrial
recently sold two SSL integrated digital multitrack recording,
editing and mixing systems. Facility Lead Sound opted for an
OmniMix for film and television post production, while HSTV, the
Home Shopping channel chose a Scenaria for its requirements.

Shanghai Radio, A-String in Taiwan and Avon in Hong Kong have all
taken analogue SL9000 series mixing systems. There have also been
recent sales to Synchrosound in Malaysia and Platinum Studios in
Taiwan

Market "Technique-driven"

SSL's Alan MacLeod believes that one of reasons top-end UK
manufacturers are successful in Asia is that the market is
'technique-driven'.

He explains, "When SSL brought out the B series consoles it
effectively enabled new ways of working.

"Hand in hand with the new capabilities of the system came
techniques that were not possible before. There is now global
acceptance of those techniques."

MacLeod also points out that while Asian manufacturers are ideally
geared up to mass production for the consumer market, "more than 90
per cent of the systems we produce are customised in some respect".

According to MacLeod, another factor driving sales of hi-end audio
equipment is a growing awareness that saleable programmes must have
high quality sound tracks.

"Programme makers are selling to broadcasters who may already be
transmitting in surround. As the uptake of domestic decoders
increases, high production values are increasingly essential," he
suggests.

While broadcasters look to overseas sales to maximise profits, and
independent programme-makers constantly seek to attract new buyers,
post-production facilities are constantly looking for a competitive
edge.

Performance: A Crucial Issue

"They want to offer good rates, the ability to meet deadlines
reliably and provide as much creative flexibility as possible,"
MacLeod notes.

He likens the situation to a race track: almost any car would
enable you to complete successive laps but if you want to win,
performance becomes a crucial issue.

KBS - Korea's largest radio and television broadcaster - recently
bought four new mixing consoles from AMS Neve. Two were high-end
Capricorn digital systems, while the other two desks were from the
well established and relatively inexpensive analogue 55 Series.

The KBS satellite television network covers South and North Korea,
Japan and the northern part of China. Two channels offer a range of
programming including sport, drama, documentaries and music.

David Lee of Korean distributor Seoul Sound Technology Group says,
"These sales are very significant for us. KBS is the main
broadcaster in the region and its purchasing decisions will
inevitable influence those of other facilities in Korea."

The two Capricorn consoles, which are being installed this month,
are to be used primarily for live broadcasting and music
production. They are going into KBS' Seoul-based satellite
television station, which was itself only launched in July this
year. Both are 48 fader systems.

The 32 fader 55 series consoles will be delivered in January next
year. They will be installed at KBS' radio station for use in live
music and talk shows.

Earlier this year, Measat Broadcast Services in Malaysia ordered
seven AMS Neve digital consoles for audio post production and
broadcasting.

Phase one of the broadcaster's plan saw the introduction of a 48
channel Capricorn digital desk for light entertainment production.

Also specified were four Logic 3 digital mixers with eight output
Audiofiles, all fitted with removable drives. Two of these were for
dubbing and the two for ADR.

Two Logic 2 digital mixing desks with eight output Audiofile
Spectras with removable drives are being commissioned for live
sound production. One stand-alone eight output Audiofile Spectra is
being used as well. All are fitted with 24-bit systems running
version 12 software.

AMS Neve has also received a repeat order from broadcaster NHK in
Tokyo. Its second large format Logic 2 digital mixing desk is being
used for audio posting in HDTV format programmes.

Like SSL, AMS Neve has a strong foothold in the music recording
sector. Recording studio Asahi Sound in Japan recently ordered its
third AMS Neve V series analogue console. The 60 channel VR Legend
has been installed in Studio 401.

In the case of large-scale consoles suitable for music recording,
the UK has undoubtedly been aided by its historical dominance of
the pop world and the product development that this has financed.

But by no means all UK manufacturers have a connection with the pop
music industry. Audio workstation manufacturer Digital Audio
Research is another UK company enjoying growing success in the
Asia-Pacific.

Towards the end of last year, the manufacturer supplied Malaysian
facilities house Addaudio Post Productions with a Soundstation Gold
integrated system. This gave Addaudio three DAR rooms in total.

At the time, studio manager Daniel Tang noted, "We have been using
DAR Soundstations since 1991 and are very happy with the overall
system approach, particularly in terms of Soundstation's
comprehensive editing facilities and ease of use."

Back For More

Now Addaudio is back for more, as DAR regional sales manager Alan
Campbell explains. "Addaudio have upgraded their two older systems
to Gold specification and have ordered two DAR Sabres this month."

Now a five DAR system facility, AddAudio will be using one of the
mouse-driven Sabres to create a lower cost post room and the other
as an eight track transfer room prior to projects entering one of
the fully equipped dubbing suites.

Elsewhere in Asia, DAR's Japanese distributor has sold systems to
broadcasters including JIC Satellite which opted for a Sabre Plus,
while major broadcasters including TBS have upgraded their existing
systems. Other users include national broadcaster NHK. "We have
done well in most of the major Asian countries, such as Korea,
Taiwan and Malaysia to a degree," says Campbell. "Japan and to a
lesser degree China have been successful for us. We see potential
in Indonesia.

"We are trying to boost the established markets and at the same
time keep up with the emergent markets such as Vietnam and
Cambodia, where they are starting to show real interest."

Working Developing Markets

In terms of developing markets, some products are easier to
introduce than others. Audio Processing Technology is a developer
of compression technologies, a major use for which is in the
distribution of audio via digital ISDN lines.

Although the company's main centres of operation are in the UK and
US, APT sales manager Asia Patrick Cullen is now permanently based
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

"Europe and America are our primary markets but Asia will become
increasingly important over the medium to long term, Cullen
predicts. "The technology we are offering, in terms of ISDN
solutions is still quite new.

"Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan are the more advanced countries but
elsewhere there is less knowledge of ISDN and there is a lot of
groundwork to do.

"In some senses we are having to sell the technology in advance of
the actual products."

Although Cullen estimates that around 95 per cent of broadcasters
in Japan using codecs are using APT technology, in other Asian
countries, there is still not the communications infrastructure to
support the digital technology APT offers.

"We have had our first sales in Taiwan and Korea and we are
involved in quite large projects in Thailand and Malaysia," Cullen
reports. "We are hoping that over the next two to three years we
can replicate the success we have had in Japan.

"It is important to break into new markets because broadcasters
like to know who else is using the equipment. They are reticent
about being the first."  '

MTV ANNOUCES EXPANSION PLANS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

MTV Networks Asia President Peter Jamieson today announced the next
phase in MTV's development in Asia, which are expected to take
place this year.

By the end of October, India will begin receiving its own MTV, a
third service seen only in the Indian subcontinent, while MTV
Mandarin moves its production base to Taipei.

To address MTV's growth in Southeast Asia, staff strength will be
increased with new hires, and all three channels will see the
addition of new programmes that reflect the social, cultural and
musical tastes of each region.

Singapore will remain the regional headquarters for MTV Networks
Asia. All channels will be post-produced and uplinked from
Singapore. The three channels will be referred to as MTV Asia, MTV
India and MTV Mandarin.

Apart from enjoying a new service specifically for them, Indian
viewers can look forward to new shows that will be produced in
India and Singapore, as well as a higher rotation of Indian music
videos, interviews and new features.

MTV India will be delivered to the Indian subcontinent on Panamsat
4, which up till the end of October delivers the MTV Asia feed
containing four hours of India-specific programming.

MTV Mandarin will move its production base from Singapore to
Taipei. The move beefs up the Taipei office with hiring new local
staff, and several of the channel's staff from Singapore, including
on-air personalities, will also be relocated to Taipei. The channel
will announce a roster of new shows in due course.

MTV Asia forges ahead with new programmes designed from Southeast
Asia, including new shows specific to Asean countries, plus
increased rotation of music videos from the region.

Recently, MTV Asia launched a new live music series called Live &
Loud, showcasing some of the best in upcoming Asian artists.

DOORDARSHAN TIGHTENS GRIP ON NDTV AND TV TODAY

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Doordarshan (DD) has issued notices to the owners of TV Today (part
of the India Today group) and New Delhi Television (NDTV),
informing them both that their current affairs programmes - Aaj Tak
(Until tonight) and News Tonight -  would not be televised on the
national network at prime time any longer.

Sources in the ministry for Information and Broadcasting (I&B) say
that, in all probability, News Tonight would be dropped altogether,
since the firm has entered into a tie-up with the Hong Kong based
Star TV network owned by Rupert Murdoch, to make similar
programmes.

The new schedule, which comes into effect on any day between
November 4 and 6, places both the current affairs programmes half
an hour later than their current slots. DD has also quadrupled the
telecast fees for both programmes, asking for payment much higher
than is being charged for tele-serials.

Both the private producers used to pay a fee of Rs35,000
(US$1,000), but this has now been increased sharply to Rs150,000
(US$4,225). And even this fee will suffer a review after six
months.

HP SERVER OFFERS MOST CHANNELS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Hewlett-Packard recently announced its support for clustered
networking of its broadcast servers, allowing up to 24 on-air
channels, the largest number of channels available in the broadcast
industry to date.

With the HP MediaStream Server - Broadcast Series as the core
building block, broadcasters can create truly scaleable systems -
from two to 24 channels - opening up new application areas for
digital server technology.

The HP MediaStream Server - Broadcast Series is the low-cost
building block of a multichannel system. It provides advanced
server capabilities - networking, a proven "bulletproof"
architecture, industry-standard MPEG-2 video compression and an
open platform for applications development - at prices starting at
US$100,000.

Because a single HP broadcast server offers up to six channels, it
is the ideal starting point for a multi-channel system.

With standard features such as RAID (redundant array of inexpensive
disks), redundant components and a multi-threaded operating system,
the HP clustered-server complex can offer complete redundancy
without the total mirroring of servers of the server complex
itself.

HP's use of MPEG compression also adds to the cost-effectiveness of
this multichannel solution. Because MPEG uses one-third less disk
space than Motion JPEG, storage costs are dramatically reduced.

This cost can be significant when considering the massive storage
needs of a multichannel facility or of a pay-per-view or NVOD
system. A key component of server clusters is the underlying
network used to connect multiple servers into a server complex.

HP has incorporated Fibre Channel networking into its servers for a
broadcast-studio environment. Fibre Channel is a very-high-speed
link capable of faster-than-real-time transfers.

It can be implemented in cost-effective "loop" configurations that
do not require the use of an expensive network switch.

MANILA'S PASI BUYS RUSSIAN SATELLITE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Philippine Agila Satellite, a government-backed consortium,
recently bought for US$9.5 million the country's first commercial
satellite from Russian space agency Intersputnik.

The satellite, Agila 1, is due to be operational by Nov 10, in time
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting, which is
being hosted by the Philippines.

The purchase of the Russian satellite is an interim measure,
pending completion in early 1998 of two other broadcast and
telecoms satellites, being built by Aerospatiale of France.

PASI's interim satellite has already been in orbit for three years
and the company has effectively bough the last two years of its
operational life, Mr Panizales said.

PASI was hard-pressed to come up with a satellite
telecommunications service for the APEC ministers meeting, which
starts Nov 24.

HUM AAPKE HAIN KAUN IN MASSIVE FESTIVE DEAL WITH STAR TV

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The Hindi feature film, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? (What is my
relationship with you?) is to be shown on November 10, the main day
of the Hindu festival Deepavali, on Star TV.

The premiere on the small screen will net the movie's producers,
the Barjatya family of Rajshree Films, a record Rs50 million
(US$1.4 million).

The film, which is basically a family entertainer, holds the record
for the highest box-office collections, having grossed more than
Rs2.25 billion (US$64 million) during the three years that it has
run at various cinema houses in the country.

It stars current matinee idol Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan in what
reviewers call a 'squeaky-clean' film. It is understood that Star
TV has forked over is Rs10 million, more than what Godrej Soaps had
to pay for sponsoring the Miss World beauty pageant in Bangalore in
November.

The deal, considered a major coup in the Hindi film industry, will
eclipse the trend set by another great Indian film Sholay (Embers),
which was recently screened by Doordarshan on a national holiday.

The screening, done through G. P Sippy Films, helped DD to pocket
around Rs25 million in ad revenues through the selling of 83 time
slots to various advertisers.

OVERWHELMING DEMAND REPORTED FOR ASTRO SERVICE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Most of Astro's first batch of 7,000 Digital Satellite Receivers
(DSRs) have been sold even before they reached the authorised
Philips dealers.

According to Paul Edwards, Astro's Chief Operating Officer, the
demand prior to the soft launch of Malaysia's new digital satellite
television and radio station on October 1, was overwhelming.

"We took nearly 3,000 calls last Thursday alone from interested
subscribers, and this is even before our advertising campaign
starts on October 12," he said.

The first subscribers are expected to have their sets installed
starting next week. Edwards said Astro will not be charging
subscribers during the month of October.

"October is a settling in period, and there will be some tuning of
the service. More shipments of the DSRs are on the way, but we
advise potential subscribers to reserve their DSRs now," he added.

Astro's Director of Information Systems, Andrew Lee, reported some
11,000 "hits" per day on the Astro Internet website. These included
both Malaysian and international users. The website can be accessed
at http:// www.astro.com.my.

"If there is any indication of interest, Astro has certainly caught
the imagination of the Malaysian public," said Lee.

Discreet Logic has announced the appointment of Peter Ramsay as
General Manager, Asia-Pacific.

Ramsay will be responsible for Discreet Logic operations in the
region including offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, India and Japan.

He joins the Discreet Logic Asia-Pacific team effective November 1,
1996 and will be based in Singapore.

Ramsay has worked in the broadcasting and video industry since 1981
and brings a wealth of management and technical experience from
companies including Tekniche, Dynatech and Chyron.

The post production market is maturing very quickly in Asia," said
Ramsay. "More and more customers are demanding the very highest
level of performance from both equipment and operators."

New Bombay Office

Discreet Logic recently extended its presence in the Asia-Pacific
region with a new office in Bombay that exclusively serves India.

This office will provide enhanced local support and training to the
increasing number of Discreet Logic clients in India.

Paresh Khara has been named Business Manager for the region, and
will manage a team of sales, systems integrators, demo artists and
support personnel, as well as close liaison with the regional
distributors.

Indian Market "Growing"

"The market in India has grown from a handful of PC-based post

ESPN PLAYS BALL WITH STAR SPORTS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Sports satellite channel giants and arch-rivals ESPN and Star
Sports have turned into somewhat uncomfortable bed-fellows, in an
effort to trim losses and beat the enormous pressure created by
intense competition and lack of sufficient revenues in the Asian
market.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two rival
channels, which was signed in early-October, clarifies that the
tie-up is only for Asia. It envisages the setting up of a new joint
venture company by ESPN and Star, to be headed by Sandy Brown of
ESPN.

The Delhi-based Modi Entertainment Network (MEN), which manages the
programming for ESPN, will continue in the same capacity for the
new network. MEN has a three-year contract with ESPN, of which just
one year has elapsed.

The main reason for the synergies between the two groups is that
the bidding route for sports programmes had become so high that
even advertising revenues have failed to cover the costs.

By joining hands, the two groups can try and ensure that the
programmes on the sale block remain between them, and that the
bidding price is not pushed too high.

In another related development, Star TV announced the joining of
former Doordarshan director-general R. Basu as managing director of
its India operations. Basu will head News Television International,
Murdoch's holding company in India.

NEW MALAYSIAN BROADCASTING BILL TABLED

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

MALAYSIAN Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat recently tabled
a Bill calling for a jail term of up to three years for anyone
failing to obtain a licence for receiving foreign broadcasts.

He said that the change to the current provisions were necessary to
keep ahead with technology.

"These changes should not be left to occur with no specific
direction, but be directed towards the benefit of the people and
the country," he said when tabling the Bill to amend the
Broadcasting Act 1988 in the Lower House of Parliament.

He added that the amendments will enable the licencing and control
of new broadcasting services, following advances in satellite
technology.

Under the amended act, a licence will be required from the
Information Ministry in order to receive any foreign broadcast or
telecast directly, and to make any transmission from Malaysia.

Offenders could face a fine of up to M$100,000 (US$39,280), or a
jail term of up to three years, or both.

Under the bill, the Information Minister will have the right to
determine the size and form of transmission receivers, control the
type and supply of broadcast materials to places such as hotels,
and to give exemptions for such licences in the broadcast of
official functions or other non-profit oriented public services.

The bill also states that prior approval will be needed from the
Information Minister before the screening of any advertisement, and
failure to do so will constitute an offence. Those convicted could
be fined up to M$10,000 (US$3930), jailed for a year, or both.

The Bill also incorporates additional areas such as ships and
aircraft, which were previously outside the ambit of the
Broadcasting Act's provisions.

The Minister added that that Malaysians could now watch programmes
from private TV stations and that subscribed television services
had been introduced last November.

He added that the launch (last January) of Measat 1, Malaysia's
first satellite, was a milestone in the development of broadcasting
and telecoms technology in the country.

"With wise management, satellite TV can help us in our effort to
create an informed society," he said.

Nonetheless, the government has the responsibility to ensure that
the technology will not be misused to jeopardise the national
interest socially, economically or politically, he continued.

The amendments will place the administration and licensing of radio
and television receivers under the direct supervision of the
Information Ministry.

In another report, the Minister for Energy, Telecoms and Posts,
Datuk Leo Moggie was quoted as saying that the development of the
multi-media super corridor and the growth in the number of
television users in the country would help boost the market for
satellite related service, and that Malaysia has surpassed the
average television and personal computers penetration levels for
developing countries.

He said that the telecommunications market in the Asia-Pacific
region had experienced tremendous growth over the past 15 years,
and that the demand for satellite capacity was expected to grow
from some 850 transponders in 1993 to about 1,300 in 1997, and to
more than 2,100 transponders eventually by the year 2000.

MALAYSIAN BROADCASTING: WATCH THIS SPACE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Malaysia certainly looks set to position itself to attract the
major broadcasting companies in its bid to become the region's
broadcasting hub, if the events over the last few months are any
indication.

The evidence is overwhelming: the recent launch of the country's
first national satellite television and radio project, Measat
Broadcast Networks Systems; an initial investment of an estimated
US$2 to $10 billion to realise plans to create a multimedia super
corridor via a new hi-tech city close to Putrajaya, the new
administrative capital; fresh incentives for foreign broadcast
companies to start up in the country, such as preferential
treatment for infrastructural contracts and corporate tax
exemptions; a proposed Bill of Guarantees to regulate intellectual
property legislation to protect investor interests; new amendments
to the Broadcasting Act to legalize parabolic dishes, antennae
decoders and radars; a third Measat satellite by the end of the
decade, amongst many other projects and plans all clearly signal
the country's intent to lead the region in broadcasting and
communications.

The signals say: "yes, we're serious and we want to lead. And don't
take our word for it. Our efforts will speak for themselves." Such
vigour is optimistic, refreshing, and will be exciting to watch.

Encyclopaedia Britannica Sets Big Plans Following Sale


Expanded programs, richer content and enhanced new media products are among
Encyclopaedia Britannica's future plans under the new ownership of an
investment group led by Swiss investor Jacob Safra.

"The new owner expressed interest in investing in content and technology,"
Joseph Esposito, Encyclopaedia Britannica president and chief executive
officer, told BPR.  He said the sale of the company will not spur any major
changes for the 2,400 Encyclopaedia Britannica employees worldwide.

"The sale has given us the capital to go forward...to enable us to compete and
maintain our name as the number one reference publisher in the
English-speaking world," said Esposito, who was promoted from president of
Encyclopaedia Britannica North America to his current position on July 1,
1995.  He succeeded Peter Norton, who retired June 30.

Though terms of the sale to Safra's group were not disclosed, analysts
estimated the property could fetch as much as $500 million.  When plans for a
sale were hinted at in the spring, speculation about possible buyers ranged
from Simon & Schuster to Microsoft.

Encyclopaedia Britannica released a statement in April saying it was seeking
cash to develop new products and sales channels, and that a new owner was one
of three options (BPR, May 22, 1995).  The other two options were a joint
venture partner and an outside investor.

At the time, Encyclopaedia Britannica denied it was leaning toward a sale,
saying it was "considering all alternatives equally."  Encyclopaedia
Britannica was owned by William Benton Foundation, an Illinois not-for-profit
organization whose sole beneficiary is the University of Chicago.

A Happy Ending For The Financial Story?

Encyclopaedia Britannica sales, like those of competitor World Book, have been
lagging in recent years.  Between 1990 and 1993, the number of book-sets sold
fell more than 50% from 117,000 to 51,000.  The company posted a slight
revenue decline in 1994, when it generated sales of $454 million.

According to Esposito, the financial backing from the new owner may allow
Encyclopaedia Britannica to get back on track with new products.  "We'll
expand our program and the content we create," Esposito told BPR.
Encyclopaedia Britannica also plans to further its position on the World Wide
Web.

Sale Comes During Company Overhaul

In August, Encyclopaedia Britannica began to restructure its North American
direct sales forces that is intended to more effectively target lead
generation and sales efforts, as well as reduce administrative costs.

Under the new organization, Encyclopaedia Britannica reduced its number of
sales offices from 91 to 20, and offered sales reps the opportunity to switch
from independent contractor to employee status.  With the shift, the company
has focused its efforts on the 4,800 zip codes from which 70% of its sales are
already generated.

Encyclopaedia Britannica's remaining sales offices are in Maryland, New York,
Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Colorado, Texas, California, Florida, New
Jersey, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, Minnesota and Canada.

Morrow Brings Rob Weisbach On Board, Forms New Imprint 


William Morrow & Co.  last month lured former Bantam Books senior editor Rob
Weisbach on board as vice president and publisher of his own imprint.

Rob Weisbach Books will launch Jan.  8 and "will play a significant part in
the continued growth and innovation at William Morrow," according to William
Wright, president and CEO of the Hearst Book Group.  The new imprint will
focus on high profile commercial non-fiction as well as fiction, and will
produce 10 to 12 titles a year.  Weisbach will hire a senior editor and an
assistant editor to staff the imprint.

While at Bantam, Weisbach published several New York Times bestsellers,
including titles by popular TV personalities Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser and
Ellen DeGeneres.  At Morrow, Weisbach said he intends to build "a list that
will be funny, inspiring and original...and will aim to satisfy a broad range
of readers."

Microsoft Press To Double Sales In Fiscal 1996, Says Welke


Microsoft Press (Redmond, WA), the computer book publishing arm of software
giant Microsoft Corp., expects to nearly double its revenues to more than $80
million in fiscal 1996, ended June 30, general manager Elton Welke told BPR.

The increase will come largely as a result of sales of Windows 95-specific
books, Welke said.  "We're having an astonishing year on top of a very good
year in fiscal 1995," he added.

Despite the fact that the release of the Windows 95 operating system slipped
out of fiscal 1995--where Microsoft Press budgeted for the windfall of Windows
95 revenues to hit--"we made our numbers without it."  and finished fiscal
1995 with $42 million in revenues, Welke said.  "Our fiscal 1996 numbers will
be extraordinary as a result" of the unbudgeted sales of Windows 95-specific
books, he told BPR.

Although Windows 95 has contributed significantly to Microsoft Press's recent
revenue growth, it's not the only topic that's hot.  Internet and professional
training books are doing very well too, Welke said.  In addition, Microsoft
Press will publish two interactive multimedia books on CD ROM this fiscal
year, and intends to release "considerably more" CD ROM titles in fiscal 1997,
according to Welke.

The publisher's most recent run-away bestseller is Windows 95 Resource Kit,
which has more than 1 million copies in print and 600,000 sold to date.

"Our international business is growing at a good clip, Windows 95 books are
selling well, we're continuing our basic line of applications and tutorial
books, we've increased our high-end technical books and we're entering into
interactive multimedia," Welke said.  "Right now, all cylinders are firing."

Banta To Buy Manufacturing Unit From Times Mirror Education Group


Banta Corp.  has agreed to acquire Times Mirror Higher Education Group's
manufacturing division.  Terms of the transaction, which is slated to close in
the first quarter of 1996, were not disclosed.

The acquisition will include the Dubuque, IA-based printing and bindery
operations that primarily serve the three educational publishing companies of
Times Mirror's Higher Education Group.  The Dubuque operation will become part
of the Banta Book Group, which has plants in Menasha, WI and Harrisonburg, VA,
and will remain fully intact with its 230 existing employees, a Times Mirror
Higher Education Group spokesperson told BPR.

The Times Mirror Higher Education Group includes Wm.  C.  Brown Publishers,
Brown & Benchmark Publishers and Richard D.  Irwin, and was the fourth-largest
higher education publisher in the U.S.  in 1994 with an estimated $230 million
in revenues (BPR, Aug.  21, 1995).  Banta will continue supplying the
education group with printing and graphic services after the sale goes
through.

G.  Franklin Lewis, chairman and CEO of the Times Mirror Higher Education
Group, said the company had "conducted a long and diligent search" for a buyer
that "could be a cultural match with the Times Mirror High Education Group;
would pursue the course of providing low-cost printing solutions to our
printing needs; and be a technology partner as we explore new and effective
ways of providing print product as well as increasing access to electronic
product...We believe we have that in Banta Corp."

Warner Bros.  Worldwide Licenses Characters To Seven Publishers


Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing (Burbank, CA) licensed its popular content
and cartoon characters to seven publishers who will produce roughly 90 books
based on the material.  The licenses are part of an ambitious effort on the
part of Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing that will result in the release of
more than 200 books based on its properties in 1996.

The seven publishers who licensed the material are Landoll Publishing, Walter
Foster Publishing, Publications International, Penguin USA, Warner Books,
Scholastic Inc.  and DC Comics.

Of the group, Landoll Publishing (Ashland, OH) will release the first titles
with a 42-book mass market line of color and activity books, paint with water
books, sticker, marker and paint pop-up books and story books.  All titles
will feature Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and other Warner Bros.  characters.  The
line will launch Jan.  15.  Landoll's deal calls for at least 24 additional
titles to be released next summer featuring the Animaniacs, Pinky & The Brain,
Slappy Squirrel and Goodfeathers characters.

Beginning in April, Publications International (Lincolnwood, IL) expects to
release a line of electronic chip "Play-a-Sound" books, each with four, five,
seven or 16 sound buttons.  DC Comics licensed Pinky and The Brain for a line
of 12 comic books to be released in May in the U.S.  and Canada.

Walter Foster Publishing will release two how-to-draw books in June as part of
its agreement.  Later in the summer, two graphic novels based on the
Animaniacs characters will be published by Scholastic Inc.

Though Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing operates separately from Time Inc.
and its imprints, sister company Warner Books (New York) was cut a piece of
the deal through an agreement to publish four adult pop-up books featuring the
Looney Tunes characters.

Finally, next holiday season, Penguin USA (New York) will release a line of
children's titles, including plush books, electronic chip books and paint
books based on Warner Bros.  characters.

Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing was launched in 1994 by Warner Bros.
Consumer Products, which handles licenses for Warner Bros.  content and
characters (BPR, March 28, 1994).

Time Warner AudioBooks Reorganizes, Moves To New York


Time Warner AudioBooks today moves from Los Angeles to New York and makes
Warner Books its sole distributor.

With the shift, former vice president of operations Judith McGuinn was named
vice president and director of Time Warner AudioBooks.  McGuinn will be
responsible for day-to-day operations and strategic planning, and reports to
Maureen Mahon Egen, senior vice president and publisher of Warner Books.

Egen said the relocation will provide better opportunities for cross-promotion
of audiobooks through the sales and marketing operations already in place for
books.

The company will have a west coast production office in Century City where
Maja Thomas, director of production, and John Whitman, executive editor, will
be based.  All other departments will be housed in the Time Life building in
New York.

House Votes To Allow Lawmakers Book Royalties, But No Advances


In a vote sparked by the year-old ruckus surrounding House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's controversial multi-million dollar book deal with HarperCollins,
the House approved a proposal allowing lawmakers to receive unlimited book
royalties--as long as they have their contracts cleared by the ethics
committee and do not accept advances from publishers.

The House voted 259 to 128 to adopt the rule proposed by Rep.  Gerald Solomon
(R-NY).  The vote flew in the face of a 10-0 ethics committee recommendation
on Dec.  6 to curb royalty income starting Jan.  1, 1996 by including the
monies in the $20,040 cap on outside earned income for lawmakers.

Failure to pass the proposal could have cost Gingrich millions in royalties he
will collect from sales of the HarperCollins title released in 1995, To Renew
America.

Gingrich drew fire when it first became public that he was in line to collect
a $4.5 million advance for a two-book deal he struck with HarperCollins, a
division of media conglomerate News Corp.  The deal was labeled unethical
because News Corp.'s Fox Television Network was embroiled in a battle with the
Federal Communications Commission over foreign ownership of TV stations.
Public outcry forced Gingrich to give up the advance, but not the royalties
the two books will generate.

According to House Democratic Whip David Bonior (D-MI), last week's action
marked the first time a recommendation from the ethics committee was weakened
in a House vote.

In a report on its findings on ethics charges against Gingrich, the ethics
committee last week stated, "The committee strongly questions the
appropriateness of what some could describe as an attempt by Rep.  Gingrich to
capitalize on his office...The committee believes that the existing House rule
must be changed to clearly restrict the income a member may derive from
writing books."

Steck-Vaughn Acquires Summit Learning In $4 Million Deal


Educational publisher Steck-Vaughn last month acquired Ft.  Collins, CO-based
Summit Learning from American Educational Products for approximately $4
million.

Steck-Vaughn was the fifth-largest U.S.  publisher of supplementary
educational materials in 1994 with revenues of $53.6 million, according to
BPR's sister publication, Educational Marketer.  AEP, which also owns
Scott/Hubbard and Churchill Films, was the tenth-largest U.S.  publisher of
supplementary educational materials in 1994, with estimated revenues of $21.1
million.

The acquisition will allow Steck-Vaughn to broaden its marketing channels to
reach school decision makers at all levels through Summit's established direct
response marketing presence among both classroom teachers and consumers.
Steck-Vaughn said it expected Summit's 1995 revenues to top $10 million.

Steck-Vaughn will use Summit as a launchpad for a new line of proprietary
products for the parent and teacher store market.  Until now, Summit has
focused primarily on mathematics curriculum, with a growing presence in
science.

Legal Publishers See Growth Via Electronic Products


Editor's note:  This is the first in a two-part series on the legal book
publishing market.

According to the Book Industry Study Group's Book Industry Trends 1995, the
legal publishing market accounted for $1.3 billion dollars in 1994, up 10.3%
over 1993.  Although law publishers have experienced the same acquisition
frenzy found in other areas of the publishing industry, new owners have tended
to keep their subsidiaries separate, using them to establish or maintain
niches in the marketplace.

A recent informal BPR survey of key legal publishers found that despite the
acquisitions, a fairly level playing field has been maintained.  In addition,
advances in electronic media have revolutionized the way legal information is
published.

"The industry is not necessarily getting consolidated, but there are more big
players," said Paul Wojcik, president & chief operating officer of The Bureau
of National Affairs Inc.  "We might be the largest independent legal
publishing company left."

The Bureau, which reported a 7.3% increase in 1994 operating revenues to
$215.5 million, is entirely employee owned.  Of BNA's 1,800 employees, 1,500
are based in Washington, DC with the rest scattered as correspondents in state
capitals.  Publishing more than 200 print and electronic products of national
scope per year (including four daily publications and a number of
newsletters), the company divides its books into three categories:
Environmental Safety & Health, Human Resources & Labor Management, and Law,
Business and International.  In 1994, the book division reported revenues of
$4.7 million, a company record.

BNA counts among its key titles Media Law by Rex S.  Heinke (1994), the
three-volume Copyright Law and Practice by William Patry (1994), and Mental
and Emotional Injuries in Employment Litigation by James J.  McDonald, Jr.
and Francine B.  Kulick (1994).

The company has discontinued the 28 looseleaf binder version of BNA's
Environment Library and now offers the product exclusively on CD ROM.
Products on CD ROM now account for more than half of BNA's subscription sales.

"The electronic information piece is booming," Wojcik noted.  "It's also the
most confusing part of the business."  A particular benefit of the CD ROM
format, according to Wojcik, is the ability to add large amounts of public
domain information to existing texts.

Thomson Legal Publishing, a division of The Thomson Corp.  (Toronto), made
several key acquisitions in the past year.  The most recent buy included the
topical product business and other non-citation legal information products
from Shepard's McGraw-Hill in November.  The company will integrate Shepard's
products into its existing U.S.  legal publishing operations, which has 3,000
employees and annual revenues of $400 million.

In other acquisitions, however, Thomson Legal Publishing has maintained the
separate identities of its companies, which include Bancroft-Whitney of San
Francisco, Lawyer's Cooperative Publishing of Rochester, NY and Clark Boardman
Callaghan of New York.

Bancroft-Whitney, for example, is devoted to publishing materials for the
California law market.  When Thomson acquired San Francisco-based Barclay's
Law Publishers in February 1995, its California unit was transferred to
Bancroft-Whitney, with the remainder of the company left to function as a
division of Lawyer's Cooperative Publishing.  In November, Bancroft-Whitney
acquired Legal Solutions Inc., a producer of legal forms for California
attorneys.  LSI maintains separate headquarters in Corona, CA.

With approximately 160 employees, Bancroft-Whitney published four print and
six electronic titles in 1995.  Among its major titles are the Witkin library
of four California legal treatises, (which is handled by a separate 15-person
department), Deering's California Codes (186 hardbound volumes, updated
annually) and Barclay's Official California Code of Regulations.  All are
available in CD ROM format as well as print.

Barclay's employs 30 people in south San Francisco.  According to publisher
Laurie Carron, the company's charter as part of Thomson is to "sell to the
non-legal market."  This is achieved by "slicing and dicing" state codes for
businesses into industry-specific products.  "Businesses that are regulated,
not just the lawyers, need these codes," she said.  Barclay's currently
publishes official codes in four states.  "We try to add new states all the
time," Carron said.

The second part of this series will feature Matthew Bender, John Wiley & Sons,
West Publishing, Wolters Kluwer and Reed Elsevier.

In The Loop. . .


Dove flies to larger coop...Beverly Hills, CA-based Dove Audio Inc.  last
month completed a $5.8 million equity offering that will allow it to move to
larger quarters in West Hollywood in February.  Dove used the offering
proceeds to buy the two-story, 22,000 square-foot building that formerly
housed the Writer's Guild of America.  The new facilities will include two
state-of-the-art, fully-digital recording studios, editorial suites, a storage
area with a computerized catalog system to archive all Dove masters, and will
be equipped to do audio and video post-production work.  The building will
also include retail space.  Dove president Michael Viner said the move was
necessary because staff size has doubled over the past year, and noted the
purchase of the building fits with future expansion plans for Dove Audio.

New book finds bumps in 'The Road Ahead'...  A little more than a month after
Penguin USA's release of The Road Ahead by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates,
naysayer Anthony "Andy" Martin has entered the fray with a book of his own:
Bill Gates:  The Robber Baron of Cyberspace.  In announcing the release of his
book, Martin, executive director of a Washington, DC-based organization called
"the Committee to Fight Microsoft Corp.," claims to answer the "dire
forecasts" put forth by Gates in his book.  Martin says his title is based on
"original research, 'inside' Microsoft sources and a searching review of
available public records and documents."  Bill Gates:  The Robber Baron of
Cyberspace is available through its Palm Beach, FL-based publisher, Orange
State Press, for $19.95.  Meanwhile, The Road Ahead ranked as as one of the
top-selling books of the 1995 holiday buying season.

Waterstone's to hit 'The Wall'?...Rumor on the street has it that U.K.-based
parent company W.H.  Smith this month will merge the management of its
respective U.S.  bookstore and music store chains, Waterstone's and The Wall.
A source within the company told BPR it was unclear whether the merger would
extend to the primarily mall-based stores themselves.

'Free Press' coming this month...In an effort to speed Free Press hardcover
titles to press in paperback format, Simon & Schuster will launch a new
paperback imprint this month--Free Press Paperbacks.  The imprint is expected
to release one to two dozen titles a year, the first of which will be The Bell
Curve by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein.  Simon & Schuster folded The
Free Press hardcover imprint into its trade books division in June 1995 (BPR,
June 28, 1995).  Free Press publishes about 100 titles a year on a variety of
topics, including business, social issues, politics, history and behavioral
science.

People In The News.  .  .


Crown Books parent Dart Group last week lost its knight in shining armor when
Robert Marmon resigned because he and Dart Group could not agree upon an
ongoing compensation package.  Marmon, who has served as Dart's chief
financial officer since October 1994 and was instrumental in putting in place
a plan to restore stability to the company following the raging battles of the
Haft family, will remain at Dart through February to help recruit his
successor.

Separately, Crown Books named John Sutton, Cynthia Holland and Ellen Marshall
as divisional merchandising managers.  Sutton will handle the buying of all
trade fiction, non-fiction and mass market books.  Holland will oversee the
buying of all other merchandise, and Marshall will be responsible for
merchandising operations.  Sutton and Marshall are veteran Crown employees,
while Holland moved to Crown from Waldenbooks in the summer of 1994.

HarperCollins named Matthew Goldberg vice president, director of product and
market development for its Adult Trade Publishing Group.  Goldberg was
formerly director of national accounts at HarperCollins.  In addition, the
publisher named Linda Stormes vice president, director of national accounts.
Stormes moved to HarperCollins from Random House, where she had been national
account manager.  HarperCollins also named Jeff Rogart to the newly combined
position of director of sales/advanced media and merchandise accounts.  In
addition to his current responsibilities for selling HarperCollins' advanced
media products to all channels, Rogart will assume direct selling
responsibilities to Price Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's, as well as the
distributors that serve that marketplace.

Recent appointments at Avon Books included naming Jennifer Hershey as
executive editor and Jennifer Brehl as senior editor.  Hershey joined Avon
from Bantam Books, while Brehl, who will oversee Avon's science fiction and
fantasy list, was previously at Bantam Doubleday Dell.  The appointments
follow those of Debby Tobias to vice president, director of sales, and Trish
Lande Grader to executive editor (BPR, Nov.  20, 1995)

Des Moines, IA-based Meredith Corp.  named Barb Preuss advertising and
merchandising manager for retail book marketing at its publishing group.
Preuss was previously direct mail copywriter at Kirke-Van Orsdel Inc., a West
Des Moines insurance company.

Is DirecTv phenomenon destined for Europe?

The sense of anticipation is palpable. With only weeks to go until two of
Europe's TV giants - CLT and Canal+ - take the bull by the horns and launch
digital services, 1996 could be the year digital TV at last becomes a
reality in Europe.

In the last six months, digital has shifted from being a theoretical,
almost futuristic concept, to a viable business opportunity - maybe even a
necessity. The model in all this is the U.S., where DirecTv and Primestar
have triumphed beyond all expectations, to the extent that digital
satellite television (DST) in the U.S. is now seen as the first genuine
threat to cable's multichannel dominance.

This lesson was rammed home in a fiercely bullish report from SBC Warburg
in December which argued that the success of DirecTv in particular had
transformed the business case for digital satellite. Two examples stand
out: DirecTv's success in pay-per-view, and the potential for
satellite-delivered online services.

DirecTv has resuscitated the comatose PPV market in the U.S., thanks to
more channels (70+), impulse ordering and user-friendly onscreen guides. At
3.78 per month, buy rates are five to six times those achieved by cable
MSOs. The average monthly spend by subscribers on PPV is $17.44 (Primestar,
with more big ticket events and higher prices, generates $32.73 a month).

In Warburg's words, that potentially makes PPV a "really significant
generator of business for BSkyB and Canal+." Warburg's BSkyB valuation
model projects PPV revenues in 2002 of #100 million ($155 million), but its
analysts now reckon this could be too low "by a factor of five times."

Equally significant is the potential appeal of interactive services off
satellite. Using a telephone line as the upstream, digital satellites could
deliver Internet access at more than 30 times the speed of a full
phone-line service. Hughes, the owner of DirecTv, already offers a similar
service in the U.S., DirecPC. In Europe, Kinnevik plans to deliver
satellite online services in Scandinavia this year.

The message is clear. Digital satellite, for so long a mysterious,
uncertain business case for analog pay TV operators terrified of destroying
their existing businesses, in fact holds huge potential. Cable operators
may have to face up to the fact that digital satellite can do almost as
much as their expensive fiber-based wired systems can.



1996: Europe's digital year?

Players in terrestrial TV, cable, satellite, publishing and film all
harbor digital TV aspirations. But in Europe, labyrinthine cross-holdings
and non-competition clauses muddy the waters. Some companies have struck
technological and corporate alliances that tidy up the sector in
preparation for the shift to digital - but many more are needed.

For instance, Germany's Kirch Group has abandoned its unilateral digital
decoder system, the "D-box", and joined the list of companies signing up
for MediaGuard, the digital decoder developed by Bertelsmann and Canal+.
From the moment Deutsche Telekom, which controls 90% of German cable
subscribers, chose MediaGuard, Kirch's surrender became inevitable.

A similar kind of inevitability hangs over the future of CLT's digital
plans, particularly in France. Bertelsmann, News Corp., Havas and Walt
Disney were reported as likely buyers, or at least partners, of the
Luxembourg broadcasting giant, which has plans for digital services in
France and Germany.

The reason for those rumors is simple. In France, a CLT digital package
would compete with a similar planned package from Canal+. The two companies
share a common shareholder, Havas, that is unlikely to fund competing
digital services, nor see Canal+ damaged by a rival service.

Most likely, CLT will either join up with Canal+, or Havas will sell its
stake in CLT to another buyer. In this context, the business logic behind
the rumors about CLT's future is compelling. When added to the
near-certainty that BSkyB has European ambitions, and the best way to
fulfill these ambitions will be in digital satellite, a News Corp. link-up
looks convincing. But Bertelsmann is not likely to countenance an
infringement on its own territory - hence its connection with CLT. tv

Rewe joins Pro 7 to crank up German TV money machine

On the back of unprecedented commercial broadcasting growth, Germany
ushered in the new year with a brand new TV player. Rewe AG, the country's
largest supermarket and discount retail group, took a 40% stake in
fifth-ranked German network Pro Sieben (Pro 7).

Rewe's entry into the TV market may be only the first maneuver in a
process of financial retrenchment and, possibly, consolidation in Europe's
largest TV market. Germany is preparing to quadruple the size of that
market for the second time in 10 years, with the advent of digital TV. It's
also dealing with probable regulatory change and a likely medium-term
slowdown in an advertising market that has been up, up, up for the best
part of a decade.

Cologne-based Rewe's investment in Pro 7 takes some of the heat off Leo
Kirch and his son Thomas - for years they have been accused of playing hard
and fast with ownership ceilings thanks to Kirch pere's numerous
investments.

Pro 7's new alliance, and a planned public stock offering, should dispel
accusations that the broadcaster is unofficially controlled by Leo through
Thomas. Rewe spokesman Wolfram Schumck says the new partner has no concrete
plans with Pro 7 just yet: "We have to get to know each other first."

Rewe massive revenues (DM46 billion ($32 billion) in 1994) will add strong
backing to Pro 7's mission to compete with the other four "major" German
networks - state networks ARD and ZDF and commercial giants RTL and SAT 1 -
in a world of digital channels and fragmentation.

For Rewe, diversifying into commercial TV is in line with board chairman
Hans Reischl's strategy of "investing in promising future markets." Pro 7
anticipates revenues of DM1.45 billion in 1995, with pre-tax profits of
about DM200 million, making it the most profitable network in Germany, with
operating margins in excess of 17%. According to Pro 7 spokesman Torsten
Rossmann, Rewe won't participate directly in financing acquisition of
rights and production costs, "but as a strong shareholder, [it] will
facilitate obtaining bank credits."

The Rewe announcement came soon after Pro Sieben Television's official
conversion into an AG (joint stock company) in anticipation of a summer
1996 public flotation of 35% of the company. The conversion reduces Thomas
Kirch's stake to 24.5% and liquidates the 49.5% stake held by Gerhard
Ackermans.

Pro 7's initial public offering will be a German TV first, offering a
desirable investment vehicle. Pro 7 expects the listing to raise DM300
million. Analysts at London brokerage SBC Warburg have initially valued the
free float in the range of DM700-DM900 million. Prior to the listing, two
businesses may be divested: the film and TV production arm (to be taken
over by Thomas Kirch and Pro 7 MD Georg Kofler) and home shopping channel
H.O.T.

Rewe sources say the price for its stake is well in excess of DM60
million. Assuming Pro 7 maintains annual revenue growth of 8-10% over the
next two years, SBC Warburg's preliminary valuation is in line with
multiples at similar European TV companies such as France's M6 and TF1 and
the UK's HTV and Scottish TV.



Market prospects

With almost 30 terrestrial and cable services available, the German TV
market is the most developed in Europe, even though TV's share of the
advertising market (at $4 billion gross, 20% of the total) still has room
to grow.

German TV's share of total spend is only half the level of that in Spain.
Germany boasts 32.4 million TV homes, 15.6 million of them connected to
cable - a primary reception vehicle for many commercial channels. Since
1990, the number of channels has grown from four to 15.

A concerted effort on the part of most commercial channels to attract
middle market and youth viewers has driven up program costs, both for local
fare and imports. Rights values skyrocketed in 1995, spurred by commercial
TV leader RTL, which forked out $250 million to snatch a Warner Bros.
package from under the nose of the Kirch Group. The deal included TV rights
to 44 prime feature films.

In November, Kirch fought back and stumped up $30 million for German TV
rights to a Steven Spielberg package that included mega-hits Jurassic Park
and E.T. The bid broke all previous payment levels for single film titles.
Public broadcaster ARD separately bought TV options on all properties from
new Spielberg vehicle DreamWorks through the end of the decade.

Whether the channels can sustain such prices is unclear. Efforts to boost
in-house production have brought mixed results at RTL. Pro 7 has stepped up
to the domestic production plate, spending DM400 million in 1995 on its own
TV films and enhanced news coverage. Pro 7's total program budget for 1996
stands at DM1 billion.

Short-term growth in the German TV ad market is likely to sustain the
existing setup, with regulators rather than cash-strapped advertisers
driving investments. In spite of a sluggish 1995 economy, TV advertising
was buoyant last year, with growth estimated at 11% (having jumped nearly
16% in 1994). Zenith Media reckons 1996 will be equally healthy, with TV
forecast to generate over DM6.9 billion.

But not all broadcasters are sanguine about the medium-term: "The
advertising boom is over," says Rossmann. "Growth will be less and
competition harder."

One factor is a growing stable of niche channels fighting over this TV ad
pie. On top of that, the role of the regulator remains unclear. Germany's
law-makers have played kingmaker in the last 10 years, in the face of a
virtual TV "triopoly" - Bertelsmann, Kirch and CLT.

In October 1995, federal regulators drafted rules on channel ownership,
whereby one company will be allowed to control up to 30% of total viewing,
regardless of the number of channels owned. Kirch already takes 29.5% of
the audience; Bertelsmann controls just under 20% and CLT, 22.7%. In
anticipation of the 1997 enforcement of the new rules, 1996 could see the
first phase of channel ownership consolidation.

Digital, however, could significantly alter the competitive balance,
putting Pro 7 and the other "second division" channels in a position to
launch their own stables of channels. Pro 7 has five transponders booked on
Astra's digital satellites 1F and 1G, and should be well-positioned to
expand into pay offerings. tv

Dutch print moves to buy up channels

Two Dutch publishers are buying into TV channels. Dutch bank Mees Pierson
is handling "serious" negotiations between Scandinavian Broadcasting
System's SBS6 and Dutch daily paper De Telegraaf. The newspaper wants a 35%
stake in SBS6 as a springboard for future projects like online services;
SBS6 wants a Dutch backer to solidify its local image. SBS6 wants to buy
HMG's channel RTL-5, but is reportedly offering well below the asking price.
Dutch regional publisher Wegener is close to gaining 100% control of
Arcade Entertainment's three TV channels, radio, music, video and film
retail operation, worth $500 million a year.

ExpressVu and Power/DirecTv have received licenses to broadcast digital

ExpressVu and Power/DirecTv have received licenses to broadcast digital
DTH services into Canada, offering distinct competition to the country's
cable sector for the first time. At the same time, Canadian MSOs - led by
Shaw Communications - were refused a license for their own DTH service,
Homestar.

ExpressVu is owned by BCE Inc. (the parent company of telco Bell Canada)
and broadcaster Western International Communications, among others.
Power/DirecTv is 80%-owned by Canada's Power Corp. and 20% by
DirecTv/Hughes Electronics Corp. The new DTH services will provide as many
as 70 channels of pay-per-view programming, in addition to traditional
services; both services will launch in 1996.

Five new DTH PPV programming services were also licensed, including a new
sports/special events service backed by the CTV Television Network, and
separate movies/special events services from Power/DirecTv itself, Viewer's
Choice/Home Theater and Canal Premiere.

Because there will be competition between the two services, regulatory
body the CRTC will not regulate their rates. Like cable, the new DTH
services will be subject to certain requirements in terms of basic service,
maintenance of Canadian services and open access for all programming
services. They must contribute 5% of their annual gross revenues to funds
that support Canadian program production.

In a nod to increased competition, the CRTC will consider applications for
future DTH services six months after the two new services are launched,
offering a possible second chance to Homestar.

Report round-up

Interactive cable TV will reach only reach 4.6 million Asia Pacific homes
by 2005, according to a report from UK consultants Ovum. In Interactive
Television: The Market Opportunity, Ovum forecasts that 26.4 million
households in the U.S. and 23.1 million in Europe will have cable access to
interactive TV in 10 years.

Cash flow will still be negative in Asia Pacific in 2005 as a result of
the low penetration, but will be positive in Europe by 2002. Interactive TV
will generate $4.31 billion in advertising revenues in Europe and $782
million in Asia Pacific in 2005: both are swamped by the U.S. figure of
$9.03 billion.

After two years of delays, revisions and in-fighting, the Spanish cable

After two years of delays, revisions and in-fighting, the Spanish cable
law was finally passed in the New Year. In the end, it included most of the
amendments demanded by the opposition Partido Popular. Despite that, the
opposition voted against. If the PP wins the election in March, the party
has vowed to change the law.

PP amendments in the bill include minimum and maximum franchise areas of
50,000 and 1.5 million people and a proposal that the second of the two
licenses to be awarded in each area will be decided by a commission
comprising central, regional and local government - a seeming recipe for
bureaucratic disaster.

Perhaps the most contentious part of the law - the automatic awarding of
the first license in each area to telco Telefonica - remains Telefonica has
already launched cable service via Cablevision, its joint venture with
Prisa, cabling 2,600 homes in Barcelona and starting operations in 16
cities. It offers a 40-channel package, including film channels TNT,
Cinemania, and Cine Clasico, and sports channels Teledeporte, Eurosport and
Esportmania (from Prisa).

The potential glitch for Cablevision is the clause in the new law that
forbids Telefonica from launching cable operations until nine months after
the second, commercial license is opened for bidding. Prisa maintains this
does not apply to cities where it has already started operations.

AB launches dawn raid on French digital

French TV production house AB Productions, owned by Claude Berda and
Jean-Luc Azoulay with annual revenues of FFr1 billion ($204.5 million), has
jumped the digital Gallic gun by launching its analog AB1 channel January 1
on Eutelsat II F1. AB also announced plans for a 30-channel digital,
encrypted bouquet with nine channels to be running by February.

AB hopes to sign up at least one cable operator by the end of January at a
price of around FFr2.50 per subscriber per month.

A French government-commissioned report on the future of satellite TV,
published January 4, suggests it is time state-owned France Telecom
acknowledges it cannot compete with Astra and Eutelsat in the DTH market
and abandons its third generation of satellites.

Murdoch bids for Olympic European TV rights

Rupert Murdoch's latest raid on sports rights is aimed at the most sacred
prize of all - the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee says a
consortium led by News Corp. has submitted a "serious bid" for European TV
rights to all Olympic events between 2000 and 2008. Reportedly, the bid is
worth more than $2 billion.

News Corp. has been a mammoth sports rights buyer in the UK, the U.S.,
Asia and Australia. For the past 12 months, the company has been developing
its international sports assets, with News Corp. subsidiary Fox and cable
giant TCI merging their sports channel interests.

News Corp.'s main competitor for the Olympics will be the European
Broadcasting Union, which represents many of Europe's TV networks. Snapping
up long-term Olympic rights is becoming fashionable - U.S. network NBC
practically locked up U.S. broadcast and cable rights to the Olympics until
2008, for $2.3 billion.

TV2 monopoly broken
The Norwegian parliament has ended the advertising monopoly held by
national commercial channel TV2. The government had previously outlawed the
use of programming from SBS-owned satellite channel TV Norge by regional
terrestrial broadcasters, since it put TV Norge in direct competition for
advertising with TV2. The government has now allowed the redistribution of
TV Norge's programming. TV2 plans to sue the government for $100 million in
damages from lost ad revenues .

UK cable ads up
UK cable and satellite TV ad revenues are predicted to jump 25% in 1996,
according to a report from merchant bank Goldman Sachs. The sectors are
predicted to increase ad revenues to #171 million ($265.5 million), up from
#137 million in 1995. The total TV ad pie for 1996 is estimated at #2.39
billion.

although the merger is still thought to be going through.

l Iranian police raided 110 houses in Tehran, seizing banned satellite TV
equipment used to watch "corrupting" Western programs, according to local
papers. There are an estimated 250,000 satellite dishes in Iran, despite a
1995 edict ordering the dismantling of all-such equipment.

l In order to satisfy the European Commission's anti-cartel regulations,
Dutch producer Endemol Entertainment could pull out of HMG, the holding
company that owns RTL-4, Veronica and RTL-5, rather than reduce its stake
from 24% to 7.5% (the maximum allowed by European regulations). HMG backers
CLT, VNU and Veronica would each retain a one-third stake.

l The Brazilian Congress will formalize the guidelines for commercializing
the country's telecoms sector early in 1996. Regulations go before a
special congress in late-January (TVI, Dec. 11, 1995).

One partner away from dual service dexterity, Argentine MSO goes fiber

"Wanted: investors with cash and experience in telecommunications
services: foreigners welcome." This may as well be the sign outside the
door at Argentine cable operator Video Cable Comunicacion this year. Telco
investment scouts looking south of the border for a well-placed growth
vehicle need look no further than Argentina's largest MSO.

VCC is Latin America's biggest MSO, closing 1995 with 623,400 subscribers,
about 12% of all Argentine subscribers.

VCC was the first Argentine MSO to close a deal with a foreign partner.
Continental Cablevision bought a 50% stake in late 1994 for $150 million -
yet VCC founder-owner Samuel Liberman retained control, which is why there
are no Continental executives stationed in Buenos Aires.

VCC's greatest asset is the geographic spread of its systems - mostly
acquired during a 1993-94 spree - that line a 400-mile industrial corridor
from Buenos Aires via Rosario to Cordoba.

The affluent business corridor generates about 75% of Argentina's GDP, and
if business telephony/data transmission fulfills its promise as the hot
growth center over the next 10 years, VCC is well-placed to take advantage
(rival MSO Multicanal is more widespread outside Buenos Aires, but has
lower penetration in the biggest provincial cities).

But much depends on how alliances shape up. VCC's assistant CEO Carlos
Pratola says that securing another partner - probably foreign - will be a
priority this year, to help develop its telephony business. The company
also aims to build up its Buenos Aires penetration from 50% to 60%.

Regulation remains the key variable. Argentina's telco duopoly, Telefonica
and Telecom, has the option of sacrificing state protection in November
1997 in exchange for permission to enter video services. But the MSOs are
seeking protection from the telcos through a new broadcast bill, soon to be
debated in congress. Argentina's cable operators are asking for a window of
several years to develop telephone services before the telcos muscle in on
their turf.



Despite being one of the most mature Latin cable markets, Argentina's
multichannel market continues to evolve. In 1993, massive consolidation
among the nation's 1,200 cable operators produced four dominant MSOs. In
late 1994, big investments by Continental Cablevision and TCI confirmed
that Argentina's $1.5 billion-a-year industry had enough growth potential
to lure the biggest players.

In 1995, as MSOs focused on standardizing operations among the systems
acquired in 1993-94, the first accord between a telco and an MSO hinted at
the shape of things to come: a converged landscape with a few multi-service
providers dominating the information industry.

By 2000 there may be just three road hogs jostling on Argentina's
info-highway. One certain competitor to VCC is Multicanal, a subsidiary of
Argentina's largest media/entertainment group, Clarin (TVI, Feb. 13, 1995).
Multicanal has an agreement with Spain's aggressive Telefonica
Internacional (TISA), a controlling shareholder in Telefonica de Argentina;
TISA plans to buy 25% of Multicanal.

Four players - Telecom, CableVision (owned by TCI Intl.), Fincable/Cabtel
and VCC - are expected to play major roles in the combined services market,
but mat well pair off. If Telecom teams up with one of the three MSOs, VCC,
by virtue of size, would seem the most likely candidate; talks are said to
be underway.

But Telecom, with a less-focused expansion strategy than Telefonica's, may
take a while to select its partner. Continental and VCC may decide they can
happily focus on finding a U.S. long-distance carrier to pair with.

VCC could also join forces with Fincable/Cabtel, two independent MSOs
administered as one by broadcaster Telefe (TVI, Jul. 31, 1995). There's
already a precedent: VCC considered buying into the Telefe MSOs a year ago,
but Continental balked at spending further dollars in a slowing economy.
Telefe's systems pepper B.A.'s satellite towns and could complement VCC's
presence.



Of more immediate concern to VCC than telephony is tight competition in
the overbuilt sections of greater Buenos Aires. VCC, Multicanal and
CableVision all overlap in the metropolis, along with several smaller
operators.

As a result, the MSOs are racing to upgrade plant, converting 550 MHz
headends to 750 MHz and installing fiber optic lines "to the node." The 750
MHz set-up allows VCC to increase from 50 to 78 video channels (without
digital compression), plus spare capacity for interactive services and
telephony. Internet connectivity should come on line this year.

Such enterprises require capital. Continental's buy-in was a private
transaction with Liberman, so none of the $150 million funded upgrade. But
with the help of Continental's relationship with U.S. banks, VCC secured a
$140 million syndicated loan from Citibank in November 1995.

VCC expects to secure a further $40 million loan in first quarter 1996,
from U.S. semi-governmental bank OPIC, together with the Export-Import
Bank. The loan will finance the purchase of U.S.-made hardware VCC requires
to continue its upgrade.

Though it's debatable whether continuing to add channels makes sense, the
big MSOs are under pressure to offer equal levels of program choices. As a
result, VCC and Multicanal have been playing catch up with CableVision
(TVI, Oct. 30, 1995), which has offered 65 channels since early 1994.
Pratola says that 100,000 VCC subscribers now get 70 channels - the rest 40
or 50 - and all B.A. subscribers should get the full range by second-half
1996.

During 1995 VCC began to distinguish its lineup by grouping channels by
genre. Hence Music 21, MTV Latino and MuchMusic are found on consecutive
channels.

Like its rivals, VCC has its own programming wing, Gala Producciones,
which generates 14 channels. Four of these are marketed outside the MSO,
earning an extra $22 million last year (nearly twice 1994); more channels
are planned. The company's most popular network is kids service Cablin,
ranked within the top 15 B.A. cable channels.



Like all Argentine MSOs, VCC must address the matter of tiering its
service - 70 channels in a single $33 package doesn't make financial sense.
Tiering, the gateway to pay TV, already exists in some provincial systems
where there is little or no competition. But VCC learned in 1992 not to act
alone in B.A.: when it tried to switch HBO Ole to premium status, requiring
an analog decoder, many subscribers switched to competing systems that
still offered the movie channel as a basic service. VCC abandoned the
experiment.

VCC, CableVision and Multicanal will have to agree to introduce tiering at
the same time. An accord may be struck this year due to two precipitating
factors.

First, soccer monopoly Torneos y Competencias (TyC) introduced a premium
Sunday soccer match for suburban B.A. and provincial subscribers last year.

TyC's premium service is available with the installation of an inexpensive
"trap" - a simple decoder on the outside of a house - rather than an analog
box, but many subscribers opt for the latter, which also decodes erotic
channels (scrambled by law). About 10% of VCC subscribers have these $180
analog decoders.

A second factor is the imminent arrival of DTH services which will offer
up a broad range of near video-on-demand and premium program options not
yet available on Argentine CATV. tv

Regulators seek to please all sides in Africa's new Rainbow Nation

It would be an enormous understatement to say that - like everything else
in the country - South Africa's broadcasting environment is changing. The
sector is being reworked from top to bottom, and market forces are vying
with political pressures for regulation in the national interest.

The forces driving change include the new African National Congress-led
government, business interests representing the white and black
communities, and foreign investors cautiously circling over what could be
the gateway to a resurgent Africa.

But there are several vexing issues to be resolved. At a very basic level,
ad agencies and census takers are scrambling to figure out just how many
newly-enfranchised citizens exist in the townships and cities, and whether
and when they will emerge as bona fide consumers. At the political level,
the monolithic South African Broadcasting Corporation represents a mammoth
regulatory chore; already a dispute is brewing between the SABC and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) over what the new SABC should look
like.

The IBA's recommendations for the SABC go to the heart of the new South
Africa's putative broadcasting infrastructure. In late 1995, the IBA
recommended that SABC's channels be cut to two, licensing the network's
third channel as the country's first national, commercial, terrestrial
network.

The SABC's response was to re-launch all three channels, going directly
against the regulatory grain. The issue still has not been resolved.
Legislation along the lines of some of the IBA's recommendations is
expected in 1996, after a parliamentary committee considers its findings.

The SABC's only national rival is pay service M-Net, owned by a consortium
of South African publishers and banks, with 20% held by international pay
operator NetHold. Thanks to its NetHold affiliation, M-Net is now
spearheading DTH developments in South Africa and the entire continent. The
SABC also announced at end-1995 its plans for a satellite service.

At the beginning of January, the IBA said it would begin licensing
satellite services in the second half of 1996, amid uncertainty about
whether its powers actually extended to this activity. NetHold/MultiChoice
have already launched a digital satellite package on the understanding that
no licensing was required, beaming off PanAmSat 4.

The final sector to be affected by the wholesale changes will be South
Africa's still tiny independent TV production industry, now readying itself
for increased demand from both domestic and new, imported services.



Socio-economic changes

Alongside black economic empowerment, the biggest boost to television
viewing will come as a result of the giant housing and electrification
program. In the townships and shanty towns, the new black consumers are
buying - along with cookers and refrigerators - television sets.

In the still desperately-poor shanty town areas around Johannesburg, 42%
of dwellings have TV sets. Significantly, this is almost identical to the
percentage of dwellings with electricity. The scope for growth is enormous
- nationwide, over half of SA homes are still without electricity.

The number of TV homes is estimated at 4.4 million, and the national TV ad
spend is worth $50-$60 per home. Total ad spend is moving from print and
radio to TV, and from whites to blacks. In 1993, pay service M-Net received
around a quarter of all TV ad expenditure. The SABC's main service, TV1,
took 50%, while its more black-skewed service, CCV, took the remaining 25%.
But according to the SABC, in the year to March 1995, advertising revenues
for CCV grew 25.4%, while those for TV1 (whites) grew by only 14.7%.

The SABC's advertising revenues are around R900 million ($246.9 million)
per year. M-Net gets R300 million, putting total TV ad expenditure at
around $329.2 million. The SABC estimates that new commercial competitors
(in both radio and TV) will take R260-R380 million each year from its
annual revenues.

The SABC is also financed by a license fee, which is collected from 2.4
million TV homes, only 54% of estimated TV homes. This system is bound to
be changed. Innovative ideas, such as a tax on electricity consumption,
have been considered.

The SABC's three TV channels have enjoyed, M-Net aside, a monopoly on
free-to-air terrestrial broadcasting. TV1 has a largely white audience and
CCV (Common Cultural Values) a mainly black audience, while NNTV (National
Network TV) reaches fewer homes, catering to a mainly black viewership. The
two main channels carry nearly all the advertising, while NNTV brings in a
small amount of sponsorship revenues. TV1, CCV and NNTV reach 76%, 72% and
56% of the country respectively.

TV1 broadcasts overwhelmingly in English and Afrikaans, and despite 90%
geographical coverage of the population, only reaches 5.4 million adults.
The TV1 signal is also distributed by Intelsat 604 on a frequency covering
most of Africa, but requires a large, expensive dish. The programming mix
is broad-based, and TV1 operates as a mass-audience generalist service.

The CCV transmitter network covers only 20-25% of the country, but reaches
72.5% of the population. Around 80% of its prime time broadcasts are in
African languages and around 75% of its viewers are black.

NNTV, the newest of the three SABC channels, was launched in 1990 to try
to provide for as many of South Africa's 11 official languages as possible.
English takes up 44% of the airtime, with the remainder in Afrikaans (21%);
the Nguni languages, primarily Zulu and Xhosa (21%); and SeSotho (17%).
NNTV is only received in the major metropolitan areas. It also broadcasts
weekly programs in Portuguese and German for those respective communities.
NNTV carries no advertising, but does have sponsorship income.

In addition to the services operated by the SABC, four other
government-owned broadcasting services were established in the former
homelands. The largest is the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation with
a free-to-air service restricted to the area of the former Bophuthatswana
and the Witwatersrand. Unlike the SABC, the former homeland broadcasters
have been funded directly by the government.



The proposed environment

The IBA's proposals for a new broadcasting infrastructure to represent the
new country - and the developing market economy - cover a lot of ground:
the financial viability of the SABC, competition and the development of an
independent production industry. It has much less to say on satellite
broadcasting, though it is proposing future regulation in this area. Cable
does not feature in the IBA's report.

The key IBA recommendation is that the SABC reduce its channels from three
to two by the end of 1997, though it recognizes the corporation may need
another year to downsize and rationalize.

The IBA suggests that some of the programming on NNTV be absorbed into the
other two channels and that NNTV be repositioned as a satellite service.
The former homeland services will be merged with the SABC's two channels.

In January 1998, the IBA will issue a license for a new private
terrestrial network with heavy public service language and local content
obligations. But there is political and commercial pressure for this date
to be brought forward.

There are already a number of contenders for the new service, including
Southern Media, a consortium that includes the UK's Channel 4, black
development group KTI and others. Its rivals include: Free-to-Air, a group
headed by TV1 head Quentin Green; a joint venture including Moribo
Investments, part of the black empowerment group Thebe, and Interleisure;
and MTV South Africa, including Primedia Broadcasting and musician Johnny
Clegg. Others may join the lists.

The IBA favors a regional third TV network because of the centralized
nature of present broadcasting. It also proposes that the SABC have
regional windows in its schedule. The new SA has nine provinces, of which
Gauteng (around Johannesburg) and the Western Cape are the most
economically advanced and have the most extensive production facilities.

There will also be minimum requirements for specific program categories,
which may include minimum hourly requirements across the schedule and
within prime time. Both the SABC and the new private licensee will have
African language conditions imposed.

Foreign investment in SA television is currently limited to 20%, though
this is essentially theoretical, since M-Net has provided the only
investment vehicle to date. The IBA will maintain this limit and will
introduce cross-media ownership limits. No group or person with control of
a newspaper with more than 15% of circulation in the relevant area may have
financial control (a 15% stake) in a radio or TV license.

The IBA proposals are controversial, not least in the way that the SABC
may be carved up. The network's response has been to announce plans to
relaunch its three channels in 1996 as SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3. It says
English-language broadcasts will constitute 65% of its airtime, with
Afrikaans only taking up 3.8%. SABC 1 will use the current CCV signal and
will broadcast in the Nguni languages in prime time. SABC 2 will replace
TV1 and will broadcast in Afrikaans and SeSotho during prime time. SABC 3
will take the NNTV slot, broadcasting in English during prime time.

The announcement has infuriated Afrikaners; the former ruling National
Party has even threatened to block the SABC's attempt to get a R500 million
grant ($136 million) from the government.

This raises the issue of public broadcasting funding. The IBA is proposing
that these services be funded through a mix of advertising and sponsorship,
license fees, government grants and other income such as merchandising.
This would be reviewed after three years. Parliament should also provide
funding on a triennial basis toward increasing African language and local
content programming on the SABC, says the IBA.

The SABC is now mainly funded through ad revenues. In the 1993/1994
financial year, 74% of its income was from advertising revenues, license
fees made up 20%, and other income contributed 6%. There was no direct
state funding or grant, and the corporation achieved a surplus of R106.2
million and generated a cash flow surplus of R77.8 million for the year.



But new programming regulations could cripple the SABC, and state
subventions for increased African language and local broadcasts are
considered essential. The SBAC has already said it cannot meet these local
content requirements (see column, p.5) and stay within budget. It wants the
IBA to reduce "performance periods" for measuring local content to a
maximum of 10-12 hours from 18 hours.

According to the SABC, providing 30 minutes of local news a day in each of
the nine provinces would cost an extra R153.1 million in 1996/1997, R168.4
million in 1997/1998 and R185.2 million in 1998/1999. Local content
regulations (including the upgrading African language provision) will cost
R70.8 million in 1996/1997, R155.8 million in 1997/1998 and R31 million in
1998/1999.

The cost of implementing another report, this time on educational
broadcasting, is estimated at R160.3 million in 1996/7. From January 1 the
SABC replaced Sky News with BBC Worldwide as its main foreign news
provider, and the deal may be extended to include an education package.
Worldwide last September created a new Worldwide Learning Division.

On the positive side of the balance sheet, the state will benefit from the
integration of former homeland broadcasters, saving approximately R120
million per annum. The SABC's Sentech signal generator, which controls its
network of transmitters, will be converted to a public company, with the
shares transferred from the SABC to the state.



Production

Though the SABC figures are vague, independent production currently
constitutes roughly 12.4% of its total broadcast time. The IBA's proposed
regulations in this area are ambitious to say the least: it wants
broadcasters to ensure that, in the future, 40% of their local content is
commissioned from independent production companies controlled by black
South Africans or women and are based in a range of different provinces and
non-metropolitan areas and represent new talent.

The IBA is also determined to break the old boys' club of white male
producers at the SABC. The Film and Television Federation, the Black
Producers Association and the SABC have now joined forces to jointly
develop new commissioning procedures and terms of trade.



Pay TV

Until 1995, there was only one pay TV player in South Africa. M-Net, has 1
million subscribers and is reckoned to be at saturation level, though it
did add around 100,000 subs in 1995. M-Net takes 27% of TV advertising
revenues and is now looking for opportunities elsewhere in Africa.

In October 1993, M-Net sold its subscriber management services and
technology (ComTech) divisions, as well as its investments outside South
Africa, to a new company, MultiChoice, which manages a package of satellite
channels that includes M-Net, as well as handling M-Net's terrestrial
subscriber management.

M-Net had an "open time" arrangement with the SABC for an unencrypted
period in the early evening, but the initial agreement has expired and is
now under negotiation. By a reciprocal arrangement, also likely to be
renegotiated, the SABC's TV1 has been available to MultiChoice viewers in
Africa, while MultiChoice also rebroadcasts TV1 to Namibia.

With M-Net's terrestrial service now mature and the SABC under pressure to
relinquish terrestrial frequencies, the satellite sector offers the most
action. MultiChoice dominates the market, by virtue of having been the only
player for so long, but the SABC has already leaped in to challenge
MultiChoice's dominant position.

M-Net currently beams its programs off Intelsat VI, as well as
broadcasting terrestrially. Intelsat 704, launched in February 1995, has a
Ku-Band spot beam that includes South Africa, as does the recently launched
PanAmSat 4. The SABC and MultiChoice have both leased transponder capacity
on PAS-4.

From July, the SABC started analog transmissions of its terrestrial
services on Ku-band. In October 1995, the SABC's board endorsed plans to
implement SABC-owned DTH television and radio services. The plan
anticipates the introduction of eight digital pay channels to launch by
July 1996 and 14-16 channels by the end of the year.

The SABC says this distribution mechanism will make the "best
international programming available in South Africa." It is already looking
for international players in a package that will include locally-produced
and multilingual programming as well as more recognizable services.

SABC has also talked of launching one free-to-air analog signal aimed at
rural areas and based on education and development-type programming,
another free analog channel carrying local and international product, and
eventually the digital services, mostly sourced from overseas.

In a carbon copy of the situation in Europe, the SABC is complaining to
the IBA that the incumbent DTH operator, MultiChoice, has a dominant
position because of its control of decoder technology. The SABC would like
the IBA to regulate against what it believes is a restraint on competition.
Local analysts doubt this will happen and see MultiChoice retaining its top
spot.

M-Net/MultiChoice is currently offering South Africans 16 digital TV
channels, three radio channels and 40 music channels commercially via
PAS-4, having launched the service on November 1, 1995. The channels
include Supersport, Movie Magic and children's channel K-TV. Soon there
will also be Hallmark, SelecTV, TNT, ESPN Africa, VH-1, TV5 Afrique, and
religious channel Trinity.

Another group, African Satellite Entertainment Corporation (ASEC), is
currently tranmitting two channels off Intelsat 704, beaming into South
Africa from neighboring Swaziland, and claims to have 35,00 subscribers.
But in December, the Swazi communications ministry threatened to withdraw
its license because of non-payment of fees to Swaziland Post and
Telecommunications Corporation.

Estimates of the potential DTH market vary. Estimated dish sales in 1996
vary between 180,000 and 250,000, with around one-fifth digital. The
equipment supplier Aerial Empire estimates the figure in year one of
satellite DTH will be 100,000 systems sold. The saturation point could be
as low as 300,000 digital subscribers.

Digital dish installation is R4,500 and Multichoice costs R175 a month.
Analog costs R1,500 and a four channel subscription will cost R80 from
ASEC. tv

Program quotas

Local television content
Free-to-air terrestrial television
Broadcasters have overall quotas for local content and also genre-specific
quotas.
The SABC must ensure that, within three years of adopting local content
regulations, 50% of its programming during the South African television
"performance" period (18 hours a day) and at prime time meets the following
quotas for specific program categories:
Drama   20%
Current Affairs 80%
Documentary and informal knowledge building     50%
Educational     60%
Children        50%.

Private terrestrial free-to-air television stations must achieve a local
content quota of 30% within the South African television performance period
and meet the following quotas:
Drama   15%
Current Affairs 70%; Documentary and informal knowledge building
40%; Children    30%.

Non-terrestrial subscription broadcasters: local television content
requirements will be set in the form of an airtime or a financial
obligation.
Terrestrial subscription broadcasters (currently M-Net) should have more
local television content - in each year at least 5% of its programming
should be local; or it should spend a specified sum of money per year on
local product. The broadcaster will have to comply with a 30% air time
obligation during unencoded (open) time.

ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS

Happy New Year to all! When the clock changes, we check our smoke
detectors; when the year changes, we check our BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT
mailing labels! If yours indicates a January expiration date, renew now!
Call, write, e-mail, or fax us with your renewal. We have some great plans
for 1996--you won't want to miss out.

The ALERT staff spent many hours during 1995 redesigning BUSINESS
INFORMATION ALERT. We hope the changes you see will permit easier reading
and access. Besides our new format, you'll notice that Marydee Ojala's
regular two columns are now one: "News and Trends." This change allows her
the flexibility to address those issues of most importance each month. In
addition to our regular articles and columns, we plan to bring you library,
publisher, and vendor profiles. If you work in or know of a library that
functions in an atypical manner, and would like to share your experiences
with our readers, please contact us. If there is a vendor or publisher you
want to know more about, let us know--maybe others are curious.

This month's feature article by Cynthia Shockley came about from a
discussion on the BUSLIB listserv. Cynthia had posted a question asking how
librarians are getting involved in setting Internet policy. For this
article she compiled some of the responses and expanded them into a
practical discussion of how we can organize our involvement in Internet
use, policy, and training. I'm sure you'll use this article--if not now,
then very soon.

Associate Editor

Risk or Reward: Setting Your Organization's Internet Policy
by Cynthia Shockley

Last year Internet use doubled, as it has every year since 1988. At the
same time, use of the Internet's graphical interface, the World Wide Web,
grew almost twenty-fold. No one knows exactly how many people are out there
creating, maintaining, and using Internet sites, but an October 1994
estimate by Internet analyst John Quartermain puts the number at 13.5
million.

One of the leading search sites, Lycos, ran 30 million searches in October
1995. Estimates are that this number will grow to 100 million searches per
month by June 1996. Lycos has cataloged more than 9.3 million Internet site
addresses, called URLs. Given this experience, Lycos began a television
campaign in November 1995 advertising itself as "The Catalog of the
Internet."

Internet content--everything from the text of classical literature to
underground music--is exploding even more spectacularly. Without any
prospect of profit, thousands of individuals have put millions of pages
online--everything from complete libraries of technical information to day-
by-day personal diaries.

How does this dynamic growth impact the library community?

Have you been asked by your organization to develop Internet policies and
procedures? Are you doing the training for your organization? Are you a
Webmaster or on the Webmaster's team?

When such a question was posed on the BUSLIB listserv, some interesting
dialog took place. "You really hit a hot button with that question" replied
a student enrolled in an MLS program. "The one thing that the faculty has
attempted to drill into our heads is that librarians cannot sit and wait
for someone to ask their opinions! We have to get in there and form policy
and procedures or someday we will wake up and our jobs will be gone! The
MIS department (as well as others) will be all too happy to take over if we
don't insist that we be included right from the beginning!"

As Barbara Beverly, Director of Library Services for the New York State
Department of Economic Development, observed "I intend to promote library
access as much as possible since we are being seen as the place to go . . .
however, MIS and other departments don't want to provide much Internet
access because they see it as a big time waster (which it can be). But how
else can people learn?"

How can librarians step into the breach?

How aggressive should librarians be in claiming the Internet as their
domain? The Internet is an information utility and, as such, it is best
understood by us. If we don't participate, others--those less trained in
the art of cataloging, searching, and retrieval who are delving into the
world of electronic resources--will take the job. In that case, librarians
will run the risk of losing more of their organization's info-business
market share (and, eventually their jobs).

=======================================
Step 1: Develop Internet Use Guidelines

Your organization should have an Internet policy and procedures for its use
so that your fellow employees will know what the boundaries are as they use
the Internet. One major U.S. corporation published its Internet use
guidelines on its Web site for its employees. The topics covered are
specific and follow common sense. For example:

* behavior resulting in disciplinary action (e.g., sending threatening
messages);

* behavior considered prudent and good manners (e.g., include a signature
with an e-mail message reply);

* behavior as a participant on listservs and newsgroups (e.g., actively
disclaim that you are speaking for the company and obey copyright laws);
and

* behavior for using file transfer protocols (e.g., don't ftp during prime
business hours).

As noted in the third item, obeying copyright laws is a very critical rule
that should have clear direction from you as a librarian. The library
community is actively working on how the letter and spirit of the copyright
law translate into applications in an electronic, networked environment. We
should be there to guide our organizations in developing their policy
statements with respect to copyright laws. Your fellow employees should
know that their seemingly innocent acts of copying downloaded material are
often serious violations of copyright laws.

You also may want to develop guidelines for patrons using the Internet
while in the library. Glen Whitmill of the New Castle-Henry County Public
Library System posted an e-mail message on a library listserv encouraging
librarians to comment and provide input on his library's "Computer Usage
Policy" draft. (The URL is http://www.nchcpl.lib.in.us/Library/LibraryInfo
/InternetPolicy.html.) This policy covers use by both staff and patrons of
the Internet. Guidelines are straightforward and practical and require that
a patron sign a limitation of liability statement to help protect the
library.

====================================================
Step 2: Volunteer to Train Employees on Internet Use

We librarians are guides to information. The more information there is, the
more your organization needs a guide. As described above, the material that
resides on the Internet is growing at a phenomenal rate.

For example, one librarian responding to the listserv query reported that
"we started out providing access to the Internet in our nonprofit
organization by providing individuals with dial-access accounts . . . later
we installed our headquarters node and made it an item in the library's
budget. Computer Services did not want to do it, so we did. Computer
Services did participate in selecting a provider and oversaw all the work
of installing the hardware and software. We agreed between us that the
library would be responsible for training users."

We are comfortable instructing individuals on how to identify, search, and
access information resources and should continue that role. Another
librarian serving a scientific community observed "one thing was readily
apparent and that was 'Internetting' was not going to be intuitive . . . it
was felt that since the Internet was going to be difficult to navigate, it
would be good if we could do something to smooth the way for our
clientele."

================================================
Step 3: Develop Internet Construction Guidelines

As librarians, you also should participate in developing policy and
standards for the material that is to be posted as part of your
organization's Internet presence. As the number of people engaged in
placing information on the Internet increases, so does the variety of ad
hoc organization, presentation, and style. Typically, MIS staff--often
assigned to take the lead role in preparing an organization's Internet
presence--are not aware of the commitment that the organization is making
by placing electronic documents and information on the corporation's
Internet site. They haven't thought about the value of the information over
time; retention and updating requirements; how to migrate the material to
the coming generation of electronic storage systems; or how to cite and
classify the material to facilitate users in finding it.

Managing information is what we do by trade. Here are some possibilities
for contributing to the development of your organization's Internet
presence:

* Work on document construction guidelines that use hypertext markup
language (HTML) standards.

* Establish required content guidelines for each page: e.g., name of group
responsible for data, number and size of graphics, contact information, and
date last information was revised.

* Establish a process to continually acquire, revise, and update linked
resources on the Internet including how links will be identified,
established, and checked.

* Articulate and publicize the criteria for documents published by the
organization destined only for the Internet so that the material can be
searched as a hypertext linked document since often users no longer read
serially.

* Assist in identifying materials placed on the Internet that have
permanent value and should be considered candidates for organizational
archives.

* Evaluate various search and retrieval engines: e.g., Lycos, WebCrawler,
Yahoo, World Wide Web Worm, InfoSeek Search, and Open Text Web Index.

* Develop compatible cataloging (i.e., field names and record structures),
indexing, and keyword schema to support the selected search engine.

* Determine which parts of the organization's Internet site have data that
is not to be shared with all user communities and therefore should have
limited access.

In sum, if we as librarians are willing to take some risks in stepping up
to our organization's needs, we can help our fellow employees smoothly
accelerate and merge onto the Internet infobahn.

Items on Knight-Ridder, IAC Newswires Codes, Dow Jones Offerings, Lexis-
Nexis Software, M.A.I.D. Web Site, Avenue Technologies Home Page, B & I on
CD-ROM, ISI Current Awareness

by Marydee Ojala

New Year's parties are over; the champagne's all gone; and it's now time to
focus on 1996 as a business year. As you can see, BUSINESS INFORMATION
ALERT has changed its look somewhat. I can tell you that it was quite
exciting to exchange ideas about the new look via e-mail and fax. It was
less time consuming than formal meetings and, in the end, we probably
reached better conclusions about design and content than if we had been
sequestered in a conference room somewhere. We weren't distracted by the
peripheral discussions that always seem to impinge on the main topic--even
in the best run meetings.

For the past several years, I have been writing two columns: one for
database current awareness and one called "For Your Information."
Increasingly, I was finding it more and more difficult to decide what items
to put in which column. The dividing lines between databases, search
services, CD-ROMs, books, consumer hosts, and the Internet were (and are)
becoming more fluid. The simple fact is that business information
specialists must keep up with sources in a wide variety of media. Rather
than waste time trying to categorize and classify current awareness by
database or general knowledge, we threw out the whole idea. As of this
issue, the "News and Trends" column will confront any media, so long as it
is worthy of the attention of business information specialists, AKA you,
our readers.

=========================
Knight-Ridder's New Looks

Following in our footsteps of redesign (well, probably not, but I'd like to
think so), Knight-Ridder Information has consolidated the customer
magazines of Dialog (Chronolog) and DataStar (Knight-Ridder Information
News). The new publication will be called Chronolog, and there will be both
a U.S. and a European edition.

If the first issue is any indication, the U.S. version will be slightly
larger (16 versus 12 pages for the December 1995 issue) due to additional
information and search tips about Dialog databases. Articles are shorter
and more to the point than in the previous Chronolog, but not as brief as
those in the former Knight-Ridder Information News. Hopefully the style
changes will translate into more customers reading the newsletter. Dialog's
Chronolog grew to the point of being almost unreadable. Plus, I found too
many recycled press releases and articles I'd already read in producer
newsletters.

Let's hope Knight-Ridder's new newsletter will truly do what they say it
will: Give us solutions to our information problems and maximize our time.
Serials librarians will be distressed to note that the change occurs with
the last issue of the 1995 volume year, rather than the first issue of the
1996 volume year. For more information, contact Knight-Ridder at 800-334-
2564 or 415-254-8800.

==================================
Information Access Codes Newswires

Well known to business searchers are the Predicasts product codes, most
frequently associated with the PROMT database. One of the big questions
when IAC bought Predicasts was, "Why don't you apply the Predicasts product
codes to your other business files?" Usually what searchers had in mind was
Trade & Industry.

IAC took care of that in early 1994 with some 75 percent of Trade &
Industry records from that time forward being coded with the Predicasts
product codes. Now the Predicasts codes are being added to another IAC
database. This time it's Newswire ASAP. The enhancement comes in
conjunction with a reload on Dialog to take advantage of the standardized
field structure tagging. As part of the reload, Newswire ASAP can now be
accessed from outside North America. For more information, contact
Information Access Company at 800-227-8431 or 415-378-5269.

================================
Dow Jones Expands Text Offerings

Dow Jones News/Retrieval's Text Library has expanded by 67.5 percent. A
great deal of this is due to the addition of IAC databases PROMT, Trade &
Industry, and Industry Express. Interestingly, IAC has relinquished the
database brand names when articles from these three files are added to Dow
Jones.

When you retrieve an article from any of the thousands of sources
represented by the IAC databases, they will be labeled as coming from
Information Access Company, not from an individual database. Other sources
contributing to Dow Jones' growth include the Federal Document Clearing
House (FDCH), which provides complete coverage of developments in the
federal government. That includes news conferences, congressional hearings,
White House meetings, speeches, and briefings.

On the international side--but only searchable in North America--are the FT
McCarthy press clippings. A subsidiary company of the Financial Times
(London), FT McCarthy provides company, industry, and market news clipped
from major European newspapers and business magazines. For more
information, contact Dow Jones News/Retrieval at 609-452-1511.

=========================================
Macintoshed Lexis-Nexis Research Software

An updated version of the Lexis-Nexis research software for the Macintosh
(version 2.9) can be downloaded directly from the Lexis-Nexis Communication
Center on the World Wide Web (http://www.lexis-nexis.com/). Improvements
include a text input window that expands to meet your search strategy
requirements, a scrollable research session history window so you can
repeat a search without re-keying it, improved document formatting, dual
column printing, Internet access, and point-and-click hypertext links to
other related documents.

You need at least a Macintosh computer (68030 or higher), System 7.0 or
higher, 4 MB RAM, one 800K or 1.4 MB disk drive, and a modem. For more
information, contact Lexis-Nexis at 800-227-4908 or michael.galamb@lexis-
nexis.com.

=============================
Profound Chooses the Internet

In one of his typical profound quotes, M.A.I.D plc CEO Dan Wagner, declared
recently: "Online is the Internet and the Internet is online." That was to
preface his announcement that the Profound Business Intelligence Online
Service will use the Internet as its main delivery mechanism.

Essentially, M.A.I.D has transformed its VAX cluster of computers into a
gigantic Web site--rather than use client/server technology--and will use
Netscape as its browser. If the final product is like the prototype, you
will be able to search the various Profound databases, including Textline,
five IAC files, market research reports, company data, and wire services
using M.A.I.D.'s InfoSort indexing.

The Internet service will run in parallel with Corporate Profound,
Profound, and Profound Business Facts on the Microsoft Network. For more
information, contact Profound at 212-750-6900 or connect to the home page
at http://www.profound.com.

==============================
Avenue Technologies on the Net

Company profiles, some 25,000 of them, can be found at Avenue Technologies
Home Page (http://www.avetech. com/avenue/). A subsidiary of DataTimes,
Avenue Technologies compiles company information from a number of different
sources, among them the DataTimes newspapers and numerous other financial
sources. The companies are both publicly and privately held.

This home page is not flashy, and there are customer endorsements--complete
with the customer's photograph--that can easily be skipped by professional
business researchers. If you want to shortcut the research process on
company background, this is one way to go. Reports cost $40 and include
graphs and charts. Delivery is to e-mail boxes. For more information,
contact Avenue Technologies at 415-705-6971 or rick@avetech.com.

==========================
Business & Industry CD-ROM

The new Business & Industry database (File 9 on Dialog, BIDB on DataStar)
will join the Knight-Ridder OnDisc family of CD-ROM databases. As with
other KR OnDisc products, searchers can choose between full-blown Dialog
search software or the simplified Easy Menu approach.

With its emphasis on facts and numeric data, Business & Industry is a good
choice for end user searching by both students and business people. The
annual cost for Business & Industry Database OnDisc is $3,995 for companies
and $2,400 for academic and public libraries. For more information, contact
Responsive Database Services, Inc. at 216-292 9620 or 800-313-2212 or by e-
mail at rdsmail@ix.netcom.com.

============================
ISI Delivers on the Internet

The newest information product for the business world is current awareness.
Funny, since it is far from a new and revolutionary concept. The latest to
join the rush to alerting services is the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI). Delivered over the Internet, ISI's Research Alert Direct
brings its Current Contents and citation index databases into competition
with such other current awareness products as Individual Inc.'s NewsPage.

Bibliographic information from ISI will be delivered directly to
subscribers' e-mailboxes. Full text can be supplied through ISI's The
Genuine Article document delivery service. ISI's new home page can be found
at http:// www.isinet.com. For more information, contact ISI at 800-336-
4474, 215-386-0100, or e-mail to isisales@isinet.com.

COMPANY INFORMATION--
Hoover's Guide to Computer Companies


Lawrence Hagemann & Eric Nee, eds. 1995. The Reference Press, Inc.
Softcover & disk versions. 667p. ISBN: 1-878753-79-7. $34.95

This is a new title in Hoover's stable of excellent and inexpensive
business directories. This particular title was published in conjunction
with Upside Publishing Company, a respected publisher of material on
emerging technology trends and their impact on the computing industry.
Upside editors contributed a brief overview article of the computer
industry and a 12-page list of who's who in the industry that includes
brief biographical information. The list-lover's compendium is expanded and
includes lists of the top companies and retailers from various sources in
addition to the Hoover's list of rankings.

The main sections contain the traditional two-page profiles, including 10
years of financial data (where available) of 77 "industry leaders" and one-
page profiles (with six years of financial data) of another 173 "selected
industry players." Another section includes a bare-bones description of 885
companies, providing only their addresses, top officers, 1994 sales, and
number of employees. There are two indexes, one of companies by
headquarters location and the other by brands, companies, and people. An
extra added attraction is an electronic version of the text on disk using a
Windows program, which will permit you to export data to other programs and
create mailing lists.

In this rapidly changing industry this is a good, inexpensive source for
all types of libraries. Other people interested in the computer industry
will find it an excellent initial source to consult. For the latest
information you will need to consult either specific-industry periodicals
or online databases. Hoover's Guide to Computer Companies is definitely a
recommended acquisition.

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT--
Vitality and Renewal: A Manager's Guide for the 21st Century


Colin Hutchinson. 1995. Praeger Publishers.
344p. Hardcover, ISBN: 0-275-95233-9, $69.50;
softcover, ISBN: 0-275-95234-7, $24.95

Written from a British perspective, but applicable to the U.S., this book
calls on business leaders to take a proactive role in moving us away from
our current wasteful use of resources to a sustainable economy in which
conservation and recycling are the norm. Author Colin Hutchinson quotes Gro
Harlem Brundtland, "Sustainable development . . . meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs," and predicts we have 40 years at most to meet our
environmental challenges.

Hutchinson's nonjudgemental and holistic approach distinguishes this book
from other more polarized environmental calls to action. He provides middle
and upper management with a framework to create environmental solutions. He
also introduces the skills needed to lead a partnership of ecological
organizations, government agencies, and business to a sustainable society.
Recognizing that the ability to bring about changes in organizational
cultures will be fundamental to achieving the goal of a sustainable
economy, Hutchinson predicts change management skills will be the key
business tool for the 21st century.

Practical techniques to bring about and manage change in an organization
are provided. Specific examples are given of corporations that have
assigned priority to ecological concerns and that have made significant
progress in controlling their effect on the environment. For instance, from
1985 to 1991, Dow Chemical cut its air emissions in half in the U.S.

Hutchinson also advocates a redefinition of economic metrics. For example,
our current measures of economic success, such as the Gross National
Product, are correlated with factors such as pollution emissions and linear
consumption of resources. In support of Hutchinson's recommendation, at
about the same time this book was published, the World Bank announced a new
system for calculating a country's net worth by assigning values to its
natural resources, capital investments, and worker productivity. Using this
new scale, Australia and Canada were rated by the World Bank as the globe's
two richest nations. The U.S. came in at 12th place.

Appendixes contain environmental checklists, and a list that identifies
major corporations with formally defended environmental policies. There is
an annotated bibliography to some 100 publications and an extensive roster
of organizations available as resources for further information or data.

Readers may initially question Hutchinson's premise that an individual, or
even a single firm, can realistically make a dent in the complex global
environmental problems facing us today. But the increasing number of
articles in the popular press about participatory management, the growing
empowerment of the individual, and the voluntary downshifting to simpler,
but higher-quality lifestyles supports Hutchinson's thesis.

Hutchinson concludes by challenging business readers to make a difference
in their organizations and communities. By taking charge of environmental
impacts, first on an individual level, then on the corporate, and finally
on the community level, Hutchinson believes business leaders have the
opportunity and the responsibility to move us to a sustainable economy.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY--
Business & Industry


1995. Responsive Database Services, Inc.
Dialog database

Business & Industry(tm) (B&I) looks as if it is another "must" in the
growing list of databases essential for thorough online research. The
October debut of B&I on Dialog and Data-Star has tongues wagging in online
circles.

B&I is produced by Responsive Database Services, Inc. (RDS), a new venture
founded by Dick Harris, formerly president of Predicasts. Early on, RDS
scored big points with its exceptional marketing push to get search
materials out to registered Dialog and Data-Star users several weeks prior
to the generous trial period. This is a wakeup call to producers who can't
seem to get materials out the door.

B&I is not duplicating the efforts of other international business
databases, e.g., Promt or F&S Index. A comparison of B&I's source
publication list to Fulltext Sources Online and Books & Periodicals Online
confirms that a majority of the publications available on B&I are also
available elsewhere but not necessarily from Knight-Ridder. Such
publications as Wirtschaftswoche, once available only through Genois, will
now reach a wider audience. B&I has limited date coverage beginning in July
1994 and plans to update daily. B&I editors exclude stories from wire
services, market research, and analyst's reports. Searchers who have waded
through similar data in Promt will applaud this decision since separate
searches are often required in unique databases.

Although the manual claims B&I's index system is "user-friendly, . . . easy
to remember and easy to apply," don't toss the documentation just yet.
B&I's indexing system consists of concept and marketing terms, product and
geographic codes, industry and company names, and document types.
Additional indexes include trade names, spokespersons, and slogans.

Here are two important points for experienced searchers: PC codes are
automatically truncated, and the concept term for market share (ct=market
share) may be a popular change from such keystroke gyrations as
market?(5n)share?. The marketing terms are especially welcome and reflect
the best of Marketing and Advertising Reference Service (MARS). The Dialog
search examples provided in the documentation are straight forward, and
standard display formats apply. Format 8 gives title, word count, and
indexing. Format 8 also indicates if an article is available in full-text.
(Searchers may also limit the search to this format by entering /FULLTEXT.)
Unfortunately, the enhanced title feature B&I has touted is not available
with a format 8, KWIC, or title display. RDS has made sure it gets a few
cents for this great feature.

Finally, a remark about the "indicative statement" that RDS provides at the
end of abstract records. If the statement begins "article contains little
further information. . . ": beware! That precious "little" may be the
missing information you've spent time and money to find.

Washington, D.C.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY--
Internet Connection: Your Guide to Government Resources


Jeff Steinman, ed. 1995. Bernan Press.
Newsletter, 10 issues. $69

Since the early 1990s, government agencies and departments have been
exponentially increasing electronic publication of government documents and
records. Accessing these databases is sometimes only slightly less daunting
than finding those databases on the Internet. Good Web browsers, gopher
indexes, and other electronic Internet site locators are increasingly
available for those savvy information providers who regularly navigate the
Net. The Internet Connection: Your Guide to Government Resources is a print
resource intended to keep you informed about government sites on the Net.
It does just that.

This newsletter is not intended to teach readers about the Internet.
Consequently, a lot of space is not wasted defining terms. It is especially
useful for corporate information professionals or sophisticated academic
librarians who assist users in research or are responsible for their
institution's Web Site. Its drawback is that when you find a good
government reference, you cannot just electronically "forward" the
information to someone else.

On average, five government resources are brought to your attention per
issue. An example of one resource is the editor's article, "Tax Forms for
FedWorld." In this article (typical of what you will find), the Internet
address is provided. Step-by-step instructions for logging on and
maneuvering through FedWorld to get to the subject of the report are
provided. Helpful hints and good explanations for downloading the tax forms
are used. In this article little explanation is required for what a tax
form is but other articles do explain the scope of the government resource.

What I liked most about the newsletter was its back-page diagram outlining
government resources at a glance. The diagram summarizes what has been in
the previous seven pages and is a precursor to an annual index. Other
serials taking this same approach include Internet World, which places
resources by subject on its back page. Information professionals should
find a use for those back pages because when the amount of space required
for the at-a-glance summary, the table of contents, and white space is
deducted, there is little more than five pages of new and usable
information.

Bernan Press is a reputable government book wholesaler, and its reputation
lends credence to this guide. What I found most helpful informationally,
were the opinions and valuative comments about the particular government
resources it is guiding you to. Information about the quality of access,
currency, maneuverability, and scope are the valuing tools information
professionals need to know before recommending. Those professional
guideposts would be worth the subscription.

Internet Tools of the Profession: A Guide for Special Librarians


Hope Tillman, ed. 1995. Special Libraries Association.
Softcover. 250p. ISBN: 0-87111-430-5. $37.50

This reference book is a combination dictionary/teaching tool on
researching on the Internet. It is also a guide to sample locations of
information, arranged in some cases by subject and in others by unique
Special Libraries Association (SLA) interests. As it is an in-house
publication intended for SLA members, part of its layout follows the
division/geographic organization of SLA. Internet resources therefore are
divided into the 28 SLA subject divisions. Seven, including business and
finance, chemistry, education, food/agriculture/nutrition, information
technology/networking, nuclear science, and pharmaceutical provide
evaluative resource lists. The other divisions have a hit-or-miss list
without evaluations. The editor tells us that this is because many
divisions were not able or willing to participate. Therefore, the list of
subjects is not in itself a ranking of importance as an arbitrary and
random self-selection.

Authors of the evaluative lists follow the same editorial outline,
including detailing the purpose and value of that particular title. The
selection criteria for putting a title on the lists is, however, solely the
author's. For example the 19 resources cited under Information
Technology/Networking were selected because they may be used for keeping
current and are helpful for librarians who train others in accessing the
Internet. On the other hand, the 19 resources selected under Education were
chosen for their representation of the diverse interests of the division's
membership. Food/Agriculture and Nutrition titles were selected because of
their proven usefulness in that type of library.

The publication's value to information professionals lies less in the small
highly selective subject lists, than in the evaluative information provided
with some references. When used in conjunction with the index, the lists
may prove helpful. Its other great value to the SLA member is the 34
addresses where SLA discussion groups can be found. Enough information is
provided to be able to either find a forum or subscribe to the lists. The
editor is correct that there is a need for updates to these lists. Sample
screens were found helpful.

This publication is not a must for libraries. Comprehensive subject guides
exist in print and on the Net. It is however a helpful resource for the
personal professional growth of information professionals. It will
certainly aid new SLA members who join a division and wonders what core
Internet resources are peer-recommended.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS--
Doing Business in the New Vietnam


Christopher Engholm. 1995. Prentice Hall Publishers, Inc.
Hardcover. 256p. ISBN: 0-13-325853-X. $24.95

This reference book contains guide information about doing business in
Vietnam today. The comprehensive volume accommodates information about
Vietnam on a range of business topics including country profile, selling
to, investing in, and working with the Vietnamese. Additionally, it affords
up-to-date information including useful business addresses, trade contacts,
sample contractual agreements, and visitor information.

Many informed business leaders and scholars see Vietnam as the hottest new
business frontier in the Pacific Rim. In spite of its stigma as a
"communist country," Vietnam is experiencing booming growth with negligible
inflation, a standardized currency, low labor rates, and a population of
70-plus million with a work-hard philosophical background. Today, with
recent (and continuing) government and market reforms, business and
commerce in Vietnam operates as a near "free market economy" system. All
this rapid economic expansion offers opportunities for exporters,
investors, entrepreneurs, and business executives.

To write this book, Engholm draws on his experience, which includes
founding The Engholm Group--which specializes in public relations and
company representation in Asia and Latin America--international business
consulting, presenting seminars, and writing this book. In this practical
guidebook, he provides dozens of useful tips and effective strategies for
developing profitable relationships with Vietnamese businesses and the
Vietnamese people. Engholm's previous books are Doing Business in Asia's
Booming "China Triangle" (1994) and When Business East Meets Business West:
A Guide to Practice and Protocol in the Pacific Rim, the Asia and Japan
Business Information Sourcebook (1991).

The book opens with a preface, short introduction, and brief glossary of
key terms and acronyms. Its four parts contain four chapters each. Part 1
contributes a profile of the people, the economy, the politics, and the
business scene. Demographic and economic facts, the official government
structure, a chronology of Vietnam-U.S. relations, and the climate for
business are analyzed. Historical background, the Chinese influence, and
the Vietnamese people and their work ethic also are addressed.

Part 2, "Selling to Vietnam," confronts the primary marketing topics.
Chapter 5, "What Vietnam Wants to Buy," points out many facts that go
beyond what standard summary statistics would indicate. Even though Vietnam
is statistically one of the poorest countries in the world with a GNP per
capita of only $200, disposable income by consumers varies greatly. Among
the 72 percent of the populations still working in agriculture, many cannot
even afford a bicycle and earn barely $50 per year. On the other hand,
about 49 percent of the urban households have at least one motorcycle (with
new Hondas selling for $1,700). Details about entering the market
(import/export regulations, setting up a sales representative's office,
rent, registration, and bank accounts); channels of distribution
(wholesaling, retailing, channels, shipping, customs/clearance, and
warehousing); and advertising and promotion (trade shows, billboards,
regulation, cost/rates,) are presented.

"Investing in Vietnam" is the topic of Part 3. Issues such as why and with
whom to invest, types of foreign venture allowed, foreign investment
regulation, favorable regions (provinces) for investment, regulations and
license requirements, finding local investment partners, the rapidly
emerging private sector, project approval and start-up, working with
Vietnamese labor, finding skilled workers and recruiting managers,
unionization and strikes, and wage administration are discussed. Chapter 11
looks at the in's and out's of "Transferring Technology" and presents
Vietnam's attitude toward Western technology. The part's final chapter
deals with financing, taxes, and commercial disputes. The banking sector
and capital markets also are explained.

The fourth and final part, "Working with the Vietnamese," centers on
business culture (differences with other Asian countries, trust-based
relationships, gifts and bribes, and managing and motivating workers);
communicating and negotiating (use of an interpreter, meeting approaches
and tactics); essential etiquette and protocol (business cards, names
usage, dining and drinking, gifts, holidays, and "lucky and unlucky" days);
traveling (hotels, air/road/train, health and safety risks, money matters,
working hours, entertainment and shopping, recreation, what to bring); and
living in Vietnam (paperwork required, renting a house, community support,
and life quality). The work's appendixes provide useful business and trade
contacts with addresses and phone numbers, sample contractual agreements,
and visitor information (addresses and phone numbers of airlines, hotels,
museums, restaurants, and nightclubs/discotheques).

This well-written guide equips readers with an array of good advice. For
example, knowing how to avoid costly mistakes when dealing with the
government and how to conduct yourself through the intricacies of
socializing could make the difference between success and failure in a
business venture. One of the strengths of this book versus other recent
books on the same topic (Doing Business in Vietnam, 1995 by James W.
Robinson; Vietnam: Business Opportunities and Risks, 1995 by Joseph P.
Quinian; Vietnam: A Business Handbook, 1994 by Neil Ashwood) is that it
covers the topics by asking and answering practical yet probing questions
such as, "What is the Vietnamese attitude toward American business and vice
versa?" and "Should a firm begin promotion of its products and services at
a trade show in Vietnam?". Additionally, the book is enhanced with about 25
pages of photographs and numerous graphs, tables, and charts to add to and
clarify the volume's content.

Doing Business in the New Vietnam is recommended for practicing managers,
consultants, government officials, academics and advanced students, and
others interested in pursing import/export trade, investment, or additional
commerce-driven interaction with the economically-emerging new Vietnam.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS--
JADE: Japanese Accounts and Data on Enterprise


1994. Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing Inc.
CD-ROM database. $12,000

This intriguing product will be useful to anyone working with the Japanese
market. Teikoku Databank has long been know as a leading supplier of
corporate credit information from Japan. Its two English language online
databases--one of profile data and one of full financials--have made it
much easier for researchers to find information on Japanese companies.

JADE takes the information from the Teikoku Full Financial database, adds
several useful data items, and tops it with a powerful package of financial
analysis software. The database covers some 10,000 Japanese companies,
providing a full range of profile information (name, address, telephone,
year of incorporation, number of employees, credit rating, trading banks,
CEO background, to name a few); financial data (balance sheet and profit &
loss account in a standardized format); and 22 ratios calculated from the
balance sheet. A welcome addition to Teikoku Databank's standard
information is U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), UK SIC, and
NACE codes. These do not translate perfectly to Teikoku Databank's own
Industrial Classification, but Western searchers will find them much more
familiar.

Searching is straight-forward and fast. In addition to the profile
information, it is possible to search by the 22 ratios, 12 financials, or
the year-on-year trends of those financials. Once a company or companies
are found, there is a wide variety of reports that can be produced,
including those in user-defined formats. The financial analysis software
allows users to get a detailed analysis of an individual company's
finances. In addition, it permits analysis of a group of companies, or of
one company relative to its peer group. The results of the analysis can be
in report format or a selection of effective graphic formats. It is also
possible to download data for use in other software packages. Several
custom export formats such as dBase, Lotus, Excel, are included, as is
ASCII and DIF.

In general, the interface is very clean and easy to use. As a sample
application, it was quite simple to select manufacturers of cameras,
identify the most profitable firm in terms of Return on Investment, display
its cost structure, and compare several of its performance ratios to the
industry norm over time.

The one caveat has to do with the nature of Japanese financial reports.
Financial reporting standards in Japan are significantly more lax than
those in the U.S. Also, there are several differences in practice, such as
reporting stocks at book value, that can lead to different results than
would be expected under Western standards. All this should be kept in mind
when interpreting one's findings.

The database is updated quarterly. It is available for DOS and Windows and
can be included on local and wide area networks.

Washington, D.C.

REFERENCE--
The Directory of Business Information Resources


Ed note: Although this publication is a third edition, we included it due
to its relevance.

3d ed. 1995. Grey House Publishing.
Softcover. 1,197p. ISBN: 0-939300-60-5. $155

This third edition of The Directory of Business Information Resources is a
hefty softcover with 1,197 pages of information on 90 different industry
groups, form accounting to wholesalers. When evaluating this book, one's
immediate reaction is to compare it to its venerable predecessor, Gale's
Encyclopedia of Business Sources (EBIS), now in its 10th edition in two
hardcover volumes. The younger directory comes off fairly well in
comparison, though it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Here's
why.

According to the numbered entries, The Directory of Business Information
Resources contains 13,489 brief paragraphs that describe the associations,
newsletters, magazines, trade shows, directories, and databases in each
industry. Each entry is listed only once, unlike EBIS where the same
information can be listed numerous times under different categories. The
Directory is much more straightforward in its arrangement, which makes it
easier to use but also much less sophisticated for subject searching. For
example, in EBIS, the accounting section contains numerous "see references"
and divides the industry into subgroups such as cost accounting, government
accounting, and accounting research. This means the reader has to guess
which section to look under and also creates entry duplication. The
Directory, on the other hand, has a 14-page section on accounting with no
"see references" and all entries placed together according to type. It is
one-stop shopping at its best.

Typical directory entries contain brief, basic information: name, address,
phone, and fax number, one contact person, and either a description that
can be as brief as one line or no description at all. There are no
electronic addresses, and information such as association membership
numbers or publication print schedule is often missing. This fact makes for
very uneven value among entries.

EBIS tends to treat the "whole industry" as it were, with sections that
include statistics sources, financial ratios, and price sources in addition
to the basic section echoed in The Directory. EBIS also treats the business
world in general in much more detail, by including discrete sections on
such topics as employee motivation, acid rain, and AIDS policy.

The Directory of Business Information Resources has some curious omissions.
For example, the Computers & Data Processing Industry section makes no
mention of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) nor the Institute
for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), two of the largest
organizations in the field. Nor does it include such widely circulated
publications as Infoworld, PC Magazine, or PC Week, though it does have
Computerworld, PC Computing, and BYTE. These important omissions in an
industry with which I am familiar lead me to suspect there may be similar
ones in other industries. Some of the more obscure entries for this
industry, such as NEWMEDIA and Proclaimer, listed in the "Magazines &
Journals" section, contain no descriptive information and therefore are of
very limited utility.

Another glaring omission is in the health care of medical industry, which
is of great current importance, but is all but ignored except for the
mention of a few publications scattered throughout the book. However, this
industry is very well treated in EBIS. Yet The Directory includes such
eclectic groups as the "gifts" industry and the "motorcycles" industry.

One definite plus for The Directory is its entry index, sorely lacking in
EBIS. The Directory's other index is a publisher index. Since reference
works of this type are generally used to find information on a topic
unknown to the researcher, a subject index also would be helpful to
indicate to users the editorial decisions on entry placement. Also, The
Directory does seem to have a great many small, regional organizations and
publications.

If it is important for your library to have the most comprehensive
collection of this type of information in print, then this volume is a
necessary addition to your collection. If you have a limited budget and can
only purchase one title, I'd have to stick with the Gale publication.

IDG COMMUNCIATIONS TO ENTER ROMANIAN MARKET

International Data Group (Boston, MA) has established the
first computer publication in Romania. The company said
that "InfoClub" magazine will be published six times a year
and will have an initial circulation of 60,000. IDG said
that it will publish the magazine in association with
Stiinta si Technica Publishing Company (Bucharest), the
largest technical publishing company in Romania.

IDG chairman patrick McGovern, who recently returned from
Romania after negotiating with Stiinta si Technica, said
that Romanians spent over $105 million in 1990 to acquire
computer hardware, software and services and that "in 1991,
we expect the (Romanian) market to increase 35% to over
$140 million." He said that the "vast majority of this
amount will be for imported equipment, providing an
attractive market for the world computer industry."

"InfoClub" chief editor Ioan Albescu said that Romania had
about 60,000 computers presently installed and that he
expected that amount to increase substantially. He said
that the country needs both computers and communications
technology to provide for its economic development under
the new economic and political systems.

According to Albescu, half of the editorial content of the
start-up will be devoted to IBM-compatible personal
computers, with the remainder covering the technology and
applications of other computer companies. Because it will
be the only computer publication in the country, he said
that editorial dealing with mainframes and minicomputers
will also be included.

IDG also publishes computer magazines in Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

designed to "fill the increasing need for in-depth analysis
of the worldwide regulatory, legal and technical
developments affecting" the pharmaceutical industry. It is

together seemingly unconnected developments affecting the
pharmaceutical industry worldwide."

A/S/M COMMUNICATIONS TO LAUNCH "MEDIA WEEK" ON JANUARY 14

A/S/M Communications (New York) will begin the publication
of "Media Week" magazine with an issue on Jan. 14. In
OCTOBEr, A/S/M, a subsidiary of Billboard Publications Inc.
(New York), acquired the monthly "Marketing & Media
Decisions" from Act III Publishing (New York) and decided
to change title and frequency.

A/S/M said that the new weekly will cover media news and
trends. A/S/M chairman John Thomas, Jr. said that "we will
now publish three different weeklies ("Adweek," "Adweek's
Marketing Week" and "Media Week"), each one tailored for
its audience." He said that the three publications give
readers the magazines they need. "We'll be offering
advertisers the best general coverage among agencies and
clients, plus highly targeted coverage at the media
departments of every top agency."

Newly appointed publisher Lawrence Oliver said that "never
before have people had to keep up with so many aspects of
the media business as they do today." The new launch "will
be able to keep on top of the latest developments. The news
value of the publication is going to hinge on timeliness.
The big change in the marketplace today is the number of
alternative types of media that can be bought. It's a lot
to keep up on."

Oliver said that the publication will be targeted to media
executives at all levels at ad agencies.

A/S/M became a subsidiary of BPI Communications in July of
this year. BPI also publishes a number of media properties,
including "Billboard," "Back Stage" and "American Film"
magazines.

GRO COM GROUP TO LAUNCH "DELI-BAKE ADVOCATE" IN JUNE

Gro Com Group (Clearwater, FL) will begin the publication
of "Deli-Bake Advocate" with an issue in June. The new
magazine will be published six times a year and will have
an initial controlled circulation of 15,000. The first
issue will debut at the International Dairy-Deli
Association in Anaheim (CA).

According to co-publisher Mark Weeks, the publication will
link buyers and sellers "in an effective and affordable
manner." He said that the magazine will serve as an
important forum for companies who are "serious about
profiting from the rapidly growing deli-bake industry."

The company said the publication will be targeted as an
informational and marketing tool to deli-bake managers,
distributors and brokers. Weeks said that the circulation
list has been drawn from such sources as the International
Dairy-Deli Association, the Retail Bakers of
America/International Deli-Bake Association and verified
and qualified yellow page directories.

Weeks said he hoped that circulation will grow each year to
accomodate the demands of the industry. He said the
circulation is ultimately expected to reach between 30,000
and 40,000.

Editorial for the publication will cover ideas for
merchandising and promotion, industry trends, category
updates from industry experts, legal issues involved in
importing and exporting meats and cheeses, safety,
strategies and new products.

The company had originally planned to launch the
publication in January. The delay till June is due to
"advertising softness," Weeks said. Gro Com also publishes
"Food Distribution Magazine."

a year, a subscription delivered by facsimile machine costs
$295. The letter is sent every Monday morning to

complaints of users were documented without appearing to be
engaged in "vendor bashing." The purpose of the publication
is to correct mistakes and to show what is successful, the
company said.

GRALLA PUBLICATIONS LAUNCHES "CORPORATE TRAVEL'S STRATEGIC
MEETINGS"

Gralla Publications (New York), a subsidiary of United
Newspapers (London), has begun the publication of

"Strategic Meetings" as a supplement to the company's
"Corporate Travel" magazine.

"Corporate Travel" is a monthly with a controlled
circulation of 46,000. Gralla said that the new supplement
will fill the gap between the meeting planning and
management training markets. The company said that
editorial for the publication focuses on the results of
corporate meetings and how those results could have been
different. Gralla said that special attention is being paid
to elements of group interaction within the meetings. The
publication will have "more of a management focus" than
other publications in the field, Gralla said.

The publication is being targeted to ceo's, presidents,
vice presidents and other corporate executives involved in
the meetings process. The publication will analyze factors
involved in a "good" meeting, including objectives, advance
preparation, agendas and results. Saying that most meetings
magazines talk about the logistics of meetings, Gralla said
that the new supplement will present information that
non-meeting executives can understand and act on.

Gralla said that it hoped to spin-off the publication
within the next year.

The supplement continues Gralla's recent expansion
activities. In April of this year, the company began the
publication of "V.I.P." magazine. In May, Gralla purchased
"Action Sports Retailer," "Outdoor Retailer" and two trade
shows from Pacifica Publishing. In August, the company
acquired "Wall Street Computer Review," "Insurance Software
Review," "Computer's in Banking" and "Communications in
Finance" from Investment Dealers' Digest. Also, Gralla will
begin the publication of "Gifts & Stationary Business" in
March 1991 and Sports Vision in January.

EDGELL FINDS BUYERS FOR SIX OF SEVEN PUBLICATIONS

Edgell Communications (Cleveland, OH) has found buyers for
six of the seven publications that it had put up for sale
in October. Because most of the deals have not yet been
closed, Edgell would identify only one of those buyers. In
addition, the company said that it was ceasing publication
of "Housewares" magazine after its December 15 issue.

The seven publications put up for sale include "Aqua,"
"Bicycle Dealer Showcase," "Petroleum Engineer
International," "Pipeline & Gas Journal," "World
Cogeneration," "Corporate Meetings & Incentives" and
"Communciations News."

Edgell spokesperson Mary Abood said that the company had
found buyers for all of the publications except "World
Cogeneration." She said that because most of deals would
not be finalized until after the new year, she could only
identify one buyer. Abood said The Laux Company (Maynard,
MA) had reached an agreement in principle to acquire
"Corporate Meetings & Incentives." Terms of the deal were
not revealed, but "TBP" estimates that the sale price was
about $1.7 million.

The Laux Company president Dean Laux said the purchase
allows "us to offer the largest circulation in existence
among meetings and travel executives. We see (the magazine)
becoming the flagship of our...group of publications for
the meetings and travel industry." The Laux Company also

publishes "Medical Meetings," "Insurance Conference
Planner," "Association Meetings" and "Religious Conference
Manager." "Corporate Meetings & Incentives" had estimated
1989 advertising revenues of $2 million, an increase of 5%
over the $1.9 million recorded in 1988.

Laux said that he plans no changes in staffing or location
(New York) for the magazine. The monthly has a controlled
circulation of 40,000.

"Housewares" was published 22 times a year and was targeted
to housewares merchandise managers, buyers and chain store
management personnel. Most of the editorial covered
merchandising ideas and retail strategies. It had a
controlled circulation of 13,000.

K-III CONFIRMS REPORTS OF INTEREST IN FIELD PUBLICATIONS

K-III Holdings (New York) has confirmed that it is in
negotiations for the acquisition of Field Publications
(Chicago, IL).

The proposed sale includes Field's book clubs, "Weekly
Reader" and other classroom periodicals and its Funk &
Wagnalls reference book unit. The "Weekly Reader" has a
circulation of about 10 million. The companies involved had
combined sales of about $300 million last year. It is
estimated that the purchase price will be around $250
million.

A major part of Field's business comes from licensing deals
with Walt Disney Co. However, Disney has announced that it
will soon organize its own children's book publishing
operation as soon as the current licensing Field has
terminated.

K-III currently owns some specialty book clubs and business
and professional magazines. The company acquired Reader's
Garden, Inc. last August. It added that property to its
Newbridge Communications division and made known its desire
for further acquisitions.

ACT III PUBLISHING CEASES PUBLICATION OF "CHANNELS"
MAGAZINE

Act III Publishing (New York), a subsidiary of Act III
Communications (Los Angeles), has ceased the publication of
"Channels" magazine. The company said that a suitable buyer
for the magazine could not be found.

The publication had a mostly-controlled circulation of
26,000. In an attempt to increase circulation earlier this
year, frequency for the publication was increased from 12
times to 24 times a year.

Taglined "the business of communication," the 10-year-old
magazine was targeted to television professionals as well
as lawyers, financial experts and advertisers. Editorial
provided business coverage of the electronic media,
television, cable, syndication and finance, in addition to
analyses, news of industry trends and profiles.

For the first six months of 1990, "Channels" had estimated
advertising revenues of $1.4 million, an increase of about
40% over the $1 million recorded during the first six
months of 1989. Estimated advertising pages for the period
increased 16%, going from 259 pages in 1989 to 301 pages
for 1990.

The magazine was purchased by C.C. Publishing, Act III's
percursor, in 1985 from Media Commentary Council (New
York). At that time it was a non-profit publication.

The demise of Channels continues Act III's decision to
divest itself of its business and professional magazine
properties. In September of this year, Act III ceased the
publication of both "BME's Television Engineering" and
"Corporate Video Decisions" and sold their circulation
lists to PSN Publications (New York). In October, the
company sold "Marketing & Media Decisions" to BPI
Communications (New York) and also ceased publication of
the six-month-old "The Marketer."

Act III also publishes "Mix" and "Electronic Musician"
magazines as well as "Biz News" newsletter.

WEST PUBLISHING INSTITUTES DIRECT ACCESS TO DIALOG
DATABASES

West Publishing Co. (St. Paul, MN) said that, beginning in
early 1991, a new interface will enable Westlaw legal
information service subscribers to access Dialog (Palo
Alto, CA) databases via the Westlaw directory and using
Westlaw commands. Dialog is a unit of Knight-Ridder.

The new arrangemenet supercedes, but does not replace, a
gateway previously established between the two companies
that required users to enter and use Dialog commands. The
new arrangement will provide Westlaw subscribers access to
140 Dialog databases, about one-third of Dialog's total.
The companies said that additional Dialog databases will be
added every month until all 380 are available, probably be
the end of 1991.

West president Dwight Opperman said that the dealw as
important because "law firms, coroporate legal departments,
and other users of computer- assisted legal research have
found it increasingly important to access news, business,
technical, and other information in addition to traditional
legal research." Access to Dialog "will enable legal
professionals to increase their efficiency."

The new gateway works only one way. Subscribers to Dialog
will not be able to access West databases. The companies
said that if a need for a two-way gateway is identified,
they will consider its implementation.

THE SCIENCE OF ALLIANCE

Nowhere are partnerships more important in the broadcasting industry
than in Asia. And within Asia no market is considered to be hotter
property for cable and satellite right now than India and the
Subcontinent.

A population of 900 million that supports a middle class of 250
million, coupled with 14,000 cabled homes and rising, are figures not
to be sniffed at by western broadcasters looking to extend their brands
into the Far East.

But in a pioneer market, no amount of high production values or honed
channel images and marketing campaigns will ensure that signals reach
cable operators, that cable operators relay them to households and
that, in the case of the pay-TV channels at least, subscription
revenues find their way back into the right pockets. India is no
exception.

Although of all the channels targeting that region, ESPN and Disney
have arguably the sort of programming that will pretty much translate
anywhere, their respective alliances with the Modi Group is a smart
one. A diversified conglomerate, Modi's foray into entertainment -
although still fledgling - is comprehensive. Offering its partners
everything from production possibilities, distribution networks,
subscriber management and revenue collection, Modi is a one-stop shop
and a grass-roots partnership. In return, the Indian company can expect
to receive the Western broadcasting know-how it presently lacks. But
with a collective turnover of $2 billion plus a year, knowledge is all
the Modis are likely to require and that may only be in the short term.
Its high-profile alliance with Disney may also put it out of reach of
others: zealously protective of its brand, Disney is likely to be
precious as to who else it allows to join its Indian stable.

The Modi-Disney-ESPN hook up is only one of several big Asian deals
that have been cemented over recent months. Partnerships and global
alliances are increasingly become the way forward in Asia. But
remaining available opportunities will, and are narrowing.

SIX MONTH INVESTIGATION INTO FAILURE OF APSTAR 2

China Great Wall Industry Corp. and Hughes Space and Communications
have concluded their six month investigation into the failure of Apstar
2, which exploded in January,  seconds after take off via a Long March
rocket. The failure has been put down to wind shear which damaged
either the satellite or the rocket. As yet there is no set date for the
launch of Asiasat 2, which is also set to go up via a Long March rocket
before the end of the year.

NBC ASIA AND NBC SUPER CHANNEL ASIA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

Both NBC Asia and NBC Super Channel Asia are to be distributed in
Indonesia as part of Star TV's multi channel pay-TV package designed
specifically for the Indonesian market. Broadcasting off Asiasat 2, the
service will be available in early 1996 and will be distributed by the
Indovision Group, the only company licensed to collect pay-TV revenue
in the archipelago. The U.S. network has also announced distribution in
two other countries. Following an agreement signed with distributor
Cable Boss, NBC Asia will be available to cable TV subscribers in the
Philippines. While in Taiwan, the news and current affairs channel will
work together with Liann Yee Production Co who will not only handle the
distribution for NBC Asia but will also work to adapt some of its
programming specifically for the Taiwan market. The agreement in Taiwan
also applies to NBC Super Channel Asia when it launches, probably in
early 1996.

KOREASAT 1 LAUNCHED

South Korea's first domestic satellite, Koreasat 1, launched in August
from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on board a
McDonnell Douglas Delta 2 rocket. However, a low performance by the
rocket in its first stage left the satellite in a lower than desired
orbit. Koreasat 1 which was supposed to have been placed into an oval
orbit with a high point 22,200 miles above the earth, missed its mark
by about 3,800 miles. According to McDonnell Douglas, the satellite
will be able to use its onboard thrusters to correct the altitude
deficit, but will have to sacrifice some of its expected 10 year life.
The satellite's 12 KU-band transponders had been earmarked for the
delivery of direct broadcasting, fixed telecommunications and
electronic data throughout the Korean Peninsula.

PAY-TV LICENSING CHANGES

Thai broadcasting authority the Public Relations Department (PRD) is
expected to make changes to its system for pay-TV licensing. Currently
the PRD simply charges Baht 25,000 ($1,000) for a licence, however
director general Arun Ngamdee admitted the rules need to be adjusted.
It is possible they will be changed to mirror the Mass Communication
Organisation of Thailand (MCOT)'s licensing policy. MCOT, the only
other Thai body authorised to give out pay-TV licences, takes an equity
stake in each incumbent.

IBC PAY NETWORKS

After conceding a 36% stake to Grammy Entertainment and BBTV
Satelvision (the operator of leading terrestrial broadcaster Channel

intend to launch their own pay networks but say IBC will take
precedence, at least initially.

Bangkok Entertainment Co., operator of terrestrial broadcaster Channel
Three, expects to begin broadcasting its pay-TV channel in early 1996.

Sony Pictures Entertainment, in conjunction with Singapore-based
production company Argos Communications Enterprises (ACE), is to launch
a 24-hour Hindi-language satellite service primarily targeting India in
the fourth quarter of this year. Broadcasting via a C-band transponder
off Pas-4, the new channel will be called Sony Entertainment Television

to date is accessed by 14 million of the country's 45 million TV homes.
The service will be advertiser supported with revenues expected to come
from both local and international companies. $70 million has been
allocated for original Hindi production over the next five years.

PASSAGE TO INDIA

The Modi Group dominates India's broadcasting industry. Anil Wanvari
profiles the diversified company, which, through a combination of
market-savvy and strategic alliances, has left its competitors standing

It all started as a twinkle in a little boy's eye. Lalit Modi, a scion
of the multi-billion dollar Indian Modi group, was bowled over by the
delights of Disney comics and movies. As he grew into college and went
to the U.S. to study management, the twinkle turned into admiration for
the company responsible for pioneering the animated feature film. Then
admiration turned to ambition, he too would set up an entertainment
empire... in India.

Today Lalit Modi, 32, is well on the way to achieving that ambition. As
president and managing director of the Modi Entertainment Group (MEG),
he is piecing together an outfit that may well become the most
integrated entertainment business in India and has made several matches
with global entertainment leaders, including Disney, ESPN, U.S producer-
distributors New World Entertainment and Multimedia Entertainment, and
theatrical conglomerate United Artists, to distribute and market their
product in Asia's most dynamic broadcasting market. Other high-calibre
deals incorporating programme production, channel distribution and even
publishing are sitting on the table.

Being part of a large Marwari - a community known for its financial
acumen and entrepreneuralism - probably made things easier for Modi as
he didn't have to scout around for start-up capital.

Started by his grandfather, Gujar Mal Modi in 1933, the Modi group is
today involved in a whole series of activities from manufacturing
through service industries like telecommunications and oil and gas
exploration. It boasts a collective turnover of $2 billion-plus. In
fact, the Modis even have a township named after them - Modinagar.

However, the group is not exactly a cohesive whole as it has split into
factions, each represented by one of Gujar Mal Modi's sons. The
splinter that has spawned the entertainment arm is the $300 million
diversified Krishan Kumar Modi company, run by Lalit's father, KK Modi.
With fingers in numerous pies from the manufacturing of cosmetics for
Estee Lauder and cigarettes in partnership with Philip Morris, to tea
retailing via the

Tea City outlet, KK Modi's flagship companies include Godfrey Philips
(cigarettes and the tea), Indofil Chemicals, (fertilisers to
polyester), Modern Home Care (household products) and, of course, the
entertainment concerns, which are just taking shape.

"The reasons for getting into entertainment were clear," says Lalit
Modi. "No large company has looked at it as a serious business [in
India] and hence there was an opportunity to corporatise it. It [the
market] consisted of mom and pop-type operators with thousands of
players, all of them small. The reasons for our entering TV were that a
boom was inevitable. There was just a single channel but restrictions
were being lifted which would change this. Entertainment is the
backbone of Indians. We had the infrastructure, marketing and brand-
building savvy and were ideally positioned to make a go of it."

What makes the Modis different from other Indian groups looking at
entering the entertainment industry is the group's broad perspective
and ambition. Lalit Modi believes in using a network of companies to
straddle every segment of the entertainment business.

"I want the Modi Entertainment Group to be in every aspect of
entertainment. I want to attack on all fronts - production,
distribution and cinema exhibition, accompanied by merchandising. In TV
I want the integration [created by] having a satellite channel,
software production [facilities], distribution and marketing," Modi
explains. "An entertainment product should be bought for every possible
window - pay-TV, free-TV, cable, you name it. I expect the linkages
that I am now forging between the various elements of entertainment to
generate 40% to 50% savings."

Indeed, neither the Hindujas, Zee TV or Business India TV can boast
portfolios as large as the Modi Group, as all three focus on one, two,
or at the most three different facets of the entertainment business.
Zee is involved in software production, runs three satellite channels,
operates an amusement park and produces films and music. The Hindujas
are at present only involved in cable TV but have intentions to expand
into publishing, satellite TV, movie production, multiplexes and
entertainment parks.

As yet the Modi Entertainment Group has not diversified into amusement
parks, the music business or radio, but no one would be surprised if it
didn't make a foray into each of these in the future. "Let the policies
become clearer," says executive director Rajiv Sahai.

Lalit Modi believes life in the entertainment lane is just starting.
"By the time this article comes out I'll have struck a few more deals,"
he says. "Currently I am looking at direct-to-home in a big way, but so
are several others like [PanAmSat via] PAS-4, Hughes, and Rupert
Murdoch. For all you know, I may tie up with one of them at some stage.
I have allocated $200 to $300 million to be invested in entertainment
over the next three years. I'd like the group to be a major force in
the Indian marketplace. So far we have delivered. Time will tell
whether we'll succeed."

MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN

The Modi Group's market knowledge and financial acumen has attracted
the attention of the world's leading entertainment companies, writes
Anil Wanvari

The essence of the Modi Entertainment Group lies in the number of
global alliances CEO Lalit Modi has created. However, this is in-
keeping with the company's overall philosophy. Founder Gujar Mal Modi
once said when you don't have certain know-how you should take it from
a foreign company. And grandson Lalit is certainly following that
advice.

"We have 42 joint ventures in the Modi group as a whole. As far as
entertainment goes we knew we wanted to get in but we didn't understand
it. It was a new business for India and we didn't have the technology,
whereas the foreign partner did," he explains.

So far Modi has surrendered a majority (51%) stake in the Disney joint
venture, which has already spawned two subsidiaries, and has given away
50% in three of its other six entertainment companies.

"Thanks to these partnerships we've got faster to market and in turn
have given them our understanding of the Indian market and
infrastructure," he says.

Modi's first chance at an entertainment partnership came in 1993 when
the conglomerate inked a deal with Walt Disney to set-up Walt Disney
(India). "Disney had just completed a licence agreement with a small
Indian company and approached us, among several other companies, for a
tie-up," recalls Lalit Modi. "We pursued them with great motivation, we
were prepared to take on losses for some time and put in a great deal
of effort behind building up the business. All this is probably what
drove us together."

Formed to act as a vehicle for further Disney investments in India, the
joint venture soon spawned its first wholly-owned subsidiary: Walt
Disney Consumer Products (India) to look after the merchandising and
licensing of Disney products.

So far Walt Disney Consumer Products (India) has finalised licensing
deals with about 42 Indian companies.

Walt Disney (India's) second venture, Buena Visa Television (India),
was set-up to take responsibility for programme distribution and
marketing, with access to the huge library of series, animation shorts,
educational software and films from the animated giant and other
affiliated studios such as Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone, Caravan and
Miramax.

"Their professionalism and their commitment to quality encouraged us to
take them on as partners," says Disney's Hong Kong-based marketing and
communications manager, Rose Leng. "We saw eye-to-eye. They also enjoy
a unique relationship with Doordarshan."

Modi's relationship with the state-owned broadcaster has not only
helped Doordarshan fight the onslaught of foreign satellite channels
like Star TV, but has succeeded in reaping rewards all round: Today
Disney shows are broadcast on both DDI and DDII and, for Buena Vista TV
itself, such deals have contributed towards revenues which reached Rs52
million ($14 million) in 1994, of which Rs14.8 million was profit.

Close on the heels of the Buena Vista TV formation, Modi also signed
deals for the rights to distribute Disney films to India, Sri Lanka,
Nepal and Bangladesh under the guise of Modi Films, another 100% Modi-
owned company.

And, although movie-going in India has been on the wane, Modi
Entertainment is trying to change that. Via a 50/50 joint venture with
United Artists Theatre Circuit, the company is looking at setting up
multiplex theatre chains in all the major metros, at a cost of Rs150 to
Rs200 per site.

Another 100%-owned venture, Home Communications, has also been actively
acquiring the rights to TV software, including 300 Hindi film titles
and a few overseas English productions. Home Communications is also
looking at co-producing programming for television, the fruits of which
will be sold to broadcasters including Modi's joint venture Disney
Channel.

For Modi, software opportunities lead naturally to channel
opportunities and greater returns. But only if the right revenue
streams are tapped. "Advertising in India is not growing fast enough to
sustain the explosion in free-to-air channels," says Lalit Modi. "So I
was convinced the key to the Indian TV market would be distribution,
and via the pay-TV route."

And that is where his next venture, Modi Entertainment Network (MEN),
comes in. Headed by marketing veteran Tony D'Siliva, MEN is relying on
Modi's existing network of 2000 salesmen and 50 national distributors
to get into the cable TV distribution and subscriber management
businesses, albeit in a rather unique way.

Says Lalit Modi: "Most of the distributors have children who have come
of age and are looking for new businesses to enter. They are respected
in their towns and have influence. I'm offering the children the option
to manage collections for pay-TV from operators and service them and
distribute decoders."

The distributors are expected to set-up separate outfits with their
servicing field force and will work in conjunction with a dedicated MEN
staff of 150 to collect subscriptions revenue. Modi group salesmen will
conduct household audits to confirm whether the satellite feed is
actually being retransmitted by the cable operator. D'Silva expects MEN
to be involved in 100 cities by the end of Year One.

Such efforts seem to be already bearing fruit: in December 1994
sportscaster ESPN signed MEN to be its exclusive Indian distributor.

"There are few companies in India that know as much about the media
business as these guys," says ESPN Asia managing director Sandy Brown.

Brown says Modi will be involved in all facets of the channel's
distribution and operation from the distribution of decoders to the
subscriber management and revenue collection. And although ESPN is
currently doing all the customisation of the channel itself - it is
providing between eight to 12 hours of dubbed Hindi-language
programming a day, in addition to producing local wrap-arounds - Brown
says he isn't ruling out Modi getting involved in the production
process itself.

ESPN is keen to test the market for pay-TV in India. Set to launch in
mid-October, the ESPN India channel will be one of only two pay-TV
services targeting the Subcontinent, the first being Star Movies.
However, at the time of writing, the two companies have had to change
tack, having made the decision to offer the service free-to-air for a
short while as a promotional ploy.

Lalit Modi says this is a deliberate strategy: "I'd like cable
operators and viewers to get a taste of the quality of programming ESPN
can provide," he says. "Once they become aware, I'm sure they'll be
willing to pay for it."

But observers say the company hasn't managed to get its pay-TV
management act together and has failed to get enough cable operators on
its side, in addition to falling short with the required number of
decoders. The truth may lie somewhere in between. Indian cable
operators are averse to coughing up cash for decoders and don't like to
reveal their true subscriber bases due to heavy government levies.

ESPN's Brown is not unrealistic about the task ahead. "Collecting the
revenue is not going to be an easy task, the operators are not used to
paying for services and their sheer number and distance apart will make
things difficult. But if anyone has got the distribution network to
pull it off it is the Modis."

Lalit Modi is also unperturbed: "The decoders are not the problem. We
have everything in place, but we will only go ahead when the timing is
right," adding that MEN is pursuing further deals with other
broadcasters for pay-TV distribution.

The efforts may well be worth while as indications point to big
returns. If MEN can persuade even five million of India's 15 million
cable homes to pay Rs5 a month, the numbers will work out at Rs300
million a year. And that's just for starters, reckons Modi.

What may be some time off, however, is the widely-speculated Modi-
Disney pay-TV movie channel, to be delivered via PAS-4. According to
Disney's Rose Leng, the entertainment conglomerate has no immediate
plans for India. "India is just one of several Asian markets we are
examining. We have to find the right programming format and partners,"
she says. "We'll just leave the transponder that we have booked there;
we are not going to rush in."

The explanation from the Modi side is that the satellite channel has
been delayed because the group is still doing research into the Indian
market. "We are reviewing the possibilities together, we can't afford
to make mistakes," says Lalit Modi. "The viewer gives you only one
chance in the TV business."

Modi's ability and willingness to carefully research its market is an
attribute that attracted the attention of New World Entertainment, one
of two U.S companies with which Modi has set-up shared equity ventures,
the other being Multimedia Enterprises.

"Research into the TV viewer has been spotty in India in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative research," says New World's John Cuddihy.
"But the Modis have gone out on their own and produced some excellent-
quality research we have access to."

The purpose of New World Modi (India) is to create opportunities in the
TV business on a number of fronts in which distribution of the existing
catalogue, original production and channel development are all being
evaluated. However, Cuddihy says that of them all, channel development
is probably of least interest. "Although we wouldn't necessarily turn
our backs on a situation that included hardware, our mandate in India
at the moment is to work on the software," he says. Currently, Modi-New
World India has taken slots on DDII for the long-running soap Valley of
The Dolls, which is being stripped five times a week.

According to Ethan Podell, executive vice-president of Multimedia
Enterprises, his company approached Modi for a partnership: "The group
is a sophisticated business entity. They have a good grasp of the media
business."

Podell envisages the venture producing U.S-style talk shows for the
Indian market, albeit with a local focus. Work on one daytime show has
already started and should be ready in the next six months.

"We don't know how long it's going to take to make money in the Indian
market but all our markets are revenue-driven," says Podell. "We are
optimistic."

And that's exactly what has made Modi Entertainment Group the darling
of the western media world. Says Lalit Modi: "When we were discussing
with Disney, we were willing to work their way and we were motivated
and persevering. For every venture we had to approach them afresh. In
some of the ventures I'm aware we will take four years to break even;
in some we are already making profits. I have a vision: that the Modi
Entertainment Group is to emerge as a major player in the Indian
market."

LAWS UNTO THEMSELVES

The second part of Cable & Satellite Asia's A-Z guide to regulation. By
Janine Stein

Korea

Regulatory bodies and laws: Since December 1994, the licensing
authority has been the Ministry of Information and Communications
(MOIC). The previous authority, the

Ministry of Information (MOI), now makes recommendations to the MOIC.
All cable companies are required to join the Korean Cable Television
Association (KCTA). Programming standards and practices are set by the
Korean Cable Communications Commission (KCCC). Laws governing
television include the Telecommunications Business Law, the Cable TV
Law, the Satellite Communications Law (draft) and the Satellite
Broadcasting Law (draft). Satellite laws are being drafted to deal with
the use of satellites after the launch of KoreaSat.

Uplink/downlink: No company is allowed to establish uplink or downlink
facilities except for Korea Telecom (KT) and DACOM. Uplink/downlink
agreements between cable network service-providers and foreign
satellite operators have to be rubber-stamped by the Ministry of
Information and Communication.

Foriegn ownership/cross media ownership: The government has adopted a
tripartite framework for cable TV. This consists of system operators
(defined geographically), programmers (defined by genre) and signal
transporting providers (network operators). Cross-ownership among the
three is prohibited by the Cable TV Law. Foreign companies and large
domestic business conglomerates, such as Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo,
are supposedly prohibited from participating in system operating and
signal transporting, although they are heavily involved indirectly.
Foreign investment is limited to 15% in the TV programmers category.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: The Copyright Law
protects foreign broadcasts and cable retransmissions.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Advertising time can be no longer
than 10 minutes per hour, with a maximum of six minutes per hour on the
children's channel. Programmes cannot be interrupted by advertising
more than four times in two hours, and ad breaks, depending where they
fall in the schedule, are regulated in terms of length and content.

Reception and distribution rules: Private satellite TV reception is
officially banned. This will change with the launch of KoreaSat though.

Programming rules and content restrictions: Cable TV channels have
strict foreign content restrictions, varying from 10% for arts and
culture, and 20% for educational programming, to 50% for science and
technology and documentaries. Movies, foreign programming, cartoons and
commercials have to adhere to certain content standards.

Contact: Ministry of Information and Communications, Tel: 82 2 720
4929; Korean Cable TV Association, Tel: 82 2 735 6511, Fax: 82 2 735-
6514

Malaysia

Regulatory bodies and laws: Ministry of Energy, Telecoms and Posts,
Ministry of Information. The power to grant broadcasting licences lies
with the Ministry of Information. Regulations regarding satellite
services are contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1950 and the
Broadcasting Act of 1988. Malaysia's legislation is being amended in
response to new technological advancements such as uplinking services
and public reception of satellite broadcast signals.

Uplink/downlink: Uplinking is possible through the Telecommunications
Department. This restriction will be revised under the new regulations.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: The 1974 guidelines require
foreign individuals acquiring 15% or more of voting powers, or groups
acquiring 30% or more, to apply for permission from the Foreign
Investment Committee (FIC). Alternatively, if the acquisition by
foreign interests in a Malaysian company is worth more than $M5 million
($2 million), irrespective of percentage, companies will require the
approval of the FIC. There is no separate defined policy for the
telecommunications sector, although there are expectations that the
development of cable and satellite networks by foreign companies will
require joint ventures with local companies. There are currently no
specific rules on cross-media ownership.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Broadcasts are governed
by the Copyright Act of 1987. The material must be original, first
published in Malaysia, or broadcast from Malaysia. With some
exceptions, broadcasts from outside Malaysia are not entitled to
protection.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Details of requirements on cable
are not yet confirmed. There are severe restrictions on the content and
production of advertisements.

Reception and distribution rules: Dishes were banned in 1992 to prevent
Malaysia receiving unsuitable foreign channels. This ruling is expected
to be overturned when amendments to the broadcasting and
telecommunications acts are tabled before Parliament this year.

Programming rules and content restrictions: The Malaysian government is
softening its hard-line attitude towards foreign programming. The
Ministry Of Information is conducting a study to determine the kind of
programmes suitable for television, video-tapes and cinemas. It will
also look into a rating system and a broadcasting code of ethics.

Philippines

Regulatory bodies and laws: The regulatory bodies are the Department of
Transport and Communications, the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC), and the Kapisnan ng mga Brodkaster (KBP). Cable
regulations are works-in-progress at the moment. Main industry body,
the Philippine Cable Television Association, is expected to shortly
submit its recommendations to the government.

Uplink/downlink: Licences to establish uplinking facilities are issued
by the NTC. Various construction and equipment permits are also
required. However companies have to prove the current facilities
provided by the satellite communications service-providers do not not
meet their requirements. Foreign broadcasters do not require permits to
downlink to cable operators, providing the signals do not originate in
the Philippines.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Under current regulations,
foreign investment in the cable industry - classified as broadcast
media - is not allowed. Reclassification is expected to take place this
year. If reclassified as telecommunications, the foreign investment
ceiling will be 40%. There is a possibility cable may be classified and
regulated separately with a 30% ceiling on foreign investment. There
are foreign ownership restrictions on the ownership of uplink
facilities too.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Piracy is a problem,
although efforts are being made to encourage cable operators to adhere
to rules. But fines for offenders are low. Many cable systems are video-
driven, using unlicensed tapes and unauthorised retransmission of taped
satellite programmes.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Except for institutional
advertising, cable TV is not officially allowed to carry advertising.
In reality, cable operators are carrying up to four minutes of ads per
hour. In return for carrying institutional ads, cable operators are
awarded tax credits.

Reception and distribution rules: None

Programming rules and content restrictions: The Philippines has no
restrictions on foreign programming content. Cable operators rely on
acquired programming because they aren't supposed to produce their own.
Cable operators are obliged to carry the terrestrial broadcasters.

Fax: 63 2 921 7128.

Singapore

Regulatory bodies and laws: The Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA)
is a statutory authority under the Ministry of Information and the
Arts, which regulates and licenses the broadcasting industry in
Singapore. Broadcasting services are governed by the Singapore
Broadcasting Act 1994. Video-on-demand is classified as a broadcasting
service and is subject to SBA licensing requirements. The SBA is
responsible for regulating broadcasting services content. The
Telecommunications Authority Of Singapore (TAS) is responsible for
regulating broadcasting delivery systems.

Uplink/downlink: To uplink satellite signals from Singapore,
broadcasters need a satellite broadcasting licence issued by the SBA.
Broadcasters who want to operate their own uplink facilities need a
licence issued by the TAS. To be granted a satellite broadcasting
licence, broadcasters have to ensure their service is acceptable and
complies with local laws in recipient countries. Once satisfied, the
SBA will give its approval in principle within two weeks. The actual
licence takes a month to issue. There are several incentive schemes,
such as the Pioneer Status scheme, granted to broadcasters who choose
Singapore as their base. These are incentive tax packages based on the
type of activity and amount of investment made. Satellite broadcasters
can uplink their services through a common carrier like Singapore
Telecom, SIMCOM, or ST Teleport. They can also operate their own uplink
facilities either individually or in joint-ownership with other
broadcasters.

Foreign/cross media ownership restrictions: None

Intellectual property and copyright protection: A number of laws
protect intellectual property. These include the Copyright Act, the
Trademarks Act and the Patent Act. Cable operators have to obtain
copyright authorisation for programming.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Cable advertising is restricted to
14 minutes per hour. There are no restrictions on satellite
advertising.

Reception and distribution rules: Private dish installation and usage
is banned. Businesses can apply to the SBA to receive DTH services.

Programming rules and content restrictions: There are no language or
foreign programme restrictions on cable or satellite TV. The cable TV
system is required to carry the local terrestrial channels on its
network.

Planning, Tel: 65 373 0803 Fax: 65 278 6009

Taiwan

Regulatory bodies and laws: Regulatory bodies are the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and the Government Information Office
(GIO). Revisions to the Broadcasting and Television Law are pending.
Taiwan's first Cable TV Law was passed in 1993.

Uplink/downlink: Foreign broadcasters are not allowed to uplink from
Taiwan. This could change under the new legislation.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Draft regulations may allow
49% foreign investment in satellite companies. Foreign investment in
cable has to be indirect.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: A new copyright law has
been drafted to bring Taiwan into line with GATT standards. The draft
law clarifies the definition of broadcast but does not specifically
address the protection of unencrypted signals. At the moment,
protection is offered to works by nationals of the U.S., Hong Kong,
Switzerland, the UK and, in certain cases, Korea and Spain.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Ads are allowed to occupy 10% of
broadcasting time on cable. There are no restrictions on satellite.

Reception and distribution rules: Broadcasts are mostly unregulated.

Programming rules and content restrictions: Content guidelines are very
general, mainly for the protection of children. There are no language
restrictions. 20% of the cable programming mix has to be locally-
produced. The GIO is planning a Satellite Broadcast Law which will give
it authority to control content. At the moment, the GIO uses the
Broadcasting and Television Law's provisions on programme production
and distribution. As most foreign suppliers of satellite programmes
fall beyond the reach of local authorities, there are indications that
the local authorities will attempt to control foreign programming
through cable operators carrying the programmes.

Contact: Government Information Office, Tel: 886 2 357 0020 Fax: 886 2
357-0016.

Thailand

Regulatory bodies and laws: The Broadcasting Law covers all
broadcasting in Thailand, with separate regulations for cable.
Satellite TV has no regulations of its own. The Public Relations
Department (PRD) is the broadcasting regulatory body.

Uplink/downlink: Uplink facilities require a licence under the amended
Radio and Television Act, which covers the provision of radio or
television services for the public. The licences are issued by the
Department of Posts and Telecommunications. A company establishing
uplink or downlink facilities has to be majority Thai-owned. The Alien
Business Law restricts foreign involvement in certain activities;
including operating uplinking facilities.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Broadcasting licence
applications have to be submitted by Thai nationals with offices in
Thailand. In ordinary registered partnerships, partners must be Thai
nationals. In limited partnerships, the partner with unlimited
liability must hold Thai nationality and not less than 50% of the
company's capital must be held by Thai nationals.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Perhaps surprisingly,
given the proliferation of pirated  goods in Thailand, foreign
broadcasts and cable retransmission of foreign broadcasts are protected
under the Thai copyright law.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Thailand's pay-TV services are not
allowed to carry advertising. Content is dictated by the PRD.

Reception and distribution rules: Private ownership of satellite dishes
is allowed. Pay-TV companies have to obtain a licence from either the
Mass Communications Organisation of Thailand (MCOT) or the PRD.

Programming rules and content restrictions: There are no foreign
programme quotas. Programmes cannot be insulting to anyone, especially
Thai Royalty, heads of state or government officials. Religion has to
be respected, as does the public order, national unity and
international relationships. Obscene and cruel footage is banned.
Foreign television production crews have to obtain official permission
to shoot in Thailand.

BIG MONEY, BIG PLANS

Malaysia's foray into cable and satellite has begun with two consortia
competing for market share. Sarah Walker reports

"We are about to make a quantum leap," said Malaysia's minister of
information about the imminent arrival to his country of pay-TV, which
will enable the 22 million-strong population to tune into around 25
channels of TV, compared to the current choice of just four. But it
will be a controlled leap. Far from heralding the beginning of an open-
skies policy, there is every sign Prime Minister Mohammed Mahathir -
concerned about the effect uncensored western satellite channels could
have on Malaysia's national culture and identity - will preside
carefully over the emergence of cable and DTH.

So far two companies have been given licences to develop a secondary
television market in Malaysia. One, Cableview Services Sdn Bhd, has
already soft-launched part of its five-channel MMDS service called Mega
TV (see box). The other, Measat Broadcast Network Services (MBNS), will
launch its 20-channel DTH service mid-1996, utilising Ku-band capacity
on the country's first domestic satellite, Measat One.

Although Cableview Services has cash-rich shareholders, its level of
investment in pay-TV comes nowhere near that being earmarked by its
satellite-delivered competitor. However, both Measat and MBNS are part
of a much wider effort to construct a modern technological
infrastructure in Malaysia. Measat is owned and operated by Binariang
Sdn Bhd, a private telecommunications company in turn owned 20% by the
U.S. Baby Bell US West and 80% by Malaysian shareholders, including the
influential business tycoon Ananda Krishnan. The Malaysian shareholders
in turn wholly own MBNS, giving it sister company status to Binariang.

Binariang itself, far from just being a satellite operator, has a
complete range of authorisations from the Malaysian government to
establish a fully-integrated, multimedia network operating under the
corporate identity name of Maxis. This includes the setting up of a
cellular phone system, the construction of fixed broadband networks
and, of course, the launching and operation of Measat.

So far two Measats have been planned and will be co-located at 91.5
degrees, although eight orbital slots have been filed in total. Measat
One will launch in December 1995, while Measat Two is tentatively
scheduled for October 1996. Both will be put into orbit by the French
launcher Arianespace.

Measat One's payload will be comprised of 12 36MHz transponders at C-
Band and five, 54MHz transponders at Ku-Band. The C-Band footprint will
cover the whole of the Asia Pacific, as far west as the east coast of
India as far south as northern Australia, north to Mongolia and east as
far as Guam. Ku-Band capacity, meanwhile, will provide spot beam
coverage over Malaysia, the Philippines and India.

Although the same model as the first craft, Measat Two is likely to be
configured differently with three 76MHz C-Bands transponders, in
addition to 12 at Ku-Band. Measat Two's Ku capacity will also be
extended to provide coverage of Java, Queensland and Vietnam.

"The satellite payload is quite flexible, we can switch transponders
between the different beams," says Maxis's Steven Corda. "We are
looking at targeting emerging countries, to be there when they require
a service," he continues. "For instance, we have one transponder that
can be switched to Vietnam, providing five to 10 channels of
programming."

Although the satellite operator and the programming arm operate as
separate entities, the commonality of ownership ensures that synergies
exist. While C-Band capacity on both satellites is available for hire,
all the Ku capacity has been leased exclusively to MBNS so that it can
provide DTH services initially to Malaysia, but potentially to all the
different regions covered by the spot beams.

For Malaysia itself, MBNS has initially been licensed to provide a 20-
channel DTH package receivable with 50cm dishes. According to Paul
Edwards, MBNS's chief operating officer, channels in the package will
be a combination of international and locally-produced services. "We
will probably have two local channels initially," says Edwards, whose
staff are now in the process of acquiring shows and commissioning local
productions. Eventually, MBNS will have the capability to produce its
own programming once construction has been completed of the Asia
Broadcast Centre, a huge facility combining production, post-production
facilities and uplinking. The centre will also enable the company to
help localise the international services, in terms of providing dubbing
and subtitling and possibly even providing local programming.

"Our experience is that local programming often drives the pay-TV
packages and that often international channels by themselves have not
always been especially successful in some markets," says Edwards. "So
we are looking at a combination of local driver channels packaged with
top-quality international channels that have an element of
localisation."

Although contracts have yet to be signed, programmers who have
confirmed they are in discussions for carriage as part of the DTH
package include the Discovery Channel, ESPN, CNNI, TNT/Cartoon Network
and Asia Business News.

With such services previously unwelcome in Malaysia, Edwards says a lot
of focus is being channelled towards the issue of censorship, "to
ensure that whatever we broadcast will be acceptable," he says. "We are
still evaluating those standards but have employed some very advanced
technology which will allow us to delay the transmission of content,
subject to the usual permissions of the programme owners."

CNNI for one will broadcast to Malaysia on a two-hour delay basis to
give local censors plenty of time to cut out any offending programme
material.

With the launch of the DTH package still some eight to 10 months off,
Edwards says negotiations are still underway with MPEG-2/DVB-compliant
compression technology suppliers. Also still being evaluated is the
pricing structure. "We are still doing research into the market as to
what acceptance levels are," he says. Although a more comprehensive
channel package, coupled with the high cost of digital decoders, is
likely to push the price up to at least twice that of Mega TV, say
industry experts.

Utilising compression rates of at least 10 to one and perhaps even
higher on each of the 17 Ku transponders provided by both Measat One
and Two, MBNS will be able to provide in the region of 150 DTH
channels, split between the satellites' several spot beams. "We will
not necessarily beam services into each of those countries but have the
capacity to do so," says Edwards. "And because the beams are switchable
to a degree we can allocate transponder capacity to certain markets as
the need arises." Although Edwards says the services could also be
delivered to cable headends as well as to the home, "the experience of
Europe and the U.S. shows that there is a very definite role for DTH."

Aside from Malaysia the first market to be targeted by MBNS is India,
where an MoU to deliver a multi-channel DTH service, in conjunction
with state broadcaster Doordarshan, has already been signed. Utilising
up to four transponders, a potential 40 channels will eventually be
available. "India has been a cable market until now but it has grown
very fast indeed and we think that going forward there will be a very
viable DTH market there," he says.

As regards the C-Band capacity on Measat One and Two, Maxis's Steven
Corda says Binariang is "looking to provide any type of fixed satellite
services you could imagine." The first will be a Vsat service scheduled
for the second quarter of next year, another will be telephony, with
long-distance learning another possibility. However one of the major
target markets will again be broadcasters, for distribution to
headends. "We are looking at both international and domestic
broadcasters," says Corda. "Say if the domestic broadcaster wanted to
make its programming available in Indonesia, or Mindanao in the
Philippines where there is a large Bahasa Malaysia-speaking
population... When you look at the coverage, we cover just about all of
Asia Pacific and the power levels are quite large, so we can run two
analogue channels per transponder at high quality, effectively doubling
the amount of programming you can see on our satellite versus some of
the others," he continues.

Corda views all the other regional satellites as Measat's direct
competition, but doesn't believe it is a major issue.

"Digital video and high-powered transponders have lowered the cost for
individual uses such that we are now getting a whole new market
segment," he says. "Now instead of just the $1.5 million to $2 million
a year for a transponder, customers can lease an eighth or a quarter,
we are now getting into the $500,000 and lower range." The cost for a
full C-Band transponder on Measat will be $1.9 million a year.

For Binariang though it is the construction of the fixed broadband
network that is seen as potentially the largest revenue-earner. The
company is to invest R$2.9 million in its development over the next
five years. So far two deals have been signed for the construction of
hybrid fibre/co-axial systems, with the aim being to capture an 8%
market share by the year 2000.

Edwards see synergies for MBNS and Binariang in this area too. "Such a
state-of-the-art system will allow for VOD and interactive
programming... we see ourselves as a content-provider," he says.

MEGA TV: NO SECOND BEST

With a population starved of choice yet relatively affluent, received
wisdom is that the time is right for pay-TV in Malaysia. But do
Malaysians need two services? The answer, according to both MBNS and
competitor Mega TV, would appear to be yes.

Although MBNS's proposed pay-TV plan is impressive, the country's
second pay-TV licensee, Mega TV, will still have an eight-month lead
over its DTH-delivered competitor, and decidedly lower overheads.

Test-launched in September with a four-channel package - comprised of
CNNI, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and ESPN - Mega TV will begin
its full, five-channel service in November with the arrival of HBO
Asia. At this time viewers will be required to begin paying for the
package.

According to CEO Shamsul Khalid Ismail, the total cost of the service
includes an installation fee of R$260 ($104) to R$450, depending on the
type of property, a R$135 decoder deposit fee - the decoders are given
out free of charge, but on loan - and a monthly fee of R$45. For this,
subscribers will get four 24-hour channels, plus a fifth channel
incorporating 14-hours of the Cartoon Network, broadcasting from 08.00
to 18.00, plus locally-packaged general entertainment programming,
broadcasting from 20.00 to 01.00.

Operated by Cableview Services which in turn is owned by a consortium
of five companies, including private broadcaster TV3 (40%) and the
minister of finance (30%), Mega TV is initially targeting the wealthy
Klang Valley area of Malaysia, which incorporates Kuala Lumpur. Target
households are those with incomes exceeding $1,500 a month. And
although Mega TV is allowed to sell three minutes of commercial airtime
per hour on all channels except HBO, its main revenue is expected to
come from subscriptions.

While it is likely all of the channels distributed by Mega TV will end
up on Measat as well, Mega is playing on the cost factor. "We know
their service will be a lot more expensive," says Ismail. "They will
have to target the R$3000 a month income bracket." And by the time
Measat's DTH service is up-and-running, Mega TV will have expanded
beyond its initial coverage area.

With a nationwide licence, the plan is to expand coverage as quickly as
possible, using the same MMDS delivery. Channel capacity could also be
extended to around 12, and even more, should digital MMDS be
implemented. This, says Ismail, could render it unnecessary to invest
in other forms of delivery, such as hard wire cable, because digital
MMDS would allow compression of the existing channels.

Having invested R$110 million to date, breakeven point, says Ismail, is
50,000 subscribers. "We have the capacity to install about 40,000
dishes a month, so it is possible we could recoup by year end," he
says.

A CRISIS OF IDENTITY

Cable TV in the Philippines is a growth industry, but regulatory issues
need to be resolved before it can reallydevelop. By Sarah Walker

The Philippines may be home to one of Asia's lesser developed economies
but its cable system is surprisingly well developed and, coupled with
interest from overseas investors, is growing rapidly.

A country with a population of 66 million, there are currently 5.5
million TV households in the Philippines. To date, cable has passed
over 40% of TV homes and there are an estimated 300,000 to 350,000
subscribers. Projections for the year 2000 are over one million.

The Philippines Cable TV Association (PCTA), an efficient industry body
formed in 1987 with six charter members, now numbers 216, although the
number of cable operators that have received cable licences from the
National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is 320. PCTA estimates put
the total number of systems operating at between 260 and 300.

Sky Cable, the country's largest cable operator, carries 55 channels
and has a subscriber base of 120,000 (see sidebar), however most
operators carry between 10 and 20 channels and serve anything from 300
subscribers upwards.

Although monthly subscription fees, which range from P90 ($3.50) to
P430 - depending on the location of the service - are low, the ability
of most Filipinos to speak English has provided a ready-made market for
western companies.

Most of the major satellite broadcasters are carried on Filipino cable
systems, including ESPN, TNT/Cartoon Network, HBO Asia, The Discovery
Channel and Star TV. Operators receive the services from satellites
such as Palapa B2P, PAS-2 and Apstar 1, and, like Indonesia, the
geography of the Philippines means most of the major VHF and UHF-
delivered broadcasters such as ABS-CBN and GMA 7 are also carried via
satellite and then relayed by cable. In outlying areas where
terrestrial reception is poor this has resulted in a big demand for
cable TV.

However, in the bigger cities, where UHF and VHF signals can easily be
received, the demographic of the average cable viewer tends to be
higher, as in this instance cable is an add-on service, not a
necessity.

In Metro Manila for example, between 60% and 80% of viewers are in the
AB category as opposed to elsewhere, where they only number 30% of
viewers.

In addition to the relaying of foreign channels and national
broadcasters, a few locally-produced and packaged channels are also
carried. Sky Cable has three of its own, while the Hollywood Channel,
which began broadcasting off Palapa B2P in March, is a 16-hours-a-day
nationwide cable network that, according to Liza Legaspi, programme
manager, broadcasts mainly acquired U.S. programming such as Time Trax
and Lois and Clark.

Carried by about 100 cable operators, Hollywood Channel has plans to
start producing original programming soon. Its sister company, Cable
Boss, is a distributor and acts as the middle-man between  programmers
and cable operators, providing monthly figures and collecting revenue -
under-reporting of the subscriber base is still a big problem in the
Philippines.

The other major  distributors are Accion, and Yes Cable. Many of the
U.S. broadcasters use all three, as does Star TV. According to its
general manager, southeast Asia, distribution and marketing, David
Ilagan, the pan-Asian broadcaster will be launching a full Filipino
Channel, once Asiasat 2 launches.

Although the Philippines can lay claim to having built one of, if not
the first, cable system in Asia - constructed in Bagio City in 1969 -
the imposition of marshall law by the Marcos regime in 1972 put a
freeze on the telecoms and broadcasting industry. From that point on,
cable TV's development, like the country in general, stood still.

It wasn't until 1987 when the government of Cory Aquino allowed any
citizen of the Philippines to build a cable system, (as long as they
submitted the applicable technical and financial studies) that cable
began to grow again.

Now that President Fidel Ramos, who has set his sights on turning the
Philippines into a newly industrialised nation by the year 2000, cable
can really begin to develop beyond its formative stages. Or at least
that's the theory. Regulatory wrangles and legal loopholes mean that,
presently, Filipino cable does seem to be undergoing something of an
identity crisis.

Currently cable in the Philippines is classified as broadcast media,
but the NTC is formulating plans for it to be reclassified as telecoms.
Should this take place it would bring about a number of changes, the
most significant being a change in the foreign ownership ceiling from a
present zero to 40%.

Most industry observers think foreign investment is the only way cable
operators will be able to upgrade their infrastructure significantly to
compete with the country's rapidly growing telecoms market. Indeed a
number are already forming alliances with U.S. cable companies in
preparation for an easing of restrictions.

The most high-profile overseas operator is the Falcon Cable/Cavite
Cable Systems joint venture in which the U.S. company helped the cable
operator install a fully fibre-optic system. Fellow U.S. predator UIH
also has an alliance with Sun TV. Other U.S. companies thought to be
looking for strategic alliances include Time Warner and TCI.

"To go from 250,000 [subscribers] to over 2.5 million the cable
industry needs to establish stability, a level of professionalism and
vision," says Clive Flessig, vice president international, Falcon
Cable. "Telecoms will come up with a compelling argument to get into
the business... International investors are in need of a local partner
who is familiar with the environment."

There have already been some informal tie-ups between telcos and cable
companies to provide telephony over cable. To name just one, the
Philippines Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) and Manila's County Cable
Communication's Network have been testing infrastructure pairing
traditional copper wire and co-axial cable for the provision of
telephony, using U.S. company First Pacific Network's (FPN) technology.

The present telecoms bill currently allows telcos to provide cable TV
but not vice versa, therefore it is evident some changes in the law are
necessary to create a level playing field.

The PCTA recognises this but is opposed to the possibility of a
provision for cable being inserted into the Telecoms Act. Instead it is
presently drafting its own cable TV bill to put before Congress which
would classify cable as a separate entity.

While not fully against foreign ownership of cable, the PCTA is anxious
to retain the industry's autonomy and is unlikely to recommend a full
40% ceiling, perhaps opting instead for 30%, with ownership taking the
form of equity participation, but not management control.

Should cable eventually fall under the banner of telecoms, operators
will also have to apply for a Congressional Franchise before
approaching the NTC for a licence. The PCTA vehemently opposes this,
saying the cost involved would prejudice the smaller operator. Others
disagree. "If you look at the 300 or so operators pending licences,
many are mom and pop operations who really don't have enough money to
get in here and offer a reliable service. A congressional franchise
would shake out the small guys from the big guys," says a Manila-based
consultant. A Congressional licence requirement could also help limit
overbuilding, he adds. At the moment there is no limit on the number of
operators allowed per district.

Whatever the outcome of the regulatory changes, in order to develop,
the industry will need some sort of financial boost. The current move
towards consolidation will provide operators with not only more finance
for infrastructure upgrades and original programming production, but
also greater muscle with which to bargain with overseas programmers

Additional money could also come from advertising. At the moment this
too is officially banned although many systems do sell commercial
airtime.

The PCTA is currently pushing for between four and five minutes an hour
compared to the 16 minutes currently allowed on the national stations -
which in turn are opposing the proposal.

Says one cable operator: "National broadcasters view us as a possible
threat to their revenue base, but it is likely that we would be going
after the local market."

LEADER OF THE PACK

Sky Cable - the Philippines' largest operator - reaches 100,000 cable
subscribers, of which 70,000 are located in Metro Manila.

Operating a basic package of 55 channels at a cost of $16 a month, it
is one of the few operators to package and produce its own channels.
Currently numbering three, these are the I Channel, comprised of kids
fare in the daytime and adults at night, Sky Movies and a Filipino
channel that airs movies and locally-produced news and entertainment in
the local Tagalog dialect.

Sky is also the first operator in the Philippines to operate a premium
tier. Launched on July 1 after two weeks of testing as part of the
basic package, the tier is initially offering two Mandarin-language
channels: TVBS, the international arm of Hong Kong terrestrial
broadcaster TVB, at a cost of $4 and news service CTN, at a cost of $2.
There is also a one-off members' fee of $100. By year end the cable
operator hopes to be providing 10 premium channels and is thought to be
in discussions with MTV and Japanese terrestrial NHK.

According to Sky Cable general manager Mel Verlade, the premium tier is
initially aimed at the country's minority, but wealthy Chinese
population.

Sky is using General Instrument's Jerrold equipment for the service.
David Johnson, GI's Asia Pacific support manager, says the deal marks
the first fully interactive, two-way addressable system to have been
sold to the Philippines. Sky has also acquired some impulse PPV boxes
and is currently negotiating with rights-holders. Verlade said VOD is
also a possibility in the future.

Sky owns some eight cable systems nationwide and is looking for further
acquisitions. It is also in the process of laying 100km of fibre-optic
cable in  Metro Manila, with the economically-prosperous town of Cebu
the next possible target for a major infrastructure upgrade.

Owned by the Benpres Group, holding company of the locally powerful
Lopez family - whose subsidiaries include broadcaster ABS-CBN and local
telecoms operator Bayantel, in which Nynex owns a 25% stake - Sky is
not short of cash, or contacts.

ASIAN AESTHETICS

On-air identities and graphics are crucial to the branding of a
channel. Janine Stein looks at how networks are adapting their look to
suit the Far East markets

Staffers at the TNT & Cartoon Network Asia just don't talk about movie
genres anymore. The lavish Thirties swashbuckling drama, Captain Blood,
has become a "magenta." The futuristic 1970s science fiction Logan's
Run, on the other hand, is "definitely a green," according to the new
TNT-speak.

To the crew that is creating an on-air Asian identity for the classic
Hollywood channel, films have become colours and clips set to music to
create a certain mood, to encourage an emotional reaction.

This emotion is TNT's greatest weapon in the American movie channel's
battle for an Asian identity. "No-one has seen the movies and they
don't know our stars in this part of the world," says TNT's director of
programming, Andrea Miller.

But the emotions are universal: love, jealousy, greed. "All these
movies have great emotional content, great moods, great stories,"
Miller says. And TNT has translated them into colour.

While the palette the night-time channel uses reflects Asian cities
after dark, in TNT-speak blue equals light-hearted, comic and musical -
for movies like The Glass Bottomed Boat. Promos for an evening of
traditional family entertainment are gold, while screens filled with
green herald edgy, sci-fi-types like Shaft or Children of the Damned.
When the promos are purple, the movies will be darker, filled with
mystery and suspense. Magenta is reserved for grandeur, for costume
dramas and epics, for films like the Adventures of Don Juan.

If TNT has moved away from its movie icons to achieve an Asian look,
virtually all the channels have shunned traditional Asian icons in
their quest for an Asian identity.

"Anything that you would love to see on a postcard, we try to avoid,"
says David Flack, MTV's director of on-air promotions. "We're looking
for youth culture, the kinds of things that young people are interested
in."

The traditional pool of instantly-recognisable Asian images - dragons,
chop sticks, fans, jade carvings - are "kind of corny," Flack says. TNT
& Cartoon Network's creative director, Ian Diamond, calls these
cultural icons tired and jaded, and steers clear of moviedom's
equivalents - the director's chairs, the strips of film, the
spotlights.

"We wanted to create a look that was contemporary, unique and elegant;
a look that suggested the essence of Hollywood yet avoided Western or
Asian movie cliches," Diamond says.

In contrast to the channel's nostalgic tone in Latin America, TNT
Asia's pitch aims to "appear timeless, not too attached to particular
faces, styles, or periods... we will sell the emotions, energy and
dynamics of Hollywood." It's a concept created in the U.S. For their
new Asian image unveiled earlier this year, TNT went to New York-based
design firm PMCD.

"It was a case of people for the job," Diamond says. But he insists
local artists have as much chance of participating in the network's
ongoing creative process as anyone else. "It's a matter of artistic
talent."

TNT's design elements include fire, water and light, a 3-D feel is
created with movie clips in multiple backgrounds and light play.

Diamond makes heavy use of what he calls "organic" (as opposed to
electronic) elements - 35mm film, original instruments, the real rather
than the virtual - to create TNT's sumptuous night-time feel. Although
he later processes the images on 3-D particle animation using SGI
Wavefront software, he sets great store by their "real foundation."

Just in case the subtle messages are missed, TNT has taken out an on-
screen insurance policy - the word "movie" running in different
languages at the bottom of the screen. "This avoids disruptions to the
basic look and feel but successfully delivers a simple and direct
message to viewers," TNT says.

In a much more powerful programming position, the Discovery Channel is
less esoteric about the on-air image it is forging in Asia. Saffron-
robed monks, the sun rising over a Buddha, traffic in Bangkok,
Sukhothai, plus lots of Asian faces and places are all part of the on-
air promotions and fillers. Each market has its own promos and
interstitials. "We are bringing people their own cities, something to
identify with, pieces of everyday life," says director of on-air
promotions, Susan Seelandt.

The images are set to original music on traditional instruments - a
route also favoured by Asia Business News (ABN). "It's much softer, and
the melodies are Asia-specific," says ABN's deputy managing editor,
Jeremy Pink.

CNBC Asia also aims to echo on-screen pieces of its viewers lives. At
the same time as avoiding the "hard-nosed aggressive approach," the
channel brings images of the way Asia does business to the screen.
Exchanging business cards, greetings, scenes of industry, of stock
exchanges, "things that are typical and obviously Asian, but not
stereotypical," says Robert Wilson, director of network distribution
and marketing.

Creating an identity that works is an imprecise science in such a new
arena. Apart from the obvious don'ts, such as being careful with images
of pigs and pork for Muslim audiences - and that means no Porky Pig on
the Cartoon Network - the creators of on-air promos for Asia are mostly
still easing into the market.

At the Discovery Channel, Asian graphics are currently being phased in
to take the place of graphics from the U.S. "We are in the process of
Asianising the look," Seelandt says.

Next year, when the channel launches its Bahasa and Japanese services,
new graphics with an Asian colour palette using reds and golds will
replace the flourescents and light colours of the U.S.-generated
images. The graphics will be commissioned from Asian artists. "These
are the people who are going to be watching. They know better what will
make people happy," Seelandt says.

While even Asian-based channels such as Asia Business News has not left
colour choices to chance, the global channel least concerned with an
Asian colour palette is MTV.

"We use every colour of the rainbow, sometimes all at once," Flack
says. "The designers are locals, and we're dealing with a young
audience which is less concerned about auspicious colours than older
audiences. We trust them. We have sat down to discuss the wisest kind
of design, but we haven't gone into colour details because that comes
naturally."

Bowing to Asian tastes has been less in the form of content and more in
feel. "We have gone out of our way here to soften the packaging and
promotions," Flack says. "There are fewer cuts than there would be in
the U.S. and Europe, and the whole thing is softer. It's still really
powerful, but the pace is a little easier on the eye."

With a choice of 300 to 400 station IDs, "if someone doesn't like one
of our IDs, a new one will be on in a couple of minutes," Flack says.
Obviously, all efforts are made not to offend anyone. "There was one ID
which has a guy eating a freshly-roasted pig, which we obviously didn't
screen."

Most of MTV's IDs are from the U.S. The Asian operation, launched in
April, has produced three so far, although they have come up with a
swathe of image promos. "We only make IDs when we find very good
subjects," Flack says.

Although he makes heavy use of local talent in producing on-air promos,
one of the problems Flack has "is that people come up with things they
think we want. We have to ask them to think beyond that... If producers
are making something for a Taiwan audience, they have to think about
things from a Taiwan perspective. But it doesn't necessarily have to
feature a Taiwanese thing." Having injected the MTV attitude, "the best
thing for me to do is to take a back seat" and let locals get on with
it, Flack says.

Apart from the language, differentiating MTV Asia from MTV Mandarin is
easy: Although both have the kind of laid-back cool MTV cherishes, MTV
Asia's attitude is less gentle, the humour less black. An MTV Mandarin
image promo will have some dude with wire coat-hangers rigged to his
head as antennas for the MTV signal. On MTV Asia, a skeleton in a
suitcase and a gun show up on an airline's X-ray conveyor belt.

Whatever the routes they've chosen to take in establishing their Asian
credentials, in every case there's a need for international programmers
to meld modern Asian elements - a face, a skyline, a city street - with
internationally established channel brands.

"We are giving a local version of something that people want, in much
the same way as they want other products from abroad," Flack says. "We
make it local, but it still has to be MTV. It still has to be part of
the world network."

ESPN takes that thinking further. ESPN Asia's general manager for
programming and production, John Davies, calls ESPN "a universal brand"
with a distinctive graphic style that runs through all the networks.
"The network ID is just ESPN. The look is recognisable. We're not
putting Mickey Mouse ears on anything."

It's the same line Turner is taking with Cartoon Network, which is sold
in Asia with TNT. "Donald Duck is universal," they say.

Like the Discovery Channel and others who are customising with
subtitling and voice dubbing, ESPN's programming, language, and
promotions will be tailored for different markets. However, Davies
insists, "we are not branding the channel Asian. We are not trying to
identify ourselves as anything - just ESPN... Colour is not something
we concern ourselves with."

With its universally popular sports content and its proven record even
in Asia's most difficult markets, ESPN's identity requires a lot less
physical effort than TNT's at this stage. As the movie channel found in
Malaysia, sometimes, no amount of colour, mood or manipulation will
work. New MMDS service, Mega TV, which launches later this year, gave
the nod to the Cartoon Network and the flick to the classic movies.
Mega TV's reason? They just aren't appropriate for a Malaysian
audience.

FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE

Casbaa is linking with Reed to bring this year's Cable & Satellite
Convention in Hong Kong (December 6-8) back to basics

A cliche it may be, but few can deny that Asia's satellite and cable
industry is growing at a rate of knots. Region-wide, almost without
exception, cable and or DTH infrastructures are rapidly being
developed. New satellite launches providing digital capabilities will
further proliferate the number of channels available. Advances in
technology means Asian countries should be in the position to leapfrog
levels of development that have characterised the growth of multi-
channel environments in the U.S. and Europe.

However there is a downside to Asia's rapid development. An overall
lack of knowledge and expertise, an absence of uniform technical and
operational standards, and, in many cases a total lack of effective,
regulatory legislation has lead to incoherent and disparate growth
throughout the region.

The Cable & Satellite Asia '95 show which is to be held at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, will attempt to address some of
these issues through its convention, while allowing companies a chance
to showcase some of their products.

The show is being organised by the Cable & Satellite Broadcasting
Association of Asia (Casbaa) in conjunction with Reed Exhibition
Companies. A non-profit association set up in 1993, the aim of Casbaa
is to bring together the various parts of the industry, including
international and national programmers, hardware suppliers and cable
and DTH operators to achieve some stability and work towards achieving
common goals.

"We are a young organisation," says Bill Hooks, immediate past
president of Casbaa and HBO Asia managing director (he has been
replaced as president by Turner International's Ted McFarland). "Early
on we were looking for a reason to exist, it was necessary to define
our mission and reach a point where we could convince our members that
Casbaa could make contributions by furthering the cable and satellite
business."

The three-day convention will be the first in a series of industry
events organised by Casbaa. Hooks says the aim is for the show to
become an annual date in the diary for delegates and exhibitors not
only from the Asia-Pacific region but also the U.S. and Europe, and the
premier event for those baffled by the ever-increasing and ever-costly
number of conferences and exhibitions currently being staged in all
corners of Asia.

"There are too many conferences that look like each other and deliver
the same papers, run by for-profit companies who in our view don't
spend enough time worrying about what might be in the best interests of
attendees in terms of content and execution," says Hooks. "They are
very expensive and targeted at senior executives as opposed to what is
emerging as an industry with many different levels... to the typical
Taiwanese or Philippine cable operator the relevancy of, say, a
discussion on telephony today, given where they are in terms of cable
development, is so far removed from what they need to do as to be
irrelevant."

As such, the Casbaa conference plans to go back to basics, moving aware
from "paper-delivering panels" and more towards general sessions and
workshops on issues that are meaningful to companies attempting to
build basic cable infrastructures, such as the use of fibre in building
cable systems, or an explanation of the technical specifications needed
for the building of a modern, not overtly expensive, cable network.
Other subjects the committees have identified as possible workshop
topics include programming, marketing, on-air promotion and customer
service. General sessions will address broader issues such as market
access and copyright.

The conference will also comprise a keynote address from a well-known
industry leader.

As for the exhibition itself, which will be located on Level 7 of the
Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition centre, almost 70% of the 2,500
square metres of floor space has been booked.

MONEY BY NUMBERS

Both China and India will continue to represent major growth areas in
the Asian cable and satellite market, says telecoms consultancy MTA-
EMCI's Sam H. Book

The situation today

China has nearly 40 million cable homes representing about 13%
penetration of total households. Over 12,000, mainly low-capacity catv
systems carry between eight to 20 channels including terrestrial
broadcast stations, government channels and up to four Star TV
channels. Cable rates are about $1 per month and installation charges
come in at between $25 and $35. Reception is the primary motivation for
subscribing to cable television in China, a situation similar to
America in the 1950s and '60s when most American cable subscribers
lived in rural areas and small towns with poor off-air reception.

India, by comparison, has over 12 million cable homes which represents
approximately 7% of total Indian households and over 20% of urban
Indian households. Over 35,000 local cable systems provide
retransmission of terrestrial broadcast stations and a growing array of
satellite programming. Most Indian cable subscribers can now receive
CNNI, BBC World, Zee TV, and several Star TV services, in addition to
regional TV stations and the national state-owned broadcaster,
Doordarshan. Monthly cable subscription rates are between $3 to $5 with
installation costs about $15.

As regards the growth of satellite dishes for DTH delivery, the
statistics for China are particularly impressive. Despite an official
government ban, there are currently over one million satellite dishes
installed and additional dish sales are topping 5,000 a month.

Likewise, India also has over one million installed dishes, but the
proliferation of cable systems, each carrying most of the available
satellite programming, is inhibiting the growth of dish sales to the
home.

Projections For Tomorrow

The economics of cable television require density of homes and
households with disposable income. Hong Kong, Singapore and cities in
Japan, Taiwan, Korea and several other Asian countries are economically
viable cable markets, while areas with low population densities and low
incomes are not viable for modern, broadband systems. China's major
urban markets, especially Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and a
few other cities in Guangdong province contain most of China's newly-
emerging middle class population, providing sufficient concentrations
of affluent households. Urban India, comprising 30% of the total
population, includes four major metropolitan centres, each with between
five to over 10 million people and about 30 cities housing between one
to five million people. MTA-EMCI estimates that between 10% to 15% of
all urban Indian households have sufficient disposable income to be
able to afford cable and satellite television.

The market for satellite television equipment and programming
incorporates both cable operators and direct-to-home (DTH) services.
Consumer demand for DTH depends again upon disposable income levels and
also the competition provided by cable services. Cable has first-mover
advantages over DTH in both China and India, especially in the upscale
urban markets. For example, recent MTA-EMCI focus studies in New Delhi
and Bombay revealed that nearly 80% of a sampling of high net worth
households subscribed to cable.

However, despite pervasive poverty, rural areas in China and India are
also promising DTH markets. If only 2% of non-urban Chinese and Indian
homes had sufficient wealth to buy satellite equipment and programming,
the non-urban potential market for DTH would be approaching three
million homes in India and five million in China.

Broadband, hybrid fibre/co-axial (HFC) cable systems are in development
in Beijing, Shanghai and in each provincial capital, but most of these
systems are still in the planning stage, and their economic viability
is uncertain. In India, agglomeration of small cable systems is
underway in New Delhi, Bombay and a few other cities. The Indian cable
industry may evolve towards the U.S. model of multiple system operators
(MSOs), or cable may remain a fragmented, locally-owned and operated
business. Much of cable's future depends on government policy and
regulation.

Based on a combination of on-site data collection, analysis of
secondary data and demographics and consumer demand modelling of cable
and satellite television, MTA-EMCI forecasts the rapid growth of cable
and satellite in both China and India.

In China, cable and satellite homes are projected to grow from about 40
million today to over 130 million in 2005. In India, cable and
satellite homes are projected to grow from 14 million today to 53
million in 2005. Cable and satellite penetration of total households is
projected to increase from 12% to 34% in China and from 8% to 25% in
India between 1995 and 2005.

MTA-EMCI, resulting from a merger of Malarkey-Taylor Associates and
EMCI, is a leading global telecommunications consultancy, with offices
in Washington DC, London and Singapore

ASIA SATELLITES TRANSPONDER WATCH

168oE: PAS-2

CNBC Asia has now replaced ANBC on 411MHz. A transponder has been hired
by TVBI to beam programmes into northeastern Asia and Taiwan.

138oE: Apstar 1

The official inquiry on the fatal crash of a Chinese Long March 2E
rocket has now been reported. Apstar 2, the sister satellite to this
one, was due to locate at or around 77 degrees East last January, but
was apparently lost when severe cross-winds above the site damaged the
fairing - the fibre-glass cover on the nose cone which encloses the
satellite. International Telecom Japan recently started a feed of
Reuters VideoNews via this satellite as the second hop from Intelsat
704, with some additional regionally-specific feeds.

113oE Palapa B2P

Australian Television, the ABC external TV service, is in serious
difficulty. Although the signals on this satellite continue, a review
of Australian global broadcasting is imminent. CNBC is in-the-clear
until October and will use Asiasat 2 next year. MTV Asia has moved into
B-Mac encryption.

116oE: Koreasat 1

Koreasat 1, a Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 3000 satellite, is
South Korea's first domestic satellite. Launch was delayed by Hurricane
Erin and may have not achieved the correct orbit without considerable
use of the fuel reserves. The failure of a booster rocket to separate
from the Delta rocket carrying the satellite into orbit will mean a
reduced life. The additional drag created by the booster meant that the
satellite could not be delivered into its intended orbit. The launch
was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the launch vehicle was a
Macdonald-Douglas Delta 2 rocket. Delta 228 was the first major partial
failure of such a vehicle. The Hercules GEM solid booster, by failing
to separate, caused the first stage to deliver less velocity. The
second stage compensated by burning for 35 seconds longer than planned
on its first burn, which placed the rocket in parking orbit. The second
stage shut down early when fuel ran out. The third stage placed the
satellite in an orbit with an apogee of just 30,000km, which is below
the required 35,700km. A second satellite could provide back-up, it was
to have been put in a storage orbit until the capacity was required.

93.5oE: Insat 2B

After some false starts the DD3 channel has launched, with a schedule
of arts and current affairs programming. Insat 2C's launch will add
much-needed transponder capacity over Asia. If granted capacity, as
they hope, a growing number of international TV channels could beam via
Insat into the regional DTH and cable audience. The evidence of the
controversial deal between Doordarshan and CNN is being seen on Insat
2B. Doordarshan and CNNI have launched a joint 24-hour on this
satellite at 4160MHz vertical Tp. C12. Pakistan and Bangladseh already
have terrestrial arrangements with the 24-hour news channel.

85oE: Raduga

Business India TV, which has been reported on this satellite, is
gearing up for a move to Ekspress, which may herald another launch as
14 degrees West seems an unlikely location for such a geographically-
targeted channel. On the 3875MHz RHCP channel, BITV has been showing
TVI News - current affairs programmes - and TVI Prime entertainment.

NEWS OF THE WORLD

If the penny hadn't dropped before, December's announcement by Capital
Cities/ABC that it was joining the 24-hour news business in 1997
confirmed that televised news is no longer the preserve of the
traditional networks, and that in order to retain market share better
to be a rolling service than one which relies on that now rather
decrepit notion of expecting viewers to tune-in for their news at set
times during the day.

In staking its claim for a piece of the all-news market, Capital
Cities/ABC joins rival American network NBC and Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp, all of which have in their sights the superabundance of existing
24-hour news and business news channels now in service worldwide.

So why the sudden rash of interest in 24-hour news? After all,
programmers have long bemoaned that news is too expensive to produce -
especially the thrifty generalist satellite channels. This, however, is
changing. News costs might not still be in the same league as, say, a
half-hour of syndicated infotainment acquired from a US programme
distributor, but technology developments inside and outside the studio,
coupled with the changing commercial view that news can be a profit-
generator not just a cost-centre, are putting it within the reach of
the many rather then the few.

But while the entry barriers come tumbling down, for cable distribution
they still remain high, meaning carriage is more and more dependent on
strategic cable operator-programmer alliances. For example, the Time
Warner/Turner merger, combining, among others, the top two US MSOs (if
Turner shareholder TCI is included) and CNN, is a timely boost for
America's original all-news channel just as the competition is about to
hot-up. Meanwhile, in the US, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America,
Rupert Murdoch seems to be assembling the pieces which when connected
will light up a global news network. And where cable distribution
cannot be guaranteed by News Corp or even its own budding partnership
with TCI, direct-to-home will be an effective alternative source of
supply.

For the rest of the field, however, even those with financial muscle,
distribution will probably have to be sought outside of cable. Hence
the partnership between NBC and Microsoft to launch the US
broadcaster's proposed round-the-clock news service on the Internet.

While audiences for such a channel might not at first be as widespread
as, say, cable or even DTH, new technologies and changing commercial
strategies, which are rewriting the way television news is packaged for
consumption, suggest the interactive medium is a better one for the
distribution of visual news.

Bob Ross, Turner Broadcasting president, international, speaking in
Hong Kong in December, predicted that news channels of the future would
act more like radio stations than traditional TV newscasters. Instead
of airing live bulletins, news channels would simply select from a
'playlist' of recorded, but constantly-updated items, refreshing the
running order throughout the day.

If news is to be presented as such - especially business news, whose
natural audience is in the workplace - is there a better way of
distributing it than via an interactive medium which allows viewers to
double-click on the news that is relevant to their world?

HAVAS FORCES CLT TO QUIT THE DIGITAL CLUB

COMPAGNIE Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) has reportedly
withdrawn plans to launch Club RTL, its Astra-based French-language
digital direct-to-home bouquet.

In return for dropping plans to launch the package of 15 to 20
channels, which would be in direct competition to Canal Plus, the
Luxembourg-based broadcaster is reputedly set to become a 25 per cent
shareholder in Canalsatellite Numerique and to contribute several
television channels to the Canal Plus DTH bouquet.

The news followed weeks of speculation. Havas, a mutual shareholder in
CLT and pay-TV giant Canal Plus, had from the outset never been
comfortable with the idea of two competing bouquets for France and had
pushed for a union of the two projects. Havas president Pierre Dauzier
said in an interview last month that there could only be one European
bouquet, claiming "no one can beat Canal Plus."

The two companies reached an agreement to share conditional access and
digital IRDs last summer, with CLT joining the SECA alliance led by
Canal Plus and Bertelsmann to develop the Mediaguard system.

CLT had seven transponders reserved on the Astra satellites 1E, 1F and
1G. With this capacity probably about to become vacant, Europe's pay-TV
groups - most notably Canal Plus - may now be expecting an unexpected
increase to their digital Astra allocations.

KIRCH JOINS MMBG ON THE REBOUND

THE digital decoder battle in Germany between the Multimedia-
Betriebsgesellschaft (MMBG) consortium and the Kirch group took a
dramatic turn on December 1 when Deutsche Telekom confirmed it would
not be aligning itself to Kirch's digital decoder technology,
effectively forcing Kirch to join the MMBG.

While MMBG defied the sceptics by displaying its Mediabox decoder in
Cologne in November, the entire MMBG constellation was threatened by
Deutsche Telekom's hesitation on whether to break away from MMBG and
team-up with Kirch and Vebacom, Germany's second largest cable
operator.

Deutsche Telekom announced, however, that it was the MMBG's Mediabox
which offered "a very good platform for the establishment of an open
and non-discriminatory system in Germany." The PTT cable operator
criticised Kirch's failure to comply with its protocol and to provide
the necessary technical specifications - Kirch, it seems, had been
bluffing about the superiority of its d-box technology.

Now Kirch is to take an eight per cent stake in the MMBG and work on a
unified decoder system for the German market - a solution which will
allay fears of two competing decoder systems splitting the German
digital TV market and confusing the consumer.

Germany's Chancellor Kohl, a close political ally of Leo Kirch, stepped
into the digital decoder fray to ask why a French-developed decoder
system (MMBG's SECA-developed Mediabox) was to be chosen by the MMBG in
favour of a German one (Kirch's d-Box). Prompted by Kohl, Deutsche
Telekom, in its public service role, was forced to re-examine the
qualities of MMBG's Mediabox against the Kirch/Nokia-manufactured d-
box. MMBG had given Telekom until mid-December to decide on its role,
leaving the digital decoder consortium in a very precarious position.

As for Kirch, the Munich-based television company never enthused over
the idea of joining the MMBG and partaking in its "open and non-
discriminauory system," despite an offer of a 15 per cent shareholding.
Kirch preferred to fight for its position as the digital gatekeeper in
Germany with its own decoder and Irdeto conditional access system. Now
poised to join MMBG, it seems that Kirch has lost the decoder battle.

Without Telekom, the MMBG would have been in trouble - Deutsche Telekom
currently holds a 35 per cent share in the consortium and its 15
million cable connections were vital for the MMBG to succeed. Vebacom
has a further 1.1 million connections.

MMBG's recent display of its Mediabox decoder countered claims from the
Kirch camp that the consortium did not have a fully-functioning
decoder. The Franco-German consortium said it plans to start operations
in April with further members of the consortium to include oRF, SRG,
Bauer Verlag, RTL-2 and Tele Munchen. Philips is to start mass
production of the decoder this month with key components coming from
its factories in Krefeld and Hamburg. By the start of 1996, the decoder
will be available to French retailers and in Germany by April, with an
estimated qrice-tag of DM1,000-1,510 (#455!to #682).

BELGIUM'S CABLERS THREATEN BLACK-OUT

THE re-negotiation of a global agreement between Belgium's cable
operators and rights-holders on the payment of authors rights reached a
stalemate in December, with cablers threatening to cease carriage of
half of the channels currently distributed if no progress is made
before January 1.

The dispute flared-up back in September when authors' association Sabam
announced that it did not want to renew the global contract on cable
rights, concluded in 1993 between Belgian cable association RTD,
broadcasters and copyright holders (Sabam, Agicoa, Belfitel). Under the
agreement cable companies are allowed to distribute 16 channels from of
a list of 21 able to be received in Belgium via terrestrial
transmitters. Cable operators, meanwhile, pay an amount equivalent to
15 per cent of the average subscription fee (BFr539 (#12)), which is
added to subscribers' bills. Other channels wishing to be carried on
cable, such as pay-TV and satellite channels, have to pay for cable
retransmission rights themselves.

According to Sabam, any new agreement should take into account the
multiplication of channels with the advent of the digital era and
should include a clause regarding neighbouring rights (performers,'
producers' and broadcasters' rights) as provided by Belgian law from
last year. The amount paid to rights-holders should therefore be
increased, the organisation said.

Cable operators argued that, in the last 10 years, the amount paid to
rights-holders has increased by 79 per cent in-line with the increase
in the number of subscribers and of the cable subscription fee. An
increase in authors' royalties would jeopardise their profitability,
they claim, as the Wallonian government forces them to pay a special
tax of BFr150 per subscriber to support local TV stations. They also
consider this a disadvantage in comparison with the DTH industry, as
satellite equipment owners are not subject to the payment of authors'
rights.

According to RTD, the ideal solution would be for broadcasters to pay
for authors' rights themselves. If the current system is maintained,
they would like to see three new channels, M6, Sat 1 and La Cinquiame,
included in the global agreement. And if neighbouring rights have to be
taken into account, RTD claims it could only be practicable if the
amount paid to authors is reduced by an equal amount.

DEUTSCHE WELLE TO LEAD ASIA BOUQUET

A DIGITAL bouquet of between four and five European TV channels, 12
European radio stations and a data channel is to be created for the
Asia-Pacific region via the recently-launched Asiasat 2 satellite. The
package is being spearheaded by German overseas broadcaster Deutsche
Welle, whose 36MHz C-Band Asiasat 2 transponder will be home to the new
multiplex.

The transponder will be compressed using NTL's MPEG-2, DVB-compliant
digital compression system. Deutsche Welle will be using an 8MHz
digital stream and the other television channels between 6MHz and 8MHz.
However, as the new craft will not be ready for digital broadcasters
until April, the package will initially test-transmit in analogue.

Contracts have yet to be finalised and the remaining channels in the
package still to be announced, though it is expected that there will be
representation from other European countries, including Italy's Rai,
TVE of Spain and, if agreement can be reached with Star TV, MCM, the
francophone music channel.

Although some Deutsche Welle programming is already broadcast in the
Asia region via tape-delivered distribution deals with terrestrial
broadcasters such as SBS in Australia, Mongolia Television and a number
of Chinese stations, which then dub programming into their local
languages, the Asiasat service will mark the German pubcaster's first
full channel service in Asia.

Initial distribution will be to cable headends and hotels. Channel
distribution will be handled by Transtel, the distribution arm of
German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF. They in turn have agent
representation throughout the Asia region.

SNG 'RETIREMENT' PLAN FOR ASTRA 1A

SOCIETE Europeenne des Satellites (SES) is planning to use its Astra 1A
craft for satellite newsgathering (SNG) and other related services when
the satellite nears the end of its natural life. The first Astra
satellite, launched in December 1988, would be placed into inclined
orbit and moved to a second orbital slot, probably one of those applied
for by Luxembourg's government on SES's behalf.

Once in position, Astra 1A could be used for both news and sports feeds
and, said the company, backhauls of programming services to the Astra
platform at 19.2 degrees East.

According to SES, if Astra 1A has insufficient reserves of fuel it
could be placed into inclined orbit where, initially at least, it could
provide service for 23 hours-a-day.

Astra 1A has a design life of 12-and-a-half years. Although two
transponders have been shut down to prevent overheating, the remaining
14 remain in sound working order. While establishing a digital platform
at 19 degrees East, SES remains committed to providing a continuous
analogue service for existing customers and viewers.

A move for Astra 1A would be most likely post-1998, when Astra 1H will
assure back-up for the entire Astra fleet.

HBO TO DECIDE ON CINEMAX VIA APSTAR

ASIA looks set to receive its second Hollywood satellite movie channel
as HBO Asia reaches the final stages of its discussions on the
viability of a Cinemax channel launch in the region. A decision is
expected early in 1996.

HBO Asia's outgoing president Bill Hooks said there was room in the
region for a competitively-priced library-based movie channel to
compliment HBO.

The Cinemax channel would be carried as one of the five or six
compressed channels HBO Asia is planning next year for its Apstar-1
satellite transponder. At the moment, the transponder is used to
transmit a separate censor-sensitive version of the HBO movie channel
to Malaysia's Mega-TV.

HBO Asia also revealed that US equipment supplier General Instrument
was the most likely vendor of HBO's digital compression technology.
Other likely channels for the increased capacity are a channel for
India and an uncensored feed for markets which want their HBO in its
original form.

Despite being forced by the lack of infrastructure into basic channel
delivery and in spite of its above-average charges, the pan-Asian
English-language Hollywood blockbuster channel has chalked up
impressive gains in the region. Hopes were that the channel would reach
more than one million cable subscribers by the end of 1995.

At the end of 1994, HBO Asia had 600,000 subscribers. This was done at
the same time as the industry sounded the death knell for pan-Asian
programming. Although HBO has ruled out local movies on HBO Asia, the
programmer has not dismissed the possibility of local films on a second
movie channel.

NETHOLD NORDIC SETS MODEST DIGITAL AIMS

DIGITAL satellite services from Nethold and its subsidiaries FilmNet
and MultiChoice are scheduled to commence via Astra 1E in mid-January.
However, distributor MultiChoice is targeting mid-March as the date
when there will be sufficient receiver numbers in the marketplace to
meet anticipated demand.

MultiChoice Sweden is expecting a gradual build-up in supplies from
manufacturers, including Pace, Nokia, Echostar and Philips. From Day
One, few receivers are expected to be in the marketplace, but this is
expected to build within a matter of weeks. The company expects 100,000
units to be sold across Scandinavia within the first 12 months.

Prices will initially range between SKr6,000 and SKr8,000 (#600-800)
according to the model and whether or not a dish, with or without a
universal LNB, has already been installed.

MultiChoice said that the demand for receivers in South Africa, where
MultiChoice recently launched its PAS-4 DSTV package, was the main
reason why March was being sited as the optimum date for delivery of
regular supplies. However, demand in South Africa equates as much to
stock shortages as it does to the public's appetite for digital
satellite television.

Nethold's three Astra 1E transponders 1E will carry shared services
from FilmNet, SuperSport, Hallmark Entertainment Network and
independent channels for subscribers in Scandinavia and the Benelux.
These are expected to include channels distributed by MultiChoice in
the VideoCrypt II package, among them Discovery, TCC and CMT. In
addition, the subscriber management company will also make available 10
near-video-on-demand channels and an audio service expected to be
provided by Digital Music Express. A majority of the services will be
common to all markets and carry local subtitling and soundtracks.

Travel expects to start in-the-clear transmissions by March and BBC
Prime - currently available via FilmNet's Eurocrypt card - and BBC
World are believed to have been lined-up for Astra distribution.

Separate digital uplinks across Scandinavia will deliver the Nethold
services to Intelsat 601 at 27.5 degrees West. These will be received
in Hilversum, added to other services, then reuplinked to the Astra
system.

THOR 2A FILLIP FOR ONE DEGREE WEST

NORWEGIAN telco Telenor has signed a contract with Hughes Space and
Communications International to build a new, 15-transponder satellite
for the one degree West orbital position. Thor IIA, as the satellite is
to be known, is expected to be operational by spring 1997 and will
distribute both analogue and digital channels to cable networks and
private dishes throughout northern Europe and Scandinavia.

Telenor also plans to increase capacity with a further four to six
transponders in 1996 and is claiming that one degree West will become
the third largest digital satellite platform in Europe after Astra and
Eutelsat.

Telenor launched a package of open digital satellite-distributed TV
channels in Oslo in late November. The digital Nordic bouquet contains
two Danish channels - Danmark's Radio TV1 and TV2 - Norwegian state
broadcaster NRK and Swedish channels TV1 and TV2, which will eventually
be available on cable networks throughout Scandinavia.

Telenor said it hopes to be able to offer the digital channels free
within the next two years, so private households can access the digital
channels without a smart card.

It is the first time that the Danish state channels have been available
on Norwegian television - the Swedish channels have been on Norwegian
cable for some time. Besides the Nordic digital channels, Telenor
distributes 17 analogue channels to cable and DTH via Thor, Intelsat
702 and TV Sat  at one degree West.

Telenor CTV said the aim is to establish an open platform, as there is
great consensus for open conditional access in the Nordic territories.
An open standard, it said, will both maximise digital penetration and
promote the efforts of hardware manufacturers.

SKY VENTURE TO AIR GRANADA ARCHIVES

UK BROADCASTER Granada and British Sky Broadcasting have joined forces
to create a new company, Granada Sky Broadcasting, which plans to
launch eight new satellite channels late this year. The new channels
will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which will offer programming from the
extensive libraries of both Granada and LWT, including episodes of the
long-running soap Coronation Street.

The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle topics: health
and beauty, home and garden, food and wine, Granada Good Life, Granada
Men and Motoring, Granada Talk TV and Granada TV Shopping Guide.

The GSkyB package will be available as part of the Sky Multi-Channels
package, which currently offers 28 channels and programme streams at a
cost of #10.99 per month.

David Chance, deputy managing director of BSkyB, was unable to say
whether this would increase as a result of Granada's channels: "Its way
too premature to say whether we will change our retail pricing
structure at all."

The GSkyB package will probably be spread across three transponders,
possibly on Astra 1D, on which BSkyB still has spare capacity. Granada
Gold Plus will broadcast for 18-hours-a-day, while the lifestyle
channels will take the form of programme packages. Men and Motoring,
for example, will have a late evening slot following on from Granada
Gold Plus.

All seven lifestyle channels will feature predominantly new programming
produced by Granada and LWT. "This venture will open-up a whole new
avenue of custom-programme making," said Charles Allen, chief executive
of Granada Television, "enabling us to significantly expand our
programme production facilities in both London and the North West."

Granada's economic interest in the channel is 60 per cent, although its
ownership is limited to 20 per cent under current regulations. However,
Granada is hoping the government will remove the ownership restrictions
on broadcasters becoming involved in satellite channels, and thus allow
it to increase its stake in the new venture.

TCI AND CANAL PLUS IN THEMATIC UNION

TELE-COMMUNICATIONS International, Canal Plus and Generale D'Images,
the media arm of Generale des Eaux, have joined forces to form a new
cable and satellite programming company based in Paris. Each of the
three parties will hold an equal interest in the venture,
Multithematiques.

Canal Plus and Generale D'Images are contributing their combined
interests in four French thematic channels to Multithematiques -
documentary channel Planate (70 per cent), cult programming service
Canal Jimmy (85 per cent), and mini-pay movie channels Cine Cinemas and
Cine Cinefil (60 per cent each). Canal Plus has also contributed a 50
per cent share in the Spanish classic movie channel Cine Classics.

TCI, meanwhile, has agreed to contribute Fr492 million (#66 million) to
Multithematiques over the next two years to develop the thematic
channels worldwide.

Multithematiques will act as a launch pad from which to expand across
Europe, provide new services for TCI's Latin American cable and DTH
ventures and bring thematic channel concepts to TCI's Japanese cable
subscribers. TCI also anticipates co-operation between Multithematiques
and its UK division Flextech in production and channel development.

TCI president, international, Adam Singer, will serve as the first
chairman of Multithematiques, while Canal Plus executive vice-president
international Michel Thoulouze will be the company's CEO.

EUROSPORT DEFEATED IN DUTCH TEST-CASE

EUROSPORT has lost its case against KTA before the Amsterdam court and
will be dropped from the cable operator's system in the Dutch capital
from January 1. The pan-European sports programmer refused to pay the
carriage fee sought by KTA, countering that it should be the recipient
of a Gld0.20 payment. However, the court ruled that the cable operator
is entitled to seek payment from commercial channels.

An offer from KTA to include the channel in its D2 Mac/Eurocrypt
extended basic tier was rejected by Eurosport. Other channels expected
to suffer the same fate include NBC Super Channel and TNT & Cartoon
Network.

With the franco-American owned Eurosport standing to lose a large
percentage of its distribution in the Netherlands, the channel is
expected to appeal against the decision and is also lodging a complaint
of 'misuse of monopoly' with the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Meanwhile, MTV regained distribution in The Hague after a court ruled
that the local operator, Casema, had broken its agreement with the
Viacom channel when it replaced MTV with local programmer The Music
Factory. However, the judge also ruled that the city of The Hague had
to keep its promise to Music Factory and so now both music channels
will be carried.

It is likely that Music Factory's owner Arcade will now also take KTA
to the courts in order to gain access to the Amsterdam cable system.
During access negotiations, KTA demanded a fee of Gld750 for the
channel, as well as the right to insert local advertising breaks -
conditions which were rejected by Music Factory.

Relations between KTA and MultiChoice have also been showing signs of
strain of late. The Dutch Commissariaat voor de Media upheld
MultiChoice's claim to be able to use its own decoders and subscriber
management system rather than KTA's D2 Mac/Eurocrypt set-top box.

KTA's ailing pay-per-view service Teleselect is available via the same
D2 Mac decoders, and MultiChoice claimed KTA wanted to use its extended
basic services to boost penetration of Teleselect.

MSO TO BUILD NEW STOCKHOLM SYSTEM

KABELVISION, a major owner of Swedish cable systems, said it plans to
invest SKr100 million (#10 million) in a new cable network for the
centre of Stockholm. The new system will be designed to carry not only
pay-TV services and telephony, but also games, home-shopping and
Internet connections.

Kabelvision is initially planning to offer the new services to
inhabitants of!some 1,000 apartmenu dwelliogs where individual dishes
have, until now, been used to serve tenants.

Kabelvision's plans are the result of a recent decision by Stockholm's
authorities to build a high-capacity fibre-optic network for each
apartment block in the Swedish capital. Kabelvision will then connect
and develop its own services.

Construction work on the new network is due to begin this January and
Kabelvision plans to launch its services in either March or April.

Some of Kabelvision's competitors are taking a more cautious stance on
upgrading their systems, however. Singapore Telecom, the new owner of
Stockholm operator Stjarn-TV, which already has one of the country's
most advanced cable systems, recently said that  Sweden is not yet
ready for advanced wired services. According to Stjarn-TV, subscribers
in Sweden will not be willing to pay for the multimedia services that
modern cable technology can offer until the end of the century.

Kabelvision, 37 per cent owned by the Kinnevik division Netcom Systems,
United Communications Inc and Time Warner (both 20 per cent) and
Bonnier (13.5 per cent), has around 500,000 households connected, or 20
per cent of the Swedish market.

OFT BEGINS BSKYB PROBE

The Office of Fair Trading has launched a six-month review of British
Sky Broadcasting's position in the UK's pay-television market. The
review follows months of complaints by cable operators, including
CableTel, Videotron and General Cable, which last year asked Trade and
Industry secretary Ian Lang to refer BSkyB to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The cable operators' chief concern is BSkyB's
practice of bundling channels, claiming that the satellite broadcaster
overcharges them to keep cable rates high and boost Sky's direct-to-
home service.

The OFT's review will be confined to issues relating to the supply in
the UK of programme channels to cable operators. It will also include
the informal undertakings given by BSkyB in March last year.

Once the six-month review is completed, the OFT will decide whether
further action under the competition legislation is appropriate.

In a statement issued in December, BSkyB accused some cable operators
of "using the regulatory process to further their businesses rather
than on building their networks and serving their customers."

SKY NETS MORE SOCCER

In a #125 million deal which left its terrestrial competitors standing,
BSkyB scooped the rights to England's Endsleigh Football League
championship and Football League (Coca Cola) Cup for five years from
the start of the 1996/97 season.

Under the agreement, Sky has exclusive rights to show up to 60 live
matches per season featuring clubs from all three divisions of the
Endsleigh League. Sky will also provide the first ever coverage of all
three end-of-season promotion play-offs from Wembley, and will show at
least one live tie from each round of the League Cup, plus the final.

Most of the live matches will be screened by the satellite pay-TV
broadcaster on Fridays and Sundays. Sky Sports indicated it was still
too soon to say how the coverage would fit into the existing schedule.

Sky already holds exclusive rights to FA Premiership football (60
matches per season) under its #300 million, five-year deal which
expires at the end of the 1996/7 season. It also has long-term
commitments to broadcast live FA Cup ties and replays, and every
England international from Wembley, plus live rights to Scotland's
three premier tournaments.

Sky broadcast 143 live matches in the 1994/5 season.

SUPERSPORT LAUNCHES

SuperSport, Nethold's new sports channel for the Nordic countries,
launched earlier than expected on December 1. Without any show of
publicity, the channel was offered to FilmNet's subscribers as "an
early Christmas present," according to one company representative.

But the new sesvice was not immediately available to all FilmNet
subscribers. December and January are seen by Nethold as an
'introductory period' when the contents of SuperSport will be tried
out.

The channel will also not be immediately available to all Nordic cable
operators. Negotiations with the region's cable companies are not yet
all in place - most cable systems are already crammed and the
introduction of a new channel means that an existing service has to be
dropped, or else moved to a less attractive slot.

FilmNet's DTH subscribers will have to wait until the end of this month
or the beginning of February before the launch of SuperSport proper.

Programme rights already secured for the new service include American
NHL ice hockey, the Italian Football Cup and German Bundesliga soccer.
Among the tennis rights acquired are the Compaq Grand Slam and the
Hopman tournament.

National events of particular interest to Nordic audiences are also
high on the channel's agenda.

US TRIO BACK IBERIA CABLE

Capital Cities/ABC, United International Holdings (UIH), the Latin
American Urbina group and Spanish cable company Multitel have joined
forces to exploit cable television in Spain and Portugal.

The new alliance has acquired the entire shareholdings of Spanish cable
company TPS, set up by the Urbina group, which distributes the Spanish-
language channels Canal Hollywood, Panda Club, Tele 1 and Discovery
Channel to cable operators.

A new company has been set-up by the four partners in the venture, with
Capital Cities/ABC, UIH and Urbina each holding 30 per cent and
Multitel 10 per cent. The group will initially invest Ptas4,000 million
(#21 million) within a period of three years and distribute the package
of four channems for no more than Qtas600.

The offer will initially consist of film channel Canal Hollywood,
children's channel Panda Club (with programming mainly supplied by
DIC), documentary channel Discovery and Spanish/Latin music channel HIT
TV. A fifth channel will be launched in the next five to six months.

The channels will be broadcast  in Spanish and in their original
versions, with subtitles for the Portuguese market.

NEWS RACE HOTS UP

Capital Cities/ABC Inc is to launch its long -planned 24-hour news
network in 1997, according to president Robert Eiger. ABC already
gathers more news than it can use on its ABC network so the costs would
be relatively low and help spread the news division's expenses. ABC's
200 plus affiliated stations are expected to provide more local news
than CNN which has previously had the all-news field largely to itself.

But in addition to the Capital Cities/ABC venture, General Electric-
owned NBC also announced plans for a 24-hour all-news network for early
1996, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is also planning to start an all-
news channel.

A problem for the new channels is expected to be gaining distribution,
with several new channels battling for space in the crowded US cable
market. When the cable companies go fully digital, this problem will be
alleviated, but in the interim, ABC is also looking at other
distribution methods, such as using telco distribution now being
created in the US, and direct broadcast satellites.

EC IN QUOTA COMPROMISE

The battle against  European programme quotas looks set to continue as
a meeting late in November by EU culture ministers to revise the
Television Without Frontiers directive ended with little change to the
original. The contradictions have been kept in the new 'revised'
proposal, while salt has been rubbed into the quota wound with the news
that the quota system will no longer be phased out after 10 years, but
reviewed after five years.

EU culture ministers reached what they called "a political compromise,"
voting to keep the controversial phrasing of clauses Four and Five of
the original directive to maintain quotas "where practicable and by
appropriate means." The proposed change in the Presidency text to "by
appropriate means" was not taken on. This will allow the UK to maintain
its loose interpretation of the phrasing, but will anger the French,
who had hoped to see a tougher stance on quotas and the "where
practicable" phrase written out.

The new five-year review will please the French, but not member states
such as Germany and the UK, who were hoping to see the quota system
scrapped altogether.

A new article has been added to the directive (article Z), whereby a
committee will be set-up acting alongside the EC to monitor the
implementation of the directive.

THE OTHER RUPERT

In a rare interview, diamonds-to-tobacco tycoon Johann Rupert explains
what lured him into pay-TV, and reveals his hopes and fears for the
digital future. Piero Muscaro and Eleonora Zamparutti ask the questions

Although he made his fortune in tobacco and luxury goods, today the
name of Johann Rupert is synonymous with pay-television. Richemont is
the maker of world-wide brand names like Cartier, Dunhill, Rothmans,
Piaget, Baume & Mercier, Montblanc, Karl Lagerfeld, Chloe and a few
others. With a total turnover of #3.8 billion in 1995 and net profits
of #690 million, Richemont is also one of the largest groups in the
world's pay-television industry through Nethold Corporation, a 50-50
joint venture with the South African public company MIH (MultiChoice
Investment Holding).

Nethold operates in 13 countries in the European pay-television sector,
where it has a total of 2.5 million subscribers. It is present in
northern and eastern Europe as well as in the Benelux with the
MultiChoice-FilmNet group and in the Middle East and Africa with the
South African pay service M-Net.

In 1995, the company booked 24 transponders on the Astra, Eutelsat and
PanAmSat satellites. It has also recently entered the Italian
television market through the acquisition of 32.5 per cent  of Telepiu,
the country's sole pay-TV operator, and 5.5 per cent of Mediaset, the
media holding of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group comprised, among
other interests, Canale 5, Italia 1 and Rete 4, 25 per cent of Spain's
Tele Cinco and 24.5 per cent of the sports channel DSF in Germany.

From the calm shores of Lake Zug, a few miles from Zurich, Switzerland,
Rupert, the managing director and owner of the Richemont Group, plots
the map of the world's pay-television industry.

Cable and Satellite Europe: What were the reasons behind your decision
to diversify Richemont from its tobacco and luxury goods activities
into the pay-television sector?

Johann Rupert: Towards the end of the eighties we set in train a
profound restructuring plan of the group. It was clear since the very
beginning that our core activities, the tobacco and the luxury goods
business, had one point in common: a great cashflow. This is the reason
why we started seeking an alternative diversification for our
investments. At that time, our now partners of M-Net, who operated in
South Africa in the pay-TV business, offered us a chance to enter this
business. After a deep analysis we realised a few things: firstly, pay-
television companies are generally cashflow negative at the end of the
first two years of activities; secondly, in order to reach breakeven
point they need at least five or six years, though over this time they
create added value and also an interesting distribution network.

Beyond the necessities of diversification there are evident synergies
to be made between the pay-television business, the luxury goods and
the tobacco industry: in all three cases Richemont operates in the
field of intellectual properties and, in particular, trademarks.

C&SEu: Apart from the obvious economic and financial synergy between
the three main sectors in which you operate, is there any other reason
that pushed you to enter the television business?

JR: In order to make a good business you have to project yourself 20
years ahead of your time, and try to imagine what people will want by
that time. Then you have to try to retrace that path backward. And when
I look at today's consumer trends and the behaviour of the younger
generations, I am convinced that the future will be based on
information and that consumption will be tightly linked to
entertainment in its widest sense. All economic choices, strategies and
analyses are subject to today's ever faster pace of our daily living
and must be constantly revised and adjusted. We cannot afford any
longer to stand still on a leading market position, because today,
everything can change suddenly.

C&SEu: What criteria did you use to invest in the pay-TV business?

JR: It is very important to be the first entrants in a new market,
especially when the sector is economically virgin. In reality, you do
not buy market shares, you buy market opportunities. Geographical
diversification is an objective linked to the single opportunities
generated by the different markets. That is what happened in the
Netherlands when Esselte decided to sell FilmNet. Recently, in Italy,
we bought 5.5 per cent of Mediaset, Berlusconi's commercial television
network, and a 32.5 per cent share of Telepiu. Mediaset has since
reduced its overall debts and it now has a considerable cashflow.
Telepiu represents a starting point for digital television: in Italy
there is no cable television and satellite television is not thoroughly
developed - there's around 500,000 satellite dishes. Nethold, through
its conditional access developed by the subsidiary Irdeto, together
with the Kirch group, has created an open door on this new market.

C&SEu: What is your relationship with Berlusconi? Some say you actually
entered Mediaset to do Berlusconi a favour in exchange for a sort of
'insurance' in order to guarantee a return on your investment in case
things went wrong....

JR: This is pure science-fiction. Nobody did any favour to Berlusconi.
In fact, we entered Mediaset once Berlusconi was already into politics.
Besides, I only know Berlusconi as a businessman, since I must have met
him four times altogether. Make it clear: Richemont is a public company
that obeys the London Stock Exchange rules and all our activities are
transparent.  According to my opinion, the Number One rule in business
is that any partnership and business decision I take should make the
cover of the world's press.

C&SEu: Nethold operates in many European countries. Do you think that
in the future it will be possible to offer a sole pay-elevision package
common to all the different territories?

JR: I believe we could define Richemont as a multi-domestic company
rather than a multi-national company. You can think globally, though
you have to operate in different countries taking into proper account
the national specifics. In Europe, we need to have companies with good
local market knowledge and also alliances with different countries we
operate in. In the pay-television business, for instance, we can
operate at European level as far as the technologies are concerned, or
in the so called subscriber management system, and in programme
acquisition.

C&SEu: With digital technology in Europe and in the rest of the world,
there has been a proliferation of partnerships between the big
multimedia groups in order to acquire key positions in tomorrow's
television market....

JR: Now that we have developed our technology of conditional access in
digital television, we are finding a great deal of possibilities in
many countries. Different media groups have approached us, thanks to
the decoder, in order to create partnerships aimed at the further
development of the new technologies. Not only in Europe and the Middle
East, but also in Thailand and in Australia, where Murdoch's digital
television project will use our technology.

C&SEu: Talking of the Middle East: what brought you to the partnership
between MultiChoice and ART, the media group owned by Saudi Sheikh
Saleh Kamel, for the distribution of the Arab-language television
package?

JR: In the case of the Middle East it has been a long-term investment
plan. Countries like Egypt, for instance, are key markets. The
partnership between MultiChoice and ART follows the mainstream of the
multi-domestic company we mentioned earlier. Also in this case our
companies brought in their technological know-how and the SMS, while
ART, which has a great experience in broadcasting, will take care of
the programme package. We expect to see the first results in five years
time. For  Nethold it is a matter of being ahead of the competition in
a critical expansion area at relatively low cost, since we can optimise
our economies of scale. After all, as pioneers in this particular
market we will be able to extend our operations in marginal, yet
interesting sectors of the industry, such as education, a key problem
in some remote regions of the Earth.

C&SEu: Digital television - in Europe and in Africa you have been the
first to introduce DSTV (Digital Satellite Television). How will
television users change in their consumption habits?

JR: In the US DirecTv offers to its subscribers 150 digital channels
via satellite. What is interesting to observe is that with such a
variety of choice it is clear that consumers will approach the media
differently. For instance, the navigation system is based on menus
classifying the content in specific categories: cinema, sport, art,
music, and so on. Then, through the use of the remote control one can
select an item, sport for instance, and other sub-menus will appear
allowing more detailed choices, a game of golf or whatever. There would
then be five or more tournaments to choose from.

Such changes in the architecture of choice will make irrelevant what
particular network one is watching. Tomorrow we will not be able to
tell whether we are watching NBC or CBS, or at least this could be one
of the possible outcomes.

C&SEu: A true war on digital television standards is being fought in
Europe and in the rest of the world: on the one hand, Nethold and Kirch
with the Irdeto decoder, and on the other Bertelsmann-Canal Plus-CLT,
and also Murdoch's News Datacom....

JR: One of the few things I am certain of in life is that in economics
as well as in politics or in any other sector, if you want to get
everything, you will end up losing everything. This rule may also be
applied in the digital technology sector. I am certain Nethold will be
able to further develop its present market position in Europe as in the
rest of the world, but it will never be able to be the sole service
provider.

C&SEu: Canal Plus and BSkyB both have strong national identities and
company policies. BSkyB is addressed to the UK where it has 4.2 million
subscribers, whereas Canal Plus has also extended its interests outside
France, though its core activity lies within the French boundaries with
its four million subscribers. Nethold, instead, operates in different
countries none of which represents its main market....

JR: The geographical diversification of our activities can be both a
strength and a weakness. Being focused on one particular local market,
as in the case of Canal Plus and BSkyB, allows you to have an enormous
cashflow. Concentrating all efforts on one market can also mean
employing heavy structures and hence having a less flexible
organisation, which in the medium-term could be a disadvantage for the
company itself. As Nethold we grew in the opposite direction, in the
sense that we had to develop a multi-domestic managerial know-how and
at the same time we had to learn how to deal with different currencies,
in different countries with different programmes in different
languages. We had to create a new distribution network which now finds
its strengths in the conditional access which we first developed in
Europe.

C&SEu: Digital television will bring profound changes, above all from
the industrial-economic viewpoint...

JR: When looking at the present structure of the world industrial
economy, one simple yet efficient consideration comes to my mind: if
you don't eat your breakfast, someone else will eat it. This means that
you must re-engineer your own business before somebody else does it.
And this can only be done through continuous innovation which is
destroying your own business by building a new business.

C&SEu: Which will then be the technological trend in the television
industry?

JR: Here the question is, will present TV operators be able to convert
analogue TV into digital TV without jeopardising their present
subscription status? One of the key elements of the conversion is the
software, which is the television programmes, the movies and all the
products offered to the viewers. Consumers' attitude towards technology
can be more or less active, what is important here is what is offered
with the technology. That is the reason why I am convinced that in
Europe there will be big winners and big losers. All markets will
experience a shake-up of some sort, this includes us as well as Canal
Plus and BSkyB. The real question is whether pay-TV operators will be
able to convert their subscribers from analogue to digital before
someone else does it. I fear that in Great Britain, for instance, there
will be great battles in order to get the Premier League rights. It
would be very strange if big media groups such as Pearson, Carlton TV,
the BBC and British Telecom itself, allowed Murdoch to dominate the
technological revolution for the British market. This would be a choice
of non-innovation. I am not saying that Britain will experience a
technological standards fight, though I reckon there will be common
partnerships, perhaps with Murdoch himself for the joint control of the
digital television industry.

C&SEu: As far as the software is concerned, one of the key questions is
the management of television programme archives....

JR: This is an issue that involves all major public TV operators in
Europe mainly due to their longer histories when compared with  the
commercial operators. For example, does the BBC - which has one of the
most extraordinary television, film and documentary archives in the
world - own the rights for digital television exploitation? I don't
think so, and I think nobody owns them today. 20 years ago, nobody even
dreamt of digital television. Hence all rights were acquired for
terrestrial broadcasting, or even cable or satellite. Certainly not for
digital.

C&SEu: What will then be the role of European public television in the
digital era?

JR: There will be synergies between pay-TV and public broadcasters,
particularly if we manage to clear the TV property rights matter
earlier mentioned. In sport events, for instance, there will most
certainly be co-operation between public broadcasters and pay-
television. In England, it will never be possible to broadcast the
Wimbledon tennis tournament in encrypted form, or just imagine what
could have happened in Italy if we had encrypted with Telepiu the '96
World Cup final, Italy versus Brazil - the government would have
probably been dismissed. Nethold has a very strong traditional
relationship with public broadcasters in Holland, Egypt and Greece.

C&SEu: What will then become the position of the big US operators in
Europe?

JR: I think operators will opt for the development of thematic channels
to be inserted into programme packages offered to viewers, and at the
same time participate with stakes in the SMS. It is necessary to offer
great premium programme packages. Take any Hollywood studio as an
example, none of them is capable of filling five movie channels with
their own productions.

C&SEu: The relationship between pay TV distributors and TV software
producers remains a key issue world-wide. It seems that you are
envisaging a clear separation between SMS and TV channels...

JR: The separation between SMS and television channels is a management
choice which we have already applied to the markets we operate in. Take
M-Net, for instance, which manages the programme offer in South Africa.
When a TV network wants to be distributed in the pan-African satellite
package, it can buy shares of MultiChoice at the same conditions as M-
Net and participate accordingly to the management of the company. In
this way, we can guarantee equal treatment to all shareholders.
Specifically to MultiChoice, it only directly owns four channels out of
the 20 presently distributed.

C&SEu: Could Nethold have a real interest in producing films, as Canal
Plus has with Le Studio Canal Plus?

JR: Software control is certainly one of the key issues in the
transition from analogue to digital. The point is that a single movie
channel airs at least 400 films a year, which means that even if we
bought a

Hollywood major we could cover 10-15 per cent at the maximum of our
product needs and at the same time the same Hollywood major would have
reduced benefits being part of the same company. I am sure that the so
called chain distribution system will collapse in the next 20 years.
Today, a film follows this kind of distribution pattern: first the
theatrical release, then the pay-per-view rights sale, then home video
distribution, pay-television rights, and last, the generic channels.
Now, let's say that in 20 years time in Europe there will be 20 million
households with pay-per-view access. This could guarantee an extremely
important film purchase potential, then perhaps the pay-per-view
providers will produce films for their own distribution networks.

C&SEu: In fact, such integration makes front page news in the US on
almost a daily basis...

JR: Yes, but have you ever heard of any of these multimedia companies
paying cash? I don't think so. It is only a matter of paper exchanges,
just contracts, never real money. Sometimes I doubt that any of these
mergers and acquisitions would have really taken place if real money
was involved. Do you know what $20 billion looks like on a table? Such
financial transactions can only work with share swaps, which is also
the best way to reduce risks.

C&SEu: As in the case of the latest merger between Turner and Time
Warner...

JR: There is always a good reason behind any operation. A very
important and very rich American businessman once told me: 'Johann, how
would you define a successful acquisition? It has to do with a company
easy to buy, hard to sell, and impossible to manage!'

C&SEu: What about Germany which represents the most developed
television market in Europe? Are things going to be even harder?

JR: Germany will perhaps be one of the most important tests of the
conversion path from analogue to digital television as far as Europe is
concerned. In fact, this is the only country where two conditional
access system exist, that is, the d-Box developed by Nethold and Leo
Kirch, and the SECA consortium of Bertelsmann, Canal Plus and CLT.
Today, Germany represents the biggest cable and satellite market in
Europe with over 30 million homes connected, though it is a congested
market. If you wanted to launch a new TV channel in Germany, you
firstly have to buy a transponder on the Astra satellites, which is not
easy since they have all been booked out several years in advance.
Secondly, you will need to sign a distribution agreement with a German
cable operator, an even more complex matter since all cable operators
in Germany have already reached maximum capacity. Now it is obvious
that with the new digital technology, these problems can be solved
since the new system through digital compression will be able to carry
from four to eight channels in digital, per transponder.

As far as we are concerned, Irdeto and Kirch have developed the only
and best set-top box available in the market. We are already producing
it industrially, and will be ready soon - in a matter of days - to
distribute our set-top box to the public. It should be  sufficient to
know that Nethold ordered 1.1 million set-top boxes and Leo Kirch
ordered another million.

C&SEu: Recently in France, TF1 and France Television announced an
agreement for the development of digital television. Several observers
consider the SECA consortium as the key issue for the further
development of digital technology in this country. Do you think the
Bertelsmann-Canal Plus-CLT alliance could come to an end?

JR: Ca depend!  I don't really know, though what I can say is that
there will be new entrants in the market and there will be more
partnerships with new companies. As far as the SECA consortium is
concerned, I don't think CLT, whatever situation they are experiencing,
would break the Bertelsmann-Canal Plus agreement.  These are serious
companies and do normally respect all agreements. We are aware of CLT's
difficult position within the consortium. If Havas will come back on
its decision - a remote possibility - CLT would be an extremely
interesting company but perhaps too big for anybody to take into
consideration, even Murdoch.

C&SEu: What are your relations with Mr Murdoch?

JR: Let's say I have great respect for Mr Murdoch. We have never been
in his way!

C&SEu: In conclusion, how will the digital war end?

JR: Has it ever occurred to you while watching a football match on
television that a friend asked you, who is going to win? I normally
answer: 'Well, that is exactly why we are watching the match!' We
cannot be 100 per cent sure of who is going to win or lose. Even in
digital television, with new standards, new conditional access systems.
I frankly do not know who is going to win, the same way as I am sure
that everybody in the business does not have a clue. Everyone bets on
their own horse. We are certain to own an outsider, the best. Though,
there is always a risk that tomorrow Pierre Lescure, Rupert Murdoch and
I will wake-up and read in the press that a big telecommunications
company has invented a new digital standard, hence upsetting all the
plans of companies like us that today are struggling in this dogfight.

C&SEu: What would you do first thing that morning?

JR: I think I would light-up a good cigarette!

CABLE AND SATELLITE EUROPE via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

IN LIVING COLOUR

Two years on, BETI, the first international outpost of US cable
phenomenon Black Entertainment Television, is ready to fly as a fully-
fledged cable service with an appeal which should be sweet music to UK
MSOs. Bill Hicks reports

Lawrence Nugent, co-founder and managing director, operations for the
UK's first black cable television channel, Black Entertainment
Television International (BETI), pens a neat graphic to demonstrate the
position his channel has reached after two years in the market: it's a
large boulder, which has been pushed nine tenths of the way up the
slope of a very steep mountain. "One more little push, we're there. You
won't be able to stop us."

The 'little push' for the service which began in London two years ago
as Identity Television, but which took the name of its US backer, part-
owner and chief programme supplier BET earlier this year, comes early
in 1996 when the channel boards the Orion 1 satellite, making its
signal available to cable operators across the UK and (in theory) the
rest of Europe as part of Orion's growing bundle of digitally-
compressed cable channels.

The roll-out won't come a moment too soon for would-be viewers outside
London who currently go to the lengths of getting their metropolitan
friends to record the hugely popular shows and mail them the cassettes
- adding new meaning to the phrase 'tape-delivered cable channel.'

Ironically, though - having just taken on the BETI name - the channel
is also about to market itself as 'Television In Colour' with the clear
aim of building on its strong, and always deliberate, crossover appeal
to audiences of all races.

The service now available in 262,000 UK cable homes - all in the London
area - launched in mid-1993 as Identity TV. The channel was created by
three black media professionals, Lawrence Nugent, Petra Bernard (ex-BBC
and Warners, now BETI's managing director, corporate affairs) and
Philip Ismay, all of whom had been thinking along the lines of a TV
channel made by, and for, British Afro-Caribbeans.

"We knew there was a huge gap in the market for black-oriented
programmes," comments Bernard, "and cable appeared to be the ideal
medium for us. It was young, its intentions mirrored our intentions."
Cable in the UK was, and remains, chiefly an urban medium, and most of
the UK's two million-plus Afro-Caribbeans live in the main urban
centres, though from the start the aim was wider.

The idea was to launch a channel which would primarily serve Britain's
black communities, but which would be marketed as an "urban
contemporary" service having strong crossover appeal  beyond the Afro-
Caribbean core audience. In that sense it would not be an 'ethnic'
channel in the way of some of the Asian and other minority-language
services, but a specialist channel: "Yes, we're a niche channel, and
our niche is entertainment," says Bernard.

Identity short-circuited the process of finding backers by going
straight to the original and most successful black channel of all,
Black Entertainment Television of Washington DC. With over 42 million
US subscribers, revenues of $115 million (#76 million), net income of
around $20 million in 1994/5 and a hard-won reputation for excellence
in everything it touches, BET occupies a unique position both in the
cable industry, and as an exemplary African-American business success
story.

"We contacted BET, we got access to the president, Bob Johnson, on
conference lines, and we transacted the whole thing over the
telephone... it was, well you can imagine...," says Bernard.

The chance to participate in a European-based cable channel came at a
good moment for BET, which since its launch in January 1980, had built
up its subscriber base to well over 30 million homes across the US and
(from 1992) Canada. On the way, BET had made history by becoming the
first black-owned company to launch itself on the New York Stock
Exchange (in November 1991); it had become a major, award-winning
programme producer and had already diversified into magazine publishing
(with YSB, Young Sisters and Brothers and Emerge), media sales and
merchandising through BET Direct. It had just picked up a 'Hot Growth'
accolade in Business Week's 100 best Small Corporations awards, and was
more than ripe for international expansion.

With BET behind it, Identity was able to approach the UK cable industry
with renewed confidence. "First we went to the cable operators, and we
were fortunate in that the London Interconnect had just become fully
fledged," Bernard says. "We forged an agreement with the Interconnect
MSOs - though we still needed individual agreements with each operator
- and secured London distribution at a stroke, all except Cable London
and Nynex. We got onto Cable London two months later - and with Nynex,
well we're still in talks."

Identity launched itself in style, rapidly building a loyal following
with a mix of programming from BET, supplemented by series from
Caribbean broadcasters and (increasingly) from its own facilities near
Ladbroke Grove (an area of West London fast becoming an alternative to
Soho's media ghetto) and UK-based independent black producers.

The six-hour schedule - rotated twice to form an 18-hour block from
12.00-06.00 - majored then and now on music, which accounts, according
to Bernard, for 42 per cent of programming: "It won't go any higher
than that," she adds - but nor is likely to get much less, since music
is right at the heart of the BET experience, both in the US and
internationally.

According to BETI affiliate sales and marketing manager Alex Jackman,
the music shows - Video Soul, Rap City, Video Vibrations, Video Mania
(the UK scene, produced in-house), Caribbean Rhythms - are becoming
required viewing for UK aficionados: "Video Soul and Video Vibes in
particular are bang up to date, up to the second on the USA scene, you
won't find anything more current. We're actually breaking black artists
in the UK, introducing names not heard here before," says Jackman.

The other major ingredients of Identity's mix were sports, cultural and
educational programmes, comedy and magazine/discussion shows, all of
which are still represented, though since June 1995, there has, in
Bernard's words, been "a clean sweep of the schedule."

That was the point at which the channel re-launched itself as BETI, and
although there was no change in the US partners' shareholding ("We
remain effectively 50:50 BET and Identity," says Lawrence Nugent),
BET's production styles became the measure for the rest of the output.
"We carried three hours a day from BET from the start, so our viewers
were already familiar with the look," she says. "Our job then was to
make everything else come into sync."

Change always has its price, and BETI has had to placate many loyal
Identity viewers who didn't like the fact that a few of their favourite
series disappeared because they didn't make the quality threshold. This
particularly affected some of the Caribbean-produced shows: "The
quantity was there, but the quality was sometimes tenuous," Bernard
says. "We now insist our suppliers maintain a Beta standard." Several
non-BET series have survived, including the popular, newsy regional
magazine show Caribscope, and the Nigerian soap Checkmate, set in the
Lagos business world.

Unlike its US partner, BETI does not have its own news bulletins,
though it provides regular coverage of "core community events, such as
sports, and the Notting Hill Carnival" in the occasional UK Profile
series.

Since the name change, the religious output has also increased,
reflecting the strong Christian philosophy of the US channel, and its
close links with some of the best known evangelical broadcasters in the
US, including Morris Cerullo. On Sunday mornings, for example, the six
hours of 'downtime' are devoted to the Christian ministries: "This is a
very, very strong element in our service," Bernard says, "and the
audience is very receptive. Someone like Morris Cerullo, one of the
biggest names, his audience is our audience."

On other days this six-hour slot is given over to a "special audio
service" - currently a relay of the London black music station, Choice
FM, though as Nugent remarks, "In the long term we would be looking to
create our own audio service." Ultimately, Nugent  adds,  he intends to
develop multimedia services: "There are ways of going interactive which
do not depend on the cable operators upgrading," he says, "though it
will depend on our having a live studio environment." Expansion of the
BETI production facilities,  probably involving a move from its smart
but limited offices in a converted warehouse, is high on the list of
priorities.

Bernard is also looking forward to adding services: "I'd definitely
like more channels, maybe one with a European slant, and I'd like the
channel to get more heavily involved in its own production," she says.
"We already get more approaches than we can handle in the production
area, people are coming to us with million-dollar ideas."

In Washington, BET is planning to launch its long-awaited BET On Jazz:
The Cable Jazz Channel in America this month, but although the service
will go to Africa (see accompanying story) there are no hard plans as
yet to bring it to the UK. The big priority for the London team is to
build its UK audience, with Bernard admitting that "I had hoped the
national picture would come sooner, but it is happening for us now."

As Nugent points out, however, it has taken the full two years to get
the message across to MSOs: "The biggest problem we had in the old days
was that we were deemed to be black entertainment for black
subscribers, so we had to go through the phase of changing their
perceptions. Of course they wanted a channel for their black customers,
but we weren't too comfortable with the idea that we were just for
them, it could alienate other viewers and subscribers."

"When we were IDTV, many operators were confused about us," confirms
Jackman. "They knew about BET in the US, but were confused about the
level of their involvement. They still liked us - they used to say,
'well we prefer you to the foreign channels'!"

Hence the name-change, hence the need for re-educating the industry and
the public, hence the 'Television In Colour' marketing push that broke
in December with billboard, radio and press advertising highlighting
BETI's strengths in sports, music and religious programming. "In the
US, they've achieved high penetration by being good programme-
providers, and we're hoping to emulate that."

The modest target is to "reach 900,000 homes by the end of 1996, and to
get over the million mark very soon after." The stated aim is to reach
4.5 million UK homes by the end of the decade, but to do so by
remaining cable-exclusive. The decision to take digital capacity on
Orion, Jackman stresses, is not a step on the road to going DTH: "All
along we have had a policy of linking ourselves to the success of
cable, and to growing as cable grows. They need us, they need cable-
exclusive original programming, and that's what we are."

BETI UK's total loyalty to cable is not shared by its US godparent: in
September this year, BET joined DirecTv's 'Total Choice' DBS package,
its first move into direct-to-home distribution. And now it is about to
use digital DTH to take its jazz service to southern Africa.

So had BETI never been tempted by BSkyB's Multi-Channels DTH bandwagon,
which would effectively get it into another three million homes at a
stroke? Obviously the potential had been weighed up, but to date the
advantages of staying cable-exclusive, basic tier had outweighed the
lure of the VideoCrypt club. On the other hand, as Bernard notes, "If
the question ever arises, we'd give it due consideration."

National coverage will also raise BETI's attractiveness to advertisers.
It has already attracted an impressive roster on the basis of its
London distribution, encompassing major brands - BT, Mercury, Levis,
Volkswagen, EMI, Cellnet - as well as a host of advertisers from the
black business sector, ranging from travel services, record labels,
hair and beauty products, food and drink specialist suppliers.
Sponsorship is also becoming a useful add-on revenue source, with Carib
Beer, for example, putting its name to BETI's in-house music show for
clubbers, C-lector; and Jamaican building society, Victoria Mutual
Finance, sponsoring the latest six-parter, Sarge In Charge.

At some point, BETI is expected to embark on its European roll-out,
made possible by the Orion feed. "Yes, Europe's in the master plan,"
Bernard says. "At the recent ECC show, we had lots of enquires from
European operators - interest is very strong, even in eastern Europe."

Capacity on cable systems is an even greater problem in parts of Europe
than in the UK, but it's one which Bernard believes is not insuperable
in either case: "They had no problem in the UK satisfying Disney, so
obviously there are ways around the problem."

BET TAKES JAZZ TO AFRICA

BET's 24-hour jazz channel, BET On Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel, is to
join MultiChoice's South African DTH package, DSTV, on April 1, just
three months after the channel launches on cable networks in the US.

The service, first mooted in 1993 and understood to be costing $20-30
million (#13-20 million) to launch, will be the world's first channel
dedicated to jazz, will be offered alongside DSTV's existing 18
channels at no extra cost, and will be marketed in South Africa,
Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique and Botswana. Both
the channel and the MultiChoice deal are breakthroughs for BET, which,
with 43.4 million cable subscribers in North America (at November
1995), and with its domestic business already well diversified into
related media and marketing activities, is now firmly looking to
international markets for expansion. "This is a very big move for us,"
BET International vice president George Amoah comments. "Although we've
been supplying programming to African broadcasters for the last year-
and-a-half on a syndicated basis, this is the first time we've launched
there in such a big way."

BETI supplied Bop-TV with an eight-hour daily block of (chiefly
educational) programming which was distributed across African and the
Middle East from a C-Band Intelsat transponder, and now supplies
similar programming to SABC's NNTV, as well as to affiliates in Kenya
and Nigeria the Caribbean, and even to Poland.

"Our plans call for global expansion," he adds, "and we're going into
it aggressively... our initial focus is Europe and southern Africa."

As in the US, where BET has developed a range of complementary
businesses, BETI intends to develop similar opportunities for programme-
related merchandise in South Africa, by building up relationships with
local business.

While Amoah indicated that BETI was eager to bring the jazz channel to
the UK and the rest of Europe, how it will do so - whether as a
complement to the London-based BETI cable-exclusive service using
additional digital capacity on Orion, or as a member of one or more of
the evolving national digital DTH packages - was not yet decided.

What is clear is that the promised mix of live concerts, classic
performances, jazz movies and documentaries will find big ready-made
audiences across Europe and Scandinavia, whichever option is chosen.

TRANS-SIBERIAN AWAKENING

Eutelsat's energetic courting of the Russians is beginning to pay
dividends, with Hot Bird thawing a long-frozen DTH industry, and plans
for the new SESAT satellites well advanced. Chris Dziadul reports from
Moscow

Eutelsat has played a key role in integrating the Russian Federation
into the global satellite industry, both by granting it full membership
status and greatly improving coverage of the country by its satellites.

The process arguably began in 1990 when the organisation decided to
modify two of its Eutelsat II series satellites in order to extend
their coverage to the Urals and Caucasus. Although one was subsequently
lost following the failure of Ariane V63 in early 1994, coverage had by
that time been extended to mid-Siberia and three former Soviet Central
Asian republics by relocating Eutelsat l F1 to 48 degrees East.
Membership followed later in the year in a process that took only three
months instead of the usual eight, thereby indicating how much value
Eutelsat placed on the Russian Federation's future input into the
organisation.

The results to date have undoubtedly been fruitful for both sides. In
Eutelsat's case, it has been able to draw on the country's vast
experience in the satellite industry to order a whole generation of new
telecommunications satellites, while for the Russian Federation
benefits of contacts with - and finally membership of - Eutelsat have
included use of the Satellite Multiservices System (SMS) for Vsat
networks and - since the middle of 1995 - being linked up to the
organisation's international trunk telephony network via an earth
station in Moscow.

Furthermore, in the field of satellite television broadcasting - which
currently accounts for 75 per cent of Eutelsat's income - the launch of
Hot Bird 1 has made viewing of European channels possible in Moscow
with 90cm dishes (rising to 1.2-metres nearer the Urals). At the same
time, Russian broadcasters have been given the opportunity to transmit
their programming using Eutelsat's network far beyond the country's
borders.

Although this has so far only been taken up by the independent
commercial station NTV (which is almost available nationally in the
Russian Federation and claims a 40 per cent audience share in Moscow),
Philippe Cayla, Eutelsat's head of service, new projects, says the
organisation would also like to see the national public broadcasters
ORT and RTR eventually become its clients.

While the Hot Bird system (which currently comprises Eutelsat ll F1 and
Hot Bird 1) will by 1997 be expanded by three further satellites (Hot
Birds 2, 3 and 4) to give even better coverage of the Russian
Federation, Cayla says the 18-transponder SESAT (Siberia-Europe
SATellite) satellite will be designed specially for the country. Due to
be launched in 1998, it will be built by the company NPO-PM in
Krasnoiarsk, located at the 48 degrees East orbital position and cover
an area from western Europe to central Siberia.

In Cayla's view, the "best option" would be for half of SESAT's
transponders to be taken up by Russian clients and for them to offer
viewers "a bouquet of five to six channels." He also feels the
satellite, which will in addition to its standard coverage have a spot
beam aimed at China and southern Asia, may be followed by a second
(SESAT II) craft targeting the far east of Russia.

Eutelsat's efforts have also made a great impact on Russia's domestic
DTH industry, as Alexander Atrashkevich, commercial director of Teleset
attests. Moscow-based Teleset is one of the oldest privately-owned
cable and DTH equipment companies in the Russian Federation, having
been set-up soon after the former Soviet Union gave the green light to
free enterprise in 1988.

From the outset, its business has been divided into three parts: the
manufacture of satellite antennas, which initially were nearly all
exported to European countries due to poor local demand; the import of
electrical components for cable and satellite systems; and the
installation of complete cable and satellite systems throughout the
Russian Federation.

According to Atrashkevich, the country's DTH market only began to
experience "serious growth" in 1995 when Eutelsat's Hot Bird enabled
viewers in Moscow to receive a wide range of European channels with a
90cm dish. Indeed, whereas only a year earlier they had to pay between
$700 to $800 (#460-530) for a 2.5-metre system to receive Eutelsat ll
F1, signals from the new satellite could now be picked up in the
capital with equipment retailing for around $230 - roughly the cost of
a 14-inch colour TV set.

Signals from the Scandinavian platform at one degree West also only
require small sized dishes, and while legal cards are unavailable in
the country pirated versions can be bought for as little as $50.

Although Atrashkevich says it is impossible to give a figure for the
number of dishes in the Russian Federation, information he receives
"from partners and competitors" leads him to believe the total number
of systems sold each year could be between 50-80,000. What is clear,
however, is that the market is growing to the extent that sales in 1995
represented a three-fold increase on those of the previous year, and
this could to rise to six-fold in 1996 due to such factors as reception
of more satellites being possible with small dishes and the launch of
new Russian-language channels which will be distributed by satellite.

He adds that one of the peculiarities of the Russian market is that
although "99.9 per cent of people in big cities live in [apartment]
blocks," smatv systems are relatively rare. Indeed, such are the
discrepancies in people's incomes, many are prepared - and can indeed
afford to - buy their own systems. This may be especially  true in
Moscow, where it is believed average monthly salaries are between $600
and $700 as opposed to the national figure of around $140.

Teleset was an official distributor for Pace between 1991 and 1993, but
now supplies several brands of DTH equipment. In Atrashkevich's view,
there is no clear leader in a market which - in Moscow's case - is
served by only around a dozen retail outlets and several principal
distributors from which the public often buys directly.

Teleset is also builds small private cable networks for offices and
banks. Geographically, its involvement stretches beyond the Federation
to Belarus and Ukraine, although in the latter's case this is limited
due to the poor economic situation.

Atrashkevich believes that although both cable and DTH markets will
continue to grow in the Russian Federation, competition will intensify
and - in the case of cable - the five-year breakeven point for new
systems may deter some investors.

His views are to some extent shared by Alexander Drozdetski, the
commercial director of St Petersburg-based A & A Ltd - the official
distributor for Pace in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekhistan - and the General Satellite Association. While
acknowledging growth in the DTH market, he feels this has been most
noticeable in Moscow and central parts of the Russian Federation where
Hot Bird has had the greatest impact, whereas in St Petersburg
reception of most satellite signals (including Astra, Eutelsat and all
those serving Scandinavia) has always been easier with small dishes:
TV3, for instance, can easily be picked up in the city but is
unobtainable in Moscow.

Moreover, this growth can to some extent be explained by rising
incomes, although "there are wide discrepancies." Indeed, "sometimes
people buy equipment because of prestige, others with middle incomes
because this is an area of their interest." What is clear, however, is
that the market is likely to "explode" once satellite-delivered Russian-
language channels (such as those due to launched by RTR this spring)
become widely available.

Like Teleset, General Satellite is involved in the cable industry and
is currently reconstructing networks in St Petersburg for the city
authorities. It also has a mobile uplink station for Eutelsat and
manufactures dishes; total dish sales average around 2,000 a month and
Hot Bird systems sold by the company usually retail for between $260
and $280.

Drozdetski expects cable and DTH markets in Russia to "go the way of
Poland" and expand significantly over the next few years. However,
while remaining free of "government interference," they are still
likely to be hampered by such factors as viewers' low incomes and there
being "not enough Russian-language programmes for individual systems
and cable networks."

PUBCASTER PLANS 'RUSSIAN SKY'

While Eutelsat is undoubtedly opening up the Russian market, the
national public broadcaster RTR is also well placed to make a major
impact with the launch of the country's first digital satellite-
delivered service from Intelsat 604.

According to Stanislav Bunievich, the station's deputy chairman and
director of engineering, RTR Network is a joint venture with an unnamed
UK partner, though rumoured to be BSkyB, and will launch - at a cost of
between $10 to $15 million (#6.6-#10 million) for equipment alone - two
channels (sport and movies) this spring. Distributed by Intelsat 604,
they will probably be followed by further channels for medical,
business and children's television and be available to an audience of
some 40 million "collective customers" - such as those served by cable
networks - throughout the former Soviet Union.

Bunievich says the idea behind RTR Network is to introduce viewers to
the idea of paying for their programming, which in his view is now "the
main way for the development of television in Russia." It is also an
attempt to make the broadcaster less dependent on the government for
its funding and lessen the burden of having to pay 75 per cent of its
revenue to the ministry of telecommunications for the use of
transmission facilities.

Although RTR is currently negotiating agreements with several foreign
programme-providers, Bunievich reckons a need for Russian material will
have to be met. He also believes there will be exceptionally strong
interest shown in the new service's children's and medical channels and
that within the next two to five years RTR, though remaining state-
owned, will become a holding company for RTR Network and other
commercial ventures.

BEAR ON A WIRE

While Moscow's mayor attempts to bring the city's maze of cable
networks under the control of the municipality, MMDS operator Kosmos is
thriving. Can wired and wireless co-exist? Chris Dziadul reports

Although cable remains a relatively underdeveloped industry in the
Russian Federation, there are numerous networks - including such
professional systems as Nika TV in Petrozavorsk around the country.
Wireless cable is a more recent arrival -  but already there are
several MMDS services operated by the US's ITI. But events now taking
place in Moscow are likely to have a major bearing on the future of
both sectors.

Viewers in the capital can for a monthly fee of around R3,300 (#0.47)
currently receive 11 terrestrial channels, of which only six - ORT,
RTR, NTV, 2x2, TV6 Moscow and TV5 St Petersburg - are distributed by
VHF signals. While this allows them to be carried by the city's 80-plus
cable networks, all of which are designed for VHF and have a limited
capacity, the remaining five UHF services, including CNN on Channel 24
and AMTV on Channel 27, can only be received by viewers able to afford
expensive aerials.

This may change shortly, however, following the issue of a decree by
Juri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, requiring all cable operators in the
city to effectively unite into a single network serving some 3.5
million households. In an attempt to stave-off the high levels of
piracy currently found in the industry, Moscow Municipal Cable
Television (MMCTV), which in theory came into being on November 5, will
see large percentages of its airtime given over to official material
(such as local news) and unified programming, with only a limited
amount being allowed for current cable operators' own output.

The move has in effect seen the city authorities claim ownership of all
the networks' wires buried under Moscow, which had up until now been
assumed to belong to local prefectures. It has also led to the creation
of a municipal channel which will have time slots allocated to several
parties, including Moscow's UHF Channel 15 and the production company
NKT.

The creation of MMCTV will, in addition, present an opportunity to
upgrade the city's existing systems. Mostly serving between 3,000 to
15,000 households, few are able to offer viewers more than seven
channels and nearly all are unprofitable.

While it is still unclear who may undertake this work, one of the most
favoured candidates is likely to be Mosteletechnic Corp, the city of
Moscow government's principal contractor. According to Sergei
Samokhvalov, its owner and general director, the company first
approached the authorities in 1991 with an offer to construct new
networks using western technology which would overcome all the
deficiencies of existing systems. This was accepted and accompanied by
a grant of $700,000 for a pilot project serving some 15,000 households.

Due for completion this January, it is also backed by Business Sviaz,
the General Centre for Radio and Television (GCRT-Ostankino), Mir (a
holding company which transmits digital TV/telephony signals via
Intelsat) and Comstar (a joint venture between the UK telecoms company
GPT and Moscow City Telephone Network (MGTS)) and will have enough
capacity for 60 channels. The 30 initially offered to subscribers -
upon payment of $150 for an addressable converter - will be divided
into three packages: basic - 11 terrestrial channels for $0.70 to $1 a
month; commercial - 16 channels including one operated by the city of
Moscow government for $6 to $8 a month; and two pay-per-view channels
for an unspecified fee. The cost of constructing the whole network,
excluding the headend, has been estimated to be $30 per subscriber and
this is expected to fall to $20 to $22 for any future projects.

Samokhvalov says Mosteletechnic has signed agreements with a number of
programmers, including NBC Super Channel, MTV Europe and Turner
International, and will be able to transmit their channels free of
charge for six months. During this time it will undertake a market
survey to determine which channels are most popular with its
subscribers, who in turn will not have to pay for their converters
until the survey is completed.

He adds that the idea behind the project was to develop one of the
first ever integrated cable networks in the Russian Federation.
Although it has taken four years and the help of General Instrument
(GI) to construct, Mosteletechnic now has a close working relationship
with the US company and recently approached the ministry of
telecommunications with an offer to provide integrated equipment for
the new Moscow-wide cable network MMCTV. In Samokhvalov's view, the
company will both secure the right to do so and also act as a
distributor for GI throughout the whole country.

Furthermore, while its pilot network will initially offer only cable
services, these are likely to be supplemented with digital telephony
and data later this year. The project will, in effect, aim to
"demonstrate the possibilities" for similar schemes being undertaken in
the cities of Minsk, Erevan, Baku, Bishek, Alma Ata, Dushanbe and St
Petersburg. It is looking for investors and has held talks with several
parties, including the EBRD.

Another, potentially competing part of the industry showing strong
signs of growth is the MMDS, or wireless cable sector. MMDS TV services
first appeared on the territory of the former Soviet Union shortly
after the collapse of communism. Backed by the US company International
Telcell Inc (ITI) - itself a consortium of several companies including
Metromedia, McCaw Cellular, Comsat Video Enterprises and Morgan and
Associates - it can now be found in the cities of Riga (Latvia),
Kishinov (Moldavia) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), along with Moscow, Nizny
Novogrod and, from early 1996, St Petersburg in the Russian Federation.

Although some such as Baltcom in Riga can claim success purely on the
grounds of subscriber numbers - over 8,000 in the Baltic republic's
capital alone - the most lucrative in terms of potential reach and
profitability is undoubtedly Moscow's Kosmos TV. Launched as a joint
venture between ITI and the General Centre for Radio and Television
(GCRT Ostankino) in 1991, it employs three large antennas to receive
Astra, Eutelsat and Intelsat services which are then retransmitted
within a 60-70km radius of the Ostankino TV Tower to the city of Moscow
and several outlying suburbs including Krasnogorsk, Kurkino, Odintsovo,
Peredelkino and Sheremetyevo.

Kosmos TV offers its subscribers - who currently number around 1,500
individuals and institutions such as businesses, hotels and embassies -
a full basic 18-channel 'package A' comprised Eurosport, MTV Europe,
RTL, Bloomberg, Bloomberg News, NBC Super Channel, a recently-launched
Russian film channel known as The New Channel and two services
(Euronews and The Travel Channel) with Russian subtitles for $36.45
(including VAT) per month. Those wishing to receive  the nine-channel
basic 'package B' of Russian and English-language channels, however,
pay $19 (including VAT) a month, while the Adult Channel is available
to all subscribers for an extra $8. Individual subscribers are, in
addition, required to pay a $300 deposit and $60 (plus VAT)
installation charge, while fees for hotels are determined by occupancy
rates.

Unlike most other cable operators in the Russian Federation, Kosmos TV
has full agreements with all the satellite channels it carries. It also
offers subscribers insurance for equipment, its own listings magazine,
a round-the-clock maintenance service and - perhaps more importantly -
a distinct advantage over individual DTH reception, since this would
require a two to 2.5-metre dish costing $1,500 to $3,000 and, for such
channels as BBC Prime, Discovery Channel and MTV Europe, up to $360 for
descrambling equipment.

According to Elvira Smirnova, Kosmos TV's commercial director, the
service would like to add more channels to those it already distributes
but is held back by "technical limitations." If these are overcome "the
number of subscribers will grow accordingly," she says, and may
eventually reach its target of 50,000.

FIRST TO SHOW

Europe's first single-sport subscription channel is covering not
football, but the sport of kings. Julian Clover dons his silks to give
a right royal welcome to The Racing Channel

There can't be too many satellite subscription services which claim Her
Majesty The Queen and other prominent members of Britain's royal family
as regular viewers. But SIS, owner of the Racing Channel, one of the
new crop of UK Astra channels and televisual purveyor of the 'sport of
kings,' boasts exactly this.

Strictly speaking, the Royal household doesn't subscribe to the #20 a
month Astra 1D service, but Britain's first family of the paddock is
the recipient of SIS's sister satellite racing service which is
targeted, predominantly, at bookmakers.

SIS actually began its encrypted (in B Mac) service for UK betting
shops as long ago as 1987, with live horse racing from Chester and
greyhound meetings from Hackney. Now offered to bookmakers and
individual trainers for an annual subscription fee of #5,500, George
Irvine, general manager of The Racing Channel, says when the
professional service first got under starter's orders "we came to an
agreement with Customs and Excise that we wouldn't, because it was a
betting service, sell it to individuals unless we were fairly sure that
they wouldn't start operating a betting shop in their front rooms."

There are now less than 500 such private subscriptions - including the
Royals' - in addition to the 9,500 UK betting shops. Transmissions via
Intelsat's 601 satellite are also received as far afield as Andorra,
North America and Saudi Arabia.

Irvine says that a consumer DTH service had long been under
consideration, but only recently did all the technological elements
fall into place to make the channel a racing certainty. The channel's
introduction was hastened when SIS's feed on Eutelsat I F4 switched to
digital transmissions, allowing additional compressed capacity to
deliver a proposed cable service to headends in the UK.

"We presented it to the cable companies with our thoughts and ideas of
what the service would consist of, the fact it was cable-exclusive, and
how we felt it would be a tremendous benefit to them, and how most of
the customers would be the kind who, through betting, would use
telephony as well. It was a 'double whammy,'" recounts Irvine.

But what was hoped to be a red-hot favourite stalled as cable operators
proved "very, very unreceptive." Irvine ascribes cable operators'
resistance to the channel to "technical problems" experienced with
existing channels.

The Racing Channel's unlikely White Knight turned out to be British Sky
Broadcasting, which came knocking on SIS's door with a proposal to
launch the service direct-to-home via satellite. However, the UK's
dominant pay-TV broadcaster was not able to guarantee SIS the 24-hour
channel it had been hoping for. Instead, it was offered, and accepted,
the daily transmission hours between 11.00 and 16.00 sharing capacity
with Sky Movies Gold on Astra 1D. However, from the summer of '96 The
Racing Channel will be able to extend its output to 19.00, before
returning to a 17.00 closedown in time for the start of the autumn
season.

SIS's cameras are in attendance at every daily race meeting in the UK
and from this wealth of coverage two meetings per day are selected for
the direct-to-home service.

An additional detail in the contract with Sky means SIS now produces
the daily Racing News magazine programme for Sky Sports, while The
Winning Post, another SIS production, returns in the summer on the same
channel with regular coverage of evening race meetings. Also during the
summer months, The Racing Channel will preview evening meetings and
screen the first few races before handing over to Sky Sports for
coverage of the remainder of the card.

Irvine concedes that the present hours are a mite miserly should, for
example, The Racing Channel, wish to screen an entire meeting. However,
since the key race is typically third on the card, coverage of the main
event is virtually guaranteed.

At #20 per month The Racing Channel ranks as the second most expensive
single premium service beamed via the Astra platform - a short head
behind JSTV's #30-a-month Japanese-language channel. Irvine, though,
says the figure should be put into perspective; #20, he says, might not
be quite so outlandish to punters who think nothing of placing bets of
#10 on a single race - though he says the average is closer to #50 -
via a credit or debit card.

"One of the good things is that you can subscribe to The Racing Channel
as a solos subscriber. You don't need to take any of the other
channels, and that was one of the things that we insisted on," says
Irvine. The implication is that BSkyB would have preferred The Racing
Channel's subscribers to have first passed through one of its existing
tiers, most likely Sky Sports.

But as evidence that SIS was correct to stick to its guns, Irvine
claims reports from Sky's subscriber management centre in Livingston
show that the enquiries have been streaming in from non-Sky customers.

The Racing Channel's deal with Sky was not hammered out until the
eleventh hour - last November 2 to be exact, four days before the
channel went live - and the agreement to use Sky's Astra 1D transponder
on the morning of the launch. Pre-launch ballyhoo, as a result, was
kept to a minimum to say the least, though in the time since ads have
regularly appeared in The Sporting Life and The Racing Post. And in
true pay-TV style, a daily clear window between 11.00 and 12.00 alerts
potential subscribers to the service.

In its first fortnight on-air The Racing Channel, Irvine claims,
attracted 20,000 calls and 7,500 switch-ons. Niche audience channels
inevitably attract consumers new to satellite television and this, in
turn, means acquainting them with the technology. The Racing Channel's
task is compounded, says Irvine, by the need among longer-standing
satellite viewers to fit "a new widget" - a reference to the enhanced
LNBs needed by many older IRDs to receive Astra 1D.

Providing such technicalities can be overcome, Irvine is targeting
30,000 subscribers for Year One and 10,000 by 1998. And despite the
original set-back with the UK's cable operators, the channel has even
been given a leg-up into cable by BT's London-based operator
Westminster Cable, which had taken part in some earlier consumer trials
of the channel.

When Sky migrates to digital - a deadline which is not expected to be
met until at least the end of 1996 - then The Racing Channel will
become a 24-hour service as was originally envisaged. But for the
moment, beams Irvine, "we're pleased that it is the first niche sports
channel, and it's racing."

DTH SURVEY:  HOW DOES YOUR MARKET GROW

In a year in which analogue equipment had the market all to itself for
the final time, saturation in Europe's major DTH markets suggests the
time is ripe for digital to take root. C&SEu's sixth annual DTH survey,
researched and compiled by Chris Dziadul

C&SEu's latest annual DTH survey indicates that the European satellite
industry had another successful year in 1995, with the number of
installations in December 1995 totalling around 20.5 million. Yet while
this represented an increase of over 20 per cent on the previous year's
figure, there were doubts in some countries as to how much longer this
growth could continue.

In Germany, for instance, sales had been stagnant for some two years
and dealers were finally being forced to concede that the market -
which already amounted to some nine million DTH and smatv homes - was
effectively saturated. In France, on the other hand, strong growth
could not conceal the fact that the industry was starting from an
extremely low base, while in Poland, which with an estimated 1.7
million dishes was still Europe's third largest market, cheap imports
were having a detrimental effect on sales.

All was not gloom and doom, however. Although BSkyB had had its fair
share of problems in the UK, it finally turned a corner in 1995 by
employing highly successful marketing techniques which helped the
number of installations rise above the 3.5 million mark - effectively a
17 per cent increase on the previous year's total. Other countries
which notched up significant sales included Italy, Belgium and Denmark.

The impact on Europe's DTH industry of Eutelsat's Hot Bird 1 - which is
co-located with ll F1 at 13 degrees East -  could not be understated
and was perhaps most clearly felt in the Russian Federation, where it
finally made viewing of foreign satellite channels a reality for
millions of people living in Moscow and central parts of the country.
Meanwhile in Greece, which had hitherto also been outside the
footprints of most European satellites, the number of installations
almost doubled following the satellite's launch.

Hot Bird also brought home the importance viewers now attach to local-
language programming. Although Astra is still undoubtedly Europe's 'hot
bird,' more and more people are forsaking its English and German-
language channels in favour of programming in their own vernaculars.
This is being offered by several satellites including Telecom 2A and 2B
in France, Turksat in Turkey and one degree West in Scandinavia, while
immigrant communities throughout the continent are increasingly well
served by Eutelsat's programming services.

What has, in addition, become clear is that each country in Europe is a
highly distinct market and developments in it should be viewed with
this in mind. The former communist countries of central and eastern
Europe, for instance, have seen their television industries develop at
widely differing rates over the last five years and this is clearly
reflected in their respective DTH markets. Even the Nordic countries,
which are united by common satellites and the usage of D2 Mac
technology, differ greatly in such areas as growth, with Sweden and
Denmark performing far more impressively than Finland and Norway.

Programming nevertheless remains a key factor in the development of DTH
services throughout Europe and its importance was clearly illustrated
in Belgium, where the sudden availability via satellite of the Dutch
broadcaster Veronica and newcomer SBS 6 contributed to an almost 75 per
cent increase in installations despite the country's high cable
penetration.

Spain, on the other hand, experienced both success and failure in this
field in 1995, with its Astra-delivered Canal Satellite package of
programming finally tasting success after an aggressive marketing
campaign and Cotelsat's four-channel package off of DBS bird Hispasat
collapsing due to lack of promotion, among other things.

Although the UK's Pace has emerged as a clear market-leader in DTH
equipment throughout Europe, its dominance is by no means complete and
is challenged in a number of territories. Cheap imports, however,
continue to trouble several markets, despite the problem being less
severe in some countries - Austria, for instance - than before.

As in previous years, it is instructive to compare growth in Europe's
DTH industry with those of Japan and the US, the world's two other main
satellite dish markets. In the former, satellite penetration of its
43.7 million TV households stood at around 13.7 per cent towards the
end of the year. Meanwhile in the US, the impetus provided by the
recent launch of such DBS services as DirecTv was maintained in 1995,
with the total number of DTH subscribers in October being 4.36 million
and the total number of C-Band dishes almost 3.83 million.

DTH SURVEY:  AUSTRIA

Population:        8.1m
TV homes:          3.035m
VCR homes:         1.75m
Cable connections: 1.17m
Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        300,000-500,000 (700,000)

Austria's DTH industry had a largely indifferent year in 1995, with few
if any distributors recording significant increases in sales of dishes.
There were nevertheless some important developments that offered a
valuable insight into how the market was likely to develop.

The cost of equipment, for instance, continued to fall and by the end
of the year the cheapest Astra systems - which employed 60cm dishes in
western parts of the country, rising to 80cm in Vienna and further east
- retailed for as little as oSch1,290 (#82). More typically, 80cm
models usually fetched up to oSch5,000 and motorised units around
oSch10,000.

Yet despite this, there was a movement away from sales of cheap 'black
imports' from such Asian countries as China and South Korea back to
more expensive equipment produced in the European Union (EU). Indeed,
companies such as Pace and Hirschmann, which had previously dominated
the quality end of the market, began to make significant inroads into
its mainstream.

While ascertaining the size of the market remained difficult -
estimates of the total number of dishes ranged from 300,000 to half a
million - most industry sources believed Eutelsat programming (thanks
largely to Hot Bird) was becoming increasingly popular in the country.

DTH SURVEY:  BELGIUM

Population:        10.2m
TV homes:          4.141m
VCR homes:         1.91m
Cable connections: 3.99m
Cable penetration: 96%
Dish total:        35,000 (20,000)

Belgium's high cable penetration did not prevent its hitherto small DTH
market almost doubling in size in 1995. The reasons for this were
twofold: the popularity of Eutelsat's Hot Bird and - perhaps more
importantly - the dramatic increase of programming available to Flemish
speakers via Veronica and SBS 6.

With sales of equipment to the country's immigrant Moroccan and Turkish
communities having peaked, the focus of attention once more passed to
the local population. Still effectively split along linguistic lines -
with French speakers in Wallonia opting for programming on Telecom and
Astra being the first choice for Flemish speakers - it saw the cost of
systems fall by around 15 per cent. As a result, typical Astra models
with 80cm dishes, along with 90cm Telecom equipment, typically retailed
for between BFr5,950 and BFr11,900 (#129-259).

With now no domestic manufacturing sector to speak of, all DTH
equipment was supplied by foreign companies. Several, including Amstrad
and Echostar, were well represented at the quality end of the market,
while Germany's Lasat performed well in sales of lower priced hardware.

DTH SURVEY:  BULGARIA

Population:        8.5m
TV homes:          2m (est)
VCR homes:         540,000
Cable connections: 60,000 (min est)
Cable penetration: 3% (min est)
Dish total:        N/A (50,000 est)

In the absence of a national commercial television service and a cable
industry still waiting on the starting blocks, Bulgaria's DTH market
had another good year in '95. Indeed, although industry sources were
unable to provide an accurate figure for the total number of dishes in
the country, it was believed to be well in excess of the 1994 figure of
50,000.

Astra programming could be received with equipment employing 1.5-metre
dishes in the western part of the country, rising to over three metres
on the Black Sea coast, which - if using increasingly popular Russian
ex-military dishes - typically retailed for around $325 (#206).
Eutelsat's Hot Bird, however, had become an instant hit and could be
picked up anywiere with generally cheaper systems (including receivers
costing around #63) which employed 1.2 metre dishes (80cm in Sofia).
Furthermore, services carried on other Eutelsat satellites remained
popular with the country's large Turkish-speaking community.

Although Pace equipment was highly regarded, its price put it beyond
the reach of most Bulgarians. However, there was a wide range of
foreign-made systems on the market and the end users' cost could often
be negotiated.

Cable connections: N/A
Cable penetration: N/A
Dish total:        N/A (N/A)

Although there was still no reliable figure for the total number of
dishes in the CIS, it was widely believed that the market stood on the
threshold of great change. The reason for this was the availability of
programming hitherto difficult if not impossible to receive in the
territory: Eutelsat had reduced the dish size required to pick-up its
signals from three metres to 90cm following the launch of Hot Bird 1,
while Astra 1D's footprint was such that its programming services could
be viewed in Moscow with 75cm equipment.

With monitoring at borders kept to a minimum, there was a large influx
of illegally-imported DTH equipment from western Europe, the Middle
East, China and other parts of Asia.

Pace nevertheless remained one of the leading distributors of receiving
equipment in the country.

Cable penetration: negligible
Dish total:        200,000 (400,000 max est)

Croatia's DTH market in late 1995 appeared to be smaller than
previously believed, but it still amounted to around 200,000
installations - an impressive penetration rate of over 23 per cent -
and sales were increasing. This could largely be put down to an almost
complete absence of cable services in the country, except in the towns
of Karlovac, Split and the capital, Zagreb, along with a terrestrial
sector dominated by the national publicly-owned broadcaster Hrvatska
Televizija (HRT) and, following a new media communication law, awaiting
the launch of national and regional commercial services.

Channels on Astra and Eutelsat's Hot Bird accounted for most of the
country's satellite viewing, with systems for the former employing 60-
90cm dishes, typically retailing for #146. While there was no market-
leader, models produced by Pace, Provision and Grundig continued to
sell well.

Dish sales in the Czech Republic held up extremely well in 1995 despite
the continued popularity of the recently-launched commercial station TV
The trends which have recently manifested themselves in Norway's DTH
industry dominated by the Ostrava-based operator Cable Plus. Indeed,
some industry sources put the number of DTH installations in the
country in late 1995 at 600,000 - effectively a 50 per cent increase on
the previous year's total.

Astra still remained popular in the Czech Republic and could be
received with systems employing 60cm dishes almost anywhere in the
country and typically retailed for CKr7,000 (#169). Eutelsat equipment
cost a similar amount, while motorised systems were more expensive.

As in previous years, although there were no clear market-leaders both
Pace and Amstrad remained popular.

TV homes:          2.266m
VCR homes:         1.45m
Cable connections: 1.359m (incl smatv)
Cable penetration: 60% (incl smatv)
Dish total:        Up to 300,000 (100,000 min est)

Denmark's DTH market experienced tremendous growth in 1995 and was by
the end of the year believed to number up to 300,000 installations. Of
these, aroune two thirds were accounted for by D2 Mac receiving
systems.

One reason for this increase in sales was the success of the pan-Scandi
satellite venture NSD, which effectively provided Danish cable and DTH
viewers with a realistic alternative to services carried by Astra.
While the latter remained attractive to viewers, channels on the one
degree West platform (which included TV3) rapidly gained in popularity.

The market was also given a boost by a significant fall in the cost of
equipment, with D2 Mac systems employing 70cm dishes, for instance,
typically retailing from DKr2,495-3,495 (#288-404). Those capable of
receiving both Astra and NSD services, meanwhile, cost around DKr4,000
if specifically designed to do so and DKr4,500 if they combined two
70cm dishes. Although Pal systems also continued to fall in price, they
remained far less popular.

As in previous years, Pace was the market-leader and Triax, Nokia and
Bang & Olufsen were also well represented.

Cable connections: 123,000
Cable penetration: 25% (max est)
Dish total:        21,000 (18,000 max est)

Estonia maintained its position as one of the Baltic region's leading
television markets in 1995, recording significant growth in both its
terrestrial and cable industries. As in previous years, it also saw a
sharp rise in the number of DTH homes: although the previous year's
figure was overestimated, the late 1995 total of 21,000 represented an
increase in real terms of 40 per cent.

Astra was the most watched satellite but faced stiff competition from
Eutelsat and Russia's Gorizont. Indeed, the top five satellite channels
received either by cable or DTH in the country were - according to
National Media Survey - Pro 7, ORT, RTL, MTV Europe and Eurosport.

The typical cost of DTH equipment -which usually employed a 1.8-metre
antenna and Pal receiver - was little changed at around EEK9,000 (#500)
and Pace, Finlux and Nokia/Salora remained the market-leaders.

Cable connections: 749,000 (est)
Cable penetration: 36%
Dish total:        50,000 (30,000)

The size of Finland's DTH market was revised upwards for the second
year running, though industry sources indicated there had been little
if any increase in sales in 1995. There was, however, an important
change in viewing habits as viewers began to switch from Astra to
Eutelsat's Hot Bird and the CTV package at one degree West.

Besides offering attractive programming, both new services could be
received with competitively priced equipment: systems with one-metre
dishes were sufficient to pick-up Hot Bird almost anywhere in the
country and typically retailed for FM1,200-1,900 (#178-292), while the
end-user cost of 70cm CTV models was FM1,900-2,900. Astra's decline in
popularity was nevertheless expected to be temporary, with several
digital services on its forthcoming 1E satellite likely to target
Scandinavian audiences.

In the absence of a local manufacturing industry - Nokia having shifted
production of both Pal and Mac receivers to Sweden - sales of equipment
were effectively confined to foreign-made systems. Pace and Nokia
(along with its brand names Salora and Finlux) each accounted for 30
per cent of the market, with several other companies the remainder.

VCR homes:         13.352m
Cable connections: 2.131m
Cable penetration: 10.2%
Dish total:        1m (min est) (385,000 est)

France's hitherto small DTH market caught up on lost time in 1995, with
one industry source estimating the number of dishes in the country at
the half-year point to be at least one million. It also put total sales
of equipment at 270,000 in 1994 and expected the figure to rise to
350,000 in 1995.

One reason for this impressive growth was demand from France's large
foreign community: Arabic, Spanish, English, Italian, German and Polish-
speakers all found programming on Eutelsat - and in particular Hot Bird
 - increasingly attractive, and by some estimates accounted for between
50 and 60 per cent of dish sales. Astra, on the other hand, was
considered by most of the French viewing public to be too geared
towards English and German-language speakers, with most still plumping
for Telecom satellites.

The latter (Telecom 2A and 2B) could be received with equipment which
typically retailed for Fr2,000 (#259), whereas Astra systems usually
cost less. As in previous years, the market-leaders included Philips
and Nokia.

Although it was expected dish sales in France in 1996 would reach
470,000, the effect on the market of Canal Plus's digital Astra package
remained hard to predict.

Cable connections: 15.491m
Cable penetration: 48.1%
Dish total:        9.23m (DTH & smatv) (7.71m, max est-DTH only)

Following two years of disappointing sales, dealers believed Germany's
DTH market had finally reached saturation point. Indeed, in a country
with over 14 million cabled homes and at least nine million served by
DTH or smatv, most were agreed that everyone who wanted to watch
satellite television now had the means to do so.

The slowdown in dish sales was uniform throughout Germany and not - as
first believed - confined to the more cabled, western part of the
country. It was also reflected in the cost of equipment, with the
cheapest 60cm Astra systems retailing for as little as #60-70 and dual
Astra/Eutelsat models (which usually employed 85cm dishes and two LNBs)
fetching #100.

With DTH equipment costing so little, imports from the Far East which
had previously made strong inroads into the market no longer had the
edge. As in previous years, producers of high-quality kit such as
Kathrein, Technisat and Pace maintained a strong presence in the
country.

Cable connections: 1,900

Dish total:        5,000 (est) (3,000)

Greece's small DTH market received a welcome boost in 1995 with the
launch of Eutelsat's Hot Bird and a fall in the cost of equipment. As a
result, there were around 5,000 systems in the country at the end of
the year (compared to 3,000 in late 1994) and sales were buoyant.

Signals from the new Eutelsat satellite - on which Eurosport was the
most popular channel - could be received almost anywhere in the country
with systems employing 80cm dishes. These usually retailed for between
#160-#226, whereas those used to pick-up other satellites could cost
anything from #400 (1.2-metres) to #2,700 (for the most expensive three-
metre model). Reception nevertheless remained a problem, with Greece's
geographical location effectively limiting Astra viewing to Corfu and
the north, and requiring 1.8-metre systems to watch Intelsat in Crete
and western parts of the country.

While there was still no market-leader, equipment supplied by Pace,
Amstrad and Echostar remained popular. Drake, Hirschmann and Kathrein,
however, continued to dominate sales of more expensive models.

TV homes:          3.8m
VCR homes:         1.596m
Cable connections: 1.52m
Cable penetration: 40%
Dish total:        400,000 (max est) (190,000)

Previous estimates of the size of Hungary's DTH market appeared to have
been incorrect, with industry sources believing the number of dishes in
the country in late 1995 to be up to 400,000. Although this was almost
double the previous year's total, it was widely felt there had been
little if any growth in the market during the period.

There was also an acceptance that the country's television industry was
on the threshold of great change: a long-awaited broadcasting bill
seemed imminent and was likely to be followed by the launch of a
national commercial television service. How this would affect its DTH
and cable industries - the latter being one of the largest in central
and eastern Europe - remained far from clear.

The non-terrestrial sector had nevertheless been given a boost during
the previous year by the launch of MultiChoice Hungary. In late 1995
subscribers could receive the basic package - upon payment of Fts35,000-
45,000 (#167-215) for hardware and a connection fee of Fts5,200 - for
Fts29,990 a month. Both Astra and Eutelsat programming remained popular
in the country, with systems employing 0.9 to three-metre dishes
ranging in price from #71-#390. Although there were no clear market-
leaders, equipment produced by several companies, including Pace,
Amstrad, Neuhaus, Radix and Echostar, continued to sell well.

The number of dishes in Iceland grew steadily in 1995 and at the end of
the year stood at around 3,000. Although this represented an impressive
increase of up to 20 per cent on the previous year's total, industry
sources were far from optimistic as to the future.

The key to any further growth in the market rested firmly with
programming: while the introduction of microwave relays of foreign
channels by Stod 2 had failed to dampen sales of DTH equipment and the
prospect of the PTT offering cable services still seemed distant, most
people felt the (legal) viewing choice on offer was limited.

Nor was their view likely to be altered by the cost of equipment in a
market in which - despite the presence of such companies as Pace and
Echostar - there was still no dominant supplier. Indeed, 1995 saw
typical 1.2-metre Astra systems with IRDs fall in price by IKr5,000
(#49) from IKr60,000 to IKr55,000, while 1.8-metre systems normally
used to receive such channels as CNN and (illegally) Sky Sports also
dropped in price by a similar amount to IKr110,000. Neither had the
effect of raising the total annual sales beyond 300 to 500
installations.

DTH SURVEY:  IRELAND

Population:        3.6m
TV homes:          1.056m
VCR homes:         623,040
Cable connections: 401,280
Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        66,000 (min est) (60,000)

Ireland's DTH market shrugged off high cable penetration, widespread
MMDS distribution and the illegal retransmission of foreign channels to
record significant growth for the second year running. This was in part
due to a large influx of illegally-imported equipment and the
widespread use of pirate cards.

Viewing patterns were little altered, however, with Astra programming
by far the most popular and neither Eutelsat or Intelsat being able to
secure a large audience. The cost of equipment was also little changed
on 1994: the cheapest Astra models with 80cm dishes typically retailed
for IR#199 (#194.6), while more expensive systems could fetch up to
IR#350.

Pace remained the market-leader, with several other manufacturers
including Lenson Heath and Grundig represented.

DTH SURVEY:  ISRAEL

Population:        5.5m
TV homes:          1.2m
VCR homes:         819,600
Cable connections: 840,000 (min est)
Cable penetration: 70% (min est)
Dish total:        5,000 (5,000 max est)

Israel's cable industry had another highly successful year in 1995,
with the number of connected homes rising to over 840,000 (effectively
70 per cent penetration). Most were offered six Hebrew-language
channels, over 25 foreign services and home shopping.

Yet despite this, the country's small DTH market not only held its own
but recorded an increase in sales. Industry sources believed it
numbered around 5,000 systems in late 1995: most belonged to Arabs
resident in the Occupied Territories or Israel proper and were used to
receive programming via Eutelsat, Asiasat and Arabsat, with the
latter's Arab Radio and Television (ART) being especially popular.

Equipment employing 0.9-metre dishes typically retailed for NS1,500
(#314), while 1.1-metre systems cost an additional NS200 and motorised
units could fetch up to NS3,500. All prices included both VAT and
installation. As in previous years, Pace remained the clear market-
leader at the medium-to-high end of the market and no single company
dominated sales of lower-priced equipment.

Population:        57.7m
TV homes:          20.222m
VCR homes:         9.726m
Cable connections: negligible
Cable penetration: negligible
Dish total:        600,000 (est) (120,000 min est)

Italy's DTH market grew significantly for the second year running in
1995, with some industry sources putting the number of dishes in the
country at up to 600,000. It also looked forward to a period of further
growth following the 1996 launch of Hot Bird 2 - which will boost sales
in southern parts of the country by allowing reception with 85cm dishes
- and Telepiu's move onto satellite.

Astra and Eutelsat's Hot Bird were the most watched satellites in the
country at the end of the year and could usually be received with 85cm
systems, which ranged in price from between Lire300,000-550,000 (#119-
219) for single and Lire450,000-700,000 for double feeds. 1.2-metre
motorised units, however, could fetch anything up to Lire2.8 million.

As in previous years, the principal suppliers of DTH equipment included
Nokia, Pace, Fracarro, Echostar and Emmesse.

No accurate figure for the total number of dishes in Latvia in late
1995 was available,  though some industry sources estimated there could
be almost 25,000, giving a penetration rate of almost two per cent.
What was clear, however, was that growth in the industry continued to
be held back by the country's expanding terrestrial sector and -
perhaps more importantly - the success of the Riga-based MMDS service
Baltcom. Backed by the US company International Telecell Inc (ITI) and
local interests, it offered at least 8,000 subscribers in the city and
environs 24 channels in three packages.

Some industry sources believed the previous year's total of 265,000 to
be an overestimate. With continued expansion of terrestrial services
and a cable industry estimated to number up to 70,000 connections,
however, there was undoubtedly general growth in the country's
television market and, most probably, dish sales, though no reliable
figure was available.

While programming carried by Astra and Intelsat remained popular,
Eutelsat's Hot Bird made viewing of satellite channels financially more
accessible to the public and was likely to eventually result in the
same growth in the DTH industry as in the neighbouring Russian
Federation.

Luxembourg's DTH market continued to expand in 1995, though industry
sources believed the territory's high cable penetration was likely to
limit further growth for the foreseeable future.

As in previous years, programming supplied by Astra - whose operator
SES is based in the Grand Duchy - continued to dominate viewing and
could be received with equipment which retailed for as little as
FLux4,000 (#87). More expensive motorised systems, on the other hand,
could be bought from around FLux17,500. While Alfa J Weirich Sar
remained the country's only DTH manufacturer, several foreign companies
including Grundig were strongly represented in the local market.

Although the launch of several new channels on satellite, including
SBS6, TV10 Gold and a revamped Veronica, made 1995 an eventful year for
Dutch broadcasting, sales of DTH equipment remained sluggish due to the
country's already high cable penetration. Moreover, they were not
expected to increase significantly in the near future despite Nethold's
plans to target the country with digital pay-per-view.

The Netherlands' large Turkish and Moroccan immigrant communities
continued to account for most low-cost equipment sales, with many
models being used to receive channels carried by Eutelsat and - to a
lesser extent - Arabsat and Intelsat. The cheapest Astra and Eutelsat
models usually employed 60-80cm dishes and typically retailed for
Gld200-300 (#79-119). While Pace remained the market-leader, Amstrad
and Echostar both had a significant market share and Philips continued
to enjoy a degree of success.

The trends which have recently manifested themselves in Norway's DTH
market - namely a switch from motorised to fixed systems and a
significant fall in prices - continued almost unabated in 1995. The
latter was to some degree spurred on by the success of the one degree
West package, which prompted MultiChoice to enter into an agreement
with Pace that resulted in hardware becoming available to the pay
channel's subscribers for as little as NKr3,000 (#304). This cost
eventually became the norm for multi-Mac equipment and represented a 66
per cent reduction on 1994 price levels.

Although Nokia remained the market-leader, Pace's deal with FilmNet
strengthened its presence in the country and several other companies,
including Philips, remained well represented. The local manufacturers
Stop and Tantec, however, remained largely on the sidelines.

While Poland maintained its position as Europe's third largest DTH
market in 1995, it continued to be troubled by a development that took
place in February of the previous year. The event in question was the
government's decision to impose a 10 per cent 'luxury tax' on all
Polish-made systems (15 per cent on imports) and inadvertently plunge
the whole local industry into a crisis. Besides creating a black market
that accounted for at least 70 per cent of all DTH equipment sold in
the country, its action led to a fall in the number of official dealers
and left those remaining uncertain about their future.

Their predicament was clearly borne out by the cost of equipment, with
the cheapest Astra systems sold - typically for around Zl440 (#113.4) -
being equivalent in price to illegally-imported Pace models.

Yet while the market continued to grow, the halcyon days of the early
1990s were clearly over: more choice of local-language programming led
to Astra gradually losing viewers to terrestrial services and - perhaps
more significantly - Eutelsat. Indeed, at the end of the year
Eutelsat's share of the market (thanks largely to Hot Bird) had risen
to 10 per cent and industry sources predicted it could reach 50 per
cent if more Polish-language channels became available.

With Pace equipment still popular at the higher price end of the
market, and no one supplier dominating sales of cheaper models, the
time seemed right for a local company to enter the fray.

Poznan-based Astra-TV took the plunge by producing the country's first
integrated satellite receiver-positioner and - following the launch of
other new products - aimed to eventually capture up to 70 per cent of
the local market.

There was little agreement on the fortunes of Portugal's DTH market in
1995, with some dealers believing it had finally turned the corner
after bearing the brunt of the country's economic recession and others
feeling it was still far from out of the woods. What was clear,
however, was that it faced growing competition from both the
terrestrial sector and newly-emerging cable industry.

Although Astra remained popular, it too faced competition from
Eutelsat's Hot Bird, which, arguably, offered Portuguese viewers more
interesting programming. Both could be received with 85cm systems
costing as little as Esc20,000 (#85), though more typically Esc50,000.
Combined Eutelsat/Astra models employed 1.1-metre dishes and could be
bought for a little extra.

As in previous years, Antel and Famavel remained the leading local
manufacturers, while the largest distributors included Cintra & Leal,
Contera, Televes, Grundig, Prosat and TV Babo.

Although Romanian dealers were unable to provide a figure for the total
number of DTH installations in the country in late 1995,  it was likely
to be only slightly higher than the previous year's maximum estimate of
300,000. While Hot Bird had undoubtedly had a positive impact on the
market, the impressive growth which followed the overthrow of
Ceausescu's regime in 1989 had long ended and domestic television
services were transformed beyond all recognition. Indeed, besides
having a vibrant terrestrial sector served by a growing number of local
commercial stations, the country had one of the largest cable
industries in the whole of central and eastern Europe, with some
estimates putting the number of connections at up to 1.8 million.

Serbia and Montenegro's DTH market showed further signs of growth in

Although Astra programming remained extremely popular, Eutelsat's Hot
Bird was watched by a significant number of viewers and both Intelsat
and Turksat also had large followings.

The cheapest Astra models (which accounted for up to 80 per cent of the
market) retailed for as little as DM250-300 (#112-135), while Hot Bird
systems (some 20 per cent of sales) were motorised and fetched DM600-
700. Although as in previous years there was no overall market-leader,
Neuhausat, Teletronik, Telemax and Protek were well represented in
sales of receivers and Cambridge of LNBs.

Slovakia's television industry has been slower to develop than that of
most other former communist countries in central and eastern Europe,
but the recent award of a national commercial licence is likely to have
a positive effect on its future.

In the absence of such a service, however, both the country's cable and
satellite industries have prospered and in late 1995 there were at
least 350,000 cable connections and 100,000 DTH homes. The latter could
receive both Astra and Eutelsat programming (including Hot Bird) using
equipment which typically retailed for SKr10-11,000 (#214-236).

While there were still no market-leaders, systems including receivers
supplied by Pace were increasingly favoured.

Although the previous year's figure for the total number of dishes in
Slovenia appeared to be an underestimate, most industry sources felt
the market had finally reached saturation point. Indeed, hampered by a
rapidly expanding cable and terrestrial sector, along with high duties
and a tide of illegally-imported equipment, it was likely to remain in
the doldrums for some time to come.

With the number of installations believed to be up to 150,000, however,
Slovenia could still boast an impressive satellite penetration rate of
some 23 per cent. Astra remained popular and could be received with 80-
85cm equipment which - if bought on the black market - retailed for as
little as DM280 (#126), rising to DM350 including installation in the
case of legal low-cost models. Eutelsat systems also employed 85cm
dishes and cost slightly more, while Italian channels on Intelsat could
be received with motorised 1.2-metre systems typically costing around
DM1,300.

While there was still no market-leader, equipment supplied by Pace,
Echostar and Technisat continued to sell well.

1995 was a year of mixed fortunes for the Spanish DTH market. On the
one hand it could reflect on the success of Astra's Canalsatelite
package - which thanks to aggressive marketing passed the 25,000
subscriber mark - and look forward to Hispasat's plans to launch a
string of digital services in the near future. On the other, it had to
face up to the abysmal failure of the Cotelsat subscriber management
consortium, which managed to secure only 4,000 subscribers for its four-
channel Hispasat package before collapsing in the summer.

Although it was hoped a local DTH market would eventually emerge, sales
of equipment were still largely confined to the country's large
expatriate community. Many continued to favour programming on Astra,
which could be received with 60cm systems in the north, rising to 80cm
in the central region and 1.5-metres in the south, and - due to strong
competition - retailed for as little as Ptas49,000 (#254) in such towns
as Malaga, though up to Ptas100,000 in places with fewer foreign
residents. Scandinavians, however, generally opted to watch a wider
variety of programming, including channels carried by the new, highly-
successful one degree West satellite.

While there was still no market-leader, in the country, Pace and
several minor brand names were all well represented.

Sales of DTH equipment remained strong in Sweden in 1995 despite the
country's high cable and smatv penetration. They were nevertheless
influenced by a train of events that got under way in August 1994 with
the launch of the Sirius package.

Offering four Pal channels (TV3, TV4, TV6 and ZTV) in-the-clear, the
services provided a boost for sales of compatible equipment until an
announcement in mid-1995 which revealed that they would all soon be
encrypted. This effectively spelt the end of stand-alone Pal reception
equipment market in Sweden and by late 1995 sales were almost entirely
confined to Mac systems.

Costs were little changed on 1994, however, with standard D2 Mac
equipment retailing for around SKr4,000 (#381) including VAT. More
popular Nordic package systems (one degree West and five degrees East)
including a 70cm dish and double LNB, however, fetched between SKr4,500-
5,000.

Figures released by the Swedish Association of Antenna Suppliers (CANT)
indicated that Finnish manufacturer Nokia and its associate companies
had a market share of up to 41 per cent. Other suppliers which were
strongly represented in the Swedish marketplace included Triax,
Amstrad, Philips and Pace.

Most industry sources felt Switzerland's DTH market was larger than
previously believed - with some estimates putting the total number of
dishes in the country at up to 120,000 - but they could not agree on
whether it was growing or relatively static.

Those serving the French-speaking community - effectively 40 per cent
of the population - nevertheless had some cause for optimism: besides
being able to reflect on the success of Telecom, they could look
forward to the launch of Canal Plus on Astra in early 1996.

Yet, while Eutelsat also had a large following (especially among the
country's expatriate communities), Astra channels remained the most
popular and could be received with 80cm systems which retailed for at
least SFr300 (#168). More expensive systems, however, could cost
viewers up to SFr1,200.

In the absence of a local production industry, several foreign
companies were well represented in Switzerland's DTH market. They
included Pace, Echostar and Technisat.

Sales of DTH systems rose significantly in Turkey in 1995 and towards
the end of the year were peaking at around 100,000 a month. Although
they were largely confined to rural areas and coincided with the
increased seasonal buying power of the local population, they also
pointed to a number of important developments in the Turkish market.

The most important of these was undoubtedly the rising popularity of
Turksat, which offered viewers over 10 Turkish-language channels,
including the pay-TV service Cine 5. Both these and Eutelsat's Turkish
services attracted a growing audience outside the main cities, which
were already served by numerous terrestrial broadcasters.

The cost of equipment, though little changed on 1994, also attracted
buyers from Syria, Iraq and Iran who subsequently supplied the DTH
markets of their countries. The cheapest Turksat equipment employed a
60cm dish and usually retailed for around $200 (including cable and
installation), while Hot Bird (90cm/1.2-metre) and general Eutelsat
(1.2/1.5-metre) systems cost more.

Cost was in fact the determining factor and as a result there was no
clear market-leader. However, receivers produced in the Far East by
Galaxy and Calibre sold well, while Raster and Laser Merih remained
among the country's own leading dish manufacturers.

DTH SURVEY:  UK

Population:        58.6m
TV homes:          22.402m
VCR homes:         16.488m
Cable connections: 3.181m (incl smatv)
cable penetration: 14.2% (incl smatv)
Dish total:        3.504m (3m)

The UK's DTH market ended 1995 on a strong note, with figures released
by Continental Research indicating that the number of installations in
the country had risen to over 3.5 million - effectively a 17 per cent
increase on the previous year's total.

This welcome upturn in what was, despite a recent slowdown in sales,
Europe's second largest DTH market could largely be put down to the
highly successful marketing techniques employed by BSkyB. While one in
three UK sales were admittedly to replace existing systems, viewers
could buy a receiver and dish for as little as #99 plus #30
installation (the former normally cost between #150-250) providing they
agreed to subscribe to the whole Sky package - including premium movie
and sports channels - for #24.99 a month. As a further incentive, they
were also given access to free sports and movies channels for six
months after signing up.

The UK market was also buoyed by the launch of several new channels
into Sky's 'basic' Multi-Channels tier. The introduction of Sci-Fi
channel, The History Channel, Sky Sports Gold, Paramount TV and
European Business News (EBN) to the Astra-delivered package brought
with it an increase from #9.99 per month to #10.99, but this didn't
seem to deter the market. New premium services Playboy, The Racing
Channel and The Disney Channel, which was offered free to subscribers
to Sky's film channels, also created extra publicity and marketing
support for the UK's main 'dish-driver.'

While Pace remained the market-leader, it faced strong competition from
several other companies, including Grundig Satellite Communications.
The latter had enjoyed considerable success since its launch in early
1994, while Amstrad, which at one time was the leading player in the
industry, continued to experience a downturn in its fortunes.

While the cost of analogue DTH equipment was significantly down on
previous years, the predicted price of digital receivers  - a hefty
#400-500 - was seen as a factor in BSkyB's decision to delay the
introduction of digital satellite television services, probably until
late 1996 or 1997.

Total 1995 dishes: 20.5m (1994 total: 16.8m)

47 VARIETIES

By applying the logic of digital to analogue Astra transponder 47,
reports Julian Clover, Sky has been improving its standing in
Continental Research's Star Report

Just how many channels is it possible to squeeze into a single
transponder? This is not a question involving bit rates for the
imminent digital era, but one which remains firmly in the analogue
domain, at least as far as Sky is concerned.

Astra transponder 47 is home to a fistful of Sky television services;
Sky Soap, Sky Travel, The History Channel, Sci-Fi Channel, Sky Sports
Gold, Sky Sports 2 and the 'non-aligned' Christian Channel. All are
proudly described by Sky as 'channels,' though only Sky Sports 2 is on-
air for a period longer than 16 hours - and that for only two
consecutive days. Some of these 'programme streams' are either owned or
controlled by BSkyB, while others, such as Sci-Fi, are merely sitting
tenants, albeit for only several hours at a time.

However, the sum of these various parts amounts to a more than
respectable, if variable product. The popularity of Sky Sports 2, for
instance, rests largely on whether its full-time sister channel is
screening an event which requires its normal football coverage to be
shunted across. And as BSkyB racks up the rights to more and more
events in the sporting calendar - Endsleigh league football has become
the latest - then Sports 2 will enjoy a greater share of the
recognition.

Sports though isn't the only audience-grabber on transponder 47; co-
habitor Sci-Fi has been performing remarkably well for a channel which
has only nine weekly hours of prime-time. A round-the-clock version is
available  for cable viewers only via Eutelsat, but this is not audited
by Continental Research's Star Report.

Sci-Fi Channel's opening programme, Inside Space, ranks ninth in the
list of top-rated transponder 47 programmes, while its first big movie,
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, came in at fifth position, despite
having been aired on several occasions by terrestrial television. The
audience level for Khan and, to a lesser extent, Alien are on a par
with movies screened by UK Gold - which, arguably, has the best crop of
movies of any basic channel.

The History Channel also has an audience to be proud of; at 109,000 its
top-rated programme would not look out of place in The Discovery
Channel's top 10, which begs the question what could it achieve if its
transmission hours were extended beyond 19.00?

Outside of the all-singing, all-dancing transponder 47, the other
newcomers to Sky's tiers have enjoyed a mixed response. Bravo's noon-to-
midnight cult television service is now sandwiched between business
news channel EBN (06.00-12.00) and Playboy channel (00.00-04.00).

EBN's audience is hard to quantify; by its very nature most of its
viewing takes place in City dealing rooms. But it also has a 24-hour
feed on Eutelsat Hot Bird 1, allowing direct-to-home viewing and, more
importantly cable retransmission, which is not necessarily included in
Bravo's viewing combo. The rows of zeros notched up by EBN during its
daily Astra transmission hours also belies an upswing in the number of
ABC1 viewers to Bravo's Astra transponder.

CAPE BLAZE HITS DSTV ROLL-OUT

A SERIOUS fire at the Cape Town factory producing Panasonic MPEG-2/DVB
receivers for MultiChoice's recently-launched DSTV service has worsened
an already severe shortage of boxes.

The fire, started by an electrical fault, caused R30 million (#5.31
million) worth of damage, destroying the production line from which
Panasonic was hoping to deliver 35,000 digital boxes before the end of
the year.

According to MultiChoice general manager, marketing, Cobus Scholtz,
Panasonic is hoping to restore full production by the end of January:
but he confirmed the fire had "severely affected" early roll-out
targets for the 16-channel DTH service.

Although Pace has pledged to step-up deliveries to supply "20-25,000"
DSTV receivers before Christmas, Scholtz said, "We had hoped to have
that many in the market right now." To date, he said, some 5,500 Pace
units had been delivered, along with "two to three thousand" from
Panasonic. Because of the shortages, MultiChoice is in talks with the
consortium launching a German-language digital package for Africa, with
a view to joint marketing of a Grundig digital IRD suitable for both
services. Rumours that Nokia boxes might also be shipped in to relieve
the crisis were dismissed: "Not true," Scholtz said, "not yet."

IRD SHORTAGES HIT UK TRADE

DESPITE Pace's efforts to boost output of analogue IRDs, the UK trade
reported serious shortages continuing into the peak pre-Christmas sales
season.

Pace said it had pulled out all the stops to up volume, with output of
analogue IRDs 30 per cent up on the same period last year. As a short-
term measure it resumed production of the old PRD800 receiver, with
scarcity of essential silicon the chief factor limiting MSS range
output.

The knock-on effect has left other manufacturers struggling to keep up
with demand. At least one brand - Maspro - sold out completely, with md
Chris Lack explaining that the last batch of Maspro ST8 MkII IRDs had
gone by mid-November: the stock was supposed to last until March.

Distributor Satellite Solutions' md Grant Lester reported "a
significant shortage... I've got five times more orders than stock.
Everything is pre-sold."  Grundig's Keith Armour confirmed that under-
supply was still a problem in the first weeks of December: "We've met
all our orders, but the problem is that people are looking to us to
fill the gap in the pipeline," he said. "The market's doing better than
any of us expected. Quarter Four '95 is up on '94 and '93 - it's the
best in the last three years."

BT OPENS UK UPLINK FOR PAS-4

BT HAS inaugurated a new uplink site at Martlesham, Suffolk to uplink
services to the PAS-4 satellite. "The PAS-4 look angle is so low so you
have to go east as far as you can," explained head of broadcast
services John Swingewood. "The best site we had was our research centre
at Martlesham Heath, where the original Sky uplink was sited."

BT has installed 16 and 13-metre antennas, one for C-Band and the other
for Ku-Band at a cost of over #3 million. "We don't spend that kind of
money unless we are confident that there is a market," said Swingewood.
The facility will be used for coverage of Asia and India with both
inbound and outbound traffic.

The service will be jointly marketed by BT and PanAmSat, who already
market services together with their third partner, Washington
International Teleport, including a 6MBit space segment on PAS-1.

The most likely first clients for the service are MultiChoice, Viacom
(for MTV and other services) and ART for its proposed services to the
region. BT is already transmitting backhaul services to PAS-4 for the
MultiChoice package in South Africa. Seven originate at Madley, where
they are taken from existing satellites, while the remaining seven are
delivered from the BT Tower in central London.

ORBIT BOOKS INTO EUROPE

ORBIT has booked three transponders on Intelsat 702 to allow small-dish
reception of its digital DTH pay-package across western Europe and
North Africa.

Orbit says the new capacity, which will fire up early in 1996, will
enable viewers from London to Algiers to access its channels via 80cm
dishes, giving the same level of service as provided to Middle Eastern
territories via Intelsat 704.

LEBANESE JOIN ARABSAT 2A

FUTURE Vision - the Lebanese broadcaster owned by billionaire prime
minister Rafiq Hariri - as well as Bahrain TV - have each booked a high-
power Ku-Band transponder on Arabsat 2A, the first of the second-
generation Aerospatiale craft scheduled for launch in July 1996.

In the interim, Future is expected to use a transponder on Arabsat 1DR
- two years after the Lebanese channel first went onto satellite, only
to be removed a few weeks later as a result of licensing problems.

Arabsat 2A, to be located at 26 degrees East, and its follow-up, 2B
(destined for 30.5 degrees East after a May 1997 launch) will each
carry 12 Ku-Band and 22 C-Band transponders. With domestic and regional
demand for the satellites building up, Arabsat is conducting a
feasibility study for a third new satellite.

THOMSON ANTI OPEN ACCESS DVB

THOMSON, first-year sole supplier of digital IRDs to DirecTv, sees a
similar pattern of exclusive deals driving the European market.
Delivering this year's Royal Television Society Shoenberg lecture in
London, Thomson research director David Brooks warned would-be digital
broadcasters that manufacturers would not be willing to bear the risks
of launching open-standard DVB boxes into the marketplace.

Exclusive or limited-supplier deals, such as those made by Canal Plus
in France, would be "the only way to ensure a return on investments,"
he said. With a million DSS sales clocked up, a new order for three
million MMDS digital set-tops from the US Tele-TV consortium, plus a
one-year exclusive window for Galaxy Latin America's digital IRDs,
Thomson has got further than most of its rivals.

Brooks believed that set-top-boxes would dominate the digital TV market
for several years, rather than integrated digital TV sets. "It's clear
the set-top-box offers the fastest way into the market," he said.
"Access control is the key issue here - it would be very difficult to
integrate a proprietary system into the TV set, in commercial terms."

Full integration would come, but only after interface requirements had
been fully standardised, and large (40-inch-plus) plasma display
technology had been brought to the market. He felt the DVB-proposed
"PCMCIA-like" common interface was "not the ideal solution,"
particularly in the "hostile environment" of the TV set. An
alternative, he added, could soon be available in the shape of "more
sophisticated smart cards" which would be able to cope with the full
MPEG-2 bitstream.

Terrestrial barely figures in Brooks' forecasts for European DVB market
growth, with satellite dominating for at least the first three years.
Brooks' forecasts (see table) were based on market projections for
France, Germany, UK, Benelux, Scandinavia and Italy.

PACE SCOOPS CHINA SET-TOP DEAL

PACE Micro Technology has won an order to supply three million  set-top
decoders to cable operators in China. The UK manufacturer will be
supplying the units to Guangdong Catv, a provincial cable operator,
over a three-year period.

Located on the Chinese border with Hong Kong, Guangdong Catv negotiated
the deal also on behalf of four other Chinese networks in the 66
million homes region, taking in the six million homes in the capital,
Guangzhou. The first 60,000 units, incorporating News Datacom's
NewsCrypt conditional access, will be delivered by June 1996.
Subsequent production of the units will be carried out by a
Pace/Guangdong joint venture company in China.

According to Pace estimates, China has almost 40 million cable homes
representing penetration of around 13 per cent of total households. The
systems themselves are small, with around 12,000, mainly low-capacity
networks carrying between eight and 20 channels. These typically
include the local terrestrial and government channels, but sometimes as
many as four channels from Star TV. By 2005 as many as 130 million
homes are expected to be connected. This is against the background of a
nationwide satellite dish ban.

BARCO SELLS ROSA TO GUANGDONG

BELGIAN cable equipment manufacturer Barco has sold its Rosa Catv
Management System and the Pulsar TV modulator to China. The products
are destined for the Guangdong Province Catv system. The Rosa system,
which has also been sold to operators in Taiwan and Australia, is set
to be operational across 40 headends in Guangdong Province by the end
of March 1996.

Rosa allows fully automated monitoring and control of headends through
a PC interface and can be operated from thousands of miles away. The
system continuously checks the performance of the headend and in the
event of a fault can switch to back-up modulators based on pre-set
parameters.

Pulsar is a microprocessor controlled TV modulator featuring its own
remote monitoring capabilities and Barco's unique concept of automatic
alignment to catv headends.

According to division manager, broadcast and cable products, Jos
Vancoppernolle, Asia now represents 20 per cent of Barco's business.
There are regular sales of fibre-optic and headend equipment and,
according to Vancoppernolle, plenty of interest in Rosa.

Many Barco products already have the capability to work with Chinese
graphics, and Mandarin software for Rosa is also being introduced.
Vancoppernolle said the investment for this could be recouped in as
little as six months.

ECHOSTAR DIGITAL BOX UNVEILED

WITH the launch of the Echostar 1 satellite from the Chinese Long March
rocket due on December 28, the US company displayed its first digital
satellite receiver at Hong Kong's Cable & Satellite Asia show in
December.

The MPEG-2-compatible receiver includes conditional access provided by
Nagra Plus of Switzerland. Digital encoding is supplied by Divicom.
Programme choice is made through a sophisticated EPG. "We've tried to
make it as simple as possible, some other brands make it quite
difficult to get from their menu back into the programming, you've got
to go through a lot of gyrations. We do it in one button," says
Echostar's Peter Knowles.

The utilities menu includes an aid to align the dish towards the
correct satellite. If the subscriber enters his zip code then the
receiver will automatically display the correct azimuth and elevation
angles for anywhere within the US. There is also a field strength
indicator, changing colour to green when the Echostar satellite is
found. Diagnostic features help installers talk through problems on the
telephone without the need to make house calls. Smart cards and phone
links through the RGA14 point can be checked.

Echostar's DBS system will offer over 100 channels of digital video and
250 channels of audio, transmitting across the US to 18-inch dishes.

S-A EXPANDS 8600 SET-TOP FACILITIES

SCIENTIFIC Atlanta is upping the bandwidth on its 8600 set-top box. A
new 750MHz version will be made available to the Asian market next year
having already been successfully deployed in the US where it is used by
the top 10 MSOs where 700,000 units have so far been shipped, says S-A.

Marketing manager, subscriber products international division broadband
communications, Vibha Rustagi said that operators would typically
purchase both the 550MHz and 750MHz versions. The 750MHz versions would
only then be deployed in homes which had subscribed to premium
channels, saving network operators a possible $15 (#10). Bandwidth of
550MHz can normally carry up to 60 channels.

The 8600 series features an on-screen display capable of individual
messaging either to individuals or to groups of subscribers. Pay-per-
view ordering can be made through impulse on the RF.

A key part of the 8600 is the electronic programme guide. Following the
familiar pattern of EPGs, subscribers can look up shows in the schedule
requesting greater detail on their desired programme choice. Through
'virtual channels' an operator can add additional sections of data,
perhaps with backing from a sponsor, which do not take up the full
amount of bandwidth required by a broadcast network, thus adding to the
customer's perceived value.

A built in set-top diagnostic enables the subscriber to quote a
reference number back to the service engineer, saving a house call if
the problem can be solved from the headend.

SATELLITE READY REVISITED

MITSUBISHI has joined the select band of manufacturers offering Nicam
and Dolby TV sets with on-board satellite receivers - recognising that
in the UK at least, Sky Television remains the chief source of surround
sound transmissions.

The Japanese manufacturer's latest AV18B and AV18BDS series offers 59cm
and 66cm models, in either Nicam or full Dolby Pro Logic versions, each
complete with integrated 150-channel satellite receiver/VideoCrypt
decoder.

The satellite section is pre-tuned to all current Astra (1A to 1D) TV
and radio channels, with dedicated Scart for simultaneous recording.
The sets offer many other advanced features, - including NTSC and Secam
playback capability.

Interestingly the satellite-equipped models retail at just #50 more
than the terrestrial-only versions, with the top model to sell at
#899.99.

HIGH-END CHAPARRAL

US receiver maker Chaparral has never been one to shy away from the
high end of the market. On a visit to its 'Euro-bunker,' Julian Clover
finds out why

Craig Howard is a long way from home. On this occasion, the US receiver
and LNB manufacturer's representative in Europe is in Heerhugowaard, a
suburb of Amsterdam, and nominally Chaparral's European headquarters.

Before arriving in Europe, the company had considered London as a
possible base, but with its Dutch distributor, The Satellite Shop,
already making a major contribution to the business, coupled with
favourable local regulations for the incorporation of foreign
companies, the Dutch capital became the preferred option.

The Satellite Shop is a major element in the Dutch DTH business. From
its base in Heerhugowaard, TSS has developed from being a dealer to
distributor and is now even getting into the manufacturing business.
Its newest product is a low-cost mount, which allows the tracking of
inclined orbit satellites, preferably as an accompaniment to
Chaparral's high-end receivers for the motorised market.

"We knew that we wanted to get a base in Europe, but we just didn't
know where to commit," explains Howard. "The Satellite Shop has always
housed our Info Centre and we've done a lot of testing here in the past
of alpha products. We decided early in 1994 that if we were going to
base somewhere this should be it."

Chaparral's first reconnaissance trip to Europe was nine years ago when
Dave Thomas was despatched from the company's base in San Jose to find
distributors for its product. "They were essentially just dealers,
hobbyists who were fascinated with the technology," says Howard. "Some
of them have developed into people like Rens Maas or Steve Chilver, who
became people who were significant in their respective markets."

Chaparral Europe is, in fact, something of a misnomer; Howard - whose
father Taylor is chairman of the board of the SBCA, America's satellite
trade association - spends at least half of his time outside of the
Netherlands. "There was a really long debate in the company as to
whether I was going to be based in Dubai after Spain, because we had so
much going on there. But, we've spent a long time developing
partnerships in the key Middle East markets, and they're working out
very well. We're comfortable that we've covered there," he says.

In addition to the US and Europe, Chaparral boasts offices in Beijing
and Jakarta. The company also a presence in South America, though not
an office.

Feeds and LNBs remain, according to Howard, Chaparral's lifeblood.
"It's interesting because in the US we're so well known for our feeds
and LNBs and in so many other markets it's receivers - that's what
we're famous for in Europe. We sell a lot more feed and LNB products in
Europe than we do receivers dollarwise, but we hold that high-end niche
which most people have left alone."

In the US, Chaparral has pulled out of the receiver business - the
result of the market's recent shift away from 'backyard' C-Band to
digital DBS. In addition, the cost of Japanese-manufactured equipment
has fallen as the dollar continues to take a pounding from the Yen.
However, receivers for the US business and educational sector, where
Chaparral is the market-leader, remain in production.

"Internationally, our receivers are still quite strong and there are
three models we manufacture for markets specifically other than the
US," says Howard. The Monterey 140 and MC115 are set to be joined by a
new product, the 200C, for educational and overseas distance-learning
markets. The new product has more extensive control via telephone lines
and PC links.

In Europe, the company hasn't been afraid to mix and match its products
to suit its target markets. In the UK, for instance, not only has
Chaparral elected to stay out of the low-end receiver business, but it
has taken a unique approach to the high-end niche. "The UK market
nearly demands that you have VideoCrypt built-in, or the ability to add
it later on. Steve Chilver Trading - our exclusive full-line
distributor in the UK - is a value-added reseller and they make some
specific models for the market, like the rebranded Highway version."

But as always with bespoke tailoring, it doesn't come cheap. The
Monterey 140, which retails for #1,500 without a decoder goes up in
price by another #1,000 by the time either D2 Mac or VideoCrypt
decoders are added.

With digital on the horizon and most new non-Astra channels taking the
MPEG route, won't demand for motorised systems simply dry up? "People
who have exposure to satellite currently have a better taste for it.
People that go digital immediately are not going to know any better,"
replies Howard. Chaparral's receivers too are future-proof, or at least
compatible with digital decoders, unlike those of its competitors.

"Satellite receivers became such a competitive business that most
people looked at the circuitry and said why bother in a market for that
is going to be relatively slim," says Howard. He believes that southern
Africa, among other emerging markets, will eventually see combined
analogue and digital receivers - a product which will prove expensive,
but for which there will probably be great demand.

RAINBOW WARRIORS

South Africa may have the first MPEG-2 DSTV service, but it seems the
Rainbow Nation will demand a wider variety of services. Nick Snow
reports from Satsem '95

If ever a land was made for direct-to-home satellite television
services it was South Africa, where the 'Rainbow Nation' is spread
across distances that defy the European imagination. In 1973 the South
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) said "DBS is the obvious
route... but economic factors are a problem."

The quotation could happily have run 22 years later as the headline for
Satsem '95 in November, the second annual gathering at Johannesburg's
World Trade Centre organised by SCASA (Satellite Communications
Association of South Africa) for the growing DTH industry.

The industry conference allied to a small exhibition brought together
the main players from broadcasters to installers, and brought out the
main issues confronting this potentially huge market.

From a scratch start South Africa recently became the world's first
digital satellite broadcasting nation with full DVB MPEG-2
compatibility following the launch of MultiChoice DSTV off of PAS-4.
MultiChoice is, of course, part of the Nethold sphere of pay-television
companies which, among others, includes South Africa's long-established
terrestrial pay-TV broadcaster M-Net, encryption services provider
Irdeto and signal distribution offshoot Orbicom. It is hard to
overestimate the group's dominance in this its home market, and the
lack of current competition was high on the agenda of this gathering of
independent-minded distributors, dealers and installers.

In theory, there was good news for them. Gert Claassen, CEO of SABC,
arrived to announce it was pressing ahead with plans to launch (at
least) five analogue free-to-air channels on PAS-4 and Intelsat 704,
and by summer 1996 eight digital subscription channels building to 21
channels by July 1998.

Failing to arrive were the team from Africa Satellite Entertainment
Corporation (ASEC), which has transponder rights on Intelsat 704 and
whose test-card was still promising a launch of services in the last
week of November.

Suddenly, South Africa was to be awash with signals both digital and
analogue, although apart from MultiChoice's supermarket shelf of the
leading channel brands from Europe and the US, and SABC's rebroadcast
of national and regional channels, there was little clue what would be
on them. And would it matter anyway? Availability of receivers - in
particular the DSTV receivers of exclusive licensees Pace and Panasonic
- was a dominant theme. At least four of five receivers were at the
show and after some cajoling several of them worked. Estimates of how
many would be available by Christmas '95 ranged from virtually nil to
50,000.

An inauspicious start it might seem - although dire warnings about the
perils of regular complete signal loss for viewers in South Africa's
hostile climate (the idea of a small problem with a digital signal is
apparently in the same category of wishful thinking as being a little
bit pregnant), lead some to imply installers would be better off
starved of supply until they'd had some practice. Needless to say, the
installers didn't see it that way.

MultiChoice, though, remains relaxed. And why not? Its service is very
expensive (possibly over #50 a month for the full package and up to
#500 for the receiver) but it hits breakeven at not much over 200,000
subs or 10 per cent of the target affluent white market. And in a
country where most urban white homes sport notices pronouncing armed
response alarms, it isn't difficult to see them paying up for more in-
home entertainment.

Meantime, there remains a vast if less affluent market to be served and
the ANC government is anxious it should be recognising broadcasting as
a potentially benevolent binding element for the Rainbow Nation.

It seems certain that either through the SABC (whose future is in doubt
but some form of privatisation seems the most likely option), or more
likely a commercial joint venture with MultiChoice, a range of analogue
services can and will co-exist alongside DSTV.

If, however, everyone pursues the digital dream too soon, many felt
South Africa could have the unwelcome distinction of being the first
market outside the US into the digital market and the first to be
forced to abandon it.

QUALITY TIME

Gate numbers weren't, perhaps, all they might have been at Hong Kong's
Cable and Satellite Asia exhibition, allowing vendors to spend a little
'quality time' with their potential customers

Along the growth curve of satellite exhibitions Cable & Satellite Asia
is, like the market it serves, still in its genesis. However, Year Two
of the show, which took place at Hong Kong's Convention and Exhibition
Centre (December 6-8), proved that the Singapore office of Reed
Exhibition Companies is making steady progress in its development. 120
international exhibitors were present, between them boasting as many as
90 new products. Visitor numbers nudging just 2,000 were approximately
a third down on a year ago, which was attributed by some to MipAsia
taking place the week before and not simultaneously, as it did in 1994.

Nevertheless, Cable & Satellite Asia '95 witnessed a 20 per cent growth
in size and the organiser is banking on further 30 per cent growth for
this year's event, which again takes place in Hong Kong November 20-22.
And according to Jimmy Lau, regional vice president, Reed Exhibition
Companies, the amount of floorspace booked for 1997 is double again.

"This year we have seen an even higher number of overseas visitors,
people who actually make plans to come in and visit the show," says
Lau. "From my conversations with the exhibitors, they've maybe come
across only one dissatisfied customer, the rest are making good
contacts."

One problem which seems to afflict Cable and Satellite Asia, as it does
with the sister show in London, is a shortage of cable operators.
Though some were present, particularly at the conference, Lau has some
ideas up his sleeve to boost their attendance in future years.

Yet, there was certainly no lack of exhibitors targeting the cable
sector; among others, the mighty Americans

General Instrument and Scientific Atlanta were present, as were Euro
suppliers Barco and Sagem. The latter proving that there is a market
for D2 Mac, even in Asia.

Barco of Belgium, took the opportunity to launch its Pulsar remote-
monitoring TV modulator into the Asian market. The company, which
counts Hong Kong among almost 30 offices, announced that it had already
sold both Pulsar and Rosa catv management system to the Guangdong
Province Catv System. Guangdong, in fact, was on everybody's lips,
especially because of Pace's announcement that it was supplying the
region with three million cable set-tops. Guangdong, located on China's
border with Hong Kong, also acquired hardware on behalf of other
provinces within the PRC. The first 60,000 Pace units are slated for
delivery in June.

Pace shared its stand with the BBC, apparently to promote a common
terrestrial/satellite digital platform, an ambition which extends
beyond the confines of their domestic, UK markets. Though according to
John Sykes, head of BBC Resource's transmission section, development
plans have stalled slightly of late because of the debate over QAM
variants. With NTL having proposed 2QAM for the UK and most of the rest
of Europe pushing for 8QAM, Pace, he suggested, would probably take the
commercial decision to include both in its box.

Though attendees came from right across the region, including the
Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand, Lau says he wants to build
up the numbers coming from Taiwan and India, which he says are still
strangers to the show. "There are more people coming who are more
interested in hardware than programming, but I think this will increase
as we continue our association with Casbaa," he says.

The involvement of Casbaa (the Cable and Satellite Broadcasting
Association) - itself a growing industry force in the region - produced
a conference line-up which read like a who's who in the industry in the
Asia region. Bill Hooks, (outgoing) president HBO Asia, Gary Davey,
Star TV's managing director and Casbaa and Turner's Far East president,
Ted McFarland, made for a formidable line-up. Lau though suggests that
McFarland's boss, Ted Turner (or is it now Gerry Levine) might even be
tempted to appear at a future conference.

Programmers were few and far between on the exhibit floor, but not
entirely absent. ESPN and CNBC were both present, as was Turner
International. However, Star was there only in the guise of its
hardware arm, Starnet, and satellite operators were also conspicuous by
their absence in the exhibition hall.

The next Cable and Satellite Asia will run parallel to Reed's
Intermedia show, which has been a successful exhibition in its own
right in both the US and Singapore. Lau's aim is for synergies between
multimedia companies and cablecos, already flowering in the US, to also
be cultivated in the Asia Pacific markets.

TRANSPONDER WATCH

45W: PAS-1

PAS-3R is due to fly with an Ariane 4 launch vehicle to 43 degrees
West, joining this satellite which launched in June 1988. The original
PAS-3 met a watery grave a year ago. The new satellite is an HS601
satellite with 16 C-Band and 16 Ku-Band transponders, and will be used
for television programme distribution on both sides of the Atlantic and
in North and South America and Africa. NHK feeds are now at 68.5
degrees East at 12GHz.

37.5W: Orion 1

NTL has a five-year contract with Orion for distribution to cable
headends. London's Channel One will be uplinked from London in digital
MPEG-2, DVB-compliant System 3000 for around 40 cable systems, each
with a top-specification 2.4-metre dish. Most signals on this satellite
are actually acceptable on dishes half that size. The Yugoslavian peace
deals prompted the return of TV from Pale on 12586MHz vertical and a
newcomer is South Korean KDBS, every night at around 19.00-20.00GMT in
Pal on 12654MHz vertical, Tp.3 with a good signal originating in
Germany. Hindi-Urdu channel Asianet is on 11585MHz horizontal from New
Jersey, USA and is probably the best of the bunch, especially as it
remains, for the time being, in-the-clear. Plenty of feeds have been
noted on 11539MHz vertical.

l 27.5W: Intelsat 601

BBC Prime slogs away in D2 Mac on Tp.71 vertical along with fellow UK
Travel channel in Tp. 63B, while on the opposite polarity CMT Europe
feeds into Europe from the US 24- hours-a-day, but at a signal strength
that makes smaller dish reception difficult. SIS has long used a
transponder on this satellite to feed UK betting shops and is on
11591MHz horizontal, hence the 1.2-metre fixed polarity and position
dishes close to many UK betting establishments. The other B Mac signal,
a system that remains unhacked, is UK cable channel SelecTV, sharing
the lower part of Travel's transponder. FilmNet has a digital multiplex
on this satellite and some UK cable-only channels use the MPEG-2
compression system here too.

29.4W: Intelsat 504

Intelsat 504 was removed from geostationary orbit in mid-November. It
was launched in 1982 serving the Atlantic Ocean Region. The oldest
Intelsat - 501 - is still in service.

21.5W: Intelsat K & 512

US wrestling for Sky One continues to be fed over this craft at
11532MHz vertical in NTSC. Feeds for the Mir-Atlantis space expedition
were seen on 11499MHz horizontal and 11533MHz vertical. New Intelsats
due above the Euro horizon this year are 708, at 50 degrees West, 709,
at 56 degrees West and 803 at 64 degrees East. It is at the end of this
year that two degrees spacing around 60-66 degrees East is implemented.

19W: TDF1/2

There are three active transponders. Canal Plus on Tp.5 1804MHz, Cine
Cinemas on Tp.9 11881MHz and Canal France International on 12034MHz,
all in D2 Mac. Generally, the situation now is that there are only
seven high-power DBS satellites active in European skies which carry
less than 10 unencrypted TV channels. Apart from second-hand value for
broadcasts to Scandinavia, the European DBS satellites each with five
high-power 100 watt transponders have proved to be the wrong platform
for the wrong job.

14W: Ekspress 2

The Ekspress satellite has four more transponders than the preceding
Gorizont class; 10 C-Band and two Ku-Band transponders are available.
An adaptable mixture of cross-strapping and six antennas allows more
flexibility than before. This satellite has maintained station-keeping
better than any other Russian satellite to date, apart from the Gals
DBS craft. TV use is confined to C-Band and amounts to six channels;
Apna, Muslim, RTPi, Cuba, TV3 Russia and ORT Russia, sharing four
transponders.

5W: Telecom 2A

Tucked away on teletext was a short but notable announcement that TF1
and France Television (operators of France 2 and 3) are to join forces
to investigate digital pay-TV services via Eutelsat. France Telecom
would appear to have under-estimated the in-orbit capacity required for
TV services.

3E: Telecom 1C

After Flight 80's success at delivering a space-telescope, Ariane
Flight 81 returned to the serious business of satellite TV and took
Telecom 2C and Insat 2C into orbit. Bayern 3 broadcast the launch live
on Astra, as it has most recent Ariane launches. Insat 2C is the first
of the Insat 2 series to be for telecommunications-only; there is no
meteorology equipment on-board. In place of that payload there are two
Ku-Band transponders. Insat 2C will be located at 93.5 degrees East.
The French satellite will replace Telecom 1C this month and bring much-
needed second-generation Ku-capacity to the French Telecom portfolio.
The new satellite has C-Band and 12GHz capacity in horizontal as well
as the Telecom 1 series vertical polarisation. Feeds of the US
President's visit to Ireland for BBC News were noted on 12648MHz
vertical. Also, inserts for the terrestrial channel TV de Catalunya
appeared. Play from the ATP-Championship-tour in Germany destined for
Sky was seen in-the-clear on 12606MHz vertical.

5E Tele-X & Sirius

Swedish channel SVT 2 has switched to digital format on 12422MHz.

13E: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1

La Cinquieme has joined Arte on Tp.26 11080MHz vertical. It shows an
educational mix of programmes each daytime. RTL-2 has been joined by a
Jazz sound sub-carrier of unknown origin on 8.10MHz, 11096MHz
horizontal, but probably a filler from RFE. Italian TV channels Rai Uno
and Rai Due moved here from 10 degrees East last year. The last
international TV service from Italy was Raisat on the Olympus satellite
at 19 degrees West, which died in August 1993. Rai is to join the
international TV league this year when a satellite-delivered service to
the Americas and Australia is anticipated. VOA Europe, a music and
speech mix reflecting the American way of life, has been taken by cable
and a few terrestrial stations over the years. At present it uses
Deutsche Welle TV sub-carriers but US government cuts are forcing the
station to find private financing. However it has been granted a
reprieve until March, when it might have to leave the air. In Europe,
CNN and NBC do such do good job in the private sector, that VOA and
radio's days must be numbered. Latest VOA convert is Melody 91.5 FM
heard on a recent visit to Beirut. The 36MHz, six-channel Viacom
digital multiplex signal on this satellite includes an MTV feed, MTV
Italian and German streams, Sci-Fi Channel and Bloomberg TV, a version
of the already successful US financial service on PAS-2. The analogue
VH-1 Germany signal on 11238MHz horizontal has ceased and dual-
illuminates the digital multiplex. Tp.40 12521MHz on this satellite has
been taken by AB-1 Channel, a French family entertainment network in
analogue Pal, for cable networks. Tp.41 is used by both WTN and APTV
for digital feeds from the Gray's Inn Road Teleport in London. XXX-TV,
or TV Erotica, on 11534MHz in D2 Mac, has been deemed too hot for
Britain, if not for Hot Bird 1, and has been given the same treatment
meted out to Red Hot Television. The UK Heritage minister has issued an
order outlawing the supply of smart cards, programmes and advertising
related to the channel. At least two more adult channels are due on-air
this year, Babylon Blue and Adam and Eve, the latter with no link to
the US channel of the same name. The Rabin funeral last year was the
cause of largest bookings of space segment yet, according to Maxat.
Also using the resources of adaptable Maxat; Herbalife TV has been seen
on this satellite at 12586MHz vertical. Longer term, Eutelsat has
agreed the launch next year, of three satellites with Arianespace. They
are Hot Bird 4 and two other (W24) satellites at other locations.

16E: Eutelsat II F3

The most obvious change on this satellite is the colourful Thaiwave,
from Thailand each evening around 18.00-20.00GMT. In a welcome addition
to satellite TV, the tests are seen every evening on Tp.22, 11163MHz
horizontal with audio at 6.6MHz. Scrambling of the signal will follow
and the fee will be DM56 each month. Egyptian TV is to add another
relay of its international service this year. Besides the relay on this
satellite, Arabsat C-Band at 31 degrees East and 1 degree West
Intelsat, a new relay to the Americas starts in May via the Alphastar
DBS satellite, or AT&T's Telstar 402R as it correctly known. It is
owned by Canadian-based Tee-Comm, and a medium-power, 100-channel
service to the US will start early this year to 60cm dishes from 89
degrees West. ATN, Asian Television Network will also join them.
Radiotelevisao Portuguesa Internaaional, which reaches most corners of
this small globe, has never been easy to find programme details for. An
Internet web though has just opened to provide those missing facts. The
channel will probably be available live via the same route within a
couple of years. TV Roumania International and for a while Actualitati
Radio, the channels that sadly could not bring you President
Ceausescu's Christmas message in 1989, seem to be fully operational
from the new Bucharest Scientific Atlanta uplink to Tp.37, 11575MHz
vertical 19.30-23.00GMT daily. An indication of the true pace of change
there is the recent ban on the cable TV relay of Duna TV from Hungary
in nearby Timisoara. TVRi was formed as many eastern European nations
have been starting satellite TV services for expatriates or foreign
audiences. The abandoned Polsat slot at 11638MHz horizontal was
occupied by Apna TV, the Hindi channel also at 11 degrees West Ku-Band,
but has now ceased.

19.2E: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1E

The end of next month sees CNBC launch more fully on Astra with Asian,
live US and four hours of The European Money Wheel programme. Astra 1E
is invisible to most fixed-dish owners due the frequency band used. The
satellite tested at around 14.7 degrees East and had been moved into
position by the first week of December, after blank carrier tests but
no analogue pictures were seen. As production rates and costs will be a
factor in the take-up of DVB digital TV, the news of a new single chip
receiver, the LS64704, from LSI Logic Corp, is a welcome development.
Early users will be ZDF and ARD, which start parallel transmissions of
their analogue Pal signals soon. America One is the new audio service
on VH-1 Tp.22 at 11538MHz, 7.74MHz. Live speech programming is provided
by National Public radio in Washington and Public Radio International
of Minneapolis. The service was due to start January 1 and is provided
by successful radio-relay agent WRN, World Radio Network, which now
runs four different programmes on various satellites. The operating
frequencies at this location are now 10700-12100MHz. There are various
ways of achieving such reception, but the new Universal LNBs are
probably the most cost-efficient and flexible units yet produced for
the European market. The lack of digital signals and suitable receivers
effectively rules out the need for DBS band reception, at least at
presently. No serious BSkyB digital involvement is expected until 1997.
As we enter this New Year, the channels now at this location look quite
varied. There are two clear news channels, Sky News and CNN, as well as
portions of NBC/CNBC. There are also two clear sports channels, multi-
lingual Eurosport and German DSF. TNT is the only clear English/French
film channel, sharing time with Cartoon Network. Arte is a clear
cultural German/French channel with some original-language programming.
It is a rather long list, but in addition to the above there are the
clear German broadcasters, both public and private, four channels for
the Dutch market and some offerings from further afield; Japan's NHK
through JSTV, Mexico's Galavision, Hindi Zee TV and two Chinese
channels. Three versions of TV3 for Denmark, Norway and Sweden,
accounting for three transponders, looks wasteful though, while Spanish
thematic channels absorb another three. QVC's home shopping service is
the only free access VideoCrypt signal in Europe, and the remaining
signals on the satellites are either German or UK-based scrambled
channels, mainly with Videocrypt scrambling, though some run dual VC2
codes. Also, 58 different radio programmes in an assortment of
languages are transmitted on FM audio sub-carriers.

20E: Telstar 301/

Arabsat 1DR

If it was not for the cooling effect of winter temperatures on our LNB
unit, we would have lost the signals from the Orbit barker channel plus
Syrian, Sudanese and the four ART channels on this satellite. All
signals are in the 3740-4060MHz range, are horizontal and, thus, limp
into Europe.

28.5E: DFS Kopernikus 2 Flight 2

VT4 for the Flemish audience uses digital capacity played out from the
Maxat teleport at Brookmans Park, using the Tandberg, Sagem and Divicom
system on 12544MHz vertical. Other occupants are the Hungarian
scrambled music channel Top-TV and Czech channels Premiera and Cable
Plus. The satellite is also used for video feeds within Germany and
beyond.

42E: Turksat 1B

Look out for Bosnian TV from Sarajevo - the logo is BIH. The signal may
appear here or on a Eutelsat, although reports of it being ready for
the New Year proved over-optimistic. Kanal 6 and Interstar both
suffered programme suspension at the end of last year, puzzling many
viewers. The Turkish state regulator had upheld complaints against the
channels over political, sexual and economic allegations made on news
and current affairs programmes.

68.5E: PAS-4

Doordarshan TV International (DDI) is on this satellite on C-Band at
Tp.12C 4040MHz horizontal with programming from 03.30 to 0630GMT in
Hindi and English. It brought news of the official opening of DD3, a
new domestic Indian TV broadcaster. All other TV direct from Indian is
on satellites beyond the Euro-arc, including NEPC (the exception,
spotted this month on 66 degrees East), another new Indian channel
which has taken to air with Hindi family programmes. BT at Martlesham
in Suffolk has installed a new dish to access this satellite and is
already supplying programmes into the South African market. The look-
angle to this satellite is low, hence the easterly location.

71E: Gals 1

Gals 2 was launched by a Proton-K rocket on November 17 and has the
same three wide Ku-Band transponders as Gals-1. The orbital destination
is still far from clear but it was at 87.5 degrees East when last
spotted and  drifting at a daily rate of one degree West. A clutch of
reports have the satellite variously leased to Chinese Land Group.
Shareholders include the Loral Corp, General Instrument  and TCI Cable
TV Co, British General Telecommunications Ltd and Asian TV network, a
South African concern and Russian State broadcasting. They all talk
about a co-location here or further over at 31 degrees East. The Gals-1
craft spent some time at 44 degrees East with Russian TV relays in the
12GHz band. The South African IBA has even approved initial consent for
a space TV service from Gals, but a location at the hot South African
51dBW slot at 66 degrees East and PAS-4 at 68.5 degrees East would seem
more logical.

80E: Gorizont 24

Be thankful this satellite is a difficult one to catch; the former
Kazakh TV occupant has been criticised for televising executions. More
acceptable behaviour is seen on HTB (NTV), as seen at 11575MHz vertical
on 16 degrees, East and also from TV6 Moscow.

100.5E: Asiasat 2

A Long March 2F rocket took Asiasat 2 aloft from Xichang in Sichuan at
the end of last year. The Lockheed Martin series 7000 satellite is
equipped with 24 C-Band and nine Ku-Band transponders. Known bookings
are for Deutsche Welle, RTP Portugal, APTV and Star TV, as well as
China, Vsat systems and other telecommunications projects. Star TV
plans expansion, despite continuing financial losses ascribe by
management to it still being in "investment mode." Those plans include
better targeting of specific countries instead of pan-Asian services.
China Central TV has started to test digital TV services; a film
channel, sports, entertainment and a clear youth/science/military or
'variety channel,' will use capacity here or on Chinasat 5 at 115.5
degrees East. It is notable that the Chinese Public TV station did not
show the Asiasat 2 launch live, in case of public humiliation in a
repeat of the disaster a year ago. Echostar 1, a US DBS satellite bound
for 101 degrees West, is the next Chinese launch and aims to rival the
already established DirecTv.

116 E: Mugunghwa 2

The launch of Koreasat 2, also known as Mugunghwa 2, should have taken
place around New Year. To attend to the problems which shortened the
life of the first satellite, McDonnell-Douglas worked on the Delta 2
rocket's pressure and temperature systems and then successfully used
the same type of vehicle to launch a Canadian Radarsat from California
in November. This year will see the success or failure of the new
Ariane 5, the Russian Proton and the Chinese Long March launchers.

CLT CONFIRMS INTENTION TO JOIN CANALSATELLITE

Canal Plus' digital DTH company Canalsatellite is being valued in
preparation for the entry of la Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT) as a shareholder (C&SE Vol.12 No.24). "We are
currently in negotiation with Canal Plus about joining the capital of
Canalsatellite," confirmed Geneviave Yver, senior manager at CLT's
digital arm, Club RTL. "However the value of Canalsatellite has to be
first established, as we do not think it is worth the amount cited by
Canal Plus, of around Fr4 billion (#526m)."

According to Patrick Jousseaume, media analyst at stockbroker Ferri,
Canalsatellite was valued at Fr1 billion when it launched as an
analogue service in November 1992 and should now be worth Fr2-3
billion. If CLT were to take a 25% stake, as has been suggested, it
would correspond to between Fr500 and Fr750 million. Canalsatellite's
ownership would then stand as follows: Canal Plus (52.5%); CLT (25%);
Compagnie Generale des Eaux (15%); Chargeurs (7.5%). Canalsatellite is
currently owned by Canal Plus (70%), CGE (20%) and Chargeurs (10%).

Several factors have pushed CLT to change its strategy. First, the
investment needed to launch its own French-speaking digital bouquet of
25 thematic channels was estimated at around Fr5 billion compared with
Fr400 million invested by Canal Plus in Canalsatellite. CLT has not
halted its own digital plans so far, revealed Yver. "Until a final
agreement on CLT joining Canalsatellite is reached, we will continue
working on our own bouquet. We intend to be an active partner in
Canalsatellite and bring our knowledge in marketing and programmes."

For the deal to go-ahead, all shareholders (Canal Plus, CGE, Chargeurs,
CLT) have to agree, said a source at Canal Plus. An agreement before
the launch of Canalsatellite planned at the end of the first quarter of
1996 is preferred, but the shareholders do not outrule the discussions
continuing.

For Havas, the common shareholder in CLT and Canal Plus,  CLT joining
Canalsatellite would resolve Havas' concern over the two companies
launching two competing bouquets. Anne Brucy, Havas senior manager,
said, "We are glad that things are developing as they are. We always
expected that only one bouquet would be launched."

CLT also faces difficulties on the German market where a recent article
in German magazine Der Spiegel claimed that Bertelsmann was close to a
take- over of CLT.

The German story was flatly denied the next day (December 27) by the
Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Junker, however, who claimed he
had "the personal assurance" from CLT's Belgian shareholder Albert
Frare that he was not to sell his stake in the company.

Junker did confirm that CLT is negotiating taking a 25% stake in Canal
Plus digital bouquet Canalsatellite. CLT has long been battling with co-
shareholder Bertelsmann over control of German TV station RTL.
Bertelsmann which controls 48.1% of the capital wants to buy out the 2%
owned by Burda to reach 50.1% of RTL capital.

This delicate position of the CLT in France and in Germany goes some
way towards justifying the rumours about the sale of CLT to a
conglomerate composed of Bertelsmann/Canal Plus/Havas.

Industry observers suggest CLT may now take the option of opening up
its capital (Fr16 billion or #2bn) - to foreign partners like Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp, Disney, Viacom or Time Warner, to ward off
Bertelsmann and Canal Plus.

UK GOLD, VIDEOTRON CLASH OVER PACKAGING

Failed year-long negotiations have resulted in UK Gold instructing
Videotron to stop distributing the channel to its London and Hampshire
franchises from February 12, a move described by Benjamin Ball, head of
programming at Videotron, as "a strong-arm negotiating tactic."

The crux is Videotron's refusal to carry UK Gold on its lowest
retention tier of five channels called Option 1, (to which channels can
be added a la carte). Gold is carried in a 10-channel tier called
Standard Pack - Videotron's 'big basic' is called Super Pack.

Videotron claims that UK Gold is asking for #0.10 per subscriber more
than any other cable operator because it wants flexibility of
packaging, and is bundling UK Gold with UK Living, making it uneconomic
to carry UK Gold alone.

Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, told C&SE, "It's nothing
to do with UK Living. We offer them the same single channel deal as to
the rest of the industry. We believe that UK Gold should go to the most
widely distributed package, not in the second tier. Videotron
distributes UK Gold as an o la carte channel against our wishes. We
have offered deals on lower than 95% penetration, but there's a price.
They can keep their tiered structure and even a la carte, but they will
have to pay a tiered price. We are buying top quality content and it's
expensive. We need realistic penetration rates to sell. We won't
jeopardise 98% of our business for 2%, giving preferential terms."

UK Gold is received by 87% of Videotron subscribers, the remainder
could do so for #1 as an a la carte channel, or #3 pcm for the next
tier. Unconfirmed industry estimates put the current price per
subscriber for UK Gold at around #0.28 and #0.38, with current
invoicing to Videotron around #0.45.

Videotron says it is resisting attempts by UK Gold to impose
contractual conditions that do not give its customers a flexible low-
cost cable TV service. Steinberg countered, "Videotron goes on about
how much better its packaging is, but its penetration levels are the
same as the rest of the industry - 21%. As Option 1 only has a couple
of channels, the terrestrial channels and their interactive services,
their penetration rate is actually a lot lower. Let them make their
interactive services a la carte."

Videotron responds that it has one of the lowest churn rates in the
industry and is building penetration by removing the financial barrier
to entry. Videotron intends to continue negotiations with UK Gold,
which is also hopeful the dispute will be resolved.

ASTRA 1E BEGINS DIGITAL BROADCAST

The first digital services have been switched on to the newly-
commissioned Astra 1E. However, the lack of available receivers means
that the services are only being viewed by a select few.

The first two channels to be switched on were the German national
public broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Transponder 71). Since December 31 the
clear MPEG-2 transmissions have been broadcast direct from SES in
Luxembourg after being converted from the analogue format.

The French Canalsatellite package is using transponders 66 and 70; the
transmissions had previously been made from Astra 1D, which also
operates in the Astra 1E band. The number of channels included in the
multiplex package continues to vary.

Nethold is using transponders 77 and 80 for its test transmissions from
its digital centre in Hilversum. Again, the number of programmes
included is regularly varied, but will include channels in
MultiChoice's Scandinavian package.

MultiChoice premium channel FilmNet was rebranded from January 1. Astra
channel FilmNet Plus became FilmNet 1 while the Thor-delivered FilmNet:
The Complete Movie Channel is now titled FilmNet 2.

REWE BUYS INTO PRO 7

Germany's largest food retailing group Rewe entered the media business
last week with the purchase of a 40% stake in commercial TV station Pro
7, set up by Thomas Kirch and Pro 7 chairman Georg Kopfler in 1989.
Rewe is thought to have paid around DM60 million (#27m) for the shares,
which it bought off the two Munich banks BFH Bank and Bayerische
Hypotheken (which held 75% of the shares). The two banks are now left
with a 35.5% share in Pro 7, while Kirch still holds 24.5%.

ORBIT INTO EUROPE

Orbit has booked three transponders on Intelsat 702 to allow small-dish
reception of its digital DTH pay-package across western Europe and
North Africa. The new capacity, which will fire up early in 1996, will
enable viewers from London to Algiers to access its channels via 80cm
dishes, giving the same level of service as provided to Middle Eastern
territories via Intelsat 704.

The three transponders will enable Orbit to offer its full 30-plus TV
and radio channels, though in Europe access is likely to be restricted
to those (chiefly Arabic-language) channels for which Orbit holds
rights outside the Middle East region.

AFCO BACKS ARABS

For the first time, the French cable operators' association AFCO has
demanded the authorisation to carry North African channels (C&SE Vol.12
No.23). Until now, this kind of demand has been made by individual
operators and didn't succeed. Under the umbrella of AFCO, the cable
operators now stand more chance of success. During the December meeting
in Cotonou (Benin, Africa), the head of French regulatory body, CSA,
Herve Bourges, asked the French president of the Republic, Jacques
Chirac, to allow the CSA to sign agreements with Arabic channels. AFCO
argues that cable should receive the same treatment as satellite which
is allowed to broadcast Arabic-speaking channels without regulation.

KIRCH REACHES COMPROMISE WITH MMBG

Seemingly defeated in the digital decoder war in Germany, Leo Kirch has
swallowed his pride and signed up to the Multi-media
Betriebsgesellschaft, the consortium of Deutsche Telekom, Canal Plus,
CLT, German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF and private broadcaster RTL
set up to develop an open, unified decoder system for Germany. Seca
(the joint company formed by Bertelsmann and Canal Plus) and Kirch's
technical arm, BetaTechnik, are now forming a joint company to develop
a standardised digital decoder and conditional access system for the
German market.

"There are still questions to be answered such as distribution,
technical details and the exact shareholder structure," said Kirch
spokesman Johannes Schmitz. "It's a new situation for us. Both sides
could have blocked each other, so we decided to join the MMBG and work
on a common decoder system."

After Deutsche Telekom's decision to opt for the MMBG's Mediabox
decoder technology, dismissing Kirch's "offer" on the grounds that
insufficient technical information on the decoder and conditional
access system was submitted and Telekom's tender protocol was not
adhered to (C&SE Vol.12, No.24), Kirch's position looked very
uncertain.

Without Deutsche Telekom, Kirch did not have the 16 million German
cable homes, key to the digital developments in Germany and was left
with an order for one million Nokia decoders - it is still unclear what
will become of this order. "The order stands firm. The decoders can be
used in other markets [such as Scandinavia]," offered Schmitz. The
decision by Kirch to join the MMBG has been welcomed by the members of
the consortium, for it prevents the situation which the MMBG wanted to
avoid all along - having two competing decoder systems in the German
market - which could only serve to fragment the market and confuse the
consumer.

Kirch is reportedly to take an 8.8% stake in MMBG, along with
Bertelsmann, CLT and ARD/ZDF, while Canal Plus and RTL are expected to
hold a 4.4% stake. Kirch reportedly demanded an 11% share along with
Bertelsmann, but was blocked by the other MMBG members who refused to
let Kirch muscle in at the last moment and steal the show.

5% will be held by broadcasters including the oRF and the SRG and the
Bauer publishing house. Deutsche Telekom and cable operator Vebacom
will hold the remaining 51% share. Further cable operators are expected
to join the Telekom/Vebacom stake.

The German cartel authorities have initially agreed to the new
constellation of the MMBG. Their wish for as many service providers and
service carriers as possible to be included in the consortium now
seemingly fulfilled. The MMBG still has to be approved by the EC,
while, the German media authorities are concerned that the decoder
system is as open and non-discriminatory as the MMBG claims it will be.

Kirch's compromise with the MMBG is also good news for Germany's only
pay-TV channel, Premiere, which is to play a vital role in the launch
of digital television. Premiere had been caught in the middle of the
MMBG versus Kirch digital decoder fray - its main shareholders being
Canal Plus, Bertelsmann and Kirch. A common decoder system will now be
able to be offered to the channel's one million subscribers.

OVER 300 GET THE AXE IN NYNEX RESTRUCTURE

Nynex CableComms, the UK's second largest cable company, is cutting its
workforce by 310 employees - including a 20% cut at executive director
level - as part of a major restructuring forecast to reduce overheads
by #7 million to #10 million per year.

"Nynex came out very low in an efficiency comparison with other cable
operators published last October by Goldman Sachs. The restructuring
was entirely forecastable," commented Neil Blackley, media analyst at
Goldman Sachs.

Despite the improved cost/revenue balance, and the positive
presentation of the move by Nynex as 'restructuring for growth', to
create what Allen Saunders, executive director corporate communications
at Nynex CableComms described as "a new, leaner Nynex", the initial
market reaction was negative, with shares dropping 1.5p. Longer term, a
more positive response on shares is expected, but Nynex had
underperformed the market by 25% over the last three months.

With the departure of former president Eugene Connell to the US, John
Killian has been appointed joint CEO and president at Nynex CableComms,
his former separate role of chief financial officer disappearing.
Similarly, Sally Davies, responsible for regulatory affairs and
development, is moving to Nynex in the US, her duties spread among
other staff.

And as the company consolidates to a central sales organisation, with
centralised installation, maintenance and repair and customer services,
there will no longer be separate North and South directors of
operations, with the director of operations South, Peter Morse,
resigning. Accounting and management support are expected to see most
losses, through a combination of natural wastage, voluntary and
involuntary redundancies.

"The cuts are spread across the board, geographically, with no sacred
disciplines, and affecting all levels. We have revenue objectives which
we need to correlate with costs. If it had been a pure cost-cutting
exercise we could have just cut staff by 10% three months ago. Instead,
we have conducted a complete review with a 100-man team, and
consultants Coopers & Lybrand, which has just concluded," explained
Saunders.

He continued, "We have identified significant efficiency improvements
and are confident the new organisation is correctly sized to meet our
new business objectives. Our North and South areas will now report to a
single manager, no longer using different routes to the same
objectives."

Saunders also accepted that last year's performance was not up to
expectations, "We were delighted with our telephony penetration and low
churn, but we have never hidden our disappointment at the level of catv
penetration [18.9%] and this is still a priority issue to address."

Killian pointed out that Nynex has, "doubled in size each year since
1991," and now aims to cut life-cycle costs and achieve economies of
scale. But ironically, it is the two largest UK players, Nynex and
Telewest, which underperformed in the Goldman Sachs efficiency table,
while small players like Diamond Cable, General Cable, and Comcast UK
Cable did well.

Nynex's share price dropped to 104p at press time on January 9.

GRANADA, SKY LAUNCH GSKYB

Former Granada executive and currently controller of factual programmes
at the ITV Network Centre, Stuart Prebble, has been appointed as chief
executive of GSkyB, the new company set up by Granada and BSkyB, which
plans to launch eight new channels in late 1996. Travel Channel
commercial director Jerry Glover, meanwhile, has been named as managing
director (commercial) of GSkyB.

The GSkyB package will be available as part of Sky Multi-Channels and
will probably be spread across three transponders, possibly on Astra
1D, on which BSkyB still has some spare capacity.

The new channels will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which will offer
programming from the extensive libraries of both Granada and LWT,
including classic episodes of Coronation Street.

The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle topics: Health
and Beauty, Home and Garden, Food and Wine, Granada Good Life, Granada
Men and Motoring, Granada Talk TV and Granada TV Shopping Guide.

Granada Gold Plus will broadcast for 18 hours a day, while the
lifestyle channels will take the form of broadcasting blocks. Men and
Motoring, for example, will have a late evening slot, following on from
Granada Gold Plus.

All seven lifestyle channels will feature predominantly new
programming. Granada Talk TV will be produced at LWT's London studios,
while the other six channels will all come from the North West.

"This venture will open up a whole new avenue of custom programme
making," said chief operating officer of Granada Group and Chief
executive of Granada's television division, Charles Allen, "enabling us
to significantly expand our program production facilities in both
London and the North West." With the addition of a new air-time sales
team within Laser, Granada's London-based sales house, the new venture
is expected to create around 200 new positions.

Granada's economic interest in the channel is 60%, although its
ownership is limited to 20% under current regulations. However, Granada
is hoping the government will remove the ownership restrictions on
broadcasters becoming involved in satellite operations, and thus allow
it to increase its ownership in the new venture to reflect its economic
participation.

The cost of the venture is expected to be #25 million over its first
two years, including start-up costs of #10 million. It hopes to be in
profit in three years and repay the initial investment in four years.
In the long run Granada also hopes to develop these channels for the
international market.

AB LAUNCHES CHANNEL FOR DIGITAL BOUQUET

Leading French youth TV producer AB-Productions (Dorothee and sitcom
number one Helane et les Garaons) offered its young audience a new
channel for Christmas. Launched live during a party on December 7, AB
Channel 1 is broadcasting series and sitcoms programming via a Belgacom
transponder on Eutelsat II F1 at 13 degrees East.

AB1 is the first channel of a future digital bouquet, the seventh in
France, after those announced by Canal Plus, CLT, TF1, Arte, France
Television and France Telecom. According to AB, in a few months time
the current analogue Eutelsat transponder will be switched into a
multiplex of nine digital channels, each of them dedicated to a
thematic genre: classic movies, thrillers, cartoons, comedy, romance,
action films, documentaries and adult.

Two other transponders would be used afterwards to upgrade the offer to
25 digital channels within two years. The digital package will be
offered to DTH viewers as well as cable. For the latter, AB's policy
will be to let the MSOs use their own conditional access if desired, in
exchange for offering the whole package.

Such an ambitious project has aroused surprise and doubt among the
French media world, especially since AB-Productions is a small company
in comparison to the TV giants engaged in the digital race.

It is understood that the company is in talks with four companies with
the aim of acquiring a whole package, including an encryption system, a
set-top-box and a subscription management service, but AB declined to
comment if such names as Canal Plus, France Telecom, Nethold or Kirch
are among the candidates.

Despite the choice of a Hot Bird slot, the channel's audience is
limited to the few motorised dish owners who receive the 12GHz band of
the transponder thanks to their multiband converters, indispensable to
receive the French channels elsewhere, on the Telecom 2 satellites. The
majority of the million or so French DTH viewers use fixed dishes with
monoband converters: 12 GHz LNBs for Telecom 2 or 11 GHz LNBs for the
Astra and Eutelsat series.

Cable is therefore essential to increase the audience. AB1 was granted
a cable licence by the CSA on December 21, despite the fact that the
channel currently screens mostly US-made products from the catalogue of
14,000 hours of programming that AB-Productions acquired on
international markets. Negotiations have already begun with French
cable operators.

Capacity is scarce on most cable networks, especially in Paris where
the basic tier is full and only two D2 Mac upper-tier channels remain
vacant. According to Videopole, it could be the first company to offer
AB1, if negotiations over the price lead to an agreement. AB is asking
a Ffr 2,50 per subscriber per month carriage fee after a six-month free
trial.

FRANCE TELECOM SLAMMED IN REPORT

French minister for Post, Telecommunications and Space, Franaois
Fillon, unveiled last week the main points of the report he ordered
last September from Georges Vanderchmitt, a former adviser of French
audit body Cour des Comptes. Fearing that France could miss out in the
digital race by having too many digital bouquet projects, Fillon
demanded a clear overview of the country's policy on satellite
telecommunications.

The Vanderchmitt report recommends the creation of a "digital super
alliance" between all the major French players, (public and private)
with broadcasters' access to the set-top boxes ensured "under fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions". The report insists on
the necessity to guarantee competition among the players inside the
alliance while having a strong policy on an external offer. Thanks to
digital technology, the latter should be adapted to the different
geographical zones it targets.

Vanderchmitt foresees that the digital market should be supervised
together by the CSA and the Conseil de la Concurrence (competition
body).

In his report, Vanderchmitt wants at the same time "to help Eutelsat to
set up a credible alternative to Astra" by changing the organisation's
structure, while he would also "establish stronger links" with Astra.
The Luxemburg system could be, according to him, "the dominant operator
in the French sky within the next three years".

The Telecom 3 series of crafts, however, is condemned by the report
which underlines the fact that Telecom 2D still has no clients.
Moreover, Vanderchmitt claims that France Telecom paid "too little
attention to marketing" and is now "marginalized and isolated". The
report concludes that the company is not in a situation to compete
anyway and should give up its DTH activities, by slipping "towards a
role of satellite services provider" only.

Commenting on the Vanderchmitt report, minister Fillon said France
Telecom's role in satellite television needs to be "redefined" and
recommended "more cooperation" with Eutelsat. Fillon also stressed that
the prejudice against the SES has to be ended and agreed with the
report's remarks that cable and satellite jurisdictions have to be
harmonized and lightened, mainly by bringing French law in line with
the European directive on transfrontier broadcasting signals.

Fillon revealed that he has ordered another report from former TDF
general director Philippe Levrier on whether or not to develop digital
terrestrial television.

BBC SEEKS EXPLANATION OF ORBIT 'CENSORSHIP'

The BBC is to "investigate as a matter of the utmost importance"
reports that Orbit has been censoring its Arabic news channel's
coverage of the case of Saudi dissident Mohammed al-Mas'ari. Senior BBC
and Orbit representatives were due to meet to discuss the alleged
editorial interference as CSE went to press.

According to Arabic and UK press reports, blackouts of the BBC's al-
Mas'ari reports started on Friday 5 January and continued over the
weekend. A spokesman for BBC Worldwide, which produces the Arabic-
language channel under a long-term contract with Orbit, said that
reports of "repeated interruptions" to the service had been confirmed -
but it was not yet clear whether this was deliberate censorship of the
al-Mas'ari deportation story or a "technical fault...we do not yet know
the source of the interruptions," he said.

Orbit was "concerned" about the reports and would be "looking into the
matter", a spokesman said - but would not comment further beyond
insisting that "reports of subscribers seeking compensation are
unfounded".

If the blackouts were deliberate, Orbit will have infringed the terms
of its contract with BBC Worldwide which guaranteed the editorial
independence of the service, as well as its pledges not to resort to
censorship. The BBC spokesman said that coverage of the Mas'ari case
would continue on the Arabic channel - "there has been further coverage
this week" - whatever the outcome.

For Saudi-owned Orbit, which already faces the problem of a patchily-
enforced dish ban in its home market, the al-Mas'ari affair coincided
with the first week of hard encryption - and thus could hardly have
come at a worse time. It had to face the dilemma of whether to risk
enraging the Saudi government, notoriously intolerant of journalistic
enquiry into its dealings, or of upsetting its partner and its
potential subscribers, just at the point when they were being asked to
pay for the first time. And also just before the launch of the rival
MultiChoice digital DTH package into which - it's not too hard to
imagine - a BBC-type news service could fit very well.

DR/TV2 LAUNCH DANISH SPORTS PAY-TV CHANNEL

Danish public service broadcasters, Danmarks Radio (DR) and commercial
channel TV2, together with state-controlled  Danish Telecom and Tele
Danmark are to launch a sports pay-TV channel, primarily aimed at the
some 1.3 million households (some 60% of the total population)
connected to cable systems. The new channel will eventually be also
offered via satellite to private DTH owners.

The as yet unnamed channel will primarily broadcast sports (mostly
football, the most popular sport in Denmark), as well as films and
popular entertainment.

The new project seems to have been triggered by the big deal recently
struck by DR and TV2 with the Danish Football Union - described as
"historical" by the Danish press, partly because of the amount of money
involved, and partly because it is the first time DR and TV2 have
joined forces, to fend off competition from the private commercial TV
sector.

The contract with the Danish Football Union is for eight years with a
price tag of over DKr0.5 billion, (#58m). For that money, the new pay-
TV channel, DR and TV2 will have the rights to all Danish football
(also international matches) of public interest.

Per Kregh Simonsen, head of sports at DR, commented, "From our side it
required quite a new way of commercial thinking. And without our trump
card, the new pay service, we would never had been able to land the
contract."

One snag in the project, is that under Danish law, Tele Danmark is not
allowed to be involved in programming operations, but it is expected
that the law will be changed by the Danish parliament this summer.

Despite the law, Tele Danmark, which is expected to put up most of the
investment money for the project, has obviously had plans to launch a
pay-TV service for some time. One year ago, it recruited one of
Denmark's most respected personalities in the film and media business,
Bo Christiansen, who has a long history with Denmark's biggest film and
media group, Nordisk Film, and is believed to have been instrumental in
planning the new sports service. Peter Herforth, former MD of Nordisk
Film Production, was recently hired to manage the new station.

The new pay-TV service will be offered at a monthly fee of DKr100 and
is expected to break even with a subscriber level of around 200,000
households.

NETHOLD/TV4 FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCE

Swedish TV4 and Nethold Nordic have formed a strategic alliance. From
occasional collaboration in recent years - mainly in the sports field -
the leading Swedish commercial station and the increasingly
multinational Nethold have now realised their cooperation into a fully-
fledged alliance. Furthermore, TV4 and FilmNet have jointly taken over
an office building in Stockholm that used to be the Swedish head-
quarters of Philips.

Jan Friedman, vice president of Nethold Nordic, said the new alliance
would "spread throughout" the two companies, and that it would also
lead to similar alliances with local broadcasters in other Nordic
territories.

TV4 and Nethold/FilmNet have identified a number of areas where the new
alliance will take effect: Joint acquisitions of programme rights, both
to films and mini-series, sports and other big events. Instrumental in
this area is Nethold's acquisitions organisation, Holland-based ProNet.

Friedman points out that in Europe, ProNet acquires rights for FilmNet
not only in the Nordic Countries and Benelux, but also in Poland, Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus and Italy: Joint
co-production of Swedish movies and TV-movies together with local
production companies. Over a three-year period TV4 and FilmNet will
invest SKr 30 million (#3m), of which FilmNet will provide one third.
"We will also cooperate in producing other kinds of programming, like
fillers and film magazines", said Friedman.

If and when TV4 launches its second channel, satellite-delivered TV4
Plus, as it is called internally, it will be exclusively distributed
via Nethold's digital platforms. The parties have also agreed to
include the existing TV4 transmissions, also with exclusive satellite
rights, on the Nethold platform.

Nethold's SMS operation, MultiChoice, will also be made available for
TV4 in many different areas. Nethold's digital platforms are expected
to be used by TV4 in future news services, home shopping, games etc.

In the sports field, where FilmNet and TV4 have already established
different ways of cooperating, for instance in sharing rights like the
Swedish national ice hockey league and the English Premier Football
League, plans are now to establish shared programme archives, research
functions and news desk services for TV4 .

FilmNet is already a client for the TV4 air-time sales group, but the
airtime bought in the future by FilmNet is expected to increase
considerably.

It has been hinted in the Swedish trade press that a future element of
cross-ownership would be a very plausible development of the new
strategic alliance.

STRONG SALES FOR DTH IN 1995

UK sales of satellite receiving equipment revitalised during 1995.
BSkyB reports that 904,555 units were sold during 1995, however this
will include non-domestic sales, to pubs, sports and social clubs
together with resales between satellite retailers.

Included in the total is the largest ever sales figure for a single
week, 40,153, for the week ending December 16. The total amount of
sales in December was 111,320. The actual installed base of satellite
homes increased by 339,000 reflecting replacement sales and churn.

According to Continental Research, on December 31, 1995 the installed
base of UK satellite homes had risen to 3.698 million, including 55,000
smatv homes. The number of UK smatv homes has progressively fallen over
recent years, often resulting from the growth of cable services.
Continental estimates the total of UK cable homes at December 31 to be
1.205 million.

The UK DTH market has been spurred by the offer of "under #100"
receivers from manufacturers including Pace and, under the Minerva
brand, Grundig. According to market research company GfK, Pace now
holds over 40% of the UK market with Pace increasing its volume sales
for November year-on-year by 66%.

The combined growth of DTH and cable homes for the fourth quarter of
1995 was 232,000. New dish installations - replacement sales continue
to run at a little over one in three - represented 135,000 homes
eclipsing cable at 97,000.

Cable installations had been running ahead of new dish homes. The DTH
renaissance can be attributed to pre-Christmas sales, particularly in
non-cable areas, where the only way to gain access to the new media
channels is through a dish. The launch of Astra 1D, which operates at
frequencies lower than a majority of the installed base of equipment
can receive, will also be a factor.

According to Continental Research director David Chilvers, in order for
cable to reach more homes the installed base would have to consistently
grow at over 100,000 more per quarter than DTH homes - a target which
cable has so far found unattainable. At this rate cable would still not
eclipse DTH until well after the turn of the century.

A new study by Continental shows that the saturation point for cable
and satellite television in the UK to be 35%. The 35% penetration,
equivalent to eight million homes, is in line with Continental's last
major forecast produced, separately, last April.

Chilvers added that generation effects will create an impact in around
20 years time creating a slow build up in penetration. Chilvers likens
future growth to the telephone where penetration grew quickly to 80%,
but the last 20% is proving more difficult.

DIGITAL DTH OUTSHINES CABLE PROSPECTS

Cable penetration rates could be significantly held back in European
markets where digital direct-to-home pay-per-view has first-mover
advantages, according to a new circular from SBC Warburg.

The investment bank, whose conclusions are based on the last 18 months
of satellite-delivered PPV in the US, says with average DirecTv and
USSB subscribers generating PPV sales of $17 (#11) per month, "the
signs are that PPV can become a really significant generator of
business for BSkyB and Canal Plus. In our BSkyB model, we
conservatively estimate PPV revenues in 2002 of #200 million. Based on
the US experience, that implies about 800,000 subscribers spending #10
per month. We could easily be a factor of five times too low."

"This is not good news for the European cable industry, and those
operators who are either still building out their networks or who have
not yet upgraded narrowband... may find progress difficult if digital
satellite has first-mover advantages," claims SBC Warburg.

DirecTv, which has targeted operational breakeven for the second half
of this year, or three million subscribers, notched up its one
millionth customer in November. SBC Warburg says the Hughes-backed
venture has been scoring PPV buy rates of between 150 and 200 per cent
on some of its movies - five to six times higher than on cable.

According to the report, European Media Monthly, in October last year
almost 80% of DirecTv and USSB subscribers registered PPV buys, with
3.78 the average number of monthly purchases. Estimated PPV revenue for
the month was $13 million for DirecTv and USSB, and $16 million for
cable operator-backed DTH service Primestar.

PPV on US cable, meanwhile, has been plagued by poor release windows, a
lack of channel capacity and confusing listing schedules in TV guides,
says SBC Warburg.

By comparison, DirecTv and the other digital DTH service providers are
devoting 60-plus channels to near-video-on-demand PPV and have
developed more user-friendly electronic programme guides.

More bad news for the cable industry, says the bank, is that DirecTv,
which is growing at a rate of 90,000-100,000 new subscribers per month,
has been recruiting up to 50% of its customer base from cabled areas,
while over 40% were or continue to be subscribers to cable.
"Furthermore, those subscribers lured away tend to be the big spenders
who part with more than $60 per month to feed their TV appetites,"
notes the report.

Cable operators hoping to fend off digital DTH with local programming
services may also be disappointed, suggests SBC Warburg, since "these
are not a driver of subscriber take-up."

NEW DEBATE ON GERMAN BROADCASTING LAW

Only four weeks after the premiers of each of Germany's 16 states
reached a compromise on the long-disputed new broadcasting act, a new
list of controversial points have come to the fore.

The main bone of contention is the media ownership rules and whether
new media or digital services will require licences from the media
authorities. The SPD-governed states are now demanding that no single
owner can have a significant stake in companies which together hold an
audience share of 25%. This would mean, for example, that the Kirch
Group could not hold stakes in channels which have a market share over
25%. If the stake exceeds 30%, new anti-trust regulation would come
into force. Besides this strongly-criticised point, the social
democrats want television channels with over 10% marketshare to be
obliged to distribute their programming within an independent company.
Spiegel TV has its own licence scheduling its magazines on Sat l and
RTL Television. If the other premiers agree to these new demands, the
social democrats will agree to the media ownership ruling allowing
shareholders to own 100% in one television channel, 49.9% in the next
and 24.9% in other special interest programmes.

To control all these regulations, the prime ministers intend to
establish a new media concentration commission (KEK) acting alongside
the media authorities. The commission would be closely involved in the
decisions of the media authorities.

There is also a question mark over the limits on public programming and
its financing. Much of the monthly public fee of DM 23,80 (#10.70) is
needed to fund the ARD and its member stations administration. Many
politicians and commercial stations are demanding that ARD and ZDF stop
their expansion and broadcast news, information, culture, children's
programming and a mixture of entertainment as in the past.

The commission for financing public broadcasting KEF has to come up
with a proposal for the next broadcasting fee which runs from 1997 to
the year 2000. According to the government of Lower Saxony, the
broadcasting fee will increase to DM28.25 a month - an increase of
DM4.45. The ARD will receive DM2.35 and ZDF DM2.05. The money will help
fund a new parliamentary and a children's channel to be launched by the
ARD from 1997 - a move strongly criticised by private broadcasters
association VPRT, which fears that the new publicly-financed special
interest channels will target commercial channels as Nickelodeon and
all-news channels such as N-TV.

On February 8, the premiers will meet again to try and reach a new
agreement on the act.

UAP VERSIONS TCC AND DISCOVERY

United Artists Programming has introduced a version of TCC for the
Nordic market and for Discovery in the Netherlands. TCC has now also
been withdrawn from the Dutch market though minimal distribution
through the VideoCrypt II package will continue for the time being.

A backhaul was introduced on January 1 for TCC Nordic to feed the Thor
satellite which has previously taken the single UK-produced version
from Astra. The backhaul is at present transmitted in clear analogue
Pal from Intelsat 601, though the intention is to switch to an
encrypted feed in the near future.

UAP vice president, distribution Andrew Shaw said that soundtracks in
the four Scandinavian languages - Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and
Finnish - would represent 45% of TCC Nordic's output. He said TCC had
reached the point in the Nordic region where such local versioning was
feasible. 80% of TCC subscribers in Scandinavia are now able to view
the Nordic version and Shaw expects this to be brought up to a near
100% within a few months. At the same time TCC is, at 1.2 million
homes,  closing the distribution gap on Discovery, the result of the
transponder share on Thor, which allows cable operators to take a
seamless feed of the two channels.

General manager Franklin Getchell said TCC Nordic had been created as a
totally separate service running for 12 hours a day as opposed to the
11 hours of the Astra service. TCC is on-air between 06.00 and 18.00
CET. "The 12 hours will be a mix of programming. All of the live action
programming will be regionalised, the pre-school will be added by the
end of the year." Programming for older children, including some of the
high-profile animation will be subtitled. For younger children dubbing
will be used where the rights allow it. Three quarters will be dubbed
by the end of 1996.

The decision to withdraw TCC from the Dutch market follows the
acquisition by parent company Flextech of a 33% share in the Dutch
language children's channel Kindernet. While Kindernet has a virtual
saturation penetration of the market at 5.5 million, TCC is only
available to 850,000 homes, principally in the Rotterdam area. TCC's
long-time refusal to pay for carriage in the region means distribution
is unlikely to increase further.

Discovery Channel, which has been available in the Netherlands since
1989 and is available in 4.3 million homes, will carry Dutch continuity
announcements on a separate audio subcarrier. In addition Discovery
will be increasing the amount of programming reversioned into the Dutch
language and intends to buy some Dutch documentaries. Teletext
subtitling in the Dutch language will be expanded with the goal of
offering subtitles on 95% of output by the end of the year.

BSKYB JOINS RTR FOR RUSSIAN BOUQUET?

Russian national public broadcaster RTR has forged a joint venture with
a "unnamed UK partner" to launch the country's first digital satellite-
delivered service from Intelsat 604. Sources suggest that this UK
partner is none other than British Sky Broadcasting. According to
Stanislav Bunievich, the station's deputy chairman and director of
engineering, RTR Network has formed a joint venture with a UK partner
(he declined to give a name) to launch - at a cost of between $10 to
$15 million (#6.5-9.7m) for equipment alone - two channels (sport and
movies) this spring. Distributed by Intelsat 604, they will probably be
followed by further channels for medical, business and children's
television and be available to an audience of some 40 million
"collective customers" - such as those served by cable networks -
throughout the former Soviet Union.

Bunievich says the idea behind the RTR Network is to introduce viewers
to the idea of paying for their programming, which in his view is now
"the main way for television to develop in Russia." It is also an
attempt to make the broadcaster less dependent on the government for
its funding and lessen the burden of having to pay 75% of its revenue
to the ministry of telecommunications for the use of transmission
facilities.

Although RTR Network is currently negotiating agreements with several
foreign programme-providers, Bunievich feels there is a need for
Russian material which it will have to meet. He also believes there
will be exceptionally strong interest shown in the new service's
children's and medical channels and that within the next two to five
years RTR, though remaining state-owned, will become a holding company
for RTR Network and other commercial ventures.

HUNGARIAN COMMERCIAL TV IN THE WINGS

Hungary is soon to have commercial television now that the Hungarian
Parliament has finally passed the long-awaited broadcasting bill, which
is now waiting to be approved by the Hungarian president. In mid-
October, the six main parliamentary parties in Hungary came to a back
room agreement over the future of the nation's state-run television
stations and the law was passed at the end of December.

The broadcasting bill will have the greatest effect on state-owned TV
network Magyar Televizio (MTV) which now faces the prospect of its
second public chain MTV2 being privatised. The terrestrial frequency of
MTV2 will be offered in concession for ten years and the current MTV2
programme will be aired by satellite with an intended viewership of
ethnic Hungarians both inside and outside contemporary national
borders. The largest commercial radio station Danubius will also be
privatised. The main state channel, MTV1 and satellite-delivered
channel Duna TV will remain largely untouched, however.

Saatchi & Saatchi Budapest senior media planner Andreas Vigh says that
another terrestrial frequency will be opened [in the public tender],
possibly under the name of MTV3, which, at the beginning, would have
60% to 70% penetration. This national channel will also be offered in
concession for ten years. The arrival of commercial television in
Hungary is set to kick-start the industry, he says. "The state channels
will have to become much more competitive and produce better quality
programming."

MTV2 which has an 80% penetration rate will be privatised with a view
towards starting up in January of 1997, along with the new MTV3.

A tender for MTV2 is expected to be announced sometime this spring and
applications will be due in July or August. The new private channel
will most likely begin broadcasting the following January. But before
the tender is announced, the new media council will have to be
appointed, and the council's first order of business will be replacing
the director of MTV, Adam Horvath, who resigned as of January 1996.
Under the draft law, the director's powers will be significantly
reduced.

Several major media investors are expected to enter the tender for the
private channel, including MTM Communications, which has entered into a
joint venture with Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems (SBS) last
September, Central European Media Enterprises (CME), which is currently
preparing a regional TV channel in the Budapest area with the Hungarian
company 2002, and CLT. French broadcaster TF1 is also reportedly in the
running as is TV Nova operator Marc Palmer.

PREMIERE TOPS ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS

The first German pay-TV channel Premiere reported around 1.1 million
subscribers at the beginning of the new year 1996 generating revenues
of about DM500 million (#227m), making Premiere the fourth largest
commercial TV station in Germany, announced managing director Bernd
Kundrun. Premiere has invested about DM600 million (#273m) over the
last five years and Kundrun forecast that the company would break even
this year.

Kundrun said that the decision of MMBG and Kirch Group to develop a
standardised digital decoder was a signal for Premiere to start the
first trials in the interactive world. To produce and distribute 12
digital programmes, a company has to invest about DM 5.1 billion
(#2.3bn) over a five year period on the basis of about two million
subscribers, he said. But the revenues in the same period would only
amount to DM1.2 billion, if the subscribers pay a monthly fee of DM50.
This means digital programmes will remain a very risky business in the
next few years, he said.

In the spring, Premiere will start a trial with 1,000 households in
Hamburg. Partners in the venture are publishing companies Bauer, Axel
Springer and Gruner & Jahr/Bertelsman, retailer Otto Versand, facility
house Studio Hamburg (subsidiary of public broadcaster NDR) and
Deutsche Telekom.

CME LAUNCHES SLOVENIAN POP TV

Slovenia's broadcasting industry has received a major boost following
the launch of the country's first national independent television
service. Backed by the US-owned investment company Central European
Media Enterprises (CME) and the local stations MMTV (based in
Ljubljana) and Tele 59 (Maribor), Pop TV - a television programme
trademark of the company Pro Plus - will offer a mixture of
entertainment and information programming and initially reach some 70%
of the country's 650,000 television households.

CME, which already has direct equity interests of 58% and 33% in Pro
Plus and MMTV respectively, will shortly also acquire 33% of Tele 59.
With both its Slovenian partners also major shareholders in Pro Plus,
it will effectively have a 72% economic interest in the new venture.

According to Len Fertig, the president and CEO of CME, total investment
in Pro Plus is likely to be between #10-11.5 million, of which the
company will provide 58% and MMTV and Tele 59 the remainder. While
having to compete in an industry already served by a national public
broadcaster (TV Slovenija) and several local commercial stations
including the long-established Kanal A, the country's healthy TV ad
market (which stood at #15m) in 1994) and per capita income (#4,000)
one of the highest in central and eastern Europe) are likely to ensure
the service's survival.

Pro Plus, whose programming will be entertainment led and targeted at a
young audience, has secured agreements with most Hollywood majors and
hopes to obtain exclusive rights for Slovenian soccer. While initially
conforming to a minimum local production quota of 10%, it intends to
raise the level to 40% by the end of this year.

Although Pop TV has effectively guaranteed its status as a national
Slovenian broadcaster through being distributed by MMTV, Tele 59, TV
Robin (which serves western parts of the country) and several cable
networks, an agreement with Euro 3, a privately owned service employing
a powerful transmitter in Krvavec to cover Ljubljana and environs, fell
through after objections by Kanal A.

The latter, which is owned by Vladimir Polic and had itself at one
stage been involved in talks with CME, is believed to have a
controlling stake in Euro 3 and felt undermined by the latter's deal
with the media investment company. It is also beset by serious
financial problems and has recently benefited from a programming
agreement with Turner.

The launch of Pro Plus and its associated television network Pop TV by
CME has come shortly after the establishment of Media Pro
International, a company which will manage a new commercial network
named Pro TV in Romania. With other projects either being prepared or
up and running (and in some instances, such as the Czech Republic's TV
Nova, already highly successful), CME is rapidly becoming one of the
leading players in central and eastern Europe's television industry. As
a result, some form of networking (and therefore satellite
distribution) of its services throughout the region is a distinct
possibility in the near future.

Within Slovenia, the appearance of Pro Plus/Pop TV has nevertheless
overshadowed the launch of a further new national channel. Set up at a
cost of DM10 million (#4.5m) and backed by the Catholic Church and
several local institutions, TV3 will terrestrially broadcast around 20
hours of family-oriented programming daily to around 80% of the
population.

RADICAL CHANGES AT POLONIA 1

The Polish satellite channel Polonia 1 has begun 1996 under new
management and with a radical change in programming policy.

Set up by the Italian entrepreneur Nicola Grauso barely four years ago,
it initially operated as an unlicensed network of local terrestrial
stations before being forced out of the country and deciding to
distribute its programming by Eutelsat. On January 1 its ownership
officially passed into the hands of Mariano Vollani - once the leading
shareholder in the Czech commercial station Premiera TV - along with
several Polish and foreign investors.

According to Katarzyna Kieci, the marketing manager of Publipolska (an
agency which undertakes all commercial activities for Polonia 1), the
broadcaster will attempt to move away from the perceived image of being
a service aimed solely at women by targeting men, people aged up to 40
and young urban families.

The first changes to the 24-hour service's programming - which Kieci
says can be received by around 28% of the population - should occur in
the first week in February and the remainder will be gradually
implemented over the following month to six weeks. Besides carrying
more music, it will also show sport, news and information (with
material obtained from Euronews) and a wide range of films and
documentaries.

VIACOM POISED FOR MID-EAST LAUNCH

Viacom is developing two new channels for its five-channel Ku-Band
digital DTH package for the Middle East, which is expected to launch
via PanAmSat 4 during the first quarter.

The package will include MTV Europe and VH-1 UK, as well as a movie
channel - expected to be a version of Showtime - and new general
entertainment and children's/family channels.

Although Viacom would not elaborate on marketing plans for the service
prior to an official launch announcement "within the next two weeks,"
it is understood the package will be offered alongside ART and Nethold
channels as part of MultiChoice's Middle Eastern digital DTH operation.
This is to use the same MPEG-2/DVB standard with Irdeto conditional
access as the South African DSTV service, for which Pace has been
contracted to supply 200,000 decoders. Pace, while it has yet to ship
any DVB units into the region, is already priming its Middle Eastern
dealers with its digital 'Gold Club' scheme.

The launch of the MultiChoice mid-East bouquet, initially intended to
be pre-Christmas, is understood to have been put back to give the
partners more time to develop services which would be sufficiently
distinct from the analogue-free-to-air ART channels already popular in
the region.

CHANNEL V LAUNCHES THAI MUSIC CHANNEL

Channel V, the Star TV-owned music channel has formed a three party
deal to create and broadcast a 24-hour customised music channel for
Thailand. The new venture, to be called Channel V Thailand, is a
partnership between Channel V, pay-TV licensee Universal Cable Network
Public Company Ltd (UTV), and Broadcasting Network (Thailand) Ltd
(BNT). The latter is a 12 year old Thai company specialising in concert
promotion and music licensing.

The new channel, which is set to launch mid-March, will be an ad-free
subscription channel and will form part of UTV's premium programming
tier, although as yet the "appropriate pricing point has yet to be
decided," said Channel V executive producer Steve Greider.

As with the two other localised versions of Channel V - for India and
Taiwan, Channel V Thailand will be heavily reliant on localisation,
with most of the programming to be either dubbed or produced in Thai
and fronted by local Thai VJs. Initially, said Greider, 60% of music
videos will be Thai with the remaining 40% international. The
partnership has already built a studio in which to customise and make
new productions.

The deal with UTV is despite the fact that Star TV also has a carriage
deal on rival service ThaiSky Cable's MMDS service. According to
Greider, Star chose to go with UTV as Thaisky already has its own music
service called Smile TV. Greider said Channel V Thailand will compete
favourably with Smile TV as it will be a "much better looking channel,
that is truly Thai but produced to an international standard."

UTV is currently broadcasting 35 channels down its 64-channel capacity
fibre-optic cable network which is currently being laid in the greater
Bangkok area.

It is also rumoured that UTV and Star TV may collaborate further to
form a DTH package for Thailand. This would be beneficial to both, as
UTV would then be able to use Asiasat 2 as a distribution platform
(currently it only has C-Band capacity on Thaicom 1 and 2) and, in
turn, Star TV would gain access to the Thai DTH market by piggy-backing
on UTV's required pay-TV licence. Currently it is estimated that there
are some 400,000 back yard C-band dishes owners in Thailand, many of
whom already received Star TV.

The market for pay-TV in Thailand is both intensifying and
consolidating. In December 1995, Thai terrestrial broadcaster and pay-
TV licensee Channel 3 and Hong Kong based satellite broadcaster TVBI,
announced the formation of a joint venture company, the TVB3 Network Co
Ltd, which will launch a full service Thai language general
entertainment channel to be called Asia Entertainment Network in early
1997, using Thai dubbed Chinese programmes and Thai language programmes
produced by the joint venture company.

CZECH CABLE AND SATELLITE DEREGULATION

The Czech Parliament implemented several changes to the broadcasting
law in mid-December. It has approved extending the broadcasting rights
of CT2, the second nationwide channel, to public broadcaster Czech
Television for an indefinite period. Under a law passed in December
1992, Czech Television was granted only temporary possession of the
frequency, because the legislation agreed at that time that the second
frequency should eventually be privatised.

As of January 1, 1996, potential cable/satellite operators no longer
have to apply to the Czech Broadcasting Council for a licence, although
they must still register with the council. The council no longer has
the authority to regulate programming conditions for cable and
satellite operators. Potential operators must still obtain clearance
from the Czech telecommunication authority and a construction permit
from the municipality where the cable system will operate. The law
further reduces advertising restrictions on Czech Radio from 1% to 0.2%
for all five channels, although it is possible to group this time on
one station.

Industry analysts believe the deregulation of satellite and cable
broadcasting is partly the result of heavy lobbying on the part of HBO,
which feared the programming quotas the council wanted to implement on
cable operators which carry the pay-television channel. Some further
believe that the new decision is a compromise between supporters and
detractors of commercial broadcasting, citing that opponents of the
decision to allow Czech Television to retain its second channel were
rewarded for their support with far-reaching concessions in the
licensing of cable and satellite ventures.

Council member Helena Havledkova finds this analysis too subjective but
she agreed that the amendment, while fundamentally conforming to
European Convention regulations, is regarded as a victory for the cable
business. "HBO [and other cable operators] will be absolutely free to
do whatever they want with their programmes," she commented.

The Czech cable industry has experienced substantial investment from
foreign companies in the past two years from companies such as HBO,
which launched in the Czech Republic in November, 1994, US West
International, which purchased a 28% stake of Cable Plus, the largest
Czech cable operator, in May, 1995, and United International Holdings,
which has taken part in several cable ventures since 1993.

TERRESTRIALS SET TO TAKE ON SKY

The UK government published its broadcasting bill before Christmas
featuring some significant changes from its white paper proposals. The
new law is not expected to come into effect until summer, possibly as
late as January 1997.

Now ITV predators such as Granada, Carlton and Mai look set to flourish
under the new bill with the proposal for a two licence limit for ITV
operators abolished in favour of a new threshhold of 15% of total TV
audience. Bearing in mind that the largest ITV owner Carlton holds 9.4%
of the total audience, the scope for expansion and takeovers is great.

All but the two largest newspaper owners (News International and Mirror
group) will be able to control commercial television licences for the
first time, favouring a greater cross-ownership between newspaper
groups, TV companies and radio.

Existing terrestrial broadcasters are to be given much more digital
capacity in the new bill with the BBC awarded the best multiplex, and
ITV, Channel 5 and Channel 5 awarded half a multiplex each. In return,
the broadcasters have to air their existing channels in their entirety
in digital though they have been allowed to offer pay-TV services -
vital for their survival. With sports rights being snapped up by BSkyB,
while NBC bid $2.3 billion (#1.5bn) for the Olympics, the fear is that
the fierce bidding will also spread to entertainment. The freedom to
run a universally free and premium pay channel will place the
terrestrial broadcasters in a much more powerful position to fend off
Sky.

The government has retreated on the idea of a final date for a complete
move from analogue to digital. Instead, the analogue switch off date
will be reviewed once 50% of UK households can receive digital
terrestrial channels, or five years after the start of the first
multiplex licence.

BET ON JAZZ FOR AFRICA

Black Entertainment Television's 24-hour jazz channel, BET On Jazz: The
Cable Jazz Channel, is to join MultiChoice's South African DTH package,
DSTV, on April 1, three months after the channel launches on cable
networks in the US.

The service, first mooted in 1993 and understood to be costing $20-30
million to launch, will be offered alongside DSTV's existing 18
channels from PanAmSat 4 at no extra cost, and will be marketed in
South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique and
Botswana. Both the channel and the MultiChoice deal are breakthroughs
for BET, which, with 43.4 million cable subscribers in North America
(at November 1995), and with its domestic business already well
diversified into related media and marketing activities, is now looking
to international markets for expansion.

"This is a very big move for us," BET International vice president
George Amoah said. "Although we've been supplying programming to
African broadcasters for the last year-and-a-half on a syndicated
basis, this is the first time we've launched there in such a big way."

BETI supplied Bop-TV with an eight-hour daily block of (chiefly
educational) programming which was distributed across African and the
Middle East from a C-Band Intelsat transponder, and now supplies
similar programming to SABC's NNTV, as well as to affiliates in Kenya
and Nigeria the Caribbean, and even to Poland.

"Our plans call for global expansion," Amoah added, "and we're going
into it aggressively... our initial focus is Europe and southern
Africa."

As in the US, where BET has developed a range of complementary
businesses, BETI intends to develop similar opportunities for programme-
related merchandise in South Africa, by building up relationship with
local businesses.

While Amoah indicated that BETI was eager to bring the jazz channel to
the UK and the rest of Europe, how it will do so - whether as a
complement to the London-based BETI cable exclusive service using
additional digital capacity on Orion, or by joining national digital
DTH packages - was not yet decided.

As the world's first dedicated jazz channel, BET On Jazz promises a mix
of live concerts, classic performances, jazz movies and documentaries,
and seems destined to find big ready-made audiences across Europe and
Scandinavia.

TELEGRAAF POISED TO ACQUIRE SBS6 STAKE

Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf says its negotiations to acquire a 30%
share in SBS6 are at an advanced stage. Bank Mees Pierson is acting as
mediator for the two parties. SBS has been looking for some time for a
Dutch partner, because the channel wants to strengthen its local
presence. SBS has strong financial backing including ABC/Cap Cities and
Paramount/Viacom, but a link with a major Dutch publishing house could
be beneficial for both parties and give the broadcaster a more Dutch
face. SBS experienced a slow start late last August, but now claims
about 92% cable penetration in the country as well as a slowly
increasing market share.

De Telegraaf currently has only very limited new media investments. The
company owns local radio station Radio Amsterdam as well as a cabletext
newspaper (with rolling text pages) also in its home town of Amsterdam.
Together with PCM Publishers De Telegraaf owns 5% in the A2000/KTA
Amsterdam cablenetwork. The company's investment in SBS6 would mark a
departure from its otherwise conservative acquisition policy. Dutch
publisher Wegener announced its talks to acquire the Arcade Media
Group, who owns TV10 Gold, The Music Factory and three radio stations,
have successfully ended. Wegener will take control of Arcade for an
undisclosed sum, which insiders estimate to be around Gld300 million
(#120m). The new company will be known as Wegener-Arcade. Arcade is
privately owned, with three quarter of the shares owned by
founder/president Herman Heinsbroek, who will remain with the new
company as a consultant. The second man of the company, A de Liefde,
will take a seat on the board of Wegener-Arcade.

POLL GAUGES BELGIAN SUBSCRIBER SATISFACTION

The quality of cable distribution varies depending on the region where
subscribers live, particularly regarding the number of programmes
available, the quality of the retransmission and the cable subscription
fee, according to a survey conducted by consumers' association Test-
Achats. Each of the 36 cable distributors operating in Belgium enjoys a
monopoly in its own franchise territory and not all of them have put
the same efforts into upgrading their network and meeting their
subscribers' wishes, notes Test-Achats.

The number of channels available on cable varies from 19 in the
Ardennes region to 37 in Limburg, while cable capacity ranges from 24
to 73 channels. The cost of a new connection varies from Bfr1,346 in
Brussels to Bfr4,033 (#29-#88) in some parts of Brabant, while the
delay required before being connected can be anything from 3 days to 3
weeks. As regards the subscription fee, it can vary from Bfr 4,000 to
Bfr 5,000 (#88-#108), but without any bearing on the number of channels
provided by the cable distributor.

The survey also shows that cable subscribers' chief complaint is lack
of consultation with them by cable companies regarding the choice of
channels they receive. In both linguistic regions, viewers show,
unsurprisingly, a strong preference for channels broadcasting in their
own language. However, it seems that, in Flanders, subscribers would
also like to have access to French-speaking channels such as Tele 21,
Club RTL, Arte, TV5 and Canal Plus, while French-speaking viewers in
Wallonia fell they are deprived of VTM, Filmnet and CNN. Obviously,
subscribers are not aware that copyright licences, administrative rules
and political motivations prevent cable distributors to broadcasting
Canal Plus in Flanders and FilmNet in Wallonia.

Test-Achats concludes, saying that, most subscribers seem satisfied
with their cable distributor, the average of dissatisfied subscribers
varying from 5 to 10%. The main reasons for dissatisfaction are lack of
consultation of customers (46%), the non-availability of certain
channels (35%) and poor reception quality.

MC EUROPE JOINS PREMIERE PACKAGE

Pay-TV channel Premiere is to trial Music Choice Europe's digital audio
service in a commercial trial this spring. The arrangement is expected
to lead to a full launch in the Cologne area during the autumn and a
national rollout in 1997 as part of Premiere's Astra-delivered digital
package. Competitor DMX expects to receive Astra carriage as part of
the MultiChoice package and already utilises capacity on the first four
Astras.

MC Europe sales and marketing director Jennifer Churchill said that a
number of pricepoints would be trialled on the Cologne network, which
has 268,000 homes connected. Existing pricing ranges from #7.45 per
month in the United Kingdom to an equivalent #12.00 in Norway. In
Cologne the pricing may be as low as DM5 per month, but as director of
business strategy Simon Bazalgette pointed out the cost of the rental
cost of the General Instrument decoder is generally included.

While adopted by Deutsche Telekom as its preferred premium audio
service MC Europe still has the task of applying to each of the 15
regional media authorities. To date licences have been applied for and
obtained from each of the larger regions; Bavaria, Northrhine
Westphalia and Hessen. MC Europe's themed music service includes local
channels such as Deutscher Rock, Golden Schlager and Volksmusik.

Chief executive Stuart Graber said MC Europe was building its
distribution and was now available in "well over eight million homes
all over Europe," including a significant deal recently concluded with
Telewest in the UK.

Asked about repeated rumours of a merger with the European operations
of DMX Graber responded that MC Europe had, "the right combination of
partners and the right strategy to do the job of building a business."
MC Europe had concentrated on the programming rather than the
technology. The two companies, said Graber, were considerably different
in their management style.

Churchill is confident of increasing the potential subscriber base to
over 20 million by the end of 1996. She sees further opportunities as
cable operators migrate towards digital services. "When we started it
was in analogue and we've been able to work with the cable operators,
they enjoy working with us, and all have plans to go digital.

MC Europe has now added Comcast's Cleveland and Darlington franchises
to its roster of UK cable operators. The service will potentially be
available to an additional 225,000 homes. It follows the rollout onto
the Birmingham franchise.

NOZEMA PLANS TO SHELVE CASEMA STAKE

Dutch transmission company Nozema wants to shelve its 22 % stake in
Dutch MSO Casema - and KPN is quick to express its interest in gaining
full control of the company. KPN now owns 76.7% of Casema, Holland's
major MSO with over 1.2 connected cable homes.

Nozema is a Dutch company that owns and operates the transmitters for
Dutch public and private television and radio broadcasters. The company
is partially privatised, but the Dutch government plans to sell the
remaining 59% share it still owns later this year. Once completely
privatised, Nozema will need to invest heavily in new transmitters for
the upcoming DAB and terrestrial digital television. Therefore, it
wants to shed its Casema shares and concentrate on its core business of
terrestrial broadcasting. Nozema has appointed the British bank
Rothschild to handle the sale of its share in Casema.

KPN's intention to buy up Nozema's shares in Casema have angered
Minister Jorristma of Transport and Communication, who says KPN's share
in Casema should be decreased. The minister is afraid that Dutch cable
companies will not start cable telephony in competition with KPN as
long as KPN is a major shareholder in Casema. After acquiring Nozema's
shares KPN would own 99.3% of Casema. The company wants to have a
strong hold on Casema when its planned merger with the cable systems of
Philips Media takes place.

Casema announced it wants to double its capital by issuing new shares.
The company says it needs fresh capital to invest in updating its cable
networks and offering new services. Casema plans to issue new shares
worth Gld175 million (#70m) only with its existing shareholders.

ARCADE GAINS AMSTERDAM ACCESS

From January 17 the two channels from the Arcade Media Group (TV10 and
The Music Factory) will at last be carried by the A2000/KTA network of
Amsterdam, but not all problems have been solved. A2000/KTA demands a
payment of Gld750,000 (#300,000) per channel per year (equalling
Gld1.50 per subscriber per channel), an amount which is five to six
times what Arcade pays to other cable operators. It is also much higher
than the amounts other broadcasters such as RTL4, Veronica and SBS6 are
paying A2000.

Arcade claims A2000 is misusing its monopoly and filed a complaint with
the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. It also began proceedings at
the Court of Amsterdam to force entrance to A2000. The Amsterdam judge
refused to rule as long as the proceedings at the Ministry are still
ongoing, but suggested the two parties to agree voluntary to a
temporary solution. The agreement between Arcade and A2000 calls for
monthly payments of Gld62,500 (#25,000) per channel until Arcade's
complaint at the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been resolved. Should
the ministry decide A2000's behaviour constitutes misuse of a monopoly,
the money will be restituted to Arcade.

SHAW, COGECO LAUNCH INTERNET SERVICES

Hot on the heels of Rogers Cablesystems' announcement of Wave, its
cable-modem PC access service, two more Canadian MSOs are dipping their
feet in the Internet. Shaw Communications has signed an agreement in
principle with Motorola for the purchase of 100,000 CyberSurfer cable
modems and Cogeco Cable has announced a partnership with St.Remy Press
Inc. for the development and marketing of a PC-based, mulitmedia
platform supporting a virtual shopping mall, to be run on its cable
network.

While Wave is now up and running, Shaw's access service is just
entering trials now and won't be launched until autumn. "We are looking
at some innovative concepts in packaging different tiers of services,"
said Brian Walters, Shaw's vice president for PC interactive services.
We are in the process of looking at the way we can nurture content
developers. At the end of the day we have to have an open platform so
that anyone who wants to, can be there."

Walters added that Shaw's basic Internet service will feature local
content, such as municipal services, entertainment and events tailored
to specific communities. Cogeco launched an Internet access service in
December and is in the process of rolling it out through its Quebec and
Ontario cable systems. It plans to test its virtual mall next spring,
for two months and then roll it out on a commercial basis. So far, all
of the announced cable provided PC access services are charging
somewhere in the C$35-$40 (#15-20) range, depending on whether or not
the modem is purchased or rented.

CANADA PLANS WORLD'S LARGEST MMDS SYSTEM

Manitoba-based Craig Broadcast Systems Inc. plans to become the world's
largest MMDS broadcaster in terms of geography. "It will be the largest
system in the world," said Stuart Craig, president and managing
director. "Nobody has ever tried this before. We will be broadcasting
from the Ontario to the Saskatchewan borders, east to west and from the
52 parallel to the American border, north to south."

In effect, Craig will be building a broadcast network that will
eventually cover more than half a million square kilometres with a
potential audience of slightly over one million.

"Manitoba is an ideal place for wireless cable with its flat terrain.
It's perfect for the delivery of signals and of course we have high
towers across the province which makes the project viable." Craig
Broadcast's wholly owned subsidiary SkyCable won the first licence
allocated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission, (CRTC) on December 20.

Craig has applied for an MMDS licence four times, beginning in 1983.
'The past applications were not successful because of CRTC decisions
and policies favouring cable." SkyCable's present business plans call
for investing C$26 million (#13m) to build nine transmission sites that
will reach 80% of Manitoba's population. Its initial target will be the
50,000 rural Manitobans who are outside cable areas. It will then
compete with existing cable companies in urban areas.

The addressable digital service will initially offer 40 channels of
programming including local, off the air stations, Canadian and
American networks and speciality channels, pay-per-view, pay TV, local
community channels and an educational channel and intends to upgrade to
60 channels.

Subscribers will pay a C$100 (#50) installation charge and a C$200
refundable deposit on the reception equipment. Antennas will vary in
size depending on the location of the nearest transmitter, ranging from
an 18 inch by 18 inch wire mesh receiver to a pencil-like antenna.

Subscription costs will be competitive with cable, starting with an
$18.95, 20 channel basic package and including three advanced tiers
ranging from $6.00 to $8.95. Craig's business plan calls for signing up
30,000 subscribers to be successful. He believes that compared to the
$1,000 plus costs of DTH systems, his MMDS network will prove
attractive to Manitobans.

HUGHES OPTS FOR SEA LAUNCH TO LOWER PRICES

Sea Launch, the first commercial satellite launching system to lift off
from an ocean-going platform has sold an initial series of ten launches
to Hughes Space and Communication Co, the Los Angeles-based satellite
manufacturer. It is the rocket consortium's first contract and the
financial details have not been released, although the contract's value
is believed to be in the $500 million (#325m) range.

Hughes' launches are scheduled to begin in 1998. Sea Launch Co is an
international joint venture with Boeing Commercial Space Co being the
lead partner with 40% of the equity, followed by Norwegian shipbuilder
the Kvaerner Group with 30%, Ukrainian rocket builder NPO Yuzhnoye with
15%, and Russian engine producer RSC Energia holding the remaining 25%.

The contract is seen as one of a series of moves by Hughes to 1ower the
price of commercial satellite launches by backing a number of different
launching systems. Large commercial satellite launches vary in cost
from $80 million (#52m) from reliable western providers, while Chinese
launches are believed to be in the $40 million (#26m) range. In the
past, Hughes has supported Chinese launch systems and recently gave a
ten launch contract to McDonnel Douglas Corp as an incentive to develop
a new rocket.

When asked if Hughes was attempting to lower the cost of launching
satellites, A spokesman for the Boeing space program replied, "If you
subscribe to the opinion, the more competition the better the price,
then I think that is the correct assumption. One of the goals of our
system is to be more cost effective and very competitive in price."

Sea Launch will be based in southern California. The Ukrainians will be
providing two stage Zenit rockets for the project while the Russians
will be supplying the upper stage or the rocket and other key systems.
The rockets will be assembled on a 650 foot (197)m long assembly and
command ship being built by the Kvaerner Group in Glasgow which is also
converting a 450 foot oil rig into a launch platform. Boeing is
supplying project management. The assembly and command ship will
probably be located in Long Beach, California and the launches will
take place in international waters in the Pacific.

CAPE BLAZE DASHES DSTV HOPES

MultiChoice's hopes of meeting early sales targets for its South
African digital DTH package, DSTV, have been dashed as a result of the
fire which destroyed the Cape Town factory producing Panasonic's MPEG-
2/DVB receivers in December, leaving the market totally dependent on
Pace.

The fire, apparently caused by an electrical fault, caused R30 million
(#5.31 million) worth of damage, destroying the production line from
which Panasonic was hoping to deliver 35,000 digital boxes before the
end of the year.

At the time of the fire, Panasonic had shipped only some "two to three
thousand" receivers, according to MultiChoice general manager marketing
Cobus Scholtz, who confirmed that the fire had "severely affected"
early roll-out targets for the 16-channel DTH service.

Soon after the fire, Panasonic said it hoped to restore production by
February. However, the full extent of the damage only became clear
later, and according to MultiChoice general manager, sales and
distribution, Deon Coetzee, Panasonic is now unlikely to be able to
supply any units until April, thus threatening prolonged shortages.
"Fortunately for us, Pace has come to the party rather nicely," he
said, "They're expected to supply 15,000 units in January and 10,000 in
February."

Hopes that Grundig might emerge as an alternative supplier had not
materialised, Coetzee added: "I understand they are still in talks with
Irdeto in Europe over the conditional access system." Grundig is
however expected to supply DVB IRDs for the consortium launching a
German language digital package for Africa. Meanwhile Echostar is
expected to bring its Star Walker approved DVB receivers into the
market, but not until March/April.

Despite the setbacks, Coetzee estimated sales since the DSTV launch in
November had totalled around 10,000 - "not too bad, considering." While
much of the momentum created by the first phase of marketing had been
wasted because there wasn't product to meet demand, he added, a "second
thrust" would be launched in late January, highlighting the latest
additions to the package: Discovery in early January, plus a local
Christian channel, Rhema; with EBN, Sci-Fi Channel, Bloomberg, Zee TV
and BET On Jazz to follow over the coming months.

EXPRESSVU, DIRECTV GET DTH LICENCES

On December 20, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission licensed Expressvu and Power DirecTv as authorised providers
of DTH services in Canada. It rejected a bid by Homestar, owned by a
cable consortium led by Canada's second largest MSO, Shaw
Communications.

Homestar's bid was rejected because the commission judged that it would
not be able to gain transponder space. Homestar intended to lease space
from Primestar, the American DTH operator owned by cable MSOs.
Primestar recently lost an orbital slot when the American Federal
Communications Commission took back the one it had intended to use to
launch a DBS satellite.

While DTH licences have now been granted, it is still uncertain as to
when operations will finally begin. Power DirecTv had asked the
commission to establish a cable tax on all cable subscribers to cover
its estimated C$17 million (#8.5m) in uplink costs. Without the tax,
Power DirecTv has said that it won't be able to turn a profit. Power
DirecTV is now considering its options and has declined to state what
it will do.

ExpressVu, which had originally been granted a licensing exemption in a
bid to kick-start cable competition is once again stalled in technical
problems with a glitch in its descrambling technology.

ExpressVu had originally been slated to launch last September but
failed to do so claiming at the time that the cable companies were
hogging transponder space. ExpressVu now believes that it will be in
service by the second quarter of 1996.

While the company has been unable to launch, it has been carrying on a
marketing program. "We are looking foreward to bringing a hundred plus
channels of digital audio and video services to places that have never
had that kind of service before," said Chris Franks, ExpressVu's vice
president of regulatory affairs.

'We are just working the last bugs out of our technology and we want to
come to the marketplace with a bullet proof operation. All the other
major DTH/DBS operations around the world have had significant delays.
I don't think we have lost any credibility. We have had over 10,000
calls on our 800 number."

The Commission's decision stated that within six months of the launch
of Canadian DTH services it would hear new applications for DTH
licences. Shaw has said that it will reapply at that time.

Meanwhile StarChoice, owned by Direct Choice of New Brunswick, has
already filed an application for a DTH licence. It plans to receive its
American signals from the just launched Echostar 1.

The company plans to use Echostar receiving equipment. Like Echostar
StarChoice plans to distribute through an established TVRC company,
Walling Communications Corporation.

StarChoice plans to launch by the third quarter of 1996. If the already
licensed services fail to launch quickly, that date will be rolled
back.

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES DBS, COMPETITION BEGINS

Echostar Communications Corp, successfully launched its high powered
DBS satellite Echostar 1 from China on December 28 and now hopes to be
in the marketplace by late February or early March.

Echostar plans to launch Echostar 2 from China during the summer. The
service will provide over 200 channels of digital video, audio and data
services and become America's second true DBS provider, after DirecTv.

While Primestar offers DTH services, it transmits from a medium powered
satellite restricting its receiving dishes to a now ungainly 30 inches
(76cm). AlphaStar, slated to start service during the first quarter of
1996, will also transmit from a medium powered satellite. True DBS
delivery systems use 18 inch receivers.

Echostar believes that it is in a strong position to compete with the
established American DTH and DBS providers. To begin with it has been
in the TVRO business as a hardware supplier since 1980 and has
operations in Holland, Spain, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia
and India. For the five years ending in 1994, the company captured 25%
of the over 2.1 million DTH units sold in the US.

"We have experience with DTH satellite products and dealers and we have
a very loyal existing base of TVRO dealers that will be our first
distribution path," said an Echostar spokesperson. "We also have the
most advanced technology. We are fully MPEG-2 compliant. DirecTv is
mostly MPEG-2 but in the area of communication between various pieces
of electronic equipment they are not. In addition DirecTv has two
sources of programming, DirecTv and USSB. If you want the full
compliment of cable programming you have to subscribe to both which
creates two bills and two cost centres. That gives us an advantage;
there will be a programming price difference."

While not yet ready to release its marketing or launch plans, Echostar
plans to come into the market at prices below other DBS/DTH providers.
Its prospectus states that the retail cost of an Echostar receiving
system will be in the $500 (#325) range, well below the cost entry
level costs of $700 (#455) for a DirecTV system.

Echostar will also be offering the system for direct sale, purchase
through financing and a leasing option. As far as subscription fees go,
the prospectus states that EchoStar intends to offer customised
packages of programming at prices below current cable and DBS/DTH
services.

"As far as the market goes," said Echostar, "we have seen numbers
anywhere from 12-20 million and we think it is at the high end of that
range. Certainly there is room for three to four players."

DUTCH INVITATION

Dutch junior minister of European Affairs Patijn has invited Belgium
public broadcaster BRTN to join the proposed pan-European Dutch
language satellite channel BVN - best of Dutch TV. Early last Summer
both Radio Nederland Wereldomroep (the Dutch world service radio) and
NOS simultaneously, but independent of each other, launched the idea of
a Dutch public satellite channel to reach the 600,000-odd Dutch living
abroad in Europe. So far, the plan has not materialised, mainly because
of difficulties in funding the project. With the possible co-operation
of the Flemish pubcaster, BVN might get off the ground in 1996.

AN UNCERTAIN LAW

Spain's cable law was finally passed by Parliament on December 15 and
came into effect On January 1. The law seems to satisfy no one, but
everybody agrees that it is much better to have a bad law than no
regulation at all, reports David Del Valle.

The Spanish cable law could have a short life if, as forecast, the
Conservative party (Partido Popular) comes to power in March and
overturns the legislation. Flying in the face of the law, PP is
insisting on putting cable TV cable licences out to tender within its
townships. Now the new law has come into effect there is some doubt
over the powers of the government to overturn licences already awarded
by regional and municipal authorities in PP-governed areas of Spain.

Besides PP's ardent opposition to the law, the Spanish cable bill has
failed to meet the demands of programmers, operators, political parties
and even the Government has voiced its opposition. The law was
introduced to fill a legal vacuum in the cable telecommunications
industry in Spain and to try to put the industry in order. All
political parties (PSOE, IU, CiU and PNV), except the conservatives,
reached a general consensus and decided, despite not being sure about
it, to approve a cable law. "The most important thing is there is a
law", said Miguel Puig, of CiU, who added that there are many things
which now need to be resolved on the technical side. Puig said the law
is too municipalist and is worried that networks awarded by townships
will give rise to "unadvanced networks dedicated only to television".

Puig agreed with programmers and operators that the law "fails to limit
the monopoly held by Telefonica and Canal Plus" and doesn't agree with
the limit of 2 million subscribed homes. The minister of Public Works
and Transport, Jose Borrell, also made his disagreement with this limit
clear and claimed "it will have constitutional problems because it
discriminates, as well as not corresponding with technological
reality". Borrell explained the need of having a cable law, however.
"We have bet on the future, not on the past. We think that this law
will allow the development of cable-based  multi-media services and
broadband networks. If a law had been passed three years ago, it would
have been obsolete by now and wouldn't have been able to meet the
current demands". He attacked PP's move to award cable licences and
calls on the party to "abandon hasty initiatives which are outside the
law, only satisfy political opportunism and which could endanger
investment in and the future of cable". He added, "we will challenge
PP's licence allocations if we consider that they exceed municipal
authority and invade ours (state authority) and if licences are awarded
not just for television, but also telecommunication services."

The Government is to create a regulatory authority responsible for
solving problems and conflicts between programmers and cable operators
which would be composed of administration, operators and programmers.

The president of Telefonica, Candido Velazquez claimed his network will
be "open to any programmers, besides Cablevision (Canal Plus). We will
be in cable wherever possible and we have approached Antena 3, Prensa
Espanola, Grupo Moll and many others". Velazquez, who assured that
"Cablevision will be operating under the same conditions as others"
considers the period of nine months which Telefonica will have to wait
before starting operations as "too long for those who want to have
cable television as soon as possible". In cities where the private
operator has no licence, Telefonica and Canal Plus will have to delay
their plans until their competitor has the correct authorisation.

Programmers, for their part, are also very critical. Eugenlo Galdon,
president of Multitel, the company which recently joined with ABC and
UIH to exploit cable in Spain and Portugal, claimed that this
"conservative" law "benefits Telefonica and Canal Plus, which both have
the monopoly of telephony and pay TV, respectively, in Spain". For him,
"it is very worrying that this law comes to light without the support
of one of the main political parties (Partido Popular)".  Galdon
criticised the limits of each demarcation (50,000 minimum and 2 million
as maximum subscribers). In his opinion, this law gives a lot of
privileges to Telefonica, because it will be able to offer both
telephony and television services, while private operators will be able
to offer only television. "This doesn't promote competition", he
concluded. According to his forecasts, two different scenarios could
take place between years 2000 and 2010 regarding cable penetration and
telephony shares in the hands of cable companies. The first one, which
he described as a good and acceptable situation, indicates, according
to his figures, that in the year 2000 cable penetration might be 20%
and in 2010, around 60%. In this situation, by the year 2000 cable
companies would manage 3% of telephony and in 2010, 20%. The second
one, a failure situation, in 2000 cable penetration would be around 10%
and in 2010, 35%. Regarding telephony, it would be 6%.

Terrestrial channel Antena 3, which has just launched five digital
Channels on Hispasat through a new company called Cable Antena, is very
unhappy with this law and has accused the Government of favouring Canal
Plus. "This law discriminates against programmers in favour of Canal
Plus", complained Manuel Campo Vidal, vice president of Antena 3. He
criticised Telefonica for joining up with Canal Plus which, according
to him, "will act as a gatekeeper which everyone, who wants to offer
his programmes through Telefonica's networks, will have to pass groups
all autonomous channels), Jordi Vila, claims that "our intention is to
be on satellite and there are four televisions (TV3, Canal Sur, ETB and
TVG) interested in it. We will form national or international alliances
to compete".

He also cast doubt on Telefonica's claim that it will have its network
open to everyone. "Canal Plus will determine the encryption system, fix
prices and determine where each channel goes. "Free access to
Telefonica's network is vital, as otherwise the development of cable
will be stopped."

Juan Luis Cebrian, member of the Canal Plus board, replied that 'this
law doesn't have any effect on the agreement between Canal Plus and
Telefonica" and justified the alliance on the need of making huge joint-
ventures to exploit cable.  He added, "according to our forecasts, we
won't make any profit on cable until within 10 years". He made it clear
that pay TV will only mean between 8 and 10% of turnover on cable, with
telephony services the most profitable. Cebrian denied that Cablevision
will act as a gatekeeper and fix prices".

Meanwhile, Cablevision continues its expansion throughout Spain - 16
cities already receive its 41 channels. Subscription to Cablevision
available from the end of the month will cost Pst 2,675 and Pst 6208 if
the subscriber also wants Canal Plus. In Barcelona, Cablevision has
already 2,600 homes connected out of a potential 12,000 homes.

KIDS CHANNELS INCREASE VIEWING SHARES

The success of children's channels helped cable and satellite channels
regain some of their audience share lost in 1994, according to a report
from the ITC. The viewing share for cable and satellite channels
increased from 34.9% to 39.6% between October 1994 and 1995, while
BBC1's share slipped from 24.3% in 1994 to 21.2%.

Children's viewing of cable and satellite channels as a whole accounts
for over half of their total viewing according to the survey conducted
by Continental Research. Some 54.4% of 2 to 15 year olds viewed cable
and satellite channels in 1995, compared with 47.3% in October 1994.
Preference for cable and satellite channels is even more pronounced
amongst younger age groups accounting for 63.9% of viewing among 2 to 9
year olds.

The viewing share for Cartoon Network rose across all individuals from
2% in 1994 to 4.5% in 1995. This share reaches 30.5% among 2 to 9 year
olds.

The recently launched Disney Channel accounts for 1.8% of total viewing
rising to 6.2% of all children's viewing (2 to 15 year olds) and 10.1%
of the younger age group (2 to 9 year olds).

TCC, increased its share from 0.6% in 1994 to 1.3% in 1995 (all
individuals, while its share among children (2 to 15 year olds) rose to
5.1% of all viewing.

DUTCH AD SPEND

For the first time in history spending on TV advertising on Dutch
channels surpassed the one billion guilder mark (#400m). Public
broadcasters are not the beneficiaries of the extra money spent on
commercials - the share of Ster went down from 50% to 35%, while IP
went up top 60%. SBS 6 is expected to take in between 3 and 5%. In real
terms, Ster's 1995 income is down 30 million guilders to 455 million.
IP's income is up to 555 million, mainly because of the arrival of
Veronica as a commercial channel. SBS 6 will take in around 20 million,
while other channels, including Euro 7, Kindernet and local cable
channels will grab 40 million.

its1995 pretax profit would easily exceed that of previous years,
largely due to proceeds from the September sale of its 9.75% stake in
BSkyB.

COMMENT

Cable telephony is not futuristic, it's happening now, cutting users'
bills and earning cable operators significant profits, utilising
existing catv infrastructures. It's also a vital component in cable's
move to being the first choice provider of access to interactive
services.

Yet in the UK where liberalisation occurred some five years ago, an
astonishing 65 per cent of UK telecoms managers did not even know that
cable TV companies offered telephony services according to a recent CIT
Research report, Business Telecoms trends in the UK 1995.

This level of ineptitude in marketing, this gross failure to accelerate
the recouping of capital investment, is almost beyond belief. If the
telecommunications professionals don't even know that cable is here in
the telecom market is it any surprise that connection rates generally
are not higher? It means that the salesman is often trying to persuade
people to buy something that many have never even heard of.

The UK may be a test bed for liberalised cable technology, but probably
the biggest lesson learnt from the British experiment is how not to
market cable telephony.

Let your customers know what you are offering and what its benefits are
- its so simple - isn't it? So why hasn't it happened in Britain?
Because, CCA notwithstanding, the UK's cable operators are more divided
than the former Yugoslavia. In five years they have never managed to
cooperate sufficiently well to be able to put out a single national
campaign on terrestrial TV.

And yet despite almost no one knowing cable telephony exists, it is a
roaring success with penetration rates and income levels exceeding
catv. It makes you wonder how many people would know who to call to
install cable TV, or even know if that is available in their area.

No such problems in Chile or Russia, to name but two countries where
the shortage of copper in the ground (what an ironic statement to make
about Chile) means that integrated hybrid coax fibre from the catv
companies is actually a preferred route to introduce telephony. For
countries such as Holland where a mature cable network exists, the use
of ASDL upgrading, or overlay technologies may look more appealing -
certainly financially given the costs of laying cable.

In truth there is not one simple answer, and local circumstances,
including infrastructure and regulatory climate and historical/cultural
factors will dictate the route to converged interactive services.

But there can surely be no doubting now that this is the destination of
the superhighway, and whether you upgrade your current route or build a
new one, without an on-ramp your country and economy is doomed to
suffer the plight of an information backwater.

SPANISH FRANCHISES IN CHAOS

The Spanish cable law bill, finally approved by parliament, comes into
force early this month (December) backed by all political parties
except the conservative Partido Popular, which remains firmly opposed
to the bill.

The first legal cable licences are to be awarded by the government by
mid-1996, for 15 year periods. The PP says the Spanish parliament is
churlish rushing through the new cable law without the support of a
party which could be in power by spring, and claimed the bill was anti-
competitive and advantaged Telefonica.

Madrid, Valencia and Vigo, whose councils are held by PP, have given
the go-ahead to public meetings awarding cable licences on their own
terms. Minister of public works Jose Borrell commented, "Investors in
these towns are taking a big risk because the licences are just for
television and not any other services, which must comply with the law."
Other political parties warned of the possibility these licences being
nullified.

A spokesman for Spanish Cable Telecommunications Association, Ademat,
adds, "We are against this law as it is incomplete and does not prevent
monopolies like Telefonica/Canal Plus." Cablevision, a joint venture
between Telefonica and Canal Plus, started a 5,000 home test
transmission in Barcelona, running until January 31 offering 34
channels for free.

Cable operator Multitel says that Telefonica will retain its dominant
position as it can offer television and telephony services before other
operators who must wait for liberalisation in 1998. Multitel added that
limits on the number of subscribers should refer to the number of homes
passed not subscribed ones. The cable bill states that no operator can
have over 1.5 million subscribers (almost 5 million homes passed) to
prevent a company having 50 per cent of the potential cable market (12
million homes).

The PP has since said it will award cable licences at the beginning of
December in all 54 towns with over 100,000 inhabitants in which it
governs. These licences would cover telecoms and catv, and run for 20
years.

Telefonica will also need to receive the PP's go-ahead to operate catv.
However, the PP will not allow municipal investment in local cable
networks, while foreign ownership will be restricted to 40 per cent.

Sandy Saunderson has been appointed director of business
telecommunications at Cable London with responsibility for business
telephony and television.

TELEPHONY LEADS GROWTH

Videotron's latest figures show dramatic growth in revenue and
operating cash flow led by telephony, with a 53 per cent revenue
increase to #57.5 million for the fiscal year ending August 31, but net
losses doubled to #13.2 million.

Residential telephony revenues are up a vast 79.9 per cent to #27.3
million, exceeded by business telephony, up 87.9 per cent to #5.7
million, telephony income having overtaken catv revenues (themselves up
26.5 per cent to #24.5 million) to account for almost 60 per cent of
revenues. Operating cash flow/EBITDA has more than doubled, from #2.2
in 1994 to #6.9 million in 1995.

"We have entered the new fiscal year with 45 per cent of our network
built-out for cable television and 39 per cent for both cable
television and residential telephone. The forthcoming year will be
marked by our transition from a high technology construction company to
a full-service telecommunications company," says Louis Brunel,
Videotron CEO and managing director.

Total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 (compared to 1994)
saw 38.6 per cent growth to #15.8 million; catv revenues jumped 26.5
per cent to #6.5 million for the quarter with monthly revenue per
customer up from #20.25 to #21.28. Annualised churn came down from 31.2
per cent to 29.6 per cent despite a rate card increase.

Residential telephony revenues of #31.18 per month were achieved, with
churn of 17.4 per cent. The quarter's business telecommunications
revenues were up a third to #1.5 million with business churn falling
from 20.3 per cent to 17 per cent. Loss from operations was #2.0
million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, up 60 per cent, with the
year's losses at #7.4 million, up 34.2 per cent.

DUTCH REGULATORY DISPUTE

The Dutch cable regulatory regime looks set to be altered following two
broadcasters - Eurosport and Arcade - each filing complaints alleging
operators had abused their local monopolies when they asked for high
carriage fees. Junior minister of culture Ad Nuis said he would prefer
cable operators to come under general competition law, but
parliamentarians appear to favour a new law directed specifically at
the sector, a view which gained extra support following the cable
operators' poor performance at a recent parliamentary hearing.

Nuis received support for a separate proposal to transform Holland's
public broadcasting system by merging the 30-plus pubcasters into a
single network by the year 2000. He proposed that the a newly-formed
public body would offer one or two channels instead of the current
three, with one of the services remaining commercial-free.

Nuis appointed a committee to study the future of the Dutch public
broadcasting system. Chaired by Democrat Mijndert Ververs, the group
will make its recommendations by April, allowin further debate before
summer's parliamentary recess.

EXPRESSVU SCHEDULES LAUNCH FOR DECEMBER 1

Canada Canadian DTH provider ExpressVu finally scheduled its launch for
December 1, delayed from September 1. Blaming the late launch on the
Canadian cable industry, ExpressVu explained that a shortage or
transponder space on Anik E-1 was caused by the cablecos refusing to
get out of the way. Instead of delivering the 100 channels the company
had hoped for, ExpressVu will launch with 40, and move up to over 100
early in 1996, when transponder space becomes available. .

ECC '95 PREVIEWS INTERACTIVITY

October's European Cable Communications show was the biggest dedicated
cable event on the continent, with all the main hardware and software
companies present, the telecos taking further steps into the cable
market, a range of cable targeted programming companies, from Travel
and NCB to Playboy,TVX and Penthouse - the latter two hot channels in a
frosty ownership dispute to UK rights, and attendance from throughout
Europe.

Response to the conference was also positive, boosting international
representation with several East European visitors in addition to
visitors from the rest of Europe, Israel, Turkey and India.

The majority of exhibitors and visitors remained British.

Convergence, DVB and MPEG compliance featured strongly throughout the
show - some of the thunder stolen by major unveilings at Telecom '95 in
Geneva less than a fortnight before.

In his opening speech, UK minister for science and technology, Ian
Taylor declared "Anti-competitive or restrictive behaviour will elicit
a firm response from the authorities." In a thinly-veiled warning to
BSkyB, Taylor said that although companies which risk their capital and
work hard are entitled to a commensurate return, ignoring de facto
monopolies could do as much harm as restoring legal monopolies. The
government would tighten up its regulation of pay-TV and access
systems.

The head of the European Commission directorate general for competition
Herbert Ungerer also delivered a warning to 'gatekeepers' of
conditional access saying markets must first be liberalised before
dominant players can be allowed to join forces. "We cannot risk digital
interactive TV or global mobile satellite systems markets being sewn up
by defensive commercial moves before they are open to competition. The
risk of collusion and abuse of dominant position clearly outweighed
potential benefits of co-operation and convergence," said Ungerer,
citing the proposed alliance between Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom and
the Kirch-group in Germany.

De facto monopolies were also attacked by the director general of the
UK telecommunications regulatory body Oftel, Don Cruickshank who
criticised BT's agreement with the labour party, saying that it was
anti-competitive in nature.

Director-general of the CCA Richard Woollam described BT's deal with
labour as "an attempt to destabilise investor companies."

During the show the UK's three largest cable companies, Nynex
Cablecomms, Telewest and Bell Cablemedia announced they are to launch
the first phase of the multimedia services trial in January 1996 to
lead to the development of commercial applications, as well as
establish standards to achievement the equivalent of a single national
network for multimedia broadband services.

Comcast is to roll-out digital music service Music Choice to its
Cleveland and Darlington franchises following its successful launch in
Birmingham adding a potential 225,000 homes to Music Choice's reach.

Scottish Television is to launch a cable channel, the Scottish Channel,
to be entirely made in Scotland, following the channel's recent
alliance with Flextech.

The Travel channel launched an Internet Web site in conjunction with
its US sister company, The Travel Channel. The Web site will allow an
estimated 35 million Internet users free access to an on-line network,
comprising a wide range of interactive travel information. Truly
complementary, additional data on programmed destinations is provided
by Internet, which alerts browsers to forthcoming programmes likely to
be of interest to Web surfers. Access the web using the following URL :
http://www.travelchannel.com/

European Business News is launching a new weekend show for teenagers
and students The Insiders' Guide To Business, designed to demystify
business concepts and jargon and encourage young people to see business
in a new way.

Ericsson launched its new Pay TV Delivery System offering extended
services such as pay per view and premium channels over cable networks
without the subscriber needing to install any additional equipment. It
also demonstrated its Universal Personal Telecom-munication and hybrid
fibre/ coax video telephony system.

Scientific Atlanta introduced its new System 70 fibre optic platform,
supporting applications such as low cost broadband delivery of basic
programming, targeted service delivery to small pockets of subscribers,
ring interconnection and headend consolidation.

Bytel announced the release 26 of its care and billing system Bytel SMS
with additional functionality for cable and telecommunications
operators.

Ascom Telecommunications showed its Baseband ATM modems. CableData
demonstrated its Intelecable Interactive Broadband Module used to
manage and bill interactive services such as VOD. It also showed
interactive service features such as Viewer Profile and transaction
Processing on Intelecable.

BSKYB - "WE WERE RIGHT"

Allen Saunders, executive director, corporate communications at Nynex
CableComms UK, is disappointed with current catv market penetration,
but emphasises low churn rates

Nynex now has 40 per cent of its UK franchises built out, with 165,000
catv subscribers and 190,000 telephone lines installed, and is on
schedule to complete its system, passing 2.7 million homes, by the end
of 1998.

But first nine months pre-tax losses rose 51 per cent to #78.5 million
for 1995 compared to the same period 1994 - as expected.

Residential telephony is a significant success story, with penetration
at 23.8 per cent, and revenues more than doubled to #24.2 million,
vindicating the policy of maintaining a 25 per cent differential below
BT rates. But catv penetration at 18.9 per cent falling from 19.5 per
cent, and significantly short of the industry average of 21 to 22 per
cent. Television revenues doubled - to #26.4 million, and turnover for
the period also doubled, to #57.1 million.

Saunders comments, "We are not satisfied with the level of penetration
and this is a high priority issue for us - we place a great emhpasis on
keeping our churn rates down, probably the lowest in the industry. What
is critical is customer retention. Our last published telephony churn
figure was 15.8 per cent - industry estimates suggest 12 per cent is
accounted for by people moving house and those taken off for bad debt.
We don't really make it easy as we have a 12 month contract, strongly
encourage direct debit, and we don't offer free or discounted
introductory services."

"The product mix is good and getting better with channels like Disney,
and there will be several more coming on in 1996 when we are confident
the industry will break through the barrier. It has grown faster than
the US, developing a multichannel service in just four years."

Nynex was criticised by other cable companies when, along with
Telewest, it entered into a separate agreement with BSkyB. Saunders
says, "It was the right thing to do at the time; after Oftel's
intervention, the rest of the industry ended up with better terms.

"Bundling of programmes is an issue that has to be addressed. My
personal view is that catv will evetnually become an a la carte
service. As a viewer, I want to pay for what I want, when I want it.
People are currently being forced to take channels that they don't
want."

"Some companies have been successful with packages and others with a la
carte so it is not clear which is the best system. There has to be some
latitude in programme packaging and this will be a key factor in
getting revenues from our customers."

On Murdoch, Saunders said, "You have to admire what he has done - he
bet his business on satellite in the UK. But you must question the
Hollywood studios signing up films for such a long time - and Premier
League TV."

"As individual operators we probably haven't done a good job of
explaining our excellent product mix. Our marketing has not been so
good. On telephony - we have brought true competition to BT and have
helped the end user. We have considerble experience in the telecoms
world - its not new to us. People are amazed at the cost savings (of
switching to cable)."

"Number portability due in 1996 could add five to 10 per cent of homes
passed, increasing our penetration 25 per cent ."

Cable telephony probably won't retain its current levels of cost
differential next century as regulators bring BT costs down - then the
differentiation will be the service provider. "Our philosophy is to get
the customer for life. Both the level of service and the service range
has to be the latest and the best - you can't have a failing network."

Would Nynex use ADSL technology to bring (existing) networks to the
standard of fibre? "No. In the US we are committing to change copper
networks for fibre. The Select Party review which said early entry by
BT into the entertainment market would result in #10 billion to upgrade
to fibre described something which it is going to have to do anyway."

"A billion pounds was wiped off cable stock when (oppositionleader)
Blair made his unclear statement. What will they (BT) do to help the
hospitals, schools or libraries that they have connected? We are the
unsung heroes, connecting them today."

There was a silver lining however as, "It was a key part of Blair's
speech and so it was good to get cable on the political agenda. It has
a raised public awareness of cable."

On new technologies, Saunders explained, "We have commercial
interactive services on trial and have talked with a lot of people, but
nothing is concluded at this stage. There is a market requirement for
games, but it has to be packaged at the right price for the user. We
welcome PPV coming in and expect to have something in place in 1996. We
expect time shifting will also be a great winner, provided as a form of
pay per view."

Lack of commercial interactive services reflects perceived market
readiness, availability of service providers and pricing rather than
implementation issues explains Saunders, declaring, "Technology is not
a problem, we have a network that will take whatever you want put down
it."

TELEPHONY: THE BIG PICTURE

A new report on the UK Cable Market from Goldman Sachs provides an
excellent overview of the current UK cable market, including many
observations on cable telephony in the UK that will have relevance to
other catv operators looking to introduce telephony

The main thrust of the report is that competition will continue to
increase and prices will fall, but that the market remains a lucrative
one with great potential for revenue earnings, though its relative
small size could result in mergers.

Combined catv/telephony revenues in the UK are currently around #60
($100) per home, triple the $32 per home achieved in the US. Cable
franchise areas are exclusive and interconnect charges are regulated,
so profitability is ensured, which has spurned on the UK build rate,
leaping 55 per cent to 850,000 homes passed in the first half of 1995.

Long term forecasts for cable telephony penetration are 38 per cent by
2003, but the average residential penetration is 25 per cent though
Diamond Cable is achieving 45 per cent. This has been achieved prior to
number portability which should be in force in 1996 - forecast to boost
penetration by 6 to 8 per cent. "The lack of portability acts as a
disincentive to changing supplier and if this barrier is removed I am
convinced that suppliers will strive to improve their services to
attract new customers and improve efficiency," says Don Cruickshank,
director general of Oftel.

Business telephony penetration varies wildly between operators, from
single figures to 23 per cent, and it accounts for 45 per cent of
revenues at Diamond Cable.

BT has a 90 per cent share of the #12.8 bn ($20.2 bn) UK telephony
market. But since opening up, this relatively small market has become
highly competitive with multiple long distance operators, multiple
wireless operators, and a growing number of local exchange operators
(BT, Mercury, Colt and the cable operators) hence there is expected to
be pressure for consolidation. Goldman Sachs suggests that UK cable
revenues (including catv and interactive services) are set to rise
1,900 per cent from #350 m ($553 m) in 1994 to #6.7 bn ($10.59 bn) by
2003.

Interconnect pricing is controlled by Oftel, but if and when BT looses
more than 25 per cent of the market (expected around 2001), current
legislation says cable will have to pay an Access Deficit Charge,
contributing toward the subsidy that BT claims it makes in local
interconnect pricing - though by that time open competition is
expected.

Meanwhile, BT is expected to increase its competition for the local
loop on the basis of Oftel dictated pricing - annual price reductions
equal to inflation (RPI) minus a productivity factor of 7.5 per cent
through to 1997. This equals some #400 m of annual price reductions,
but BT staffing is falling by 10,000 per year saving #250 m with
further savings in office space etc while lines are growing by 2 per
cent annually. BT would need to spend #15 billion ($23.7 bn) to rebuild
its network with fibre optic cabling. Most regional Bell Operating
Companies in the US have announced switched broadband overlay trials,
rather than using ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line)
technology, and so BT was expected to upgrade its network to fibre. But
a potential future Labour government (currently poll favourites) may
legislate to make it attractive to BT to interconnect with cable for
broadband services in the local loop rather than replicate the cable
companies' network.

Telecommunication companies Mercury and Energis are not seen as local
loop competitors, but their direct competition with BT in the long
distance interconnect should reduce interconnect charges to cable
companies. BT has introduced a range of incentives to maintain its
customers and also sends direct mail and calls people in newly cabled
areas to dissuade them from subscribing to cable telephony. It has also
(up until now) refused customer's number portability to cable, and
markets satellite dishes through its BT shops.

Videotron and Diamond Cable have responded by offering free local calls
between cable subscribers, and in all categories, cable telephony has
responded to BT price cuts, maintaining a pricing differential of 10 to
15 per cent below BT in every tariff category, with Nynex CableComms
saying it will maintain a 25 per cent discount to BT for the medium
term.

Another problem for BT is that it is the higher usage customers which
it is loosing. BT's average monthly residential spend is #18.50
compared to cable's residential telephony spend of #24. This may result
in targeted price reductions from BT in relation to specific
competitors and sectors, but it is not allowed to vary its pricing
geographically. However, it can use strategies such as price discounts
to selected numbers which are also BT, so that one person switching
would affect a whole circle of friends.

Both usage and the number of lines in the market is expanding
sufficiently to more than make up for the price declines as falling
prices stimulate usage growth.

In the face of falling prices, the report says success in the
telecommunications market will increasingly be driven by product
innovation, itself driven by software and marketing which highlights
these innovations.

Cable companies are buying the latest generation of switches to lead
the introduction of new services including voice mail, and Teen Talk
(Bell Cable) with different numbers on the same line.

The introduction of Centrex in business sites provides phantom PBX
internal communications solutions to form the local switch.

In London the interconnect local group has launched Integrated
Communications Network capital wide, offering private networks and
circuits and high speed data links plus standard telephony. This is
expected to be followed by the launch of a national cable business
telephony initiative with its own branding, expected within 18 months,
possibly using a company such as Energis for its long distance
operator.

BT and Mercury interconnection charges including local switching make
investment by cable companies in their own switches not only viable but
virtually inevitable, and most now have their own local switching
(Digital Local Exchanges). For an optimal nationally switched network,
a national joint venture between cable companies and perhaps a third
party is postulated.

Cable companies are advised to bid for wireless local loop licences in
their own areas for both defensive and offensive reasons, as the main
cost is the headend switching which could be merged with the catv
headend - and wireless would extend cable's telecommunication service
into rural areas.

For US companies looking to replicate their success in the UK back
home, costs will be higher as they will have to upgrade existing cable
plant through hybrid fibre/coax rebuilds and the deployment of
switching, independent power and subscriber network interface devices.

LOCAL LOOP BARS COMPETITION

Removing the local loop from state monopolies is seen as the biggest
barrier to competition, with the local loop accounting for 70 per cent
of the huge cost of building a national phone network.

The stranglehold on local telephone lines by state-owned monopolies
like France Telekom and Deutsche Telecom threatens to prevent the
genuine opening of European telecoms markets to competition by the
start of 1998 says a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It
suggests that the local loop should be owned by independent companies
concerned only with providing local access for any telecom operator,
and that these companies should get a set exclusive period in return
for upgrading the network to handle multimedia services.

BT in the UK saw its labour force cut by some 40 per cent (100,000
jobs) following privatisation, hence there is strong political and
union pressure to prevent a repetition in continental Europe's PTTs.

The Association of Private European Cable Operators (Apec) has called
on Europe's regulatory authorities to allow catv operators to directly
interconnect their networks, not via telecom leased lines but by their
own means - similar to the interconnect groups now being established in
the UK. It has also called for liberalisation of telephony on
alternative infrastructures before January 1998, with the January 1996
limited liberalisation as merely a timid first step.

Again, mirroring the UK model, Apec has called for seven to 10 year
periods of exclusivity rather than allowing public telecoms
organisations to enter entertainment markets as sooon as cable
operators enter voice telephony, citing the PTTs dominant postion and
decades-old monopolies as advantages to be overcome. A quick solution
to the problems of number portability and universal service are also
called for.

CORNERSTONE OFFERS COMPETITIVE EDGE

Global catv market players are increasingly turning to suppliers for
services beyond traditional voice switching to provide a competitive
edge to attract subscriber business.

Commercially attractive solutions are sought in the switching,
transport and access portions of their broadband networks. Nortel in
the UK is enlarging its product portfolio to meet this demand by
operators to deploy advanced data and multimedia services to business
and residential communities.

Flexibility is an essential part of Nortel's Cornerstone range which
comprises a family of coax access systems that interface seamlessly
with its switching, data and transmission products and can be tailored
to specific catv franchise requirements.

Cornerstone allows catv operators to introduce multiple services on to
their networks incrementally.

Cornerstone Voice and Cornerstone Data, enable existing HFC networks to
carry additional services, generating new revenue through controlled
incremental investment.

The Voice option enables narrowband services, from standard telephony
to advanced CLASS (customer local area signalling) features - such as
caller ID and call waiting - to be delivered over standard HFC plant.
Transmission quality, reliability and grade of service can exceed the
current copper telephony infrastructure.

Cornerstone Data enables catv operators to enter the growing home
working market, delivering high-speed data communications services
across their existing network, letting the service provider offer a
highly-competitive quality of service and feature set.

The emphasis is on delivery at a reasonable cost to subscribers, with
only minor modifications to existing cable plant and low capital
investment, even at low penetration levels.

By sharing bandwidth among a number of users, the Data option provides
a high peak rate to each user as most users only need network access
for a short time, downloading Web pages, or graphics files from an
office server. It uses ATM between the head-end and the data port to
ensure bandwidth is fairly distributed between users.

Cornerstone Data also lets operators charge users for the bandwidth
they take, not their connect time, allowing subscribers to browse
without having to disconnect then re-connect to a service and without
incurring bills for idle connect time.

Future Cornerstone products undergoing field trials offer multimedia
and wireless applications. Multimedia applications include highly
interactive services such as educational VOD, home shopping and
interactive games.

Cablevision Lightpath, the telephony subsidiary of Cablevision Systems,
is piloting and plans wide-scale deployment of services based on
Cornerstone Voice over its catv network in the New York City area. New
Brunswick Telephone is the first implementation of multimedia
applications with services due to include educational VOD, interactive
home shopping and advanced telecommunications services.

In October, Bell Cablemedia chose Nortel's ATM Magellan Passport switch
to run BCM's pilot data service in its London franchise area. This new
network includes Internet access, videoconferencing, LAN
interconnection and voice over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode).
Magellan Passports are being deployed alongside Nortel Rapport Internet
access dial-up switches.

LOW-COST INTERACTIVITY IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL

Israel's Gad Line has developed a communication system for telephony
over cable allowing low cost implementation of a variety of interactive
applications which is already fully operational, serving subscribers
worldwide. Gad Line saw the potential to take advantage of the two-way
broadband coax/fibre network infrastructure by utilising it to meet the
demand for efficient two-way video, voice and data communication
channels.

Its voice/data system incorporates communal telephony, public telephony
emergency and security features, data transfer including facsimiles,
the Internet etc and utility management. The utility feature has been
implemented by a German electric company to monitor electricity
consumption, and an exclusive residential complex in Brazil uses the
system for its security and internal telephony features. Other
voice/data systems have been installed internationally. The system's
largest contract is for the telephonic networking of Tianjin, China,
with its population of 8 million.

By mid-1996 Gad Line expects to have pilot schemes starting on its
digital system for the transfer of E1/T1, long-distance learning, home
shopping, VOD etc utilising microelectronic integrated technology
within one unified system.

The existing analogue voice/data system utilises frequencies which are
not occupied by the cable television channels over the catv network
with FDM technology with FSK modulation. The system comprises a
subscriber modem as the basic unit which is sited at the home or office
of the use. This unit interfaces between a standard telephone, fax or
computer and the catv network. It blocks noisy frequencies, allocates
the free frequencies to the subscribers, and is used for assigning ad
changing subscriber ID numbers.

Trunk interface units and trunk protocol converters perform the link
and the protocol conversion between the Public Switched Telephony
network and the telephony over cable system.

HYBRID FIBRE COAX CABLE TELEPHONY ON SHOW

During ECC '95 Ericsson demonstrated its hybrid fibre coax telephone
delivery system, developed in collaboration with First Pacific
Networks. There is no telephony overlay in integrated delivery - only
the hybrid fibre coax cable TV network is built. An RF modem in the
home connects to the incoming coax and provides a master socket and an
outlet at the set top box for cable TV. FPN's 10001 product has proven
itself in the UK, reducing overall build costs.

LETTING THE LOOP LOOSE

Terry Meredith of West End discusses integrating telephony and TV in a
cable network using HFC with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
to overcome capacity limits on the local loop

The initial premise is that operators using hybrid fibre/coax (HFC) can
save between 10 to 30 per cent in costs (depending on the country)
compared to an overlay approach. Using HFC, operators with installed
catv networks can avoid the civils cost of cable laying, gaining
privacy and security, which must be ensured by HFC due to the change
from a traditional copper star wired network to a shared star/bus
architecture.

Bandwidth efficiency is essential. The return path of a catv network is
typically five to 55 MHz, and an integrated HFC architecture must pack
circuits into this bandwidth without lowering the grade of service or
needing the local loop to be engineered.

Reliability of catv networks must also be assured, enabling them to
support lifeline telephony services, and so power plant must be planned
to provide the necessary levels of resilience, with home units
providing various powering options. Also, integrated TV/telephony must
provide flexible end to end service provision.

When looking at the architectural options available, HFC is the first
choice due to its broadband capability, with RF catv designs able to
provide multiple services on a single network. Standard catv
architecture with a bolt-on approach is the most cost effective
solution, eliminating construction, minimising cost and delivering
services to the customer as soon as they sign on.

In a catv network which has a return path implemented, telephony (plus
data and interactive services) can be added using the WestBound 9600
Broadband Access Platform by connecting a WestBound 9645 Broadband
Manager at the headend and one of a range of subscriber drops at the
user end. The WestBound 9600 supports multiple value added services
such as internet access and telephony. Every 64kB/s channel from the
headend is guaranteed a path in the same way as a traditional copper
network PTT, so there is no blocking and the integral cross connect
functionality at the head end is an important factor for leased line
networks.

It is possible to pack 480 x 64K channels into one 8MHz catv channel in
a totally on-blocking way eg 12 MHz supporting 720 channels provide for
greater than 100 per cent penetration in a typical HFC catv design. And
there are a range of other benefits accruing from use of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing - utilising 500 carriers (tones) each
2kHz wide and carrying 10kB/s of information. If ingress hits one of
the 2kHz bands, its affect is minimal, unlike single carrier systems
such as QPSK.

Security features include unique frequency allocation per subscriber,
and inherent random scrambling, similar to PCM AMI techniques.

Multiple integrated services for the residential and business market
include supporting digital or analogue telephony, with Centrex working,
leased line services for telephony and data, Lan interconnect services
with optional integral frame relay connectivity; teleworking
home/office connections, remote Lan, speeds up to 256kB/s; Infonet
services to add information services and gateways to third parties such
as the Internet. Future uses are expected to incorporate multimedia
services networks and the architecture - if not the infrastructure - is
already established to handle these services.

Continental Europe is particularly enthusiastic about employing 'bolt-
on' solutions to introduce telephony while the UK has an overlay
mentality, whereas in Eastern Europe and Latin America there are
bottlenecks in their local loops, with not enough copper in the ground,
are finding it more cost effective to increase telephony via catv
development. "We are aiming to be the local loop company in these
countries," says Meredith.

PARTNERSHIPS EXTEND ADC BROADBAND OFFERING

During Telecom 95 ADC Telecommunications Inc and Nokia
Telecommunications signed an agreement to cooperate on product
development for the global cable TV and telecommunications markets
based on ADC's Homeworx hybrid fibre coax broadband access platform and
Nokia's ACM2 access products. This will include joint development of
interfaces for EISI standard countries, and joint development of next
generation broadband platform solutions

"Our overlay system uses Nokia's SDH overlay for data using ACM2 - we
can take overlay networks to integrated networks," explained ADC's
Lynne High, adding that the cooperation meant the companies were able
to expand more rapidly, from a video product today to the incorporation
of voice/data from the same company.

ACM2 is a two megabit per second primary rate family for voice and data
services, while the Homeworx platform transports both digital and
broadband signals as well as narrowband telephony and data services
over HFC. ADC has also formed a telecom alliance with Hitachi telecom,
initially focused on sales and marketing, offering an end-to-end
solution for customers, including marketing Hitachi's Synchronous
optical network and ATM equipment with ADC's Soneplex and Homeworx
broadband access/transport platforms. A second phase will include a
joint venture for new products and further product integration. A cable
modem jointly developed with NetComm is scheduled to be available in
mid-1996.

CABLE ARRIVES AT TELECOM '95

As the divide between industry sectors becomes ever more blurred, the
cable fraternitynow participates in the encroaching telephony market -
including its four yearly extravaganza in Geneva, Telecom '95, held in
early in October.

Sponsored by the International Telecommunications Union, the show saw a
reputed $1 billion spent on stands by the 1,066 exhibitors, sprawled
over four exhibition floors, thronging with 189,671 participants - up
18 per cent on the 1991 event.

Larry Ellison, chairman and CEO or Oracle Corporation outlined his view
of the future - a fast network delivering everything to cheap set top
boxes. Under the company's plan, cable television would remain separate
from other devices such as computers and telephones but those devices
would be almost disposable.

 Network connected devices would download all the software and systems
needed to run direct from the network when switched on. The cable
providers couldchange systems often as the devices re-configure
themselves each time they are switched on. Set-top boxes being used by
BT in its interactive TV trials are the first examples of such
products.

Ellison suggests that "there is nothing less important than movies on
demand (MOD)" and he sees education, news on demand and commerce as far
more important, saying no cable company could justify building a new
network for Movies On Demand.

Ipitek Corporation was showing its new software system that allows
cable companies to make use of existing connections to satellite farms,
TV stations and other facilities by offering to route traffic between
them and charge for the service. Using new computer software in
conjunction with the California-based company's line up of Fibrehub and
Imtran Fibre Optic Transmission System units, the system offers more
flexibility and remote control of each point on the network from a
single PC.

ADC Telecommunications announced a development agreement with Nokia and
showed its line of Homeworx broadband access platforms (also see ADC
article this issue).

Ortel was receiving interntional interest for its linear optics
technology. The recently developed System-1000 unit allows operators to
take the complete frequency range from a satellite head end and send it
up to 40 km to the cable company. Ortel's Richard Mullikin, business
manager of satellite communications, said, "Ortel's System 1000 is
capable of accepting greater frequency ranges, it is cost-effective and
can be installed in a day."

Nortel launched Cogent at the show, an independent subsidiary of
Nortel, created to provide a complete consultancy for companies wishing
to build new networks or upgrade existing ones.

Brian Gowers, managing director of Cogent, explained the company would
supply its own personnel to initially come up with a network plan for
the desired system and, once agreed on, would offer contracts for
supply of the equipment.

Gowers stressed that it wasn't just a way to sell Nortel equipment,
pointing out that it chose Alcatel access equipment. He added tht none
of Nortel's competitors had refused to provide detailed technical
specifications for he bides and tht showed that they al recognised
Cogent as being independent.

As the system is built, Cogent supply key management personnel and will
take charge of hiring and training of employees in all areas of the
business from operation to sales.

The relationship built up with Cogent continues through to after-system
launch with Gowers adding, "We wouldn't want to exit less than 12
months after launch. Trying to step out too soon is a recipe to fall
over. It is a long term relationship."

The expo also saw the public debut of several new multimedia operating
systems. Sony unveiled its new system, Apertos, complete with a
futuristic looking set top box dubbed Pecchi, the Personal
Entertainment Computer and Communicator for Home Interaction.

Apertos offers a system on which operators can build complete
multimedia and video on demand services while the Pecchi box acts like
a traditional set top box as the interface between the network and in
home equipment which can now include a television set and radio tuner
plus computer or cable telephone.

Also competing was NEC Corporation which debuted a system that included
a broadband access network management system for fibre- to-the-curb and
fibre-to-the-building, and a service management system for VOD.

The ITU used the occasion to release its 250 page second World
Telecommunication Development Report on the state of telecoms around
the world. Among its main finding was that, internationally, the number
of new subscribers to cable television is continuing to rise.

In 1994 14.5 million cable subscribers were added, exceeding the 13.7
million rise in 1993. According to the ITU figures, almost 173 million
homes world-wide are now cabled including 76 million in the USA, 57
million in Asia and 38 million in Europe.

INTEGRATION ON TRIAL

Annual revenues for telephony via cable are now #330 million in the UK,
and forecast to exceed #1 billion by the year 2000, but this success
relies heavily on the capital needed to build the system. Previously
operators had to install an entirely separate network for
telecommunications, but integrated cable telephony (RF to the
Kerb/Home) based on transmission of the telephony signals within the
existing network lets the telephony system share the duct, street
cabinets, power and cabling of broadcast services.

Hughes Network Systems has tested its own integrated cable telephony
system, called Cable Telephony Transport System (CTTS), in an
operational environment.

Details are confidential but results are positive. CTTS has performed
well, delivering a reliable telephony service over the HFC network.
Telephony via an HFC network depends on two key subsystems. It
comprises a head end unit installed at or close to the catv head end,
and a number of remote nodes. Each remote node contains at least one
remote interface unit and primary multiplexer and servicing at least 30
subscribers. Concentration can be added to increase the number of lines
carried over the network. At the head end, traffic is presented as EI
(or TI) streams for direct connection, or via further transmission
links, to an exchange switch.

A cross connect facility in the headend enables grooming and
consolidation of traffic carried over the network. A network manager
provides configuration control and status and alarm monitoring. The
remote node is co-located with the catv equipment, usually sited in a
street side cabinet or in the utility room of an appartment. The home
link is made by copper pair to a standard telephone outlet eliminating
installation of equipment in the home.

Alternatively, diplexers can be used to add the telephony signal to the
coaxial drop cable so that no additional wiring is needed. This allows
some 30 to 60 homes to be served by a single remote node. By using
common circuitry the cost is shared over several lines, as opposed to
'RF to the home' where each telephone line has its own dedicated
equipment. RF to the kerb suits medium to high penetration areas
whereas 'RF to the home' is best used where penetration remains low.
Upgrade of the service, adding customers and maintenance, are simple
and quick, virtually eliminating home visits.

System power and backup is controlled by the operator. The system is
also very secure. Only signals designated for a given customer are
delivered to the premises so one customer cannot assume the identity of
another. For the business user, a range of line card types can be
fitted to the PMUX to provide ISDN and other data services. Also the
RIU can be used directly (without the PMUX) to provide 2048kbt/s
service.

And the system provides the infrastructure for interactive services in
the future. With the Hughes system, utilisation of bandwidth is very
efficient and can be configured for either narrow or broadband
services. Later cable modems will offer high performance ethernet over
the cable network providing high speed data communications plus
entertainment services, Internet and general on-line information.

TELLABS DEMONSTRATES REMOTE SERVICE UNIT

Tellabs demonstrated its new single-residence remote service unit (RSU)
for its Cablespan 2300 cable telephony system at ECC '95, delivering
integrated cable television and telephony services over standard
coaxial cable to the subscriber.

Single and multiline versions are available with the initial release
supporting basic telephone services for homes and small business
applications.

Compact design, low power consumption, remote provisioning to speed up
installation and service turn-up, extensive fault locator diagnostics
and ability to accommodate future network services such as ISDN and Lan
to the home are incorporated in the system which is designed to be
fully compatible with international catv and telecom networks.

The RSU enables the Cablespan system to service single home, apartment
block and business catv hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) applications. A key
function of the Cablespan 2300 system is in transforming broadcast CATV
only HFC networks into fully interactive telecommunications networks.

Tellabs Cablespan 2300 telephony over cable system with the RSU is
being used by Viacom Cable to deliver a residential telephone service
over catv for a 200 home trial in Castro Valley, San Francisco, running
from January to June 1996. Integrated catv and telephony including
direct dial local and long distance calling, custom calling and
operator assisted services will be included, and the system can deliver
voice and data services, seamlessly upgrading the existing cable TV
network. Time Warner Communications, Adelphia, Time Warner
Entertainment/Advanced Newhouse and Telewest are also evaluating
Cablespan for cable telephony.

PERSONAL SERVICE SOUGHT

In this fast moving industry, cable operators cannot presume to compete
with the telcos on price alone, so what is available for the cable
operators to enable them to maintain their penetration of the telephony
market? Tony Daniels reports

Telcos are readying themselves for an era of free bandwidth, and it
won't be long before free (or extremely cheap) calls become
commonplace. Even Arno Penzias, vice president of research at Bell
Labs, strikes a cautionary note, "AT&T Telcos should be terrified of
the prospect of free bandwidth. But the answer is change - and change
is coming." The strategy of the cable operators must be to move away
from marketing telephony offerings on price to a value-added service
basis.

UK cable operators offer savings on charges, itemised billing, and the
service advantages of a local network. Industry estimates put the
number of telephone exchange lines installed at 1.2 million, in over 50
regional franchise areas. This compares with 5.8 million broadband
homes passed (1.1 million subscribers), a telephony penetration rate of
20.7 per cent.

Goldman Sachs is a little more conservative, putting the expected
number of cable telephony subscribers by 2000 at 5.1 million (ie 15 per
cent).More value must be offered to meet forecast penetration by the
end of the decade.

The CCA expects cable telephony to increase from 1.3 million lines by
the end of 1995 to 5.7 million lines by the end of 2000, and a
corresponding increase in telephony penetration from 29 to 51 per cent,
with business cable telephony lines to rise from 8 to 12 per cent by
2000 - not much in terms of installed lines, but business-derived
revenue will be significantly higher. Centrex services could provide
small businesses with several advantages, giving callers the impression
of a much larger and efficient organisation. Key features include a
range of call transfer and forwarding options, including 'ring back
when free.'

Bell Cablemedia has taken a lead in developing innovative tariffing and
service packages including call waiting and call barring, with voice
mail following swiftly behind. BT subscribers can get all of these
services - and more besides, but BCM will soon be offering a dual-
number and dual-ringing tone service, so that users can differentiate
an incoming business call from a residential one.

Data is the obvious way that cable companies can capitalise, with fast
file transfer for business users and high-speed Internet connections
for homes. Motorola Multimedia has done significant work on cable
modems and BCM is working on its caller line identification (CLI)
service, including the manufacture of specially branded display
telephone sets. Hughes Network Systems is advocating an integrated
telephony over cable service, which offers full E1 (2Mbit/s) from the
head-end to the curb-side, as opposed to the traditional overlay
network. Telewest trialed the equipment, and has recommended that its
franchisees take up the system.

According to Richard Stevens, business development manager for cable at
Hughes Network Systems, "Telewest is holding back on the level of
deployment until they have more information; they are now testing their
own processes, which in turn will determine operational costs. "At the
head-end there is an E1 interface to the switch, and each networked
switch can support up to 20 remote curb-side nodes, again connected by
E1 lines to a mux card in the cabinet. Such systems enable cable
operators to deliver high speed data, such as file transfer or Internet
access, to the SoHo and residential markets. Although according to
Stevens, "We are likely to see such applications happening in the US
first, with some roll-out in 1996, but real roll-out will not be until
1997."

Personal numbering is still a few years away and subject to regulatory
clearance, but Ericsson is promoting its 'universal personal
telecommunications' service, which is a value-added feature of its
intelligent network switches. The service gives a subscriber a single
number, which he then uses for home, business and mobile purposes.

What is in effect a 'virtual' personal numbering system is available
today from TPS of the UK. Its Personal Assistant value added system
integrates different services, media and equipment under a single
personal number. Subscribers can consolidate their work, home and
mobile phone and fax numbers on one number, managing incoming and
outgoing calls to their own requirements.

It also offers 'find me' call completion, caller screening, fully
featured voicemail, fax store and forward, 'cardless' phone card, and
SMS support. The system knows where you are and when you are available,
and will announce calls so that they can be screened. At any time
during a call, the subscriber can transfer the caller to the voice-mail
service, to be acted upon at a more convenient time. The service is
available to telephony operators as either a service bureau
implementation or a full system sale.

US PREPARES FOR DIGITAL FUTURE

In the face of competition from DBS and DTH satellite services and
impending competition from telcos, North American cable companies now
view digital video compression as a necessity rather than a luxury.

North American viewers only watch 12 to 14 channels but the increased
bandwidth is needed to provide the 'information highway' services and
convergence services that telcos also plan to offer. Rich D'Amato chief
spokesman for the US National Cable Television Association expects
incremental investment of, "About $25 billion (#16 billion) over the
next five to six years to enable cable plant to provide both telephony
and robust video or online services."

Finance is sought for the new services, but the cablecos must be
competitive telecommunications providers, so they are demanding a level
playing field to compete with the telcos. Some states currently allow
cablecos into local telephony and some do not, but there is a
telecommunications bill now in Congress. For two years the spectre of
DBS hitting cable profits has gnawed away at cable's ability to raise
capital. The American cable industry has revenues of $23 billion
yearly, compared to the telcos' $100 billion, so unequal competition
would allow the telcos to swamp cable with their financial clout. Rate
caps were put on US cable prices in 1992.

"Should the legislation be passed,' says D'Amato, you will see cable
operators plan to get into telephony and investment in technologies to
increase capacity and signal quality. Remove regulatory uncertainties
and the bankers will lend money."

The proposed deregulation lifts the rate caps imposed in 1992,
overrides state legislatures and provides for competitive cross-entry.
The White House is not pleased with the thought of lifting cable rate
caps, but wouldn't veto it if it was well supported. It may be passed
this session or held until next year.

Increased capacity is sought by US cablecos to offer consumers a bundle
of services including video, telephony, online access and interactive
services.

"We telephony see as part of our future, carrying us into a leadership
position in telecommunications. It will include video services,
interactivity and access to home banking, shopping, energy management -
the services required from a full service telecommunications provider,"
says D'Amato. "Cable and telephone companies will be offering very
similar services."

Digital video compression will be introduced in 1996, meantime channel
capacity is being increased through fibre deployment. "Channel capacity
and system rebuilds come down to the deployment of fibre and the
addition of digital boxes. Digital boxes come down to manufacturers
producing them in sufficient quantities at affordable prices," says
D'Amato.

TeleCommunications Inc (TCI) is introducing compression on a market by
market basis in mid1996, but other major cable operators are holding
back. Time Warner Cable and Continental Cablevision have adopted a
'wait and see' strategy.

"Digitisation is unquestionably an important trend," says Time Warner
Cable spokesman Mike Luftman. "But we don't have any plans to take any
of our cable systems digital in the near term. Our Orlando Service
Network finds out what digital services people want and we use our
upgraded networks to introduce more analogue cable services, local
telephony and online computer services now. Ultimately a great deal of
TV is going to be digital but we are increasing our analogue capacity
through fibre rebuilds first."

Luftman says that close to 50 per cent or Time Warner, (TW) systems
have been fibred and more than 90 per cent will have been rebuilt by
the year 2000. He points out that while rebuilding with fibre is cost
efficient in urban and suburban areas, smaller operators in rural areas
will probably opt for the introduction of DVC with minimal fibre. "Some
systems in rural areas don't see the payback in fibre rebuilds. For
them digitisation is more important because it will allow them to
deliver more channels in the near future and it is a cost efficient way
to get channel capacity without rebuilding their systems."

For TW, the prospect of bundling services is important. "People will be
presented with at least two choices of providers of bundled services
and being in the market first is a substantial advantage.

"There's no question that cable will get there first because of the
nature our networks" says Luftman. He sees deregulation as providing
opportunities, rather than easing a credit crunch. "We don't have a
capital problem. Deregulation is important because we need access to
telephony through deregulation to gain a fair and competitive playing
field. Telephony is very important. Once you have these upgraded
networks you have this tremendous opportunity. It would be
irresponsible not to take advantage of the opportunity that local
telephone offers. If telephone is going to compete in television then
it is important to get up and compete in their business as soon as
possible."

David Fellows, Continental Cablevision's vice president of technology
and engineering sees it differently, "We are the only major MSO which
has not placed orders for DVC set tops. I want to be within six months
of a real delivery date, to be able to look at a box and kick it and
know what the price is before signing. We will be rolling out digital
compression with the rest, but at the moment we view that as a high end
tier, ten per cent of our customers."

Continental is waiting for the price to come down before going digital.
"Digital boxes seem to be north of $400 for just a decompression box,
not an Orlando full service interactive box. And for $400 I don't think
adding a hundred channels as opposed to 20, is going to pay for them."

Instead, Continental plans to introduce advanced analogue boxes which
permit the use of a virtual channel which can act as an advanced
program guide or a weather or traffic channel.

Through its participation in Primestar, the cable consortium DTH
operator, Continental has concluded that you don't need hundreds of
channels. "We are doing more market testing, but it appears if you have
just ten different movies on with start times every hour, that's good
enough. You don't have to go to start times of every five minutes and a
library of ten thousand titles to get enough revenue to pay for an
analogue box," says Fellows.

Continental is launching an IP0 and applying to various states for
alternative local telephony provider status. 'The pre-emption of state
law by a federal bill would make explaining our plans to analysts
simpler, then we would have to go through a state by state plan.

In Canada deregulation will not finally arrive until local rates are
rebalanced to make local telephony profitable. Long distance charges
curently subsidise local rates. Until the technology arrives and is
installed to permit interconnectivity and number portability, telcos
and cable companies will not be allowed into each other's businesses.

Financial analysts warned the market to avoid Canadian cable operators
due to the threat of DBS and telco competition, but this hasn't
thwarted their ability to raise capital. Colin Watson, president of
Rogers Cablesystems Ltd, Canada's largest MSO says, "The capital market
is certainly adequate. We have managed financings in the US and expect
to continue to do that. There is a lot of regulatory uncertainty on the
issue of cable and telephone competition which I believe has
destabilised the financial markets but it doesn't do anything to the
fundamentals. The informed investor is very enthusiastic about cable."

Rogers has ordered digital set top boxes from General Instrument and
plans to start rolling them out in the third quarter of 1996. Rogers
plans to continue rebuilding its networks until it reaches 625MHz which
is effectively the coming North American standard, providing 90
channels. It plans to use 70 channels for analogue services and 20
channels for DVC at a ratio of 12 to 1, eventually giving it 240
digital channels.

Shaw, Canada's second largest MSO, is building out its systems until
they reach 550MHz. It is in negotiations for digital set top boxes and
plans to start introducing compression in mid-1996.

Rogers' Colin Watson is optimistic. about the potential effect of
digital services on revenue, "There is a relatively flat growth in
traditional cable company revenues but there will be tremendous growth
in revenues from highspeed access for computers and, subsequently,
telephone revenues. Within 10 years new services will provide 50 per
cent of our revenue and that's conservative. "

Michael D'Avella, Shaw's senior vice-president for planning predicts,
"In five years from now new services will provide 30 to40 per cent of
revenues."

Telephony is seen as a 'must have' to compete in the one stop shopping
market beyond 2000, but most American MSOs believe that immediate
growth will come from providing access to online services with
superfast cable modems.

"We already have high speed access in New England and next year we will
start selling the service. Nobody else does it at the speeds we can
offer so you aren't taking a telephone customer and trying to explain
why your dial tone sounds better," says Continental's Fellows.

"Adding in enhanced PPV and revenue from digital services, I think that
in five years, new services might provide 50-60 per cent of revenue,"
says Fellows

He believes these services will migrate from the PC to the TV. "The
companies we are talking to are aimed at the computer and I believe
compelling interactive services will emerge from the PC arena and cut
their teeth there, then versions will be transferred to TV. For home
banking you want a keyboard in front of you."

For many MSOs, digitisation means satellite-proofing. "It means we can
have a service that is much better than any satellite offering," says
Watson, "We will have many many many more channels of PPV, a fully
digitised spectrum and all the local channels."

Cable telephony means increased revenues, but more importantly it lets
cablecos to compete with the telcos as they enter video. Online
services seem poised as cable's great potential in the US. High speed
access is a service cablecos can provide now. "We believe the growth in
PCs and the absolutely astounding interest in gaining access to the
World Wide Web and Internet are the next bonanza in terms of growth
opportunities," says Michael D'Avella.

TIGERS PROWL THE CATV MARKET

Taiwan, one of East Asia's foremost tiger economies, has seen a
plethora of electronics manufacturers enter the cable television
market, supplying many of the oft-overlooked components that keep a
system running. And the government's emphasis on promoting its high
tech industries mean that Taiwan is not just a low cost 'clone product'
maker, but is increasingly conducting its own research and development.

One manufactuerer with a 25 year track record is Trans Electric which
specialises in catv/smatv systems. Its annual sales of over 10,000 catv
headend modulators make the company the dominant Asian supplier. Trans
Electric's PX set top converter is used by half the domestic market and
internationally it has seen sales of over 3.5 million sets.

The company has its own catv technology centre and laboratory in
Taiwan, the first in the country, supporting its research and
development and quality control as well as providing a support and
service centre for its customers. Trans Electric is also the sales
distributor for Philips Magnavox catv distribution products and the
licensed manufacturer of the Zenith addressable scrambling system.

The company portfolio comprises headend equipment; distribution
equipment and subscriber equipment.

Lead Universal International Corporation, with its Chainford
Electronics Company factory, manufactures a broad range of catv parts
and accessories including both passive and active products ranging from
outdoor trunk amplifiers and line extenders to indoor splitters.

Exemplifying the Taiwanese approach to high levels of customer service,
Manager Kennex Huang says, "Our thirteen years in this field have
enabled us to provide high performance reliable equipment with
competitive pricing. We are also competitive on service, with a quick
delivery time of three weeks after receiving payment. Our recently
developed 750 MHz amplifier will be entering production in 1996." The
company produes various types of amplifiers, line extenders, power
inserters/combiners, line splitters, couplers, directional taps, power
supplies and catv connectors.

There are also many tightly focused companies in the market such as
Ding Yih Industrial Co which manufactures catv coaxial cable connectors
and RF coaxial cable connectors suitable for a wide range of cable
types and sizes.

Jack Chang, CEO at Favorlangh Communication Consulting Inc explained
that his company, "Provides specialised market research on retainer or
on a project by project basis,drafting franchise proposals and
evaluating opportunities."

GIVE 'EM A WINCH

Dramatic growth in the installation of fibre optic cable above and
below ground and sub-sea is pushing technological developments with new
products and techniques

In the UK companies such as Energis and Eastern Electricity have been
installing overhead fibre optic cables - ADSS (all dielectric self
supporting cables); OPGW (optical path ground wire) and WRAP (fibre
optic cable wrapped around the earth on transmission towers). CBS
Products noted that most of the existing stringing winches did not have
the necessary tension control required by fibre cables. It designed
tensioners to provide controlled braking via hydraulic variable
controls, and secondary braking through the use of hydraulic disc
brakes.

In any stringing operation a cable pulling bond or rope is first
installed along with running out blocks.

Fibre optic cable installation lengths are long to reduce splicing
which is costly and increases signal loss, but this results in the need
for a fibre puller able to take 5 km of rope. The pullers and tensioner
also need to be versatile to cope with arduous environments.

CBS supplies a range of solutions to meet these demands; trailer
mounted machines with high ground clearance for towing behind all
terrain vehicles to light weight machines that can be manually
transported in inaccessible site locations.

Underground fibre cables are usually installed manually with pulling of
cable by hand, whereas copper communications cables are installed using
small diameter (150 mm) capstan winches that provide large tension
capacities (4000 kg); these winches are then used to pull fibre cables
that require tensions as low as 200 kg.

To protect the cables from over tensioning, a simple fused swivel is
employed by CBS, rated for the maximum allowable cable load. If the
fused swivel breaks mid pull, the ends of the swivel need to be located
and retrieved. The two ends then need to be reconnected before the pull
can recommence. Also, the draw rope is usually left on the ground.

CBS' new winch has integral hydraulic load monitoring pre-set for the
level of pull at which the torque is relieved from the capstan's
hydraulic motor to stop the pull. Tension remains in the cable due to
the number of wraps of draw rope around the capstan. The winch has a
removable rope-take drum. A large diameter (760 mm) capstan allows
greater lengths of installation cable to be wrapped around, allowing a
second winch to assist the pulling winch.

Mid-point pulls, or pulls that have severe changes in direction require
cable figure eighting to ensure the cable does not kink or snag. CBS
has introduced its C-1050 cable fleeters with mid-assist winching,
currently being used in the UK and Malaysia to overcome problems
associated with figure eighting which usually takes up large areas of
pavement, roads, or motorway hard shoulder.

At mid point there is no loose end, so the cable taken off the drum is
looped through a hydraulic cable feeder which takes cable into a
detachable drum at a rate of 100 m per minute, hence it can move 2 km
of cable in 20 minutes.

CUSTOMER DATABASES ALL MAPPED OUT

In Britain Ordnance Survey large scale maps have been essential tools
of the construction sector for more than a century thanks to their
level of detail.

Developments in cost effective GIS and CAD systems generated a national
demand for data that allowed the Ordnance Survey to accelerate its
programme of converting large scale maps to a digital form. Helped by
utility sector customers, the vast task was completed in April 1995.

OS can now produce site centred Superplan plots, the OS's replacement
for traditional large scale maps. Each Superplan Plotting System is
connected via ISDN link to the OS's main database offering on-demand
access to the latest mapping of any part of Great Britain.

A new large scale digital map data product used throughout the cable
and construction industries is OS's Land-Line, used by most local
authorities instead of conventional paper mapping. Land-Line data is
not just used as a screen image, but is increasingly manipulated and
merged with other datasets such as cable or service networks. The
number of plots now being produced for use as working documents or
archive copies means that the volume of mapping in use is increasing
rather than decreasing.

When Land-Line is used with suitable GIS software, linked to one or
more databases, the resulting spatial-data asset management system can
be an efficient way of dealing with large amounts of constantly
changing information.

OS's Address point is another data product suitable for use by the
cable industry, providing a geographical reference for each postal
address in Great Britain. Frequently liked with Land-line, it is
reported to be proving an effective way of geo-referencing a customer
database for purposes as varied as marketing and network growth
planning and fault identification.

Accurate up-to-date data using quality datasets enables efficient and
economic development of existing and potential customer databases.

ENCLOSURES MEET HIGHER SPECIFICATIONS

Six new enclosures were launched by Malcoe at this year's ECC show,
built using Malcolite, a structural foam/aluminium composite, for each
body panel. These light-weight panels are further reinforced by a load
bearing cage incorporated into the panels during manufacture. Benefits
include enhanced physical security, noise insulation, and enhanced
thermal properties. Integrated doors leave a near seamless outline not
cluttered with locks, hinges or flanges. Cable entry can be top or
bottom, and the cabinets are rated to IP*6. The Cablestation
accommodates fibre, cable, cellular and microwave technologies, with
all around access to electronic equipment via front or rear doors.
Internal surfaces including doors can incorporate a slim-line heat
exchanger. Sealed equipment chambers prevent water, dust and pollution
ingress.

Also in the company's product range are: the Norfolk radio base station
with extensive anti-vandal features, sealed thermal chamber, heat
exchanger and removable acoustic cowl; the Leicester accommodates
fibre, copper and coax, suitable for joint Telecoms/catv systems, with
powerful cooling and ventilation systems, and removable thermal
chamber; the Stirling 'cost effective' model has a fixed double skin
for thermal management; and the Hallmark describes a method of
manufacture rather than an actual product, offering a stainless steel
enclosure.

Malcoe's new Telecoms division offers design, configuration and testing
services from enclose selection to site fitting.

FLAG

Work has begun on cable laying for the Fibre Optic Link Around the
Globe (FLAG) - at 27,000 km, the world's longest fibre optic
communications cable, scheduled to run from Europe to the Far East with
landing points in the UK, Spain, Italy, Egypt, the UAE, India,
Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, Korea and Japan.

Bandwidth transmission capacity will be up to 120,000 digital circuits
at 64/kb/sec, using two fibre pairs each operating at 5 gigabits per
second, and more than 40 carriers have already agreed to purchase
capacity.

Nynex Network Systems is the managing sponsor of FLAG, heading a
consortium of investors from the US, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and
Thailand putting up $1.5 billion capital for the project.

The cable system is being built by AT&T Submarine Systems Inc, and KDD
Submarine Cable Systems of Japan, and is scheduled to go into service
in October 1997.

The cable runs underwater for 26,000 km, linking with existing Pacific
and Atlantic fibre optic cables to span the globe. Primarily intended
for telephony and data, it will also form a faster alternative route to
satellite for video used in special circumstances, allowing live
transcontinental broadcasts to virtually loose their time delay.

STEEL GETS HOT, HOT, HOT

Broadband outside plant managers need to ensure that they specify
enclosures which minimise temperature to reduce chip failure rates says
George Sell, market research and product development at Channell
Commercial Corporation

Heat does affect the performance and reliability of RF amplifiers, but
while amplifier manufacturers have set operating temperature range
specifications, included heat sink features, and provided warranties
covering initial performance, they don't cover heat damage, reliability
and failure rates, and performance over the life of the amplifier
product.

Broadband telecommunications customers assume the life expectancy of RF
amplifiers is longer than the warranty period (typically three years)
with reliability throughout its life. But manufacturers have not
addressed these issues because their customers have not raised them.

Enclosure manufacturers pay lip service to heat dissipation but provide
little evidence for their claims. The operating temperatures of 40oC to
+60oC sets low and high temperature operating extremes, and, short-term
warranties deal with the occasional 'infant mortality' of products
deployed. But these provisions do not address the impact of temperature
on the long-term reliability of RF amplifiers. Neither specifications
(nor warranty coverages) address failure rates over the life of the
product, nor project a life expectancy for the products.

Heat impact on operating performance and life of amplifiers needs to be
measured and here users can turn to extensive testing by the US
Department of Defense (DoD) on integrated circuit performance relative
to heat impacts. The US DoD document MIL-HDBK-217 (MIL-SPECS) provides
a measure of heat impacts on component integrated circuit (IC) chip
failure rates.

MIL-HDBK-217 states that the transistor failure rate doubles for every
9oC (16.2oF) increase in die temperature. This applies at any
temperature and is not a range of threshold. Therefore, the cooler the
operating temperature maintained, the lower the failure rate over the
life of the component IC chips in the RF amplifier. Consequently,
broadband outside plant designer should specify enclosures that best
quantifiably maintain the lowest operating temperatures for the RF
amplifiers they house.

Previous relevant tests include those by broadband system engineers in
Sacramento, California, 1988; enclosure and amplifier product tests
conducted by Channell Commercial Corporation in Temecula, California,
1990; and proprietary field tests of new high frequency amplifier
products conducted by an amplifier manufacturer in Sunnyvale,
California, 1993, employing metal and thermoplastic enclosures.

The Sacramento tests were conducted by the local cable television
system to help decide between Reliable's (now Reltec) traditional metal
enclosures or Channell Commercial's thermoplastic enclosures. Superior
heat dissipation was the criterion.

Test results at the extreme ambient temperature of 38.3oC (101oF)
indicated the coolest reading on the IC chip as 60.6oC (141 oF). or
4.4oC (40oF) over ambient using the Channell CPH1730/500. At the low
temperature extreme of 11.1oC (52oF) ambient, Channell's had the best
showing for IC chip temperature at 37.8oC (100oF), or 8.9oC (48oF) over
ambient. Reliable's had 24.4oC (76oF) over ambient, or 53.3oC (128oF).

In both termperature extremes there was a consistent difference in
temperature on the IC chip, between the results for the Reliable and
Channell enclosures, an increment of about 15.5oC (28oF), with the
Channell enclosure having the best results.

Applying the MIL-HDBK-217 figures, that would mean deploying an RF
amplifier in the Reliable TV-1832/A would increase the predictable
failure rate for the IC chips by nearly three and a half times over the
same amplifier mounted in Channell Commercial's CPH1730/500. And this
differential factor will likely hold true at any temperature within the
specified operating range.

Testing by Channell Commercial in Temecula, California, in 1990 covered
22 different production models of enclosures from four leading
manufacturers and various amplifier models from three leading
manufacturers to gather temperature data on amplifiers, but comparative
data on enclosure heat dissipation was also collected.

The amplifiers tested were: Magnavox 450MHz and 550MHz trunk
amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders; Scientific Atlanta
450MHz and 550MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders;
Jettold 450 MHz and 550 MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 line extenders.

The enclosure models included in the tests were: Pyramid 1S30.;Moped;
Reliable TV-104, TV-106, TV-1024, TV-1228, TV-1832 and Channell
Commercial CPH1230/STD, CPH1230/500, CHP1730/5TD, CPH1730/500. Data was
recorded by sensors at four locations inside each enclosure's covers
and amplifiers.

Data was collected at thirty minute intervals, twenty-four hours per
day over 30 days. The test data is proprietary but it showed the
superiority of the Channell Commercial enclosure products in terms of
amplifier heat dissipation, especially the 1230 and 1730 units with the
series 500 heat dissipation covers.

The results of the proprietary field tests of new high frequency
amplifier products by a major manufacturer in Sunnyvale, California, in
1993, remain proprietary, however, the test data confirms the data from
the two earlier tests.

Channell thermoplastic enclosures achieve high performance through
their wall thicknesses, louvering, and type and quality of materials
used in their manufacture. And, special heat dissipating covers enhance
performance in severe sun loading conditions. RF amplifier
manufacturers strive for higher frequencies and wider bandwidths,
making the effect of heat dissipation and heat rise on electronics ever
more critical. Amplifiers nominally generate 50 W of heat dissipation,
but worse case parameters easily exceed 100 W.

Field tests show that above 36.7oC (98oF), the heat dissipation
characteristics of Channell Commercial enclosures diverge from the
norm. Other enclosures, especially metal units, track linearly with
increases in ambient temperature, while Channell's track more
positively toward a cooler scale of temperature on the IC Chip. Even if
all other design factors were equal, such as vents and louvers,
attention to convection principles, heat sinking metal bracketry for
amplifier mounting, the amount of free air surrounding the mounted
amplifier etc, the difference between the materials used for
manufacturing enclosures would still be significant. For heat
dissipation, thermoplastic enclosures out-perform metal enclosures.

HDPE MAKES DUCT 'VIRTUALLY INDISTRUCTIBLE'

Behind the glamour world of breaking news and sports finals lies the
ducting that actually carries cable, bringing programmes to viewers
homes.

Priorities here are durablility and ease - hence cost - of
installation. Ducting designed specifically for the catv and
telecommunications industries is supplied by Dura-line who's HDPE Main
Duct System is a total duct solution comprising durable product with
high impact resistance and tensile strength to simplify installation.
It can be buried directly using conventional civils techniques, or
ploughed straight into the ground, even at sub-zero temperatures
without duct shattering; it is also flexible enough to substantially
reduce the need for angled bends.

The company's Silicore Sub Duct comprises a virtually indestructible
HDPE outer with co-extruded permanent lubrication producing an
extremely low coefficient of friction to ensure that even under high
pulling loads, cable and ropes do not burn through the sub duct's walls
and it does not deteriorate or diminish with age. Coil set is totally
eliminated during coiling manufacture when the memory is set in a
permanent straight line - so the sub duct does not coil or corkscrew
when pulled from the drum.

Last year the company opened a manufacturing facility in the UK to
handle the UK demand for main duct and sub-duct products. Advanced
engineering features included in the product range are printing,
striping and colour coding. Other products in the company's portfolio
include customer feeds, speciality duct for fibre optic, underground
chambers, slot boxes, cable pulling lubricants and a range of cable
pulling and sub duct accessories.

Dura-line has recently appointed Cliff Moss, formerly of IBM, as its
managing director.

KNOCK, KNOCK

Mike Shuff interviews a former cable salesman who tells of his
experiences

MS. When did you begin door-to-door cable selling?

Dave. I started in 1993. I was put on a training course, and, by the
end, I was more or less convinced that the company knew what it was
talking about. But, after a few weeks of door knocking, I knew the real
story.

MS. What was the training course like?

Dave. The course ran over five days, We went through everything from
product knowledge to 'dealing with people'; that is, what to say. You
were told to do this and that, but when you actually faced these
situations things turned out different.

MS. What were you told to say to prospective customers?

Dave. We were told that it was going to be a soft sell, hand delivering
glossy literature and then knocking on the door. In some areas, even
the literature drops had not been done. First I had to 're-market' to
areas where most people had already declined the service, so it was
difficult to sell there. In the end, I was mainly selling the phone.

MS. Was the telephone service widely available then?

Dave. No, not in all areas. It was very annoying when you were given a
good sales lead... a prospective customer who had phoned or written
requesting information. The fact that the service was not available
meant that the call was a waste of my selling time.

MS. You were a 'Cable Advisor,' how did you sell?

Dave. Yes. The term 'salesman' was not used. In fact, we were sent to
close the deal. I was told that I should spend no more than 20 minutes
tops on any sales visit before closing. If I was selling the telephone
service, I would knock at the door and come out with something
guaranteed to get attention. "Hello! Do you know the advantages of
being on cable telephone? You only pay for the exact amount of time the
call takes... so you can really save money. Would you like me to go
through your phone bill for you, to show you were you could be saving
money?" which worked better than saying, "I've come to talk about the
benefits of cable." I was never told how it would save money, I just
read the literature.

MS. Who did you approach?

Dave. Generally it was the male owner of the house. On one or two
occasions, I thought that I had closed, only to find I had lost it
because the woman had not been involved.

MS. So its a family decision?

Dave. Yes. The children were also influential, very keen on cable
television because it's new and they can get lots of channels. They can
brag at school "Did you see so and so on cable last night?"; especially
to the kids in their class who don't yet have it.

MS. When were the best times to call?

Dave. We usually called between 6 and 8 o'clock pm. It was difficult to
get both husband and wife together at that time as wives were usually
busy with the domestic routine around dinner. This wasn't recognised by
the compay. They assumed that everybody was at home at this time;
therefore, that was the best time to sell.

MS. Were you encouraged to work outside the set hours?

Dave. Yes. I was working seven days a week. I didn't like working on
Sunday so I would use this day for pre-arranged appointments only, but
plenty of cable advisors were working longer hours, and signing up
exactly the same number of customers.

MS. What was the problem?

Dave. What you've got to accept is, there is no point in calling on
people who genuinely don't want the service. We were just given areas.
You knew almost straight away whether you had got a good area for sales
or a bad, dried-up one. There were certain areas that you knew you were
going to sell very well. A new run in a better quality council estate
was bound to provide a good crop of cable connections, These customers
wanted exactly what cable could offer immediately. Lots of sport, more
channels. films so that they didn't have to rent videos from the shops.
Better off areas simply didn't want catv - they had plenty of other
things to do and were only interested in cheaper telephone services.

MS. Who was interested?

Dave. People who had asked the company for information were generally
professional types wanting to slash large telephone bills. But the
telephone service wasn't always available which prevented me closing
the deal. One time I had sold the whole of a block, but nobody could be
connected because the people who put in the ducts had installed the
wrong type. I got fed-up making excuses for the company.

MS. What was the biggest fault in the marketing plan?

Dave. They did not listen to the actual customers, and tailor cable
services to their needs. Advertising is essential. I would open a
freephone number for anyone wanting to know more about cable. I would
advertise in local newspapers and on the local TV.

MS. What is the average 'life expectancy' of a salesman and how are
they paid?

Dave. Selling life is short. They burn you out. Normally you last
between three and six months. There was a small basic pay, then
commission. In theory, you could earn a lot of money. But salesmen fell
out with their supervisors and were out of a job. I have yet to receive
commission owed.

VOD - DELIVERED

Effective management and analysis of data, whether for programme or
system networks, billing, marketing subscriptions or general finance,
needs dedicated powerfulsoftware applications - and programs for the
catv industry are increasingly available

Wiztec Solutions of Israel has introduced Video on Demand, and plans to
incorporate telephony capability next year in its multilingual cable
subscriber management and billing System (SMS) Wizard.

Wiztek was formed in January from Digital Equipment Company's sale of
its subsidiary DECSys. Its Wizard system includes a complete cable and
satellite TV Infomanagement system for RdB and Oracle databases, and
additional databases in the new year.

Svenka Kezurer of Wiztec adds, "We have also looked at industry video
servers and developed APIs to support a variety of different servers
and any new entrants."

The company already provides Video on Demand billing facilities and is
currently running a pilot billing and customer service scheme for an
interactive games channel. It also plans to be involved in interactive
services. Kezurer explained, "We provide the interface at the entry
point where a customer who wants to use an interactive service first
needs to get authorisation fro the Wiztec database. Afterwards the
systems again interface with the Wiztec system which will provide all
the information on what exactly was provided, how much data was used or
downloaded, and for how long - which would allow charging for Internet
usage on duration used or data transferred. We can set up all kinds of
software to charge according to different services offered and their
different rates."

Kezurer added, "We recognise that telephony is a must in the UK today,
and will provide this capability by the end of next year, aiming at
cable companies providing telephony as a new service."

The company says its flexible approach to tailoring pricing proposals
and payment terms is more adaptable to the diverse norms of the
international market.

Flexibility and openness of the product itself allows the core system
to adapt to growing demands, simplifying maintenance. A $2 million
order for Wizard SMS system software and services for Singapore Cable
Vision (SCV), delivered and running by May 1st after a mid-February
authorisation, is cited as exemplifying Wiztec's flexibility and
ability to stand by a commitment. Randall Coieman, president of SCV
said that the $500 million 30 TV channel and interactive multimedia
services operation chose Wizard for its rich functionality, high level
of support and flexibility of tailoring to requirements.

A Wizard system installed at Telkabel in Austria will enable the
company to offer its 420,000 subscriber base enhanced Pay TV options as
well as PPV and VOD.

REAL-TIME DECISIONS

Cable companies increasingly require real-time information to track
market influencing news stories as they break.

International deregulation is resulting in rapid expansion of cable and
companies with real-time news feeds are best able to capitalise on
emerging opportunities for strategic alliances, mergers and
acquisitions and new services. Real-time data is also used to
streamline company management systems. Tenfore's financial information
service is often integrated with existing software packages. Access to
real-time data such as news stories, foreign exchange rates and stock
market prices allows a quick response to market changes and is
gradually replacing traditional information intermediaries. By setting
specific filters on international news feeds, users are informed of
significant market influencing stories as they break, with time to
digest and act upon them rather than still trawling through the press
cuttings.

Short and medium term cash management can be enhanced by using real-
time financial data on deposit, interbank and forward rates. The
Tenfore system also helps with hedging foreign exchange risk. Forex and
forward prices can be viewed on the PC screen, in a chart or in a
'live' spreadsheet. Tenfore's software allows real-time tracking of
market movements. Global prices can be displayed and real-time ticker
graphs track 'bid', 'ask', 'last trade' or 'volume' according to
requirements.

Users can view real-time and historic data on shares, forex or indices
to present in graphs, spreadsheets or company reports, updatedable in
real-time.

Tenfore subscribers get free use of software for analysing data;
compatibility with other software programmes enables ease of
integration. Live data can be pasted into other Windows compatible
programmes like Exel and Word, updated in real-time.

OPEN SYSTEMS - UP TO A POINT

Information exchange between catv and telco systems, not integration,
is needed says Barco whose Rosa system intefaces with telecom mangement
systems

Minimising downtime and network redundancy are two of the most
important considerations in tele-communications, whereas catv has been
driven by the number of channels, not their quality or availability.
'How else could a customer get all of these programs ?'

But DTH satellites now offer an alternative, while digital DTH and new
high pay interactive services will demand optimum network reliability.
So cable companies must provide an attractive package of programs, plus
services not available via satellite, of excellent quality, and
availability comparable to telephony. Operators have to dramatically
improve their network reliability and quality.

Pre-convergence, Barco developed a catv management concept,
establishing standards for communication between equipment, developing
a propriety protocol supporting communication via normal PSTN lines.

Full Service Networks are now demanded with integration of catv into
Telecom Network Management systems a priority.

The Telecom industry has long been highly regulated with widespread
standard protocols and interfaces for communication between different
systems. Hence adapttation of management concepts with open standard
interfaces to higher level management systems is needed with full
client server architectures, ideally able to interface with non-
proprietary products.

But it does not seem relevant, or economical, to completely integrate
telco and catv systems. More appropriate and feasible is sufficient
integration for information and tasks to be exchanged from one system
to the other. A first step is in-depth monitoring of the headend and
network. This provides the operator with the information required to
respond quickly and efficiently to problems before they are noticed by
the subscriber.

Secondly, backup and rerouting systems need to be established to
increase the network's overall Mean Time Between Failures. Finally,
links to existing Network Management systems and Subscriber Management
systems need to be established to provide accurate management
information and information to customer support for proactive responce
to incoming calls.

Analysing how many people telcos need per 1000 subscribers to obtain
the service they are providing and comparing that with catv, telco
figures turn out to be higher by a factor of 10. Hence catv operators
who want to offer similar services will have to build a similar service
organisation using an efficient tool to manage this workforce and
minimising operational costs.

Barco's ROSA (RCDS Open Systems Architecture) system is designed to
fulfil this function. Starting with its FSM860 Headend Supervisor,
Barco has supplied monitoring and management tools for catv headends
and networks. All existing RF products have been equipped with
monitoring and remote control interfaces and all new units have a
serial control bus (Remote Control and Diagnostic System bus - RCDS)
allowing full remote control and automatic configuration.

The RCDS protocol was especially developed to configure and manage
hardware equipment in a catv environment making them easier and less
expensive to integrate into a management system. ROSA provides self-
healing capabilities, system performance testing and statistical
information to optimise operations and maintenance workforce.

A user-friendly GUI allows the user to define his own windows and views
on the information present in the system. The open architecture of the
database allows access by other systems via ODBC .

The ROSA system can be used as a powerful stand-alone management tool,
and as an intelligent element manager able to interface with overall
Telecom Network Management systems at different levels. ROSA also
provides the redundancy level needed for the headend to be competitive
with availability figures reached by Telecom switches. ROSA handles
multiple headends, distribution nodes and catv networks. For
communication between the sites and a Central Management Centre ROSA
supports X25, X31, ISDN, PSTN and other connections. Its modular
approach allows gradual integration into the CATV system.

GLOBAL DATA ACCESS

Building on its core database expertise, Oracle now provides
applications for specific catv industry sytem requirements

A key to cable operators increasing penetration figures is developing
billing and financial management systems which can turn customer
activity into revenue streams so cable operators should review their
information technology infrastructures now.

Oracl, which started as a developer of relational database software,
now provides information management tools forming the backbone of
applications for billing, subscriber management, financial management,
human resources and data warehousing (extracting information from a
variety of other systems and putting it onto one large database that
everybody can access).It also provides applications to help cable
operators proactively identify new areas of opportunity and broaden the
range of services they offer.

Customer account history is analysed in minute detail to build up
customer profiles and steer marketing and customer service activity,
helping build longer-lasting and more profitable customer
relationships.

Ocacle's multimedia and World-Wide Web products enable it to provide
cable operators with a new range of commercial services, and is working
with telcoms operators worldwide to test and deploy interactive and on
demand services. Oracle is helping create information warehouses that
can manage, store and organise all the multimedia data for these
services, and its media servers support millions of clients and a host
of consumer devices.

Telecommunications-related activity now accounts for 23 per cent of
Oracle's US $3 billion world-wide turnover and its dedicated team of
more than 130 telecoms consultants now service every major cable
operator in the UK. Oracle recently supplied a suite of financial
applications including stock control, purchasing and foreign currency
management to Telewest Group, UK. For Bell Cable Media, Oracle is
putting in a financial suite to manage its UK franchises and an inter-
admin accounting system to manage wholesale retail telecommunications
traffic by different interconnect partners.

Birmingham Cable's new subscriber management and billing system is
based on Oracle technology. And Nynex, whose key supplier for billing
systems is IBM, made substantial purchases of Oracle technology last
year to deploy across all its UK franchises.

Oracle provided staff to see what the cable operators wanted, then
developed a technology approach responsive to the individual and
rapidly changing needs and goals of its potential client base.

NETWORK TRANSMISSION ENHANCED

The Harmonic Lightwaves HL 5000 series network management system
developed to enhance network transmission performance and subscriber
satisfaction will continuously and automatically poll up to 500 network
elements, displaying status on screen, with immediate problem
identification and alarm for early trouble shooting.

Colour coded indicators allow operators to dispatch service technicians
directly to trouble sites, so minimising down-time. Background polling
is constant with logging of performance history time and date stamped
for analysis of recurring problem areas, forecasting of service
requirements and planning preventative maintenance.

Four screen levels lead the user through problem identification; first
screen - complete system overview; second - zoom in on selected
network; third - digital or alarm level view of the chosen equipment;
fourth - the analogue or parameter level indicators of the selected
hardware. After problem identification and location the operator can
restore the system. Components in an NMS 5000 system are: software,
computer, transponder, and serial port interface. Advantages include
real-tie system management, control and monitoring at the headend or
hub, instant access to system status; performance logging; malfunction
pinpointing; layered software; secure remote monitoring and
troubleshooting and ability to drive alarms and third party interfaces.

RISK MANAGEMENT PAYS DIVIDENDS

Customer analysis and profiling reduces bad debt and can also
facilitate packaged marketing, fostering customer loyalty

It is critical for cable operators to get a fast return on investment,
hence whatever the technology, territory or sales environment, the key
business areas of marketing and risk management play a key role in
achieving this objective.

The pressure to recruit new subscribers should be balanced with a
realistic view of risk management. Return on investment and
profitability also relys on customers using the service and paying
their bills.

In areas where the licence requirement is to offer the service to all
in franchised areas, door-to-door is a logical means of achieving
blanket coverage. Moreover, it is a tried and tested tactic in the US
and represents proven experience which MSO's apply in new territories,
with telemarketing and direct mail as a support tactic. It is a key
requirement to target activity appropriately. Both catv and telephony
may be viewed by operators as mass services within concentrated
geographical areas, the method of marketing varies according to
different user groups as families young people and senior citizens view
the same services very differently.

Different targetting tools are used to achieve different objectives.
Area Analysis - understanding the territories in which operators work -
is critical for both engineering and sales/marketing activity. These
areas include franchises, nodes and sales territories, all of which
drive build and sales initiatives. Cable operators use geo-demographic
data alongside post office and local authority data. Many UK operators
use CCN's Mosaic to classify individual postcodes as neighbourhood
types. The analysis entails reporting and mapping; mapping can be
undertaken within the Mosaic software and, for more detailed
definition, within operators' own geographic information systems (GIS).

Customer analysis and communication: understanding the profile of
customers is vitally important to operators if they are to provide the
best service and to foster loyalty. The analysis of customer behaviour
(ie service take-up, payment history, attitude to service etc) is
undertaken using operators' own data as well as external data such as
Mosaic. Resulting analysis is used to target direct response (mail or
phone), direct sales activity and to provide management information.
CCN has designed an appropriate PC database package specifically for
use by cable companies.

After identifying customer types most appropriate for cable services,
sales and marketing activity is initiated. Risks attached to taking on
new business include - will the applicant pay? Is the applicant who
they say they are? As cable develops there is increased risk of
consumers swapping suppliers and of fraudulent activity. With swapping,
there is the temptation to run up a bill with one supplier before
defaulting and moving to another (eg BT to cable). There is also a
growing threat from serious fraudsters using features such as three-way
calling to divert calls internationally in call selling operations
which never pay service bills.

Operators check creditworthiness using their own proof of identity
procedures as well as credit referencing techniques supplied by
agencies such as CNN.

Isuses and solutions involved include: application risk assessment
where potential customers wishing to apply for service are credit
checked using Credit Referencing Agency (CRA) data. Scorecards used to
assess applications range from generic designs such as CCN's Delphi
through to bespoke cards designed to incoprorate the operators own
poliices.

Application processing entails capturing the details of an applicant,
applying the scorecard and delivering the result for installation
action to create an efficient customer service. Systems such as CCN's
autoscore incorporate the individual requirements of each client.

Previous fraudulent activity is one of the best warning signs for
avoiding or intercepting the risk of fraud. CCN's Detect compares
existing and previous credit applications to identify inconsistencies
which may signal a potential fraud. The credit industry fraud avoidance
scheme (CIFAS) is another initiative which enables its members to share
information that is useful in identifying potential frauds, which
operators access through their CRA.

Once a history of customer behaviour has been built, further risk
scoring can be based on real experience. 'Behavioural scoring' allows
operators to identify customers for PPC or value added services.

CCN's international network operates marketing systems, CRA bureau
facilities and scoring services according to the data available in each
territory.

This flexibility enables key business issues to be addressed regardless
of the environment.

Operators have an opportunity to gain competitive advantage by making
full use of the technology and software available to the cable industry
to manage their marketing, risk and ultimately, profitability to
maximum effect.

IT'S A GO: ECHOSTAR LAUNCH PAVES WAY TO DBS

     Beijing, Englewood, CO -- EchoStar's satellite launched
successfully into orbit Dec 28 culminating a "huge event" in the
company's history, pres Carl Vogel said, as it grows out from big to
small dishes.  Propelled atop a Chinese-made Long March 2E launch
vehicle in Sichuan province, the $200mln bird launches EchoStar to
contender-status in the surging DBS marketplace.  Wall Street gave its
immediate approval: the day before the launch Echostar's stock traded
shy of $21/share; Friday it ranged near $25.  Vogel said the satellite
can support 100 channels, with service beginning Feb or March from
Cheyenne, WY.  Vogel said the Cheyenne location will allow EchoStar to
send its signals to Europe and Asia.

JUST SAY NO: VA VILLAGE TURNS BACK ON CABLE SERVICE:

     Waterford, VA - In the tiny, 262-year-old village of Waterford,
VA--where the 250 residents still pick their mail up at the post
office and drink well water--cable TV is persona non grata. 
Cablevision of Loudoun had planned to bring service to Waterford, but
dropped the proposal after residents' unenthusiastic response to a
survey.  Some said cable lines hanging from utility poles would ruin
the ambiance of the village near Washington, DC, and others said cable
would prompt families to watch more TV instead of socializing with
neighbors.  With cable wired to 63% of U.S. households, some cable
industry officials said they could not recall another case in which a
community rejected cable.  "Most communities are frustrated that they
can't get cable," observed a TCI exec.

YEAR IN REVIEW: 

     1995 was a year in which stock prices reached record levels and
cable industry shares rebounded from reregulation with hopes of
deregulation.  The perception is that while inflation may be in check,
the new low yield on the 30-year long bond indicates that the economy
may be sputtering.  Market sages predict that small cap and
international equities are places to investigate.  As long as grumpy
old men--starring Veto Bill Clinton and featuring a cast of stubborn
congresspersons--hold the nation hostage with political self interest
and a bad case of moral indignation, the refreshing thought of
conservative fiscal restraint could well give way to a very nervous
stock market.  Although most citizens did not notice that the
government was closed down, a resolution of the budget impasse is
necessary to level the playing field at least back to politics as
usual. -- Philip M. Getter, Josephthal Lyon & Ross

     The Cable Guy   ...is a movie currently being filmed (I think);
anyway, that hot comic actor Jim Carrey is getting $20,000,000 to star
in it. 
     Last week (just in time for something to write about!), my
friends in Texas, Bill Arnold and Nancy McMurray of the great Texas
Cable TV Association (mark your calendars for February 21-23 to make
certain you are in San Antonio with us!), sent me something that
purports to be a draft copy by Lou Holtz, Jr. 
for script of The Cable Guy.
     Now, I cannot attest to the verity of the package that arrived
from Austin, but I can attest that I'm certain the National
Association of Broadcasters paid to have it written!
     (It is, by the way, kind of funny in a sick way.)
     In fact, one of the more poignant (for those of us in the cable
industry) scenes involved The Cable Guy telling his "mark" all about
how he--because he can turn state's evidence and testify against the
poor schmuck who got cable for "free"--can get away with stealing
while the general, unwashed public cannot.
     "Me ... I'm just the cable guy.  How many of us are there in the
entire country?  Five thousand?  Ten thousand?  I'm one bad apple in a
small group. 
     "But you ... You're Joe Citizen.  You're one of five hundred
million people who'd love to get cable for free ... This is a
multi-billion dollar industry and still growing.  They've got to make
an example of someone..."
     And, just in case you might think any news or publicity is "good
news," check out this description of the Friendly Cable office:
     "The Friendly Cable building is exactl what you would expect it
to be.  The office building was probably built in the 'cable rush' of
the early eighties.  It lloks like one of those new three-story
buildings that was built cheply.  There is a CLOSE-UP of the company
logo on the door.  The logo is a big
television set whose picture tube has eyes, a nose, and an ear-to-ear
grin 
  ... "
     The script, of course, revolves around everyone's greed at
getting something for nothing ... in this case, free cable premium
channels.
     Oh, if only people did want premium channels so badly!  (Just
kidding.) Carrey is perfect for the insidious, insinuating and
downright dangerous cable guy ... can't wait to see the movie.  Think
the studio will do a special preview for us?  Maybe at the NCTA?
     This movie is no favor to the cable industry ... but that's just
tough luck unless the industry can unite to make amnesty  (temporary,
naturally) a major tie-in with the release date.  Just thinking out
loud ... any takers?  Any other ideas?  Want a bootleg copy of the
script?
     Random Notes:
     *1996?  4 more years?  In Clinton's case, it sounds like a curse.
     Happy New Year, anyway.

TV NATION
On-line program listings have potential for publishers and viewers

For the true television aficionado, the weekly listings printed in a book
distributed over the weekend are not enough.

Canceled shows, vague sports listings ("If the playoffs go to seven games,
then none of these programs will air.")  and the whims of station managers are
not accurately reflected.

The listings in the daily paper are marginally better, but they're usually
still 48 to 72 hours out of date.

For those with cable, there is usually a "preview" channel that has a window in
which specific programs are advertised, along with a "crawling" listing. The
problem is that for a 50-channel service, the "crawl" is literally that, taking
three to four minutes to get through all 50 channels.

No, the true TV aficionado wants his or her listings on computer -- in theory.

That theory has been adopted by the two major providers of TV listings. Both
Tribune Media Services and TV Data Technologies have built systems that allow
readers to access listings on-line, either through bulletin board systems
(BBSes) or the World-Wide Web.

Our resident TV aficionado, Pete Wetmore, who edits an award-winning TV book in
real life, takes a look at the two products (Tribune's is in operation in a
couple of places; TV Data plans to unveil its offering next month).

Wetmore comes away impressed with the technology, but a bit puzzled as to why
people would spend lots of time in front of their computers just to plot their
existence in front of the TV.

Nonetheless, this new technology does give one a chance to pause: With a good
on-line TV listings service and a mailroom that can handle "tailored"
newspapers, a publisher could stop sending the weekly TV book -- or even the
daily TV listings page -- to subscribers who partake of the on-line version.
That's quite a lot of newsprint.

Another example of how new technology can save newsprint comes from the Dayton
Daily News in Ohio. As the "local" paper for the Proximity Peace Talks -- held
to discuss the future of the former Yugoslavia at nearby Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base -- the paper was able to score a scoop: It acquired a complete copy
of the peace accords just after they were initialed.

Inside, we reprint a column Dayton Daily News Editor Max Jennings wrote for the
paper because it explains that in a newsprint-only world, he would not have
been able to adequately leverage the scoop. But with a World-Wide Web site, the
Dayton paper was able to reproduce the entire accords -- and make them
available to people around the world.

Jennings' point is that this new medium not only gives him the opportunity to
do new things, it also gives him the opportunity to give readers what newsprint
would have never allowed him to provide.

Our next stop is also new media-oriented: Rick Smolen, a photojournalist with a
long history at National Geographic as well as the Day in the Life coffee-table
books, pushes the envelope he pretty much personally created in photojournalism
CD-ROMs, with Alice to Ocean and Passage to Vietnam, with a new project: 24
Hours in Cyberspace.

Kurt Foss, electronic photojournalism expert (he's a big part of the digital
efforts of the National Press Photographers Association), talks to Smolen and
his merry band of picture takers about how they plan to move beyond CD-ROMs and
into the World-Wide Web for this new venture (Foss is a participant as well).

A shifting of thought patterns is also the basis for a piece by Cole Group
Consultant Mike Middlesworth, who talks about what a publisher should look for
when attempting to move into new technology -- and, specifically, what a
publisher should seek when retaining a consultant.

And, lastly, in the Hellbox we have news from P.INK and ISGI -- the two
German-based front-end suppliers have encountered rough patches recently, and
we take a look at what's going on.

Yes, so far we are a TV nation (though the Michael Moore show by that name was
recently canceled by its second network; your printed listings might reflect
it), but it seems like in a very short time we might become a PC nation.

-- David M. Cole

ON-LINE TV LISTING SERVICES NOW AVAILABLE FOR BBSES AND WEB

Digitized TV listings are a thing of the present.    The two major suppliers of
television program listings -- Tribune Media Services of Chicago and TV Data
Technologies of Queensbury, N.Y. -- introduced electronic listings last June at
NEXPO '95 in Atlanta.

Since then, Tribune has moved into the newspaper marketplace and TV Data has
taken its entry back to the drawing board.

In theory, digitized listings provide an easy way to find out what's on TV in
the 500-channel world the cable industry says is lurking just around the corner
-- an impossible task in the print realm, unless a publisher wants to make his
or her TV book a loss leader with capital "L"s.

By providing a PC-equipped television viewer with access to a database and a
slick GUI, the suppliers reasoned, newspapers could open a new revenue stream
-- through subscriptions and on-screen advertising -- and spend less time
keeping up with changes on the local cable systems.

And maybe one day, it was suggested, newspaper subscribers who took digitized
listings could be stricken from the print distribution list, saving the
newspaper old money while making new.

Both Tribune and TV Data have products now, and in the works, that deliver
listings (and ads) via either a BBS or a home page on the World-Wide Web.
Tribune has TV Week Interactive running on two web sites and a third is ramping
up to go on-line this month. TV Data plans to roll out its Internet version of
TV Data Online at the Interactive Newspapers conference Feb. 21-24 in San
Francisco.

Each iteration offers grids 10 or so channels deep, program details, search
engines for tracking down that elusive movie from the 1940s you're dying to
tape, customizable listing displays and the fun of playing with the future
now.

But having seen both suppliers' efforts in some form, this TV book editor has
to pose a $64,000 question: Who's going to use it?


Many viewers soon may have four ways to find out what's on TV:

*Their friendly, reliable, home-delivered weekly TV book. Compact, portable and
recyclable, the printed guide's contents are accessed with a flick of a thumb
and finger.

Occasionally, it arrives damp (or not at all), but it's cheap (as little as 35
cents, if the book is distributed any day but Sunday), it doesn't have to be
downloaded or dialed into (no phone charges), and it doesn't require a tribute
to Bill Gates to own one.

*On-screen guides. Many cable systems have set aside one channel to display
continuous, rolling listings. As cable has advanced, these displays have become
interactive, provided the subscriber has a box and a remote from the cable
company. Thus, a click on-screen changes channels to the desired program.

*The off-line PC application (no Macs need apply). Dial up the local
franchise's modem, set your software to receive and in a matter of minutes, a
week's worth of listings (two, if the franchise is Tribune's) are on your hard
drive.

Click on the application and, if you've done this before and have set up your
own customized view of TV land, you have tailored listings for on-screen review
or output to a printer.

*The on-line web source. Dial up the WWW, go to your local source (for that
matter, go to a distant site) and start asking for shows you want to see, or
click a button to see the grid for what's on right now, or scan the features
text for best bets, or -- Hey! Don't get too involved -- you're taking time
away from watching TV!

And that may be the telling issue with digitized listings: No matter how easy
they are to access, will viewers want to take the time to go to one video
screen to see what's on another? Or, even worse for broadcasters, will they
become so enchanted with surfing the listings that they forget why they went
there in the first place?

Perhaps there won't be a fair test until the 500-channel age dawns. For now,
we'll quit questioning the value of these packages and take a look at what they
do.

To get a sense of how non-print listings work, we screen tested the off-line
application TV Data Online (which is to be joined by a 'Net version shortly)
and visited three sites using Tribune's TV Week Interactive.

TV Data provided a phone number and password in order to download a demo of TV
Data Online. The Windows-based program (there are no plans for a Mac version
from either TV Data or Tribune) was a hefty 2.2 megabytes big, which took a
while to bring in at 9600 bps.

Listings downloads are much smaller, 250 kilobytes and up, depending on the
number of channels and cable systems in the subscriber's area.

When the app was kicked into gear, it first announced that new data were
available, and given permission, it brought in new material for movies,
features and grids a day at a time. Updating each day, on a Compaq '486 without
any special goodies, took about 30 seconds.

With TVDO, the user can set depths and widths for grid entries. Keep clicking
on a down arrow and soon five lines of text are displayed for each channel --
and "ABC" in a half-hour box becomes ABC World News This Morning. Similarly,
the width per box can be expanded and "ABC" again grows to its full title.

To see details about a program, just click on its box and a text window opens,
showing a synopsis of the show, who stars in it and other air times. (This last
bit of info is certainly a step ahead of the printed guide, aside from movie
logs.)

By going into a channel lineup dialog box, Mr. or Ms. Viewer can create a
user-specific lineup. Channels can be chosen from the master list for the cable
system being referenced, then sorted by channel, call letters or random (to add
an element of surprise, we presume).

When the setup is done, the user tells the app to store the new order, and a
data sort is performed -- taking another few seconds.

TVDO's grid is white with colored lettering, giving a visual cue as to the
nature of the program's content. Some time segments get pretty bright and
cheery, and perhaps too dazzling to be meaningful. But the visually intuitive
may find the idea practical.

One welcome feature in TVDO is keyboard commands. Menu choices can be keyboard
driven; at the right side of the screen are buttons with the same choices for
the mouse-and-click crowd. Among the buttons are days of the week, for quick
access to daily grids.

Two other screens give access to program details. One, Best Bets, opens a
screen with four buttons -- Best Bets, Soap Talk, TV Q/A and TV Trivia. A click
on Best Bets brings up text, with paragraphs alternating black and blue. The
text is identical to features copy provided to print clients of TV Data
Technologies.

Fortunately, we had a good look at TVDO before calamity struck -- the
application bombed. On restart, it asked whether to process new data again. We
declined, not wishing to spend the time, and found that our channel lineup
preferences had been saved.

When TVDO bombed a second time, it came back devoid of grid info, just a
garden-variety spreadsheet grid (from BaseCode) -- and no evident way through a
menu to tell it to go find the data it had refreshed before.

Upon reflection, we concluded that the curse we cast on suppliers at NEXPO
booths, where we're renowned for causing demos to explode, had visited yet
another supplier. Sorry about that.

(To get a static gander at TVDO, you can surf over to TV Data's web site,
http://www.tvdata.com/.)


Tribune's truly on-line product can be seen at three web sites -- Tribune's
demo home page (http://www.tmstv.com), Continental Cablevision of New England
(http://www.continental.com/) and Arizona Central (http://www.azcentral.com/),
the recently started web service of Phoenix Newspapers that also has a presence
on America Online.

On a first visit, the viewer is asked to designate which state and city in
which he or she lives. A multi-digit code is assigned to the user for future
use, or more simply, the viewer can bookmark a page past the initial sign-up to
provide rapid access the next time around.

A tour of these three sites shows the advantage to having 'Net access: no
lengthy download (we were running on a Mac Quadra 650 through a 28.8 kbps modem
to a local Internet provider), no strange interface (we are partial to Macs, we
admit) and fairly good response time.

Totally mouse-driven, Tribune's interface varies from site to site except for
its grids, which are color-coded click-maps.

On Arizona Central, movie titles appear in green, sports in yellow,
news/talk/special affairs in magenta, gray for everything else. Continental
uses a wider range: red movies, green children, blue drama (although talk
appears to be the same color), magenta comedy, green-on-gray news, a darker
green for documentaries and cyan for sports.

It makes for quite a display -- probably useful for some programming executives
plotting their next season, but near overkill for the common Joe, who has to
read the program block title to know just what's what anyway.

While Continental goes with grids and program searches right off, Arizona
Central features a color pic of the week's cover story, with a link to the
text. As with TVDO, the content is drawn from the print-oriented product. (One
drawback: The picture remains even after the program has aired.)

The Tribune search screen is simple but comprehensive, with fields for program
and/or episode title, and description. Click on the category field and a pop-up
menu provides so many choices, they stop at the letter "H."

The search can be narrowed by date, including those gone by, to the last day in
the data cycle (from Saturday through the second Friday hence). One of four
time blocks can be selected to further narrow the search.

Once done, the search returns a list of programs, with name, date, time,
channel number and service, program category and a few words about its content
(movies get stars). After one search on Arizona Central, we printed out 12
pages -- 45 items -- of "educational" programs airing for a one-week period.

And there you have it -- literally. Go take a look at the Tribune sites, and
drop by TV Data in a few weeks to see its 'Net offering when it becomes
available.


How does all this play in Peoria? Dunno, but several score miles west, a few
folks in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have found it to their liking.

One of the first Tribune customers to go live was the company that publishes
the Cedar Rapids Gazette, which put the bulletin board version up for
subscribers early in the fall on FYIowa, a collection of electronic services
run by Interactive Media.

"Interactive Media basically is coordinating the efforts of all of the Gazette
companies," said Administrator Jim Debth. "When you go to FYIowa, FYIowa is the
umbrella for the Gazette, Iowa Farmer Today and Kcrg-TV."

FYIowa is overseen by Interactive Media, with two full-time people and a
half-time graphics person. One full-time person from the Gazette works on it as
well, Debth said, while one person at Iowa Farmer Today spends part of his time
at it, as do two people at Kcrg.

FYIowa also has a home page (http://www.infi.net/fyiowa/) through Internet
provider InfiNet of Norfolk, Va. In January, it will offer TV Vision, named
after the Gazette's weekly TV book. Now, subscribers to FYIowa's BBS can
download TV Vision for off-line use.

It's one of the first -- perhaps only -- instance where TV listings have
generated a revenue trickle. About one BBS user in 10 downloads the listings,
Debth said. Rates are $5.95 a month for 10 hours, $7.95 for 20 hours and $10.95
for 30 hours. Subscribers to the Gazette get $1 off.

"We actually have some reasonable response," Debth said about subscribers' use
of the BBS listings. "It'll be much more easy to get on our web site because
you won't have to download files."

While FYIowa will use the print name TV Vision, on-line "it'll be a much more
'Net-looking graphic," Debth said. Working with Tribune to prepare a web
version has been a snap, he said.

"Fortunately, we haven't had to do any of it ourselves, other than the graphic
we've provided them," Debth said. "We just kind of tell them this is how we'd
like the page to look."

That's the idea, according to Barbara Needleman, a marketing executive at
Tribune Media Services.

"We put up a site for them and design some wallpaper for it," said Needleman,
then wait for the client to ask for modifications. "If you put something on it,
they know what they want to change."

While Interactive Media may gain a smidgen of income from TV Vision off-line,
most publishers continue to feed the 'Net while not taking money back from the
content bottom-feeders.

"I don't think anyone is pricing it," Needleman said -- except, of course,
Tribune. While declining to provide a dollar figure for its fees, Needleman
indicated that TV Week Interactive was priced attractively, especially since
four tiers of service were available.

"There's different functionality in each of the tiers," she said, so costs and
benefits can be correlated well. "We've made it so that it's affordable for
papers who want to put something out but don't want to spend a lot of money
now, all the way to papers who want to do very cable-specific products."

At TV Data, pricing is not the immediate concern -- getting the product ready
for prime time is. Going back to the digital workbench was a marketing and
design decision, according to Mike Laddin, vice president for marketing and
product development.

"Frankly," Laddin said, "we felt there was some additional work we needed to do
on the product. We took some more time to make sure we did it right."

So he turned to Kevin Joyce, who had to look at his business card to find his
latest title: interactive and on-line services product manager. ("Maybe it
should be 'whatever is hot' product manager," he joked.)

Describing the NEXPO iteration of TV Data Online as "a very young product,"
Joyce said TV Data wanted to improve search times and screens.

"We cleaned up the user interface to the point that we threw out some things
that were confusing -- too many buttons, too many layers, too many menu items,"
he said of the CodeBasic-driven product. The result: "We reduced the amount of
steps for an action to take place, and made it easy to navigate."

Joyce said that last summer, TV Data also realized it had to contend with
several ways of delivering the data, not just through a BBS. "The Web, I think,
caught everybody by surprise," Joyce said. "It proves people are thirsty for
information and visual information."

As Prodigy was the first to show an interest in digital listings from TV Data,
it was natural to prepare for distribution through an on-line service -- but
also a proprietary bulletin board service, in this case Worldgroup from
Galacticomm of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for localized dial-up delivery, and
eventually on the Internet.

"There are a lot of flavors and ways that newspapers are setting up their
on-line services," Joyce said. "We didn't want to be tied directly or
intimately to any one style."

Hence, TV Data had to back up a bit from its ties to Galacticomm to make sure
that preparing for distribution via that route did not shut off other avenues,
such as a BBS already running at a newspaper that simply wanted to add TVDO to
its menu.

"We needed this product to work on a variety of delivery platforms," Joyce
said, although it is "totally a Windows-based product" in terms of the
end-user, unless you're running Win95. Cranking up for Win95 is undecided, as
"we're going to look and see what kind of a lifespan these off-line
applications have in general."

Is Laddin worried that Tribune has the jump on TV Data? Not hardly.

"In terms of the market overall and where we stand," Laddin said, "it's a new
media and it's an emerging marketplace for everyone -- Tribune, ourselves, the
newspapers."

"Everybody is very interested," he said. "There's a lot of activity, but the
papers are moving at a very deliberate way because everybody in the market is
still trying to figure out how they're going to make money. Short term,
nobody's making any money at this, at least up to now."

Compared to Tribune Media Services, TV Data has an enormous client base: more
than 2500 print clients, and a burgeoning role in providing data to on-screen
providers, such as cable companies and a new enterprise called VideoGuide Inc.
(http://www.vgi.com).

With backing from the Japanese trading firm Marubeni and consumer electronics
giant Sanyo, VideoGuide has set up a delivery system that uses the radio
frequencies of wireless pagers and presents listings on-screen (freshly
downloaded overnight). The viewer can click -- using VideoGuide's remote -- to
view or tape a program.

The product is being marketed through Tandy Radio Shack stores and other major
retailers in selected areas.


And so, as they say in TV land, stay tuned. How and when -- not whether --
digital listings end up in your home is the question.

More importantly, whether your newspaper will make any money off them is an
even more open question than it was last summer, when TV Week Interactive and
TV Data Online were rolled out.

The challenge lies ahead for publishers, while the suppliers have their part of
it well under way. For all, it's a big time learning experience.

What's it like, developing an on-line product? Kevin Joyce can tell you:

"Sometimes you end up reinventing the wheel. Sometimes you do it the right way
or a better way. At the very least, you do it the way you wanted it to be
done."

DATELINE DAYTON: ON THE WEB, SOMETIMES THE LITTLE GUY WINS

(This article ran as a column in the Dayton Daily News on Dec. 3, 1995, and is
reprinted here with permission.)


The story of how a midsize Midwestern daily scooped the world begins on the
blustery night of Nov. 22, the day the historic Bosnia peace plan was signed at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio.

Most of the stories had been written and edited at the Dayton Daily News when a
couple of editors who rarely get to leave the office decided to go to the base
and have a look-see themselves.

John Thomson, the assistant managing editor, and Kevin Riley, a news manager,
decided this night that there might be some map information they could get
their hands on that could be used in our package on the complex agreement.

As they drove toward the base, their conversation turned philosophical.
Thomson, who has been in the business for more than 20 years and therefore
should know better, turned to Riley and said something to the effect that "the
only difference between the New York Times and us is our heads."

"We can do anything they can do," Thomson said, "if we just get our minds
right."

In that frame of mind, the pair sauntered into the press center, where a
three-star general was briefing a cluster of tired reporters.

During the briefing, they noticed a couple of out-of-town journalists had a
phone book-sized document no one else seemed to have. Thomson and Riley set out
to get their own copy, which they did. (How, dear reader, is a professional
secret.)

Closer inspection revealed that the document was, in fact, the complete
156-page version of the peace agreement.

The highly technical, precise language spelling out the details of the land
division was not grist for the local Ohio paper, but it certainly would be
fascinating stuff to the residents of the former Yugoslavia and their
neighbors, as well as to academics and other experts from around the world.

"What if," Riley asked Thomson, "we went back right now and scanned this into
our web site? Hey, we could scoop the world."

They headed back at flank speed to the office while alerting Newsroom Systems
Manager Jeff Adams that he had work to do. By 2 a.m., most of the pages had
been scanned in to the newspaper's Access Dayton web site on the Internet
(http://www.access-dayton.com).

Our web site had been the primary creation of another newsroom computer
enthusiast, Joe Cunningham. He set it up soon after the announcement that the
historic peace talks would be at Wright-Pat. Every bit of reporting we did on
the subject went onto the site, along with our photos, cartoons and the content
of a special 12-page section we produced on the opening day.

As was appropriate, our coverage was more comprehensive and detailed than
anyone else's we saw, and even before the latest caper with the final
agreement, the web site had become known to thousands, if not tens of
thousands, of people all over the world.

The technology allows easy tracking of how many hits a site gets, and from
where; in the first few hours, 525 people requested information from our
Bosnian web site.

We were astonished at what we had wrought. We had our data accessed and
downloaded from all over Eastern Europe, Russia, Canada, a dozen countries in
Latin America, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Sweden, Singapore,
Australia -- every point of the globe.

We also found our reporting subjected to international review and criticism.

Vladimir Vuksan from Sarajevo sent a scathing e-mail to us that began: "I was
thoroughly disgusted to read the article (from the Dayton Daily News) in regard
to the rescue of an American airman by Serbian Chetniks. In those two pieces,
Serbian Chetniks are glorified as if they were the freedom fighters fighting on
the side of the Allies.

"Nothing could be more false. Serbian Chetniks were on the side of the Axis
through the most of the World War II and have done horrendous crimes against
Croatian and Muslim populations."

The next day, I received a personal e-mail from another unexpected source. It
began, "I read your column in Sunday's paper on all of the troubles you have
had telling foreign media representatives that Dayton is a place with qualities
not to be missed and to be taken into account.

"As one of those most deeply involved in all of these negotiation issues during
the past months, I can confess to having been somewhat surprised and even
skeptical when Wright-Pat and Dayton emerged as one of the alternatives.

"But that is now past us. After close to a week here, I can assure you that we
all feel that the choice of location was a good one. ... I can assure you that
we have all found Dayton much more to our liking than I believe any one of us
expected would be the case. And we appreciate seeing the world through the
prism of the Dayton Daily News!"

It was signed by Carl Bildt, who identified himself as co-chairman of the
Proximity Peace Talks, European Union special representative. To my knowledge,
Bildt was unavailable to the hordes of journalists covering the talks, yet here
he was writing me like an old school chum.

It's amazing stuff, this Internet. Which brings me to the conclusion of our
worldwide-scoop story.

The world knows now that a little paper in the middle of the United States is
the repository of the complete peace agreement. Accesses in early December hit
7000 in one day, again from every point of the globe, especially central
Europe.

And our list of admirers continues to grow. Our latest e-mail was from none
other than the U.S. State Department itself, which acknowledged it was the
Dayton Daily News -- not the federal government -- that disseminated the
information first.

Debi Guido-O'Grady, from the State Department's bureau of public affairs,
wrote: "Congratulations on an excellent site on the peace talks. You certainly
beat us in getting the full text of the agreement up on the Web.

"How long do you expect to keep the Dayton site active? While we are not
supposed to link to nonofficial sites, I was thinking of bringing up a 'reading
room' for other great resources for information (like yours) on Bosnia, on the
U.S. Department of State's official home page
(http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/dosfan.HTML)."

Thank you, State Department. It just shows you what can happen when you come up
against some of us Midwestern hayseeds.

PHOTOJOURNALISTS TO CHRONICLE CYBERSPACE FOR CD, BOOK, WEB

For more than a decade, photojournalist Rick Smolan and a roving band of
camera-toting friends have been steadily breaking new ground by combining the
power of great images with the changing tools of publishing.

Next month, he and his aptly named production company, Against All Odds, take
on their biggest challenge to date: documenting the worldwide impact of the
Internet.

Smolan began his series of popular Day in the Life coffee-table picture books
in the early '80s. For each, Smolan and 100 or so of his colleagues would
document one 24-hour period of life in a single country; each successive entry
has sought to be more technologically ambitious than the last.

His highly acclaimed From Alice to Ocean coverage -- photographed in the '70s
on assignment for National Geographic -- detailed a woman's solo trek across
the Australian Outback and became the first combination picture book
(Addison-Wesley, 1992, $49.95) and interactive CD-ROM.

Most recently, a similar but more sophisticated book-and-CD, Passage to
Vietnam, were the product of 70 photojournalists spending a week documenting
life throughout the nearly forgotten southeast Asian country, which has changed
considerably since the end of the war two decades ago.

Smolan's multimedia company, based in Sausalito, Calif., has gathered awards
hand-over-fist for Passage (Against All Odds, 1995), which skillfully blends
outstanding still images, maps, text, sound, video and related materials into
an awesome educational production.

Innovative features include a three-dimensional navigational device called the
Quebe, which gives a user a multitude of ways to experience the graphics-rich
content; several Forrest Gump-like appearances by a digitized Smolan, who drops
into several still images to narrate, and a gallery where selected
photographers stroll in and out of the scene while describing their
photographic portfolios and philosophies.

Sounds like a project that may be difficult to top, right? Wrong, at least if
Smolan's Feb. 8 project -- dubbed "24 Hours in Cyberspace: Painting on the
Walls of the Digital Cave" -- comes anywhere close to expectations.

"We have spent the last 12 years traveling around the world, documenting
different cultures," said Smolan. "For us, cyberspace is another culture and
place that we are going to, with the goal of documenting it during a typical
24-hour time period. But this time around, because of the nature of the new
medium itself, people can actively take part in the project, and respond with
their own point of view."

As with previous efforts, Smolan and his project team will hire and dispatch
100 of the world's top photojournalists around the globe to bring back stories
that reveal the myriad ways global telecommunications technologies are
affecting the professional and personal lives of people.

After soliciting story suggestions via the Internet and several commercial
services for the last few months, and screening digital-savvy photographers for
potential participation, the Cyber24 project team is putting in long hours this
month making final connections and arrangements that should make this one of
the largest on-line events ever conducted.

Karen Mullarkey, a free-lance visual consultant and former director of
photography at Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone, leads the story
development team. Affiliations with a number of media, military, government and
business organizations will supplement the work done by the project
photographers.

Tentative plans include live support from the Associated Press and Reuters, the
Department of Defense (including peacekeeping photo coverage from Bosnia), the
Smithsonian Institution, Nasa, the United Nations and Disney. In addition,
millions of people on-line are being invited to submit their own stories of how
the digital revolution is affecting their lives.

J. Carl Ganter, an assignment editor for the project, is a veteran photographer
for several of Smolan's Day in the Life projects. But this time, he's on the
other side, just one member of the team that's trying to pull this daunting
project together.

"The cooperation between cutting-edge firms (and project underwriters) like
Adobe Systems, Sun Microsystems and Eastman Kodak is exciting," he said.
"Imagine importing a digital picture and running Photoshop in the blink of an
eye. To do this, the tech team has put together an amazing high-speed network
to handle the huge blocks of text, digital pictures, audio and video generated
on the day."

Ganter, who's also coordinating and editing audio for the project, says web
cruisers (http://www.cyber24.com/) will be able to hear photographers' comments
about their subjects -- minutes after the pictures are published.

"After photographers transmit their images to headquarters, we'll debrief them
by telephone, edit their recorded comments and include them in the site,"
Ganter said. "So visitors to Cyber24 will have a chance to be virtually on
assignment with the team. There will be a lot of other exciting, cutting-edge
multimedia surprises as well."

One of the newest photo technologies to be used is a method for creating
interactive, 360-degree photographs called PhotoSpheres by merging two separate
still images with software developed by Knoxville-based Omniview Inc.. Ten or
12 world landmarks will be photographed and published as spherical scenes on
the project's web site. A special free downloadable OmniView viewer will be
needed to view and navigate inside the images.

Mission Control for the project will be in San Francisco's China Basin, where
all photos and stories will be transmitted throughout the "day," a 48-hour
period as Feb. 8 moves across the world's time zones.

On that date, an instant web site will be updated every 30 minutes or so --
beginning at midnight Pacific Standard Time -- as new content is received,
cataloged into an Illustra database and uploaded to the web pages designed by
Clement Mok, the former art director of Apple Computer and the designer
responsible for the look of the Microsoft Network.

After a few days, the project home page will close. Around March 15, after a
team of editors has had a chance to review all content captured by its select
photographers and other participants, a permanent "time capsule" web site will
open with additional materials (it will also be a showcase for the latest in
web publishing tools).

A picture book and CD will be released in the fall.

Faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology are coordinating "the world's
largest photo classroom," a parallel, collaborative project for journalism
educators and students worldwide. The best stories will be added to the
project's main web site, while the schools also will maintain their own home
pages with additional materials related to 24 Hours.

Prizes donated by corporate sponsors will be awarded for the top student
entries.

Global participation on the date is being strongly encouraged; specifications
and submission details are available on the web site. Entries may be
transmitted via the Internet or one of several commercial on-line services,
including America Online, CompuServe and PressLink.

The project will be the featured event at the grand opening of the Internet
1996 World Exposition (http://park.org/fair/), a world's fair for the
information age.

HOW CONSULTANTS CAN PLAY KEY ROLES IN PLANNING BIG PROJECTS

One day recently a friend said to me, "I know you're a consultant, but what do
consultants do and why do people hire them?"

I gave him what was essentially a non-answer and we went on to other things.

Later, after I'd thought about it a bit, I told him I'd kind of kissed off his
question and that, if pressed, I'd have to say this:

Consultants help businesses improve profits by helping solve problems, and
there are as many reasons for hiring them as there are problems in running a
business.

Newspapers, for example, hire consultants for a variety of reasons.

Sometimes, a specific problem requires technical expertise not found among
those on the payroll. Planning a computer network, for example, is often a
one-time job where a consultant can come in, examine the problem and make
recommendations in a much shorter time than it would take someone on the staff
to get up to speed.

Often a newspaper can benefit from having a problem looked at by "a fresh eye,"
someone who's not too close to the situation -- a person who is not involved in
internal turf wars, nor carries any baggage as far as relationships are
concerned.

Remember, too, that many attempts to solve problems end up in finger-pointing
and attempts to place blame. An outsider doesn't deal in reward and punishment;
he or she is there to focus on fixing the problem.

Independent consultants usually get openness from managers and others involved
in a problem simply because they're not involved in the normal office
politics.

Independent consultants often come to you with broader experience and more
industry contacts than people on your staff, especially at newspapers where few
managers attend trade shows or are sent to seminars at such places as the
American Press Institute.

An independent consultant can be of greatest benefit, in my view, when a
newspaper is going to undertake a major project.

Newspapers are rarely overstaffed. All the managers work hard at their
day-to-day responsibilities with barely enough time to work on next year's
budget, let alone take on a major project.

These problems multiply when the project -- say, pagination -- is one that
involves many departments of the newspaper and affects processes, personnel and
equipment in all of them.

Working hand-in-hand with the executive assigned to spearhead the project, a
consultant can give it his or her full attention, uninterrupted by the phone
calls that start, "I know you're working on that project, but this little
problem has come up and can you just take a few minutes to ...?"

Also, few newspapers have people on their payroll with the knowledge of
interdepartmental relationships needed for many major projects.

Yes, you can set up a committee, then charge it with studying the issue and
coming up with a recommendation, but unless you have an exceptional group, each
panelist will view it from his or her own narrow perspective.

They need help in seeing the big picture.

In pagination projects, for example, newsroom managers more often than not see
only that it is going to take them longer to deal with pages in the newsroom.
What they don't see is the reduction in time, overall, to get the paper on the
press.

Part of a consultant's role is to provide that big-picture view. Along with it,
a good consultant will also try to make all participants fully aware of how
everyone benefits from a major project. There are benefits for all departments
of a newspaper from pagination, although sometimes they're hard to see, or
attain, without understanding the entire process.

When do you need a consultant? When you look around and don't see anyone with
the expertise needed to solve the problem at hand. Or, if you do have someone,
you recognize that the enterprise would suffer if you assigned the task as a
full-time responsibility.

There are times when a consultant can serve as a referee and help you decide
who's right when two department heads make very good cases for doing something
their way.

Or, frankly, you might want to bring in a consultant if you'd like to have
someone from out of town to blame if things go wrong.

How do you find a consultant and what should you expect?

Talk to other newspapers, talk to suppliers -- they know who's knowledgeable in
their fields. Check out the trade publications. Those are all good places to
start.

I've always believed, as does Dave Cole, that consultants do a better job for
newspapers if they are independent and do not also work for or represent
suppliers. That's not to say that those who do are necessarily wrong; it's just
that old business of not wanting to appear beholden to anyone.

Once you've hit upon a likely prospect, outline your problem and ask for a
proposal. You should get -- in writing -- an initial action plan which most
often will prescribe a day or two of on-site evaluation, discussions with your
managers and the promise of a written report with recommendations.

The proposal should also include information about fees and expense
reimbursement for the initial visit.

Suppose you do find someone, you get a proposal and you accept it. Then what?

First, tell everyone in your plant that the consultant is coming and why. The
last thing you want is everybody wondering why there's a stranger poking around
the plant for a couple of days.

Then, gather those directly involved and ask for their full cooperation. Tell
them you expect them to be candid with the consultant, and that they must clear
their calendars as much as possible so as to be available while the consultant
is in the plant.

You're going to be spending a fair amount of money, so you want to be sure that
the consultant gets the information needed.

Arrange for a manager to serve as host, and to use time to best advantage, ask
that lunches be arranged with people involved in the project.

It's always nice, from the consultant's point of view, to have a place in the
building to use as a base. Perhaps the office of the person most involved with
the project or problem would serve best.

You should meet privately with the consultant at the beginning and end of the
visit. Be sure that the opening discussion includes your view of the problem
and some agreement on expectations.

Be candid. If there are personnel problems or peculiar situations to be
factored in, discuss them. Ask for and expect discretion. If you want appraisal
of personnel, this is the time to ask for it so the consultant can take the
measure of people while assessing the situation from the start.

Make it clear that you'll be available should problems or questions arise.

It can be beneficial to gather your troops for a session with the consultant
just prior to your end-of-visit interview. That's when any second thoughts can
be aired, or promised information delivered.

Expect a reasonably detailed report of findings and recommendations within a
few days of the on-site visit. If called for, you'll probably get a proposal
for an ongoing relationship involving oversight, project management or hands-on
problem solving.

If a long-term relationship ensues, ask for regular progress reports, both oral
and written. Be sure that your people are cooperating fully, and that everyone
understands your goals.

None of this will insure success, of course, but it will certainly improve the
odds against failure.

AS LONG AS IT ISN'T ILLEGAL OR IMMORAL

Shortly after I started consulting six years ago, I read somewhere that
consultants who specialize in technology break into two distinct groups:

*Those who come into your office, take off their coat, roll up their sleeves
and start writing code or plugging computers into the network.

*Those who come into your office and never take off their coat.

Because my consulting practice has always used the "we'll do it as long as it
isn't illegal or immoral" credo, we have ended up not breaking into either of
these categories.

The no-coat consulting has always been fairly straightforward: you write the
code, you hook up the wires, you make sure it all works and then write some
documentation about how you did it, so that the newspaper doesn't have to hire
you again to make a minor change.

The coat consulting, on the other hand, is rife with the possibility for
misunderstandings and bruised feelings. On more than one occasion I've had to
tell a publisher that his or her biggest problem falls in the personnel
category: the wrong people in the wrong jobs can be as big a problem as a
misprogrammed computer.

Another big problem is to be hired to solve one problem but to find a bigger
one looming of which the staff is unaware. A couple of times I've been called
in to talk about pagination, only to find ancient classified or business
systems that would be an impediment to any pagination project. When the
publisher is confronted with having only enough money to buy a pagination
system or a new classified system, it's not fun to be the one to say the paper
has to postpone pagination until the other systems are brought up to snuff.

For me, the hardest part was coming to grips with the situation where the
publisher brings me in, gives me the run of the shop for a couple of days, gets
a verbal report before I leave, nodding all the while. And then I phone the
paper six months later to find that nothing has changed.

When I was a full-time newspaper employee, I learned to have my advice ignored;
I just thought that when I was a consultant that wouldn't happen any longer.

But I forgot: this is the publishing business.

CHAPCHAL OUT AT ISGI AFTER MERGER

Danny Chapchal keeps reaching for the brass ring of publishing system supply
firms -- and keeps missing.

The man who put together the deal to buy Atex from Kodak (and who subsequently
lost Atex to the Norwegian software company Sysdeco) had almost built a new
publishing systems powerhouse late in 1995, only to lose control at the last
minute.

After turning Atex over to Sysdeco last year (see The Cole Papers, January
1995), Chapchal worked out a deal with Integrierte Systeme Grafische Industrie
(ISGI) of Eschborn, Germany.

ISGI was developed in the early '90s as a publishing systems research
consortium funded by Siemens Nixdorf and Hell Graphics. Last spring, Chapchal
became a consultant for what had become Siemens Nixdorf-owned ISGI and put
together some Siemens Nixdorf PC-based publishing systems products that were
shown at NEXPO '95 in Atlanta (see The Cole Papers, September 1995).

The products were well received. ISGI took orders from the New York Daily News
and the 25,000-circulation evening Reading (Pa.) Eagle.

In the latter part of the summer, Chapchal was named chairman of ISGI and
immediately set about finding a partner to build up the company. He found one
in Italian investor Tullio Ponzi, who in recent years had built International
Publishing Associates Holding Ltd.

IPA Systems is a holding company that owns Monotype Publishing Systems of
Rolling Meadows, Ill., and the United Kingdom; H. Berthold of the United
Kingdom; Freedom System Integrators of Wichita, Kan.; QED Technology Ltd. of
Cheltenham, England; GB Techniques of Prestwick, Scotland, and Scangraphic
PrePress Technology of Wedel, Germany.

IPA Systems was created by Ponzi and longtime industry executives Peter Purdy
and Charles Crocker in 1992 and '93. Crocker left the business in 1993. Purdy
died in October 1994.

On Nov. 8, Siemens Nixdorf transferred ownership of ISGI to Scangraphic (a
legalistic nicety -- Scangraphic would not take over ISGI's business, and each
would operate separately).

The plan was that Chapchal would be in charge of the new ISGI, which would
incorporate the resources of Freedom Systems, QED and GB Techniques.
Specifically, the deal gave Chapchal a presence in the United States, along
with a sales force.

But within days of finalizing the deal, Ponzi and Chapchal had a falling out.
Although Chapchal remains a consultant to ISGI, he is no longer chairman.

Along with Chapchal's leave-taking, his lieutenants Ian Anderson and Rod
Fenwick -- who had both worked extensively with Chapchal at both Atex and
previous projects -- also left ISGI.

While no plans for the future of ISGI have been announced, the installation at
the Reading Eagle is going forward.

As an executive with Linotype in the '70s and early '80s, Chapchal was
president of its World Systems Inc. division, with corporate responsibilities
in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.

In 1984, Chapchal returned to England, where -- in addition to being the chief
fund-raiser and chairman of QED Technology -- he was managing director of
Applied Research of Cambridge Ltd., a supplier of turnkey CAD systems.

Within two years, Chapchal became chief executive of Xenotron Holdings Plc.
Xenotron, a publishing systems supplier emphasizing display advertising makeup
systems, was shortly thereafter sold to the Hell publishing systems group in
Germany.

Hell ultimately killed Xenotron and most of its innovative technology.

Chapchal then orchestrated the sale of QED to Maxwell Communications Corp. and
took a position with Fifth Wave Technology Ltd., a division of Maxwell.

He left the publishing systems business in 1991 to run SQL Systems
International of Surrey, England, a supplier of asset management software.
Insiders indicate that within 18 months, Chapchal turned SQL from a company
that lost millions of dollars into a multimillion-dollar money-maker.

In 1993 Chapchal began discussions with Kodak about acquiring its Atex
division, and put the deal together that December. Chapchal used investors who
had been involved in the SQL restructuring.

In the course of his running Atex, those investors lost faith in Chapchal, and
in 1994 Sysdeco convinced the Atex board of directors to give it an equity
position in the company and a management contract.

Chapchal then began work on the ISGI project.

P.INK GERMANY ENTERS CHAPTER 11

P.INK, the Macintosh-based editorial front-end system whose history has been
mixed at best, has hit another stumbling block: bankruptcy.

The German company that developed the software -- P.INK Software Engineering
GmbH of Hamburg -- has filed Vergleichsbeantragung, the German version of
Chapter 11 reorganization. This type of bankruptcy filing allows a company to
keep its creditors at bay while it negotiates for better repayment plans and/or
the injection of working capital from new investors.

Reports from Germany indicate that P.INK had been planning on a fresh round of
financing from Scitex Corp. Ltd. of Herzlia, Israel -- one of its four owners
-- which was not forthcoming.

Speculation has implicated Scitex's 1995 third-quarter loss of more than $36.4
million as the reason it didn't make the investment. The loss might have left
the company cash-strapped and incapable of honoring its commitment to buy out
two of the other three owners of P.INK.

Scitex America executives did not respond to numerous phone and e-mail queries
regarding the P.INK situation.

Scitex, which markets the P.INK product line outside of Germany, Austria and
Switzerland, bought 25 percent of the company in February 1994 with an
agreement to acquire another 50 percent of the company over a two-year period.
The remaining 25 percent of P.INK would remain with its founder, president and
chief executive, Andreas Poliza.

The 50 percent of the company that Scitex was scheduled to acquire has been
owned by the German newspaper publishing group Madsack and a German software
company called Rechenzentrum Sdwest. Rechenzentrum has owned its 25 percent for
only a year.

The acquisition of P.INK was engineered by Scitex America Corp. executive Bob
Holt, a former editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Holt, based in Bedford,
Mass., spent much of 1993 in Hamburg, stopping off on his way to and from
Israel to work with Poliza to improve the software and iron out the long-term
relationship.

Scitex -- both in Israel and the United States -- has gone through massive
reorganizations recently. The head of Scitex America, George Carlisle, left the
company last summer. In November, Arie Rosenfeld, the president and chief
executive of Scitex Corp. Ltd. resigned amidst the fallout from the company's
sizable third-quarter loss.

Part of the reason for that loss was an $18 million charge for employee
termination benefits; many longtime Scitex executives have recently left the
company, including Scitex America's marketing executive Ken Hurtabise and
corporate communications executive Paul Thiele.

In addition, Scitex America announced in August the establishment of a
publishing division that would be responsible for the P.INK product line as
well as other Scitex products.

Scitex has sold the Mac-based P.INK system to two newspapers -- The Sun of
Bremerton, Wash., a 41,000-circulation evening daily, and the
63,000-circulation morning Evansville (Ind.) Courier. Both papers are owned by
Scripps-Howard.

In addition, Scitex smoothed the installation of P.INK at the Toronto Sun and
other Sun Publishing Corp. properties (which include the Calgary Sun, Edmonton
Sun and Financial Post), even though the Sun papers had purchased the product
directly from P.INK in Germany.

Executives at these papers were reluctant to be quoted about the situation, but
indicated that Scitex had told them, as one said, "not to worry."

"We've been told that the worst-case scenario is that Scitex will get the North
American rights to the P.INK code," said one newspaper executive.

Despite generally upbeat comments coming from customers, and published reports
that the staff has "expressed full support for the company," sources in Germany
indicate that P.INK programmers are extensively circulating their resumes.

The P.INK story in North America is not a happy one: Demonstrated under the
P.INK Software banner at ANPA/Tec 1990, the North American marketing rights for
the product were acquired in 1991 by the Time Magazine Group division of media
giant Time Warner.

For the next two years, P.INK America attempted to sell its software to its
sibling divisions -- magazines such as Time, People and long-time Mac user
Entertainment Weekly -- and newspapers and other magazines as well.

The potential customers, inside Time or not, were decidedly uninterested. In
1993, Time shut down P.INK America. It was another year before Scitex made its
deal, and despite the Scripps-Howard sales the company has had problems
building momentum for the product line.

Bit bucket ...

"We want them to pay enough money [to license Java] that it hurts a little bit.
It has to be something that you take seriously. For a company like Microsoft,
you charge them a couple of hundred thousand dollars, they don't even notice.
They blow that much on the fruit for one of their press events."

PC, GAME AND MULTIMEDIA HAVEN'T WRITTEN OFF CES YET

     But it's close.  Only a few suppliers have chosen to display
their wares at Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES).

     IBM is biggest computer-related company with products on
display.  Hardware from consumer Aptiva line will be shown, as will
software from its Multimedia Publishing Studio.  "We're going to
have a large booth," spokeswoman said.  Although CES no longer is
hot show from multimedia standpoint, attendance totals alone make
event worth attending, she said.  "They feel like there is still a
large draw to CES," she said.  Still, company is almost apologetic
about its presence.  "It's not a big launch," she said.  "We're
setting up a booth and demoing a lot of new products and having a
presence."

     As exhibitor, IBM is in tiny minority of multimedia hardware
and software companies.  Even though Packard Bell and others have
exhibited, it looks as though Compaq will be only other major PC
supplier in Las Vegas.  As for software, Microsoft will have hotel
rooms but no floor presence.  And small players such as Goodtimes
Interactive, which presented at last year's WCES, are almost
completely absent.

     Multimedia companies said CES just doesn't work as platform
for them any more.  "We painfully exhibited at the last summer
CES," High Technology Distribution Pres. Perry Solomon said.  High
Technology sells variety of computer memory products, including
recordable CD-ROM drives, through its Smart & Friendly unit.  "I
grew up in the consumer electronics industry, and we certainly feel
that the consumer electronics channel is a valid one for our
products," he said.  "But we're not 100% sure that the Winter CES
is an appropriate forum."  For Smart & Friendly, must shows are
Winter Comdex and CeBit in Hamburg, Solomon said.

     One show rules on entertainment software side:  Los Angeles
Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), coming in spring.  Although
only in 2nd year, E3 has secure position as top software forum in
U.S. for videogame and PC entertainment software, robbing CES of
its largest combined exhibitor category.  "We'll be at E3,"
Microsoft Senior Group Mktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said.  "We've got
a fairly substantial space in the main hall."

     That doesn't mean Microsoft -- or Smart & Friendly, for that
matter -- is writing off WCES completely.  "It's not clear to us
whether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'd
like to keep our options open," Taucher said.  "We'll be at suites
and doing meetings, but we won't have a floor presence."

     Smart & Friendly's main market is business users, Solomon
said.  But PC products are evolving so that eventually they will be
consumer electronics products, he said.  That's why he's taking a
"wait-and-see" attitude with WCES.  He hoped show would regain some
of its multimedia strength but isn't certain it will.  Summer CES's
decline as major show was very upsetting, he said.  "I've attended
so many CESes over so many years, and to watch a show that was so
strong and so powerful die was painful to me," he said.  "It proves
you've got to stay close to the market all the time.  I don't know
what happened, but somehow it lost its course."

     In attempt to provide some multimedia energy to mix, CES has
added 2 seminars to workshop:  "Multimedia Software Distribution: 
The New Model" and "Multimedia:  What Is the Consumer Looking For." 
Other panels already scheduled include "The Desktop PC Market --
What Consumers Want," computer manufacturer executive panel and
"Riding the Consumer Interactive Wave."  Strangely, Compaq
Pres.-CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer is show's keynote speaker.

FEW SURPRISES IN SPECIFICS FOR UNIFIED 'DVD' FORMAT

     New unified high-density optical disc format will be called
"DVD" and will feature Dolby AC-3 digital audio for NTSC markets,
MPEG audio for PAL and SECAM countries.

     Those were highlights of mid-Dec. announcement that
negotiators for former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and Super Density (SD)
had completed work in Tokyo on technical specifications of unified
DVD format for PC ROM and home theater applications that's said to
combine best features of rival systems.  While agreement on
technical specs appeared to give green light to start
labor-intensive effort of designing final components for late-1996
launch, patent and licensing issues hadn't been addressed.  Philips
Key Modules Pres. Jan Oosterveld, company's key negotiator in
unification talks, said no fewer than 9 working groups had been
formed to hash out remaining administrative issues.  He refused to
project how long effort might take other than to say it would have
to be finished before products can be launched in 1996.

     Main specifications are same as those reported 3 months ago
when warring parties announced preliminary pact on unified standard
(CMR Sept 18 p1).  Basic disc is adapted from SD proposal for
bonded 5" media composed of 2 layers, each 0.6 mm thick.  Data
capacity is 4.7 gigabytes per side, using "RS-PC" error correction
system from SD proposal, "8-16" modulation system from MMCD
proposal.  System operates at average data transfer rate of 4.69
mbps.  Of 11 main technical points that comprise basic system,
Oosterveld said unified format draws equally from MMCD and SD
proposals.

     Unified system adopts Dolby AC-3 as mandatory choice in NTSC
countries for DVD digital audio, with MPEG audio as option. 
Reverse is true in PAL and SECAM markets.  Oosterveld said decision
using 2 digital audio systems in world heeds suggestions by movie
industry to adopt pattern consistent with disparity in TV standards
as means of controlling international distribution of home video
repertoire for copyright purposes.

     As for DVD name, briefing documents obtained by our affiliated
newsletter Audio Week said that while DVD is "formal name" of
unified format, "it is not meant to be an abbreviation for
anything, though in the past it stood for digital videodisc." 
Negotiators said "we believe the 'V' can also stand for
'versatile.'"  Documents said 9 companies "will now undertake
discussions in an effort to develop a patent licensing system." 
Companies listed are Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Philips,
Pioneer, Sony, Time Warner, Toshiba.  Roster didn't include
Thomson, which was described as having "worked closely on DVD
development" and "has expressed a desire to join the discussion."

     "From today on," statement said, "the companies supporting DVD
will propose and promote a wide range of applications for the
format.  They will continue to develop the technology and work to
position DVD optical discs as the ideal storage medium for the age
of multimedia."  Companies said they plan soon to announce logo for
use on all DVD movie players and ROM drives.  Oosterveld said
"competition" period officially has begun, meaning no formatwide
promotional booth is planned at Consumer Electronics Show or other
trade events.

     DVD "core" developers -- Philips, Sony, Matsushita and Toshiba
-- are expected to form joint corporation to administer DVD
patents.  Secondary tier of companies laying claim to inventions
incorporated into unified DVD standard would join patent pool. 
Toshiba sources in Tokyo told us Thomson had resisted proposal,
expressing preference to enforce own optical disc licenses. 
However, same sources said later that Thomson had tempered its
opposition to pool system in bid to project united industry front
in promoting DVD awareness before late-1996 launch.

     Negotiators tiptoed around questions on DVD video copy
protection, and briefing papers suggested only that variety of
"options are possible."  Sakon Nagasaki, dir. of Matsushita DVD
Promotion Office, told Tokyo news conference that he expects
adoption of Copy Generation Management System (CGMS), now being
developed by numerous companies.  He said CGMS would form basis of
legislation in U.S. based on proposal being negotiated by hardware
companies and movie industry.

     Copyright holders warned that unless protection issue is
settled, they won't put material on DVD.  "Our excitement for the
DVD format continues to grow," MCA Home Video Pres. Louis Feola
said.  "However, in the event there is not an encryption mechanism
that prevents all forms of copying, whether digital to digital or
digital to analog, we will in all likelihood not be supporting the
format," he told us.  He said acceptable DVD encryption system
"must be applied to all forms of hardware, including computers."

     In separate development, Thomson signed "multiproduct" OEM
deal with unnamed Japanese manufacturer covering "digital and
video" products, including DVD players that can be sold in U.S. as
low as $500 starting late in 1996, Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. 
Thomson is expected to identify Japanese partner at Las Vegas news
conference set for eve of this week's Consumer Electronics Show.

     DVD technology already is advancing.  Sanyo said it developed
new laser pickup capable of reading DVDs and conventional CDs. 
Dual-use red laser pickup, which will have output power of 5 mw,
will be built using DVD wavelength of 635 nanometers, one of 2
wavelengths specified in unified DVD format announced Dec. 8. 
Unlike existing dual-focus pickups requiring use of 2 lenses, Sanyo
device uses LCD shutter system to change characteristic of laser
needed for specific types of disc.  Sanyo said LCD method makes for
smaller and more reliable pickup.  Sample shipments will start in
March, Sanyo said.

DSS PRICING FOLLOWING CE ROUTE -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300 -- or even less -- consistent with traditional
consumer electronics pattern.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  To combat falling prices,
some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and Sony DSS products
that promise 20-25% profit margins but slower sales.  Overall, 1995
unit sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected to
surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,
who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits are
made on service.  Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar
hasn't released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba
and Uniden enter DSS this year, with Uniden already indicating it
may price product at $499-$549.  In addition to DSS, Alphastar and
Echostar plan to introduce own services, latter partnering with
Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  Even Primestar,
which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, has tested sales
through TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece recently broke
below suggested list price in Wiz ad at $648.

     DSS installation charge also has dropped in some markets to
$99 vs. $150 range when product was introduced in 1994.  Signs are
that pricing trends will gather momentum as market and number of
suppliers expands.  Two recent entrants provide examples:  Uniden
and AlphaStar.  Uniden will ship 2 DSS products by mid-1996 at
$499-$549, Exec. OEM Vp Hide Kanakubo said.  AlphaStar will launch
medium-power satellite service late in first quarter with product
at $600-$700 and sales limited to distributors and direct
marketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein said.

     Uniden systems will sell in packages that include integrated
receiver decoder (IRD), 18" dish, low-noise blocker (LNB), remote
control.  Production is expected to begin in April, deliveries in
May, Kanakubo said.  Uniden has said it was considering hybrid
product compatible with C-band system as well as possibly building
IRD into other CE products.  First 2 models will be standalone
units, Kanakubo said.

     With Thomson's low-end RCA DSS product already appearing
advertised at $499, Uniden will have to hit lower retails, Kanakubo
said.  "The expectation at retail is that Uniden will be priced
lower than RCA or Sony," he said.  Lower prices could cross $400
barrier in 1996, industry observers said.  To differentiate itself
in market that also is expected to include Toshiba by mid-1996,
Uniden will sell products through satellite distributors and CE
retailers, Kanakubo said.

     Companies are taking variety of approaches to avoid dealing
with margin-slashing consumer electronics market.  Alphastar is
avoiding retail channel, relying on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors and multilevel marketing.  Company will sell single
IRD with 30" dish and remote control to satellite dealers through
distributor O'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway and
multilevel marketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming will
be sold in packages at $24-$49, with some consisting of 40 video
and 30 audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la carte
channels will retail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, 16 PPV channels at
$2.99 per movie.

     Full 120-channel service, to be available within 2-3 weeks of
launch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. 
IRD contains RS-232 port to connect to PC to download data services
as well as gain access to Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD also
will use MPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.

     Tightly focused marketing is key to AlphaStar's approach,
Klippenstein said.  "We're targeting specific customer bases rather
than going with a mass market approach that requires huge inputs of
advertising, media, and consumer electronics distribution," he
said.  Giveaway DSS systems are almost inevitable, Klippenstein
said.  "I would think that for this product the equipment would
pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost of
attracting a subscriber," he said.  "When that happens it makes
sense to give the box away because the long-term value is in the
subscription and the ongoing revenue that comes from that
subscription."

FATALITIES THREATENED IN CHINA PIRACY WAR

     Sums involved in hardware and software piracy are spurring
threats of physical harm in China, where illegal videogame console
total rivals legal units in U.S.

     War of words over piracy is threatening to turn into real
thing, as videogame cartridge and console and CD-ROM software
contraband markets explode.  "The gray market is our biggest
competitor worldwide," said executive with one leading videogame
company.

     China is leading violator on both CD-ROM and videogame fronts
-- but Eastern Europe is working hard to catch up.  There are 297
CD and CD-ROM plants in world, of which 30 are in China, and
pirated copies represent 59% of China's CD market, according to
London-based International Federation of Phonographic Industry
(IFPI).  Relatively new area for piracy is Bulgaria, with 4 CD
production lines in 3 plants.  Until Sept. 6, when 2 long-standing
European copyright conventions came into effect in Bulgaria, there
was no protection for foreign recordings, so all 3 plants were
producing unauthorized copies.  That situation is beginning to
change, copyright activists report. 

     One sign of intensity of struggles was recent temporary
shutdown of IFPI's Guangzhou, China, office.  "We've heard through
somebody that contract killers have been employed," said IFPI
Communications Dir. Catrin Hughes.  Leads were "pretty solid," she
said.  "It's not the sort of thing you take a chance on."  IFPI
offices in Beijing and Shanghai remain open, and Canton office will
go back on line as soon as threat is resolved, she said.  This
isn't first time IFPI has had to shut down office -- in recent
years, threats forced temporary closures in Thailand and Taiwan. 
"We reopened in Taiwan, and now we've cleaned up the market,"
Hughes said.

     While CD-ROM piracy snares spotlight, black market videogame
cartridge activity is soaring.  Almost nonissue as recently as
1988, cartridge piracy is costing publishers at least $1-$1.5
billion annually, said Nintendo of America (NOA) Gen. Counsel Lynn
Hvalsoe.  Aggressive legal efforts have stunted counterfeit sales
in U.S., but unlawful products are rampant in Asia and Latin
America, she said.  At close to 20 million, total number of illegal
Nintendo Super Entertainment System (SNES) consoles in China equals
installed base in U.S.  Estimates of total number of counterfeit
Nintendo cartridges sold in China come to 100 million units or
more, she said.

     CD-ROM and game cartridge pirate situations are fundamentally
different because of media used by 2 formats.  For one, while China
is producer of pirate CD-ROM product, it's primarily consumer of
counterfeit videogames.  There are almost 300 CD-ROM plants
worldwide, but just 12 can produce high-density read-only memory
chips used in videogame cartridges.  Most of those are in Japan, S.
Korea, Taiwan.

     Sophisticated pirates don't just duplicate games, they
reproduce artwork as well, Hvalsoe said.  Difference between
legitimate and pirate box often is little more than lighter
contrast on illegal copy, and sometimes fake name.  That makes
antipiracy activities in developed and undeveloped countries far
more difficult, she said.

     "They copy both trademarked and copyrighted material," Hvalsoe
said.  Getting data out of cartridges is relatively easy;  all it
takes is fairly inexpensive E-PROM or ROM reader.  Nintendo invests
significant amounts of time and money encrypting its games to make
life more difficult for pirates, but such strategies don't work
against determined assault.  "We do have some pretty sophisticated
copy protection," she said, but "we know that no matter how
sophisticated our copy protection is, the pirates will find a way
to get around it."

     There are numerous ways to detect even well-made pirate
product, Hvalsoe said:  (1) Print quality, since even good boxes
are simply copies of old ones.  (2) Product quality, because
pirates often use glue rather than screws to hold game cartridges
together.  (3) Company names, since many suppliers put false names
even on realistic artwork.  (4) Price, since counterfeit cartridges
usually are priced far below legitimate ones.

     Going after chipmakers themselves isn't easy.  Although plants
are few, strategies for disguising chips are many.  Intensive
detective activities are required to ferret out where illegal
copies were made.  Taking action against chip manufacturers also is
difficult.  "We've not had success in Korea or Taiwan suing
people," Hvalsoe said.  So Nintendo is taking advantage of Lanham
Act, which allows companies to sue offshore manufacturers in U.S.
courts if their products are being used illegally.  Most major chip
producers have significant activity and assets in U.S., so actions
taken here can have significant impact overseas, she said.

     Pricing is another defensive strategy.  In China, Nintendo is
selling product "at a significantly reduced value," Hvalsoe said,
with cartridges selling for 50% or more off U.S. price and with
many games going for just $20-$30.  Yet illegitimate games still
win price competition.  In China, taking legal action just doesn't
seem to work, she said.  "When someone's selling hundreds of
thousands of games, they might fine them $100," she said.

     Latin America is another hotbed of pirate sales, Hvalsoe said. 
"We've seen a tremendous amount of activity in Panama and also
Paraguay," she said.  Company is mounting intensive antipiracy
education campaign aimed at Latin American Customs officials. 
Nintendo also is pushing for aggressive legal action against Latin
American pirates.  Hundreds of thousands of cartridges were seized
recently in Panamanian Free Trade Zone.

     Living up to its reputation as intensely litigious company,
Nintendo has several hundred suits pending worldwide, Hvalsoe said. 
Company is working with International Intellectual Property
Alliance and other organizations to try to beat back tide of
unlawful product.  Most successful efforts seem to be in U.S.,
where game piracy seems virtually dormant.

     Even antipiracy action can have twist in China.  China
Foundation for Consumer Protection has created prize to encourage
consumer action against bootleg goods, and recently awarded 5,000
yuan ($600) to Wang Hai.  But award was very controversial, since
many felt Wang was unfairly exploiting China's Law on Protection of
Consumers' Rights and Interests.  That law requires that stores
compensate customers for twice the value of fake products returned. 
Wang was accused of knowingly purchasing fake products and
returning them for double-price refund.

STANDARDIZED TELCO AND CABLE WIRING COMING

     Compatibility between wires used by telcos and cable operators
should be on way soon, thanks to new FCC proceeding.  Commission
launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home wiring rules
between telcos and cable.  Rulemaking will deal with demarcation
between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage and
quality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE),
division of state and federal responsibilities.

     FCC Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous
competitive advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make
cable CPE market as competitive as telephone equipment market.

     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point would
be appropriate, acknowledging it might be different for
single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'
broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage and
signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should have
to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcos
have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatory
distinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring as
telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-home
broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divide
regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,
states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation of
telephony and video programming.

     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should have
same rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customers
have.  It said it believes that it may be appropriate to deregulate
cable equipment rates after market becomes competitive and after
transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether Commission
has authority to deregulate equipment rates.

     Commission rejected petitions for reconsideration filed by
Nynex and others asking to move demarcation point between
customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple dwelling
units.  Comr. Chong said demarcation point, currently 12" outside
subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to competitors, so it
reduces likelihood of competition.  Agency did set rulemaking to
determine whether persons other than individual subscribers should
be able to buy wiring in some circumstances.

16-BIT GAMES HOLD SHARE AMID 64-BIT BATTLES

     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold on
to major market share even in 1996 as manufacturers wage war of
words, titles and marketing dollars over high-powered new
technology.

     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William
(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64
would severely limit performance of system overall and was like
"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."

     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. Vp
Peter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo system to move
information from one part of machine to another.  Some portions of
Nintendo machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that will
limit system performance.  Main and Nintendo engineers say it
won't.  What's clear is that 64-bit battles definitely will end up
dominating media coverage and high-end videogame scene -- but
perhaps not dollar volume.

     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April
21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potential
launch dates in May-Aug. range.  Some observers are betting on
spring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in L.A. 
If that's to be case, Nintendo will have to resort to some fast ad
footwork.  In visit last week to company's Redmond, Wash., hq, we
were told that no ads had been placed in game fan periodicals, even
though deadlines were drawing near.  Another sign that Ultra may
come later rather than sooner:  Despite flying half-dozen
journalists to Redmond, Nintendo could show only Ultra 64
videotape, not game itself.

     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogame
industry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great year
of confusion," Main said.  One big challenge is that primary
audience -- boys 8-12 years old -- is becoming more choosy than
ever and willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge in
performance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-olds
acting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," Main said.  That
has resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo;  software sales
have been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, Virtual
Boy, is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" in
U.S. and Japan.

     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winner
determined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  He
pointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and good
software product.  "Even while other software is selling at at best
60% to 70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of
110% to 120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit market
caught Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market by
surprise is the fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Main
predicted 16-bit strength would continue to lesser degree through
1996.  "At this time next year, [16-bit] is going to represent 35%
to 40% of the videogame market," he said.

     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame market
isn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market would
be down 5% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total decline will be
10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at $3.8-$3.9 billion. 
Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3 of that, he said. 
Market share of 16-bit games has declined to 66% of total sales in
1995 from 77% last year.  Hand-held market share also slumped, down
to 15-16% this year from 25% last year.  That still represents
significant volume.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold," Main
said.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."

     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,
account for fraction of total market, 19%, Main said.  He estimated
that fewer than one million 32-bit consoles would be sold.  Of that
number, Sony's Playstation accounted for 400,000-500,000, Sega's
Saturn 200,000, 3DO 150,000 and with Atari's Jaguar and other
devices accounting for rest.  By contrast, 16-bit Super Nintendo
Entertainment system sold 2.4 million, he said.  Virtual Boy's
sales were far under expectations, Main admitted:  "It's been a
long year for Virtual Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playing
units have sold far under expectations, "we are not finished with
Virtual Boy," Main said.

     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S., 250,000 in
Japan, he said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface of
its unique capabilities, Main said.  In Japan, "they are planning
to relaunch the product in February," he said, with similar
relaunch in U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It's going
to have another round."

     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROM
videogames.  Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefit
manufacturers, not consumers, Main said.  When it comes to adding
bulk memory capacity to Ultra 64, Nintendo will stick with
recordable magnetic disc that company has already announced, he
said.  Disc will move at 8 times CD-ROM speed, he said.  Position
may leave Nintendo vulnerable when DVD hits market, since competing
M-2 and Sony Playstation systems reportedly will be able to play
back DVD discs with relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are that
Ultra 64, with its proprietary magnetic discs, won't have that
capability.

FORMAT WARS LOOM OVER DVD MUSIC CAPABILITIES

     Software and hardware companies are moving to carve out slices
of potentially vast DVD music market.  It looks as though format
war that was avoided over video DVD will erupt on sound side.

     Several entities are exploring DVD music potential -- or
battling for different sound formats.  Engineering Committee of
Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA) has formed task force to
investigate applications of high-density music discs, Exec. Vp
David Leibowitz said.  Sony is showing hush-hush technology called
Direct Stream Digital (DSD) that will form backbone of its proposal
for adapting DVD disc for ultra-high-fidelity music applications. 
And Pioneer and Philips are touting their own DVD music solutions.

     Sony claimed DSD will deliver frequency response up to 100 kHz
and dynamic range better than 120dB, on ground that any new music
proposal will have to represent "quantum leap" in sonic performance
from existing CD if it's to succeed.  Sony executives are
describing system as "radical departure" from linear PCM technology
used in existing CD system.  Beauty of DSD, they said, is that
system is "scalable" for variety of future archival or digital
delivery applications.

     DVD discs will hold 100 min. of 2-channel stereo music, Sony
Software Dir.-Sound Technology Mktg. David Kawakami said.  He said
DSD also can be adapted easily for multichannel music-only
applications.  He said Sony is confident 4.7-Gb DVD would be
capable of holding at least 74 min. of multichannel music, same
capacity as existing audio CD.

     Sony DSD proposal already has drawn sharp attacks.  DSD also
is likely to face competition from other proponents such as Philips
and Pioneer, which are developing their own systems.  Little is
known about Philips' PCM-based proposal, which is believed to carry
working name OmniDisc, and puts strong emphasis on multichannel
capabilities.  Pioneer had been floating proposal within SD
Alliance for 2-stage DVD music application, touting 24-bit, 96-kHz
oversampling.

     DSD wasn't only source of DVD music battles.  Dolby Labs
predictably welcomed word that unified DVD format includes AC-3
audio as mandatory standard for NTSC markets and optional system
for PAL and SECAM countries.  But usually staid and conservative
licensor also took opportunity to remove gloves and attack Philips
for week-earlier claims that MPEG audio is "superior" to AC-3 in
sound quality and future upgradability.  In criticizing Philips
claims, Dolby Vp Edward Schummer was referring to report quoting
Philips spokeswoman as saying MPEG has been found to have better
sound quality than AC-3 in comparative listening tests her company
has run.  She also said MPEG audio has future upgradability for
7.1-channel surround.

     Because MPEG multichannel audio decoder chips aren't "readily
available," Dolby said in report, "it is assumed" that consumer
hardware would be based at start on 2-channel devices.  Two-step
strategy of introducing DVD audio as "stereo today, multichannel
tomorrow" means that "limitations" of MPEG audio "can remain
largely unknown until some time in the future, long after the
decision [adopting system for DVD] has been made," Dolby said.

     Choosing DVD audio standard for unified specs once had been
described as "minor issue" when former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and
Super Density (SD) alliances announced preliminary truce agreement
3 months ago.  However, debate between adopting MMCD-supported MPEG
audio and SD-endorsed AC-3 system appears to have gone down to
wire, reportedly because Philips -- in breaking with Sony -- had
been lobbying heavily, to no avail, for worldwide adoption of MPEG
as mandatory DVD sound system.

     While Dolby was depicting AC-3 as winner in DVD derby, real
loser was DTS, which had ridden Matsushita's coattails and won
designation from now-moot SD Alliance as optional DVD sound system
in NTSC markets along with mandatory choice of AC-3.

HOTELS AND AIRLINES EMERGING AS VIDEOGAME MARKETS

     Systems that allow consumers to play videogames in hotel rooms
and while they're flying are beginning to achieve significant
market penetration.

     At least 200,000 hotel rooms are equipped with game play
capability for Nintendo products alone, said Nintendo of America
(NOA) Engineering Dir. Russel Braun.  Penetration is fairly
significant, since there are about 1.6 million hotel rooms in U.S.,
of which only about 800,000 are in facilities upscale enough to
want to provide gaming service.  "Real discount chains won't want
to add amenities like this," he said.

     Airlines have lot further to go.  About 35,000 seats have game
capability, Braun said, on such airlines as Cathay Pacific,
Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, China Air. 
One reason for slower progress:  Cost.  Expense of installing
system comes to about $1.5 million per plane, and weight is equal
to that of 4 passengers.  But payoff can be dramatic -- Cathay
calculated that if it gets just 2 more passengers per plane,
additional revenues will come to $1 million.

     On airplanes, each seat has own screen, mounted using flexible
shaft.  Besides videogames, screens can carry movies and public
service announcements.  Consumer reception so far seems strong,
with one caveat:  Seatmates sometimes object to language used by
struggling game players.

     Instead of selling game services directly to hotels, Nintendo
works through distributors of pay-TV systems.  "They put it in the
hotel and they manage it," Braun said.  Game systems will work only
in hotels with pay-TV systems;  when such systems are installed,
it's possible to get game play technology up and running for only
$35-$50 per room.  That's because system is centralized -- each
room has only game controller, with single main unit handling game
play activity.

     Relatively small game system can handle fairly large hotel,
since in average hotel of 100 rooms only about 20 TV sets will be
on.  Current record for continuous hotel game play:  12 hours at
one stretch.  Bill for play was reportedly far more than bill for
stay, but customer reportedly paid without whimper. 

     Hotels don't pay for installation, pay-TV distributors do. 
Hotels then get 10% of game revenue.  Consumers can select any one
of 10 videogames and pay $4.95 per hour.  Selection can be changed
relatively easily, but switch requires in-person visit by cable
operator.  Most popular Nintendo game is Super Mario World.  Vast
majority of hotel rooms are in U.S., but providers are staging
aggressive push for other countries.  U.K. opened up last month; 
plans are to enter Japan in Jan., with Brazil on list for 1996 as
well.

TOUGH TIMES FOR BIG RETAILERS

     By and large, few retailers cheered holiday season, but stores
that specialized in broader product lines seemed to face most
difficult struggles.  Some chains are trying to make comebacks from
the near dead.  Others are battling to avoid extinction themselves.

     Biggest victim of rough retail era is K mart, which staved off
immediate threat of bankruptcy in late Dec. after reaching
agreement with creditors and eliminating common stock dividend. 
Creditors agreed to delay payments on $548 million in real estate
bonds.  Original terms called for K mart to pay sum back
immediately if its bond rating were cut to junk-bond level. 
Moody's has downgraded K mart senior debt to notch above junk bond. 
Retailer also eliminated 12 cents-per-share quarterly dividend that
could result in saving $220 million yearly.

     Tandy's Incredible Universe (IU) and Computer City (CC) are
expected to post losses this year.  Board authorized buyback of up
to 5 million shares in bid to ward off shareholder discontent
following collapse of stock to $37 from $64.  Tandy has battled to
improve operations of 2 of its chains, CC and IU, latter projected
by analysts to lose $11 million this year.  Stock buyback bid is
Tandy's 2nd following 12.5-million-share program in 1994.

     Another operation trying to make it back from brink is 47th
St. Photo.  Fresh from purchase by Tuttnauer, 47th St. Photo said
it's is planning possible public stock offering to open 2 new
stores in 1996.  N.Y.C. retailer, which will seek listing on
Nasdaq, will use money to open 15,000-sq.-ft. stores in Lower
Manhattan and Long Island, said Tut Services Pres.-CEO Stuart Held,
whose firm is holding company for 47th St.

     Stores would be first that 47th St. Photo has opened since
filing for bankruptcy in 1992.  Since then, chain, which once had
$300 million annual sales, closed 3 stores, including namesake on
47th St., but maintained 45th St. location.

     Plans include boost in PC market presence and catalog sales,
executives said.  47th St. will ship 6 catalogs in 1996 targeting
niches within photography and CE, Held said.  Mail order accounts
for 20% of sales, although plans are to expand it to 30-35%, he
said.  Held projected sales of $50-$60 million in 1996.  Company
also will boost presence in PCs, which represent 28-30% of sales. 
Held said:  "PCs have been ignored up until now because it took so
much money to go into that area, but now that we're starting to
settle our finances we will become aggressive again."

     Still another retailer expanding after trying time is Tops
Appliance City.  Tops, which has battled to bring finances into
line, said it has selected site in Brooklyn to open 60,000-sq.-ft.
store and will shift to full commission for sales staff in early
1996.  Brooklyn store would be N.J. chain's 9th.  Chain also has
sought to boost home office business, adding new fixtures in some
outlets to increase assortment of PC software and peripherals. 
Tops gradually has boosted amount of PC software its stores carry
since 1994 when it moved to 100 titles from 25.

     Experiencing relatively smooth growth is Tower Records, which
just expanded into Canada, opening 22,500-sq.-ft. store in Toronto. 
Store is stocked with 100,000 music CDs, 10,000 videos, laserdiscs
and CD-ROM titles, 14,000 books.  Tower operates 150 stores in 12
countries.

3-D DVD 'WALKMAN'

     A leading manufacturer of virtual reality glasses, Virtual iO,
is working with Matsushita to develop standard interconnections for
DVD portables to be used with eyegear displays for viewing movies
and other programs on the go, including 3D.

     "We're doing some work with DVD," said Linden Rhoads, pres.
and co-founder of Virtual iO, Seattle.  Company's glasses weigh
less than 1 lb. and display images on 0.7" LCD screens about 1"
from viewer's eyes.  Image is surprisingly clear, but also reveals
flaws, with pixels relatively visible.

     Since first shipments 7 months ago, Virtual has sold 40,000
pairs of glasses priced at $799, said Rhoads, who said company
projects sales of "several hundred thousand" in 1996, based on
expectation that cable networks will offer 3D shows next year. 
Video/DVD version of glasses at start will sell for $599, she said,
with prices going "down to $299 over the next couple of years," but
$199 and $99 probably aren't within reach because of costs.

     Rhoads said Virtual is working with Matsushita, which probably
will distribute its glasses in Japan.  Primary goal is to create
uniform plug that will carry audio, video and power over same line. 
As things stand, users would need separate battery pack to power
players and headgear.  Negotiations should result in "simple and
elegant" connector that does whole job with one cable, she said.

     Virtual iO glasses provide rough equivalent of NTSC quality. 
Recent deal with Planar Systems, Rhoads said, will let company make
leap from LCD displays to electroluminescent (EL) technology.  LCD
displays are limited effectively to 60,000 pixels, but EL displays
can make possible 350,000-pixel screen that should be available in
mid-1996, offering full Virtual Graphics Array (VGA) quality
resolution, with 500,000-pixel model on market in about year.

     Virtual iO's investors include TCI, Thomson CSF and Logitech,
Rhoads said, and company has exclusive deal to provide Sony with
virtual reality (VR) glasses for PlayStation, to be shipped in 1996
first quarter, she said.  Glasses will provide full 3D effect for
special 3D games.  Game glasses will feature "head tracking,"
turning images as user turns head, up, down or sideways.

     "Cybersickness" isn't issue, Rhoads said, referring to flaw
that has plagued all 3D video systems in past -- including
dizziness, nausea, headache.  But even some Virtual staffers say
they have experienced twinges with more intense VR games.  Another
potential health hazard -- walking into traffic while wearing
headgear -- won't be problem, she said.  Glasses have see-through
screens, and users are expected to use them while seated in buses,
at home or waiting in line.

     Besides working with CE companies, Virtual is negotiating with
voice recognition supplier, Rhoads said, on system allowing users
to control glasses with words rather than reaching for switch or
control.  When SVGA glasses go on market, she said, they could make
laptop PC screens obsolete.

     Low-cost, blue wavelength solid state lasers will be
mass-market item within 2 years, said Japanese chemical
manufacturer Nichia, based in Tokushima.  Nichia said it has
developed short wavelength blue-violet semiconductor laser stable
at room temperature.  Blue lasers will make it possible to increase
density of data stored on CD-ROMs and other optical media.  Device
also could be used for projection systems.  One potential
challenge:  Fitting short-wavelength technology into longer
wavelength lasers required under new DVD standard.  Gallium nitride
laser has wavelength of 410 nanometers, compared with 635 and 650
designated for laser diodes in unified DVD specs finalized Dec. 8. 
Company said it hopes to start mass production within 2 years, with
DVD as prime application.

     Recognizing weakness of MPEG-1 as consumer product (CMR Oct 30
p1), Philips said it's consolidating CD-I sales and marketing
functions in Washington and shifting focus away from "traditional
retail."  Strategy will be to sell through "small retailers and
alternative types of distribution," including direct marketing,
said Philips N. America CD-I Mktg. Vp Gail Wellington.  Philips
Professional Media Pres. John Gray will head new operation in
Washington, not yet named, while Philips Media keeps office in
L.A., she said.  New plans don't involve leaving consumer market,
although Wellington conceded company "probably won't be as active
with national advertising."  Philips will continue direct marketing
to current CD-I owners, expanding it to offer software from
publishers other than Philips Media.  New avenues include
CD-I-based Internet browser that will be available in U.S. in 6-9
months.  Browser, introduced in PAL version in U.K. in Sept., is
modem and software combination that includes 14.4 kbps modem that
plugs into CD-I player.  CD-I disc has communications software and
browser.

GERMAN AUTHORITIES DENY FORCING COMPUSERVE BAN

German authorities say that CompuServe decided on its own last
week to bar its 4 million subscribers worldwide from accessing
some 200 sexually explicit Internet newsgroups.

In addition, German prosecutors said that they never explicitly
threatened CompuServe with criminal action.

The denials follow CompuServe's announcement last Thursday that
it had blocked access systemwide to the newsgroups in question
"in response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor's office in
Germany."

In its statement, CompuServe said: "Each of the newsgroups that
was suspended was specifically identified to CompuServe by the
German authorities as illegal under German criminal law."

Munich senior public prosecutor Manfred Wick said Tuesday his
office did not provide CompuServe with any such list as part of
its investigation of child pornography on the Internet. He also
said prosecutors did not threaten CompuServe with criminal
charges.

"We did not make any stipulations. It was the decision of
CompuServe alone," he told The Associated Press.

However, Wick released a statement Wednesday saying police asked
CompuServe to "scrutinize" a list of more than 200 newsgroups
last month.

"The decision on whether and to what extent the groups on the
list would be blocked was left to CompuServe," the statement
said.

"The newsgroups were specifically identified by German
officials," said a CompuServe spokeswoman in Columbus, OH. She
added that CompuServe's legal department was in talks with
prosecutors "and that is something that is going to have to be
hashed out."

As for the threat of legal action, the spokeswoman said: "We got
some information from (German prosecutors) that there was a real
possibility of arrest if we didn't comply."

Wick said German state police will release their findings by mid-
February as to what material available on computer networks can
be considered criminal and what effect that can have on online
services.

He said German authorities consider online services legally
responsible for information found on their networks, even if the
information comes from outside the networks--as is the case with
Internet newsgroups.

WESTINGHOUSE RAISES ANOTHER $3 BILLION TO PAY FOR CBS

Westinghouse Electric Corp., raising cash to help pay for its
$5.4 billion acquisition of CBS, says it has sold its defense
and electronic systems businesses to Northrop Grumman Corp. for
$3 billion.

Northrop Grumman will take on another $600 million in pension
liabilities in the deal.

Westinghouse said that broadcasting will now account for 45% of
its approximately $10 billion in sales and almost two-thirds of
its earnings.

Westinghouse earlier agreed to sell its Knoll Group office
furniture business for about $565 million.

The company said proceeds from the sales will enable it to pay
down more than 65% of its CBS debt.

The sale is expected to close during the first quarter following
normal government reviews, the company said.

Westinghouse also makes refrigeration equipment, nuclear energy
systems and power generators. It also operates government and
electronic systems businesses.

Wall Street was pleased with the price Northrop paid--
Westinghouse closed up $1.25 at $18.375 in Wednesday trading.

AT&T BACKING OFF PROPRIETARY ONLINE TECHNOLOGY

AT&T has signaled that it may move away from the proprietary
software it developed for its online services in favor of
technology that has made the Internet's World Wide Web
accessible to millions.

In a press release Tuesday announcing the elimination of 40,000
jobs, AT&T said it plans to modify "several of the company's
online services to Internet-based technical platforms and modify
some of its messaging services, which will require writing down
the value of some proprietary software and hardware."

AT&T operates the Interchange Online Network, a traditional
online service, PersonalLink, a messaging system, and the
ImagiNation game network. All require use of proprietary client
software.

Interchange boss Michael Kolowich did not return a telephone
call seeking comment, but a source close to the operation said
Interchange will be "moving toward a more open standard." AT&T's
press release did not indicate how long it would take to make
any changes.

The source said the job cuts will not affect the 300 employees
at AT&T New Media Services in Cambridge, MA, where Interchange
is based.

AT&T, which purchased Interchange in December 1994 from Ziff
Communications, integrated the Netscape browser software into
the service in October. While Interchange can be accessed
directly from the Internet, users still must use the Interchange
software.

Meanwhile, Gartner Group, a technology advisory firm in
Stamford, CT, that provides information on the Interchange
network, said it will introduce a Web site for its @vantage
service, which offers insights on technology. Gartner said the
site will begin operation in the second quarter.

Asked if the Web site would undercut the Interchange network,
Gartner spokeswoman Kate Berg said there "is a potential
situation...but the center of gravity is the Internet."

AT&T's Interchange offers access to various online newspapers,
including the Washington Post's Digital Ink, the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis and the New Haven, CT Journal Register, as well as Z-
D Interactive and the AT&T Business Network.

AMERITECH DISPUTES TIME WARNER STATEMENT

Ameritech says it disputes a Time Warner statement that
negotiations between the two companies about offering competing
local telephone services in Ohio have been unsuccessful.

The Baby Bell said Time Warner's real motive may be a negative
publicity campaign, perhaps to delay finalization of Ameritech's
cable TV franchise agreement in Columbus.

Last week, Time Warner, stepping up its efforts to enter the
local phone service business, asked state regulators in Ohio to
intervene in its negotiations with Ameritech on plans to offer a
competing local service.

Time Warner said that Ameritech was either unable or unwilling
to reach an agreement to provide connections on calls from Time
Warner's proposed network. The two companies began talks in
December 1994.

In a statement, Ameritech said the negotiations have actually
produced substantive agreements on many technical and economic
issues but that new issues and demands raised by Time Warner
have delayed finalization of a complete agreement.

"The combination of Time Warner raising new issues at the
bargaining table, publicly complaining to the PUCO (Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio), and conducting a media blitz
seems to be a tactic to create negative publicity and may be an
attempt to stall finalization of our cable TV franchise
agreement in Columbus," said James C. Smith, Ameritech Ohio VP.

"They seem more intent on delaying competition in the cable TV
market than negotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can
provide local telephone service."

Ameritech said it wants to resume negotiations and resolve the
latest set of issues raised by Time Warner. Ameritech said it
believes that a final interconnection agreement can be reached
on all remaining issues.

DOW JONES SERVICE OFFERS ACCESS TO NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLES

Subscribers to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval business information
service can now access full-text archives of The New York Times
for the most recent 90-day period.

North American customers can also tap into collections of Times
articles organized by topic, dating back to 1981.

Dow Jones subscribers outside North America will be able to
access the full archives dating back to 1980. Both North
American and overseas customers will have access to abstracts of
articles dating back to 1969.

For many years, Lexis/Nexis, then owned by Mead Data Central,
had exclusive access to archive stories from The Times. Upon the
sale of Mead to Reed Elsevier in October 1994 for $1.5 billion,
the long-term contract was renegotiated, allowing The Times to
sell those rights to others.

PEOPLE: MONEY MAGAZINE FIRES DAN DORFMAN

Money magazine says it has fired financial columnist and TV
commentator Dan Dorfman because he refused to tell its managing
editor who his sources were.

Dorfman has been on a paid leave of absence from the Time Inc.
publication since October when a Business Week magazine report
said federal authorities were investigating his relationship
with a frequent source of tips as part of an insider-trading
probe.

Money managing editor Frank Lalli said in a statement that
Dorfman was fired Monday.

"The serious issues raised about Dorfman and his sources
convinced me that I had to know his sources for his Money
columns," Lalli said. "I needed that information to maintain my
confidence in the quality of the information we publish. Dorfman
declined to tell me who his sources were."

Dorfman had been hired by Money in late 1994 and began writing
his columns in January 1995. He is widely known for his regular
reports on CNBC and previously as a columnist for USA Today.

CNBC, which continued to air Dorfman's regular reports after he
was put on leave by Money, said it was standing by him.

"We believe that a presumption of guilt coupled with a blanket
request for all sources could have a chilling effect on the
ability of journalists to do their jobs and protect the public
interest," the cable channel said in a statement.

It added it had no reason to believe Dorfman had violated any
law or failed to adhere to the standards of the company.

"Under these circumstances, CNBC has no reason to follow Money
magazine's approach in demanding that Mr. Dorfman disclose the
identify of all his sources," it said.

In a story on the firing that aired after Dorfman's scheduled
segment Wednesday, CNBC quoted Dorfman as saying that Time Inc.
had made demands on him that "no responsible reporter can
accept," requiring him to disclose the names of every
confidential source for every story that had appeared in the 10
columns that he wrote for Money.

He also noted that he was not asked for the identity of his
sources before the columns were published. He added that he has
asked his attorney to begin arbitration proceedings.

Dorfman, who had reportedly been signed to a six-figure contract
with Money, has previously denied any wrongdoing.

PEOPLE: DISNEY HIRES PREMIERE MAGAZINE EDITOR AS VP

Walt Disney Co., seeking to focus more attention on writers and
publishers in New York, says it has hired Premiere magazine
founder Susan Lyne as an executive VP at its motion picture
group.

Lyne, 45, who has been Premiere's editor-in-chief since the
title's founding in 1987, will be the studio's most senior
creative executive in New York.

She will be in charge of the acquisition of books, screenplays
and stage plays, and the development of intellectual material
and new opportunities.

"This is an entirely new position created to take advantage of
Disney's expanded reach," said Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group
chairman Joe Roth.

Lyne led Premiere under a number of different owners, playing an
important role in the sale of the magazine in May to a joint
venture of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines and Ron Perelman's New
World Communications Group.

It had been owned since 1991 by K-III Communications Corp.

Hachette Filipacchi Magazines said that Christopher Connelly,
one of Lyne's lieutenants at Premiere, will become its new
editor.

IT'S HERE! IBM FORMALLY ANNOUNCES SATCONNECT SERVICE

IBM has finally announced the official existence of
its IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to the
chagrin of the other satellite network operators who
are keeping a somewhat discrete silence over the
whole affair.

After many months of waiting and broken internal
deadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of the
new service to become officially released.  Many
software revisions and internal quality assurance
certifications contributed towards the internal
delays.  Many observers who have seen the system
believe that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.

The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK.

Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s can
be attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The
"general availability" date is slated for 30
September 1993.  Countries will be free to set their
own dates.

Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 to
the power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.
Error correction significantly reduces this
occupance.

IN SatConnect is designed to be operated
independently of other telecommunications networks,
although it can be linked with the existing IBM
Information Network services like the IBM Information
Exchange EDI service to collect data. With the
system, the information provider will link into IBM's
network to transmit data for distribution. Receive
sites will use conventional VSAT hardware combined
with IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSAT
receivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centre
of the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.

Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,
and advanced data masking technology has been
included to provide integrity for transmitted data.
As the system is digitally-based, video, audio and
data can be merged and transmitted securely.

Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at a
set time even though it has been loaded by the
information provider onto the transmission system in
advance. Real time data throughput will be supported
on the system during 1994 once a second release of
software is made during December 1993.  IBM is
presently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"
who wish to send large files to multiple locations
rather than the continuous small-file feed companies.

Real time feeds are considered an important business
area and they will be approached once a steady stream
of customers has been found.

The information provider is charged for connection to
the SatConnect service. There is an initial charge of
GBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for the
transfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use is
charged according to a tariff.  Receive sites cost
GBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual charge
thereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,
existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40
percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costs
down significantly in the process.

IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. to
market and distribute its satellite receiver
equipment.  Although IBM is not making the use of
Comstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing the
potential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstream
equipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-
IBM product" and will feature in all promotional and
sales literature.

The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellite
broadcast receiver and LNB are provided under the
marketing agreement.

One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth can
be changed "over the air" in accordance with users'
needs.  The DBR401 receiver will have four pre-
selected data rates programmed as standard reducing
the requirement for field maintenance.

Data sent to the receiving PS/2 computer can
immediately be routed to a LAN server or mainframe if
required, thus freeing local receiver resources and
permitting the prompt processing of data.

* Minimum system requirements for the PS/2 receiver
are: MCA-based bus; 20MHz clock speed; 8MB RAM; slot
for IN card; RS-232 port; OS/2 version 1.3 standard
edition or OS/2 version 2.0

FIRST UNION EXPANDS DATA NETWORK

First Union Corporation, a Charlotte, NJ, USA-based
commercial company has extended its contract with GTE
Spacenet to continue the provision of a Skystar VSAT
network.  The new contract, valid for five years,
will see over 300 new terminals brought on-stream
taking the network capacity to around 1100.

The company is using the additional terminals to
connect new locations in the Maryland, Washington DC
and Virginia areas.

"The Skystar network provides the speed and
reliability our branches need to provide our
customers with the best possible service.   The
network has also helped facilitate our growth through
mergers and acquisitions because we are able to get
new sites on-line quickly and to continue to deliver
the highest quality of customer service possible
throughout the First Union system," said George
Mattingly, senior vice president and director of
telecommunications at First Union.

"Our VSAT network has survived two hurricanes and an
ambitious expansion program while providing
significant cost savings compared to terrestrial
alternatives."

A spokesman for GTE Spacenet said that First Union is
one of its most demanding customers and attempts to
satisfy their requirements has in turn germinated
other benefits for Skystar customers generally.

In 1988 First Union became the first bank in the US
to use high-speed satellite-based communications in
its branch banking network.  The network supports
branch automation and transaction processing of ATMS,
video broadcasts and training systems.

First Union awarded GTE its "Supplier of the Year"
award recently out of over 18,000 suppliers in
recognition of the service, says
the company.

COMSTREAM KIT HEADS EAST FOR SHANGHAI SE

The Shanghai Stock Exchange has signed a contract
with Comstream Corp for two parallel 1000 site
satellite networks to broadcast digital data and
audio to SSE member brokers.

Under the massive contract, the Shanghai Scientific
and Technical Development Company will conduct
installation and operation of the network.  Eight

Comstream DBR401 digital data receivers and ABR200
digital audio receivers will be installed at broker
offices throughout China, and the network will
transmit real time stock information and prices while
the audio circuit will carry profiles of traded
companies, analysis of stock trading and business
news. In the downtime, 'background' music will be
broadcast.

The Shanghai Metals Exchange has also signed a
contract with Comstream for the provision of a much
smaller network.  Under the SME contract, 52
locations will be connected to the network by the end
of July.

The data networks will operate at 19.2kbit/s with
full redundancy and diversity as standard.

WHAT IS A VSAT SAYS US DEPT. OF COMMERCE

After being asked "What is a VSAT?" by the US
Department of Commerce as part of an investigation
into alleged trading misdemeanours, Satellite
Technology Management is holding consultations to
resolve technical questions raised over the
exportability of a STM designed and built
telecommunications system in Iran.

The Department of Commerce has classified a VSAT
system to be a commercial communications network
eligible for export to Iran without prior US
government approval, but the Commerce Department has
investigated recent shipments made by STN to Iran,
and agents raided offices seizing papers (DBN
passim).

STM points out that Iran currently has two US-built
VSAT systems in operation, with the largest network
provided by Hughes Network Systems for the
Telecommunications Company of Iran.  STM has supplied
the second, smaller network to the Iranian national
broadcasting organisation to demonstrate VSAT
applications to commercial entities such as the
Central Bank of Iran.

Following on from the demonstration, STM is now
battling against AT&T, GTE and Hughes to win the
lucrative contract conservatively valued at US$15
million.

A VSAT system ordered in December 1992 by Iran
Electronic Industries (IEI) under a US$1.4 million
contract is presently held at US docks after shipment
was stopped by customs officials.  The system was
destined for use within a shared hub using Intelsat-
leased transponder segment.

The problem now facing STM is to prove exactly what a
VSAT is, and confirm to Department of Commerce
officials that there is nothing untoward about the
shipment that could contravene US technology export
restrictions.

EURO VSAT MARKET SET TO RISE--REPORT

CIT Research's annual Satellite Communications in
Europe report for 1993 has just been released, and it
forecasts that the total market for satellite
business services will be almost ECU1.2 billion by
2002, with the facilities management of two-way VSAT
networks and services accounting for 24 percent of
revenues.

The rise in takeup for VSAT services will rise with
the market developing in many diverse ways.  VSAT
services are likely to be used foremost in the UK,
Germany and France -- countries noted for their
'awareness' to VSAT operators' needs -- and by 2001
there would be an estimated 19,000 one-way VSAT
terminals installed and around 15,000 two-way VSAT
terminals.   This number still pales into
insignificance when compared to North America or the
Far East.

CIT says that during 1992, as in 1991, Germany was
the largest market for VSAT services with the
presence of four network operators, and Italy
continues to be experiencing steady, firm growth. The
UK's market has consolidated following the sale of
British Aerospace Communications, and the often lack
lustre performance of its own incumbent operators.

HUGHES LAUNCH VOICE VSAT PRODUCT AT AT93

Hughes Network Systems has launched a new VSAT
product designed to provide small, remote business
locations with a high-grade data and voice
communications service at a lower price than
comparable systems.  The launch was made at the
recent Asia Telecom show in Singapore.

The new PhoneLINK single channel telephony system is
a by-product of HNS' Telephony Earth Station -- a
product designed to offer full mesh connectivity and
toll quality voice transmissions without a network
hub -- and PhoneLINK will draw heavily on TES'
construction.

PhoneLINK can be connected into a TES network, and
provides point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
communications using Demand Assigned Multiple Access
(DAMA) and voice activation to minimise recurring
satellite usage charges.

Paul Gaske, HNS vice president for international
satellite networks, said; "PhoneLINK builds on the
tremendous acceptance of the Telephony Earth Station
for remote satellite telecommunications.  With the
new technology, industries worldwide can gain
affordable basic phone and data service to their
remote locations."

COVENTRY SET TO BE TELETEXT CAPITAL OF WORLD?

Continuous research work at the Coventry University
may be keeping the idea and concept of teletext in
the public eye.

W J Overington of the Coventry University's
Management Division, has already published a series
of papers on teletext formats and telesoftware, and
it was much of his pioneering work which led to the
system and standard being implemented in the United
Kingdom.

A new system, known as Telescontext, has now been
proposed which could lead to audio subcarrier
broadcasts being used in conjunction with teletext-
like transmissions.  A discussion and proposal paper
was released to members of the UK academic community
late in May.

The system relies upon broadcasters manually
synchronising the start of audio with the start of a
teletext multipage sequence, such as a demonstration
or advertisement.  It could also be used to provide
on-screen representation of a live event, such as
sports results or elections.  Using telescontext
would enable the user to access a lot more
information while listening to a continuous audio
feed.

One of the key differences of Telescontext against
standard teletext is that the audio can be totally
separate from the television broadcast.  A lot of the
preparatory work has been based around satellite
transmissions because of the availability of audio
subcarriers, but the process could equally be used on
a terrestrial system using either broadcast offsets
of pseudo-digital transmissions.

"I recently caught the end of a television news item
about using teletext to send out live reports of the
live chess championship matches.  It has occurred to
me that if such a teletext feed could be supplied to
an Astra broadcaster that has teletext, a live sound
commentary could be provided as well using an audio
subcarrier channel.  Indeed if two or more audio
subcarrier channels were used, the live commentary
could be in several languages such as Eurosport does
with cycling and other sports, each of four
commentators speaking in one language on a separate
audio subcarrier."

Polycom, has been granted a service contract by
Marconi, the Portugese Telecom satellite services
operator, to install and manage ten VSAT stations for
the new economic data service of LUSA, the Portugese
press agency.  By the end of 1994 the network is set
to expand up to over 150 locations.

The European Space Agency has held the first
ESA/European Centre for Space Law meeting and
workshop on intellectual property rights in outer
space on May 26.  IPR in outer space is a legal area
which will gather importance in the near future
because of the increased amount of space exploration
flights and subsequent masses of data.

A virus has been carried over the Channel Videodat
teletext VBI data service in Germany. The "Tremor"
virus attached itself to PKUNZIP, a PC compression
program and version 104 of Mcfee's Anti-Virus
software -- a package which cannot detect Tremor.
Around 60,000 people have signed up for Videodat
services, but it is unknown how any people have been
infected.

Countrywide Communications says that it decided not
to re-pitch for the BT Visual and Broadcast Services'
massive PR account despite having good relations with
the client and conducting business for other business
units involved with satellite.  After a four-way
pitch the account, worth a rumoured GBP75-100,000, went
to Infopress in London.  Meanwhile sources say that
BT is close to landing a new business television
customer, its first in a long time, for a yet unnamed
client.

Reuters America Inc. and Variety Inc. have formed a
new newswire aimed at covering the international
entertainment industry.  The service will be relayed
by satellite and existing terrestrial circuits
initially in North America, although the service will
be rolled out into Europe and the Asia Pacific
regions in the future it is understood.

Scientific Atlanta has introduced a new receiver-
decoder that can handle up to 20 compressed video
signals over a 45mbit/s trunk line. Although the new
D9700 unit is being aimed at cable companies, it will
be able to handle video and data.  IDB Communications
has already signed a contract with SA for use within
its Russian distribution system.

In a separate move, Mainstream Data has announced a
Microsoft Windows version of its Mainstream Newscast
PC front end system, and the first user demonstration
was held at Windows World in Atlanta, USA at the end
of May.   A new MAC product, known as MACWIRE, has
also been launched to filter news carried over the
network. It will be premiered at NEXPO in New Orleans
on 14 June.

Reports say that the rooftop to rooftop satellite
link between the Press Association offices in London,
UK and Polycom in Paris, France is working well.  Two
1.8 metre dishes at the PA are linked to a 3.7 metre
terminal in Paris for data transfer.

Polycom says that it is still on schedule for the
implementation of its two-way VSAT service (Ku and C
band) in Europe by February 1994.  Agence France
Presse is reportedly to be the first customer with a
30 terminal network.

Sources at Channel Four Television in the UK suggest
that a subsidiary company -- Channel Four
Communications -- is considering the launch of a
Usenet by terrestrial data broadcasting feed in the
future.

Maxat is reportedly signing up two customers in
readiness for its two-way VSAT venture with Hughes
Network Systems, as exclusively revealed in DBN
recently.

VSAT IN EUROPE -- REPORT

Delegates attending the VSAT '93 conference in London
recently heard that even with a lot of European
Commission assistance and patronage, European
businesses are failing to maximise the full potential
of satellite communications services for pan-European
trading.

Hans Schoof, of the DGXIII satellite services section
of the European Commission said that the EC would
continue to act in its bid to see a free and level
trading market, particularly in the fraught satellite
services sector.

"There is a general lack of user awareness of
satellite services and European telecommunications
manufacturers are not very willing to take risks and
use VSAT networks," said Schoof, pointing out that
there is a very fragmented and unconsolidated
marketing structure for European satellite
communications.

A generally-poor fixed-line telecommunications
infrastructure in Eastern and Central Europe has seen
a growth in demand by emerging businesses for VSAT
services, with banks and news agencies being the
initial primary users of VSAT services.  In Germany
VSATs were popular after the reunification of East
and West Germany, and were extensively employed by
'West' German companies to link-up offices in the new
'Eastern Lands.'

Jon Collins, the outspoken and well-respected
managing director of AT&T Tridom Europe, pointed out
that there have been a lot of positive developments
in the marketplace over the past five years, and that
demand will continue to rise.

"The tremendous possibilities in central and Eastern
Europe are clear, and it is significant that in
Germany new legislation specifically encouraged the
use of satellite networks to overcome the problems of
limited infrastructure."

There will always be a place for terrestrial
telecommunications infrastructure, and companies such
as AT&T Tridom readily realise and accept this. "VSAT
is not going to replace all of a company's network.
It will be driven by certain applications.  It needs
to be case and cost-justified.  I am not forecasting
explosive growth [for VSAT], but I am genuinely
optimistic that we have finally turned the corner in
the European VSAT market," said Collins.

Chris Bell, head of Unisource Satellite Services
(USS), formerly known as Vesatel, believes that
Eastern European and CIS countries will act as an
important driver for new VSAT systems orders, even
though the average 'terminals per network' ratio will
be lower.

According to Bell, VSATs provide an ideal network
infrastructure for establishing a full range of
telecommunications services in areas with poorly
developed or unreliable communications, such as the
developing countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
But Europe has a long way to go before satellite
networks are as  successful as those operated in the
United States.

"A VSAT network can be installed within weeks and at
a relatively low cost. Eastern Europe and Central
Europe are almost without exception faced with poor
telecomms," said Bell.

Many industry commentators have often noted that
smaller VSAT networks are not economically viable,
and at times network operators have failed to
understand the economics of providing comparatively-
smaller VSAT networks.

In Western countries 150-300 terminal networks are
often the norm, but in areas with a poor
telecommunications infrastructure, a 20-50 terminal
location or even a dedicated point-to-point satellite
communications link can prove to be economically
viable, especially where economic regeneration and
exports are concerned.

Delegates and speakers at the conference agreed that
further moves in deregulation were an essential and
good thing, and that greater emphasis should be
placed on integrated, pan-European network in the
future.

Spot Color


For many magazines, it's too much of
a good thing.

By John Johanek

At one time or another we've all been
exposed to the effects of that deadly
combination of bad taste and too much
money. You know -- that house up the
road with just a few too many
turrets, the evening gown laden with
sequins and rhinestones, or maybe
it's that magazine you subscribe to
with its garish color.

Whether publishers feel they're
getting their money's worth or
(sadly) whether they actually believe
this reflects good design, many
magazines don't seem to know where to
draw the line when it comes to color.

Some publications have a natural
curbing device -- budgets. Depending
on the arrangement you have with your
printer, color costs typically
parallel usage. And magazines that
keep an eye on such excesses will
naturally tighten the purse strings
on rampant color, forcing the
designer to be more selective about
its application.

But, for those without such built-in
constraints, the need for critical
color sensibilities becomes
paramount. Here are some simple
guidelines.

Don't Let Spot Color Upstage Four
Color

When a magazine has the benefit of
glorious photography or top-notch
illustration, designers should let
those elements be the stars.
Frequently, the images will benefit
 that remain solid black. Trying to
tie in a color from the image onto
the larger type will likely cause the
type to compete with the image (or
images) for importance.

If you need to give type more
importance on the page, try other
options like making the type larger
or designing it into a higher
position on the page. In some cases,
making the type bolder will also
work.

Be Selective About Spot Color

If you must use color in a layout,
limit the application. Find a place
you want the reader to go first, then
put that item in color. Instead of
doing an entire headline in color,
highlight just one key word. This
will also let readers determine the
content of the story more quickly.
Drop caps are another popular
candidate for color. When using them,
you'll be more successful when the
headline is short and large. That way
the drop cap can still play a
secondary role in the design even
though it's in color.

Sometimes the best use of spot color
is something as incidental as a band
or rule that will bring the reader's
eye to the part of the page or spread
where you've placed important text,
like a subhead or pull quote. The
important thing to remember is that
color will attract attention when
used sparingly. Be sure there's
something worth seeing when you draw
the reader to a point on the page.

Use Solid Versions with Tints

When tinting sidebars or screening
large type, it's wise to also use the
tint color in full strength somewhere
on the page. Tints alone can often
smack of weak print quality, but when
that color is also a solid, there's
no question about the intent of the
 This approach works well for sidebars
that have a screen covering the box
while the border and headline are
printed in a solid. Another variation
is to print the sidebar box as a
solid color, then knock the type out
of the solid. When doing this, go
back into the headline and make it a
10 or 20 percent tint of the box.
It's best to limit this treatment to
short sidebars. No one will want to
read a large mass of knock-out type.

Avoid Critical Registration

Don't expect too much from your
printer. Printing small type or fine
rules is difficult to keep in
register. If you elect to print a
fine box rule in color, limit it to
one of the base colors like magenta
or cyan. Boxes are especially
difficult because they require both
horizontal and vertical registration.
Likewise, typography -- even large
type -- will challenge the most
skilled printer when the final color
calls for tint combinations to align
on especially thin diagonal strokes
or delicate serifs.

 . . .MORE. . .


Use Appropriate Color

Some designers tend to select colors
in a void, ignoring the underlying
message certain colors (or
combinations) convey. Just as red and
green will surely conjure up images
of Christmas, other colors project
moods and reflect attitudes. Wise
designers will work this to their
advantage, using blood red to infer
terror or a cool blue to suggest
winter.

More importantly, be careful that the
color you've selected isn't sending
out an inappropriate signal to the
reader. Businesslike subjects call
for reserved colors. If your
editorial content needs to be taken
 use serious colors when you want the
message to be playful.

Using color effectively walks the
reader through stories in much the
same way as images and type do -- the
big blast comes at the beginning of
the story and gradually tapers off as
it progresses. Color may, in fact,
drop off to nothing by the end of the
story. This not only allows the next
new feature to have more impact, but
also lets readers unwind as they move
through a story.

Smart designers will also use color
to unify the pages of a story or
several stories as a section. A
distinctive color on each spread of a
story will serve to unite them. This
is even more effective when the color
appears similarly throughout the
pages, such as in the type or band of
an overline that's in the same
position on each spread, or as the
tint color on all sidebars, or when
all pull quotes are the same color.
On sections, bands that bleed in from
the top of each page or color icons
on the opener of each story can pull
the stories together.

Use a Little Gray Matter

For magazines limited to black and a
second color, don't overlook the
value of combining the color with
gray tints. Adding a touch of gray to
a tint of red will change it from
pink to mauve. Gray working with a
screen of yellow can create a rather
unique and pleasing putty color --
just right for a sidebar. Various
combinations of gray and cyan can
result in rich, businesslike tones.
Not only will this avoid the monotony
of repetitive color, it's also a way
to take the edge off raw, harsh
colors.

Avoid Flooding Color

Perhaps the biggest abuse of color is
 give them the appearance of colored
paper stock. Rare is the situation
that warrants this treatment. Quite
simply, avoid it until you feel
you've mastered the craft of
designing with color.

Color is the designer's best friend
when used correctly. In the wrong
hands, however, it can be your
readers' worst nightmare.

The Status of Print


Are printed magazines a dying breed?
Are electronic magazines the wave of
the future . . . or, perhaps, even of
the present?

By Jack Powers

Every page delivered on disk, on-
line, or on demand is a page that is
no longer produced on press. As new
media grows, old media shrinks and
adapts to a changing communications
environment.

 --What is the future of print in the
Information Age?
 --How will it evolve to meet rising
expectations and changing demands?
 --Will batch printing be replaced by
customized, on-demand xerography?
 --And what will happen to all those
professionals who make their livings
crafting paper pages?

Here are some thoughts on the status
of today's print media:


New computing, communications and
imaging technologies have automated
most of the print production
business. Word processing, desktop
publishing, computer graphics,
electronic photography and digital
imaging have eliminated most prepress
jobs. Laser-to-plate systems, digital
printing presses, color laser
printers and in-line finishing
equipment are pushing automation into
the pressroom and bindery. Publishers
are living most of the production
manager's dream of workflow "from
brain to mouse to press," and it's
easier than ever before to make more
print.

Nobody Wants More Print

Except for the people who sell paper
and ink, nobody in the developed
world wants more print, more
"information" dumped on our desks
every morning that we never get a
chance to read, more magazines piling
up on the floor awaiting recycling
day, more catalogs that go directly
from the mail box to the trash.
What we need -- what publishers are
striving to create -- is better
print, more effective publication,
and these days that might mean
ink-on-paper, toner-on-paper or
pixels-on-screen. Instead of a single
pressrun of a million impressions,
buyers are asking for ten pressruns
of a hundred-thousand each and many
are shooting for a hundred-thousand
pressruns of ten impressions each.

Printing Belongs to the Industrial
Age

Conventional printing (along with
broadcast television) typifies the
batch manufacturing approach of the
Industrial Revolution: a single
standardized product produced in vast
quantities with terrific economies of
scale and constantly improving
process efficiencies.
 processing nirvana in which every
cylinder of every press is churning
out perfect pages 24 hours a day, 7
days a week for a single customer, a
house account, who pays -- every
Friday -- in cash. New technologies
like desktop publishing, image
processing and digital prepress have
dramatically improved the efficiency
of batch printing and at the same
time made smaller batches more
affordable.

Interactive Media Belongs to the
Information Age

Advances in computing, communications
and imaging technologies improve the
targeting of publications. On the
creative side, electronic design and
production tools make more
customized, more timely and more
economical page forms. On the
distribution side, new media formats
make the delivery of the publication
better, faster and cheaper. Smart
publishers in every industry segment
are crafting a new generation of
interactive publications that tune
themselves uniquely to the needs of
the "Audience of One." (Some printers
are expanding into new media
services, some of which make money.)

The Costs of Conventional Paper-based
Publishing are Rising

Print is getting more expensive and
losing its competitive edge to
alternative media.

 --Paper costs are rising rapidly and
may never return to their historical
lows since demand from the developing
world is increasing and pressure from
environmental groups opposed to paper
mills is strong worldwide.
 --Distribution costs (including
postage) are based on constantly
increasing labor and energy costs and
will never get any cheaper.
 --Out-of-date information costs,
which don't show up on many
 publishers in all segments.

The Expectations of Readers are also
Rising

Now that nearly every literate person
has used a computer, a revolution of
rising expectations is sweeping the
publishing markets. These new
expectations cover both the editorial
and the commercial aspects of
publication.

 --Readers expect faster turnaround
to compete with electronic media.
 --They prefer the searchability of
interactive products to the dead
weight of paper.
 --They like the superior
illustration opportunities of
multimedia.
 --They expect to pay-per-view for
the information they need rather than
subscribe to pages they may never
use.

There are Three Kinds of Publishers
and Three Kinds of Publications.

Defined by their environments and
their audiences, publishing
operations fall into three broad
classes:

 --Commercial publishers print for
profit and produce newspapers,
magazines, books and other products
which generally carry a price tag.
 --Corporate publishers create pages
for advertising, marketing, corporate
communications, technical
documentation and collateral material
that they usually give away for free.
 --Government publishers in federal,
state and local divisions generate
mountains of legislative, regulatory
and judicial documents that are paid
for by our tax money.

Defined by their intended use, most
publications do predominantly one of
three things, although most pages
contain all three in varying
  --Inform readers with breaking news,
analysis, reference data,
specifications, prices and other
facts.
 --Entertain audiences with stories,
novels, poems, jokes, gossip and
other forms of narrative.
 --Persuade prospects with
advertising spiels, marketing
communications, sales notices and
promotional material.

reactions to Jack's characterization
of the status of print? In what ways
are your publishing activities

delivery environment? Let Editors

Make an Original Sound

    
Writing that causes readers to stop
in their tracks.

By Peter P. Jacobi

We've addressed the subject of
detail, the power thereof.

We've also discussed the issue of
show vs. tell: that to show means to
bring the reader close to place or
person or situation.

In each case, the writer is using the
right information, concrete
information, and attaching to it just
the right words in just the right
combinations.

It's writing that makes a reader stop
in his tracks.

It's writing that opens a world in
her mind.

 sound in the world, it makes a
thousand echoes." That's what detail
is, at least potentially: an original
sound. It's what showing does.

You are There

Robert Mads Anderson is, according to
the records, the first person to have
made a solo climb to the highest
mountain on every continent.
Recently, for USAir Magazine, he
adapted a chapter from his book,
Summits: Climbing the Seven Summits
Solo, this particular chapter dealing
with a harrowing effort to reach
Antarctica's highest peak.

"The ice was blue and crisp," he
writes, "my ice tools barely
penetrating the surface. The air
temperature, steady at 40 below zero
Celsius, froze my breath into
crystals that floated onto the ice.
The air froze into the back of my
throat and seemed to be dripping
icicles into my lungs."

I'm there, or at least I can begin to
understand what it's like.

It reminded me of a very different
place and situation, as described by
Jean Fritz, the children's book
writer, in her autobiography. "Who
would know by looking at a map what
the Yangtse River really was?" she
asks. And then she answers:

"Orange-brown, muddy mustard-colored.
And wide, wide, wide. With a river
smell that was old and came all the
way up from the bottom. Sometimes old
women knelt on the riverbank, begging
the River God to return a son or
grandson who may have drowned. They
would wail and beat the earth to make
the River God pay attention, but I
knew how busy the River God must be.
All those people on the Yangtse
River! Coolies hauling water. Women
washing clothes. Houseboats swarming
with old people and young, chickens
 they could see where they were going.
I loved the Yangtse River, but, of
course, I belonged on the other side
of the world. In America with my
grandmother.

"'Twenty-five fluffy little yellow
chicks hatched from our eggs today,'
my grandmother wrote.

"I wrote my grandmother that I had
watched a Chinese magician swallow
three yards of fire."

I'm there, or at least I can begin to
understand what it's like.

As in the case with Susan Orlean when
she writes for The New Yorker: "The
people who shop at Sunshine Market, a
grocery store in Jackson Heights,
Queens, are thin and beautiful. They
are also fat and plain, relaxed and
frantic, Colombian, Italian, Jewish,
Indian, African-American, Bolivian,
Uruguayan, Vietnamese, young, middle-
aged, elderly, rowdy, meek, cheerful,
world-weary, rich and broke. They buy
health food. They buy Ding Dongs and
Diet Coke. They have just come to
America. They have lived in America,
in Jackson Heights, in the same
apartment, with the same furniture in
the same arrangement, for sixty
years. They are in a big hurry. They
are in no rush and hoping to bump
into their neighbors for a chat. They
are in minks. They are in their
pajamas, wearing stacks of hair
curlers and no makeup. They are
buying the works for a dinner party.
They are buying a Lean Cuisine
Chicken Fettucini to eat alone." And
so forth.

Yes, I'm there, or at least I can
begin to understand what it's like.

These writers are doing their job.
They are linking a reader to their
own experiences.

 . . .MORE. . .


James Kilpatrick, that always lucid
commentator on writing, has said: "We
must look intently, and hear
intently, and taste intently. . .we
must look at everything very hard. Is
it the task at hand to describe a
snowfall? Very well. We begin by
observing that the snow is white. Is
it as white as bond paper? White as
whipped cream? Is the snow daisy
white, or egg-white, or whitewash
white? Let us look very hard. We will
see that snow comes in different
textures. The light snow that looks
like powdered sugar is not the heavy
snow that clings like wet cotton.
When we write matter-of-factly that
last night it snowed and this morning
the fields were white, we have not
looked intently."

Such intensity comes from a curious
and gripping direction in a passage
written by Brenda Miller, this for an
essay in The Georgia Review. "I have
never been touched by someone blind,"
she writes, "but I can imagine what
it would be like. She would read me
like Braille, her fingertips hovering
on the raised points of my flesh,
then peel back the sheets of my skin,
lay one finger on my quivering heart.
We could beat like that, two
hummingbirds, and become very still.
Her hands might move across my
abdomen, flick the scar below my
belly button. My eyelids would
flutter at her touch, and my skin
dissolve into hot streams of tears."

Richard Rhodes in How to Write speaks
of writing as "a craft that cuts
windows through the terrifying
opacity of the world." Brenda
Miller's words do that.

So does David Stout when, for The New
York Times, he expresses a complex
feeling this way: "So much has been
written about the joy of hunting and
so little about the sadness, the
sadness that fills the silence after
 hunting. "I was not squeamish, say,
about slitting the belly of a freshly
killed rabbit and dumping the
steaming guts onto the damp leaves on
a chill November day. But I cannot
forget the day when I was 13 and shot
at a big rusty fox squirrel three
times before it came tumbling down
from the trees, bounding off limbs as
it fell, then trying to crawl away.

"And this hunter who would not remain
a hunter grabbed the animal by its
tail, dragging it to a clearing to
finish it off with the gun butt. Then
he stood still in the dusk, listening
to a chain saw in the distance and
waiting for his sadness to go away.
He has been waiting for 40 years."

Intense. Penetrating. I am at one.
I'd be at one even if I felt
differently about such activity.

I return to the word "understanding."
Stout makes me understand.

As does Neil de Grasse Tyson in a
very different way. His recent
article, "When Galaxies Collide," for
Natural History, warns of such
universal events. They're happening
even as I write, even as you read.
Horrors. Fears. But then he tells me:
"During the cosmic acrobatics,
individual stars easily pass by each
other through interstellar space
because galaxies are mostly empty, in
spite of how packed they look. For
example, if there were just four
snails running loose in the
continental United States for a
billion years, then two of them would
be more likely to accidentally bump
into each other than would two stars
during a galactic collision."

I can breathe easier.

Give-my-all Writing

Much closer to home, George Dismukes,
an independent filmmaker, reflects on
"What it's like to live in prison,"
for Newsweek. "At day's end we were
returned to our night cells," he
says. "Night is when the morons and
neurotics holler and shake their
bars, when the fanatics cry out
entreaties to their God. One can
shout obscenities at the neighbors
with impunity. Those who would like
to sleep are not permitted to have
earplugs.

"The jail," he continues, "also
offers the pleasures of solitary
confinement. That's where I am right
now, in lockdown. One day they came
and brought me here, without
explanation. After the bedlam of
where I had been, the quiet was a
blessing, for I like to read and
exercise my mind by filling yellow
legal pads with introspection. That's
me; solitary is tougher on those with
little education or sense of
contemplation. On the wall of my cell
are graffiti left by former
residents. One welcomes the newcomer
to hell, others speak of the horrors
of aloneness. I realize how fortunate
I am that for me silence holds no
terror."

This is give-my-all writing.

It is what Annie Dillard calls for in
The Writing Life when she says: "One
of the few things I know about
writing is this: spend it all, shoot
it, play it, lose it, all, right
away, every time. . . .The impulse to
save something good for a better
place later is the signal to spend it
now. Something more will arise for
later, something better."

Tips for Writing to Government
Employees.

   
Understanding the needs and
idiosyncrasies of a "unique culture"
-- that of the U.S. government -- has
made one publication something of an
authority on covering computer news
for governmental employees.

Government Computer News, a biweekly
that has won eight Computer Press
Association awards and consistently
outdistances its competitors in
readership, targets the buyers and
users of computers in government.
Chief editor Tom Temin let's us in on
some of his publication's trade
secrets:

 --Focus on products, technology.
Although the government buys the
computers covered in GCN, the federal
procurement process is given minimal
coverage in the paper. Instead,
editors take a technical-product
oriented tack with their editorial.
"Research over the years shows
readers are less interested in the
arcane points of procurement than
they are in the computers," says
Temin.

 --Keep readers apprised of what
their colleagues are doing.
Government employees want to know how
their associates are doing in their
own agencies, says Temin.

 --Run product reviews. "We were the
first, and until this year, the only
government publication to have its
own product test facility and to run
every-issue product reviews," says
Temin.

 --Always take the government user's
point-of-view. "We're very parochial
about covering the government,"
remarks Temin. "Even when we do
product coverage -- the same product
everybody's covering -- we don't
cover it unless there's a government
angle to it."  --Patricia Donohue,
assistant editor.

Get Authors' Permission for Reprints
Whether Electronic or Print


Understanding reprint rights under
current copyright law.

By Ellen M. Kozak

A magazine establishes a Web site on
the Internet to familiarize more
people with the magazine, create a
favorable impression of it, and
hopefully increase readership. Each
month they put up a copy of the table
of contents for people to browse and,
in addition, the editors select the
best article in the issue and put it
on the Web site, as well. What's
wrong with this picture?

Another editor is about to publish an
article about the transportation
strikes in Paris. In the article, the
author mentions Jacques Chirac. The
editor adds an editor's note that the
magazine published an article on the
French president last year, and
invites readers to get a copy by
sending an s.a.s.e. Is that
permissible?

A Matter of Copyright/Contract

Both of the examples above boil down
to reprints -- one in print, and the
other electronic. Whether a magazine
has the right to issue either kind of
reprint is a matter of copyright and
contract; both kinds of reprint are
considered publication under the law.

Although electronic rights are
turning out to be a hot area for
copyright lawyers, the answers to
some of the questions that occur seem
fairly clear under current copyright
law. Others, however, are less so --
and may become more complicated as
customary author/publisher agreements
evolve to meet the needs of new
technology.

Writer's Status Determines Writes

What rights a publisher has in
relation to a contributor depend on
the status of the writer. Is the
piece written by a staffer as part of
his or her job? If so, it is legally
classified as a work made for hire,
and you, as publisher, own all the
rights and can publish or distribute
it as you choose.

But pieces written outside the scope
of employment -- for example, a
humorous column written by your copy
editor -- like pieces contributed by
freelancers, are works in which all
rights (including reprint and
electronic rights) originate and
remain with the author.

Exceptions to Rule

There are three exceptions to the
rule that the creator of the work
retains the full copyright. The first
exception is for works made for hire.
To fall into this category, an
article, sketch or photo (all three
are copyrightable) must (1) be
specially ordered and commissioned,
(2) fit into one of nine classes (one
of which is collective works such as
newspapers and magazines), and (3) be
subject to an agreement in writing
signed by both parties stating that
the work is and was always intended
to be made for hire.

The second exception requires an
assignment of rights. An author can
assign all or any portion of the
rights that make up the copyright in
a work but the law requires copyright
assignments to be in writing.

Special Provision in Law

Both of these exceptions obviously
require a contract. If you are not
using a contract with your
contributors, there is a third way
that you acquire at least some
rights. The drafters of the current
U.S. copyright law understood that
many newspapers and magazines do not
habitually use contracts, so they
built in a special section of the law
to address the rights of authors in
their contributions to collective
works. It reads as follows:

"Copyright in each separate
contribution to a collective work is
distinct from copyright in the
collective work as a whole, and vests
initially in the author of the
contribution. In the absence of an
express transfer of the copyright or
of any rights under it, the owner of
copyright in the collective work is
presumed to have acquired only the
privilege of reproducing and
distributing the contribution as part
of that particular collective work,
any revision of that collective work,
and any later collective work in the
same series."

Ambiguity in Section of Law

The first sentence of this section of
the law is pretty clear: copyright --
the right to reproduce a work,
distribute it, display it, perform
it, and create derivative works based
on it -- initially belongs to the
creator of the work.

However, the second sentence,
although it's construction seems to
imply a restrictive reading
("acquired only the privilege
of . . ."), does contain a certain
amount of ambiguity. Just what
constitutes a revision of a
collective work or a later collective
work in the same series? Could either
of these conceivably include an
electronic version?

Get Written Agreement

Until Congress or the courts clarify
this, your best way of making sure
you have acquired the rights you want
is a written agreement. Bear in mind
that supplying reprints, either in
hard copy or on-line -- or
authorizing others, such as UnCover
to do so, may well constitute an
infringement of the author's
copyright. If doing these things is
important to you, get the permission
in writing.

Bear in mind, however, that acquiring
these rights may mean you have to pay
the author a higher fee, or a
royalty, or an annual license fee.
Writers survive economically by
reselling articles to non-competing
markets. The availability of an
article out on the Web cuts down on
its value to other publications.

As for the answers to the questions
at the beginning of this piece -- if
the articles are not works made for
hire or if you haven't obtained all
rights to them, your best course of
action is to obtain the writer's
written permission to distribute or
electronically display the articles.
Putting it into your contract is your
best way to preserve good relations
with a contributor and avoid the
possibility of copyright
infringement.

K-III Holdings Agrees To Acquire Field Publications

K-III Holdings (NY) has signed a definitive agreement with Field
Corp. (Chicago) to acquire the assets of Field Publications and
Funk & Wagnalls for an undisclosed amount. Field Corp. had put
Field Publications on the block in July and recently confirmed that
it was involved in talks with K-III on sale of the company (EM,
Dec. 10, `90). Its investment banker for the transaction is Morgan
Stanley.

The sale, which is expected to be completed early this year, involves
Field's classroom periodicals, including Weekly Reader; book clubs;
supplementary materials for children; and its Funk & Wagnalls
encyclopedia and educational materials publishing unit, acquired in
mid-1988 (EM, June 6, `88). These businesses, which employ about 950
people, have estimated combined sales of more than $300 million. With
the acquisition, K-III, a publishing-oriented investment partnership,
will operate seven publishing and information businesses with 2000
employees and post yearly sales of about $500 million.

According to William F. Reilly, chairman and CEO of K-III, the
acquisition provides a strategic fit with K-III's educational unit,
Newbridge Communications, a direct marketing company specializing
in books clubs and continuity programs for teachers and children.
Newbridge markets to more than 400,000 teachers, and Field's Weekly
Reader and ancillary publications go to more than 8.5 million
elementary students and 700,000 teachers. Field's book clubs and
continuity programs serve the children's book market through the
mail, and F&W publishes a children's encyclopedia marketed through
mass-market supermarket distribution. In terms of product and
management, no major changes are anticipated. Field Publications is
based in Middletown, CT.

Commerce Department Puts Textbook Sales At $4.06 Billion

Shipments of textbooks totalled $4.06 billion in 1990, with sales
almost evenly split between el-hi and college sales, according to
estimates prepared by the U.S. Commerce Department for its annual
publication U.S. Industrial Outlook 1991. For the entire publishing
industry, The Outlook showed shipments totalling $14.5 billion in
1990, a 6.7% increase over 1989. When adjusted for inflation, the
Commerce Department data showed shipments up 2.5% in the year.
A slowing economy which featured minimal growth in personal
consumption expenditures was cited as a leading reason for the
modest sales growth in the year, which fell below Commerce
Department estimates of real growth of 3.6%. Restrained school and
library funding were also named as reasons for the lower than
expected growth.

The Commerce Department also estimated that publishers' profits
were hurt in 1990. While publishers achieved limited economies
through improvements in manufacturing and distribution operations,
these savings were reduced by higher editorial, marketing and
administrative costs, the report said.

Despite a soft economy, the Commerce Department's outlook for 1991
sees publishers benefitting from a more coherent funding pattern
for textbooks, nominal gains in disposable income and from
continued demand for books in the international marketplace. On the
negative side, postal rate increases and higher costs for paper
will put pressure on margins. Commerce sees rising school
enrollment and gains in education funding pushing U.S. book
industry sales to $17.3 billion this year, an increase--adjusted
for price increases--of about 3% from 1990.

For the longer term, Commerce forecasts real growth of about 3.5%.
Growth will be accompanied by moderate cost increases as paper
mills and book printers become more efficient in the manufacture
and printability of recycled and acid-free paper. El-hi enrollments
are projected to rise by 3 million students in the 1990-95 period,
while 10.2 million people are expected to move into the high
income, heavy reading segment, aged 35 to 54 during this span.

Education Publishing Stocks Drop 26.2% In 1990

Stock prices of education publishers fell by 26.2% last year,
compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which declined by
4.4%, according to a round-up of publicly held companies. All
publishers posted declines, and those of all but one, McGraw-Hill,
showed declines in the double-digit category. M-H's stock price
dropped by 7.3% to 52 5/8, compared with 56 3/4 at the end of 1989.

Hardest hit was Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, down by 80.2% to 15/16
from 4 3/4 a year ago. Wall Street is evidently not convinced that
the beleagured company will successfully complete a turnaround. It
was followed by John Wiley, which recorded a drop of 43.4% to 30,
compared with 53 at the end of 1989. Investor Theodore Cross'
recent low key stance regarding Wiley has dampened speculation that
Wiley may soon be put in play.

Waverly similarly recorded a hefty drop of 30% to 17 1/4 from 24
1/2 at the close of 1989, also a victim of diminished speculation.
Following in descending order are Times Mirror, down 25.2% from 35
3/4 to 26 3/4 at the end of 1990; Plenum, down 20.2% from 28 1/2 to
22 3/4; Houghton Mifflin, down 19.8% from 38 7/8 to 24 3/4; and
Paramount, down 19% from 50 1/2 to 40 7/8.

Houghton Mifflin Hopes For Better Growth in `91

Acknowledging that it has failed to achieve its minimum financial
goals of 10% compounded growth in sales and net income for the past
few years--including 1990--Houghton Mifflin said it is hopeful it
will reach that target in 1991. Results in 1990 were hurt by a 20%
increase in developmental costs as well as lower than expected
college revenues.

Speaking at PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference, HM
chief financial officer Stephen Jaeger said both HM's trade &
reference division and school division are expected to show strong
growth in 1991. The school division in particular is expected to
benefit from a host of new developments undertaken in 1990,
including the development of an elementary social studies program
that will be introduced this year. El-hi social studies is a new
segment for HM.

Company margins should benefit from more modest increases in
developmental costs, Jaeger said. Improvements in technology have
been a two-edged sword when it comes to margins, he reported. While
technology has improved publishing efficiency, it has also placed
pressure on marketing and selling costs by causing schools to
expect lots of extras when selling texts.

HM chairman Nader Darehshori also touched on the ancillary
materials issue, observing that the biggest change in marketing he
has seen over the years is the amount of freebies schools have come
to expect. He claimed that HM has one of the smallest
implementation packages in the industry and said the company has no
plans to expand that kit. He added that some competitors could
become so desperate for short term gains that they might increase
the size of the incentive package.

Darehshori also said that HM will continue to increase its
attention on the high school market in order to meet rising
enrollments. During 1990, HM introduced a new English program for
grades 9-12 as well as new editions of its math program. A new
American history textbook is also set for this year.

Adoption opportunities for reading this year are expected to be
broader, and H-M has just started intoducing a new 1991 reading
program called Houghton Mifflin Reading: The Literature Experience,
Dareshori said. He noted that early responses from the market have
been positive, with the program already having been adopted in
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico and Oklahoma.

No Fire Sale At Maxwell Communication Corp.

Though its debt still stands at 1.7 billion pounds, Maxwell Communication
Corp.s' joint managing director Kevin Maxwell told analysts at
PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference that MCC is not in
a fire sale position and will not sell any more operations unless
it can get a full and fair price.

MCC executives sought to put distance between their company and
advertising-dependent companies that have been battered by a slump
in advertising by noting that only 10% of its business relies on
advertising revenue. MCC's businesses also do not rely on the
economic fortune of one nation, executives said. Although about 80%
of MCC's business is headquartered in the U.S., more than 30% of
revenue from those businesses are derived from offshore.
MCC was more forthcoming than McGraw-Hill about its hopes for
taking take its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. public,
saying it hopes to take the venture public by the third quarter of
1991 subject to market conditions. In an earlier presentation, M-H
chairman Joseph Dionne was vague about prospects for taking the
school publisher public. According to the agreement, however,
either party can offer all or some of their own shares in an
offering. MCC seems more eager to take the publisher public than
M-H.

Minority offerings in other MCC companies such as OAG and Pergamon
Press will not be considered until after the offering for M-M-H,
Maxwell said. Those sales will also depend on market conditions.
Maxwell also indicated that all sales would not be solely to raise
money. The recent sale of 20% of Berlitz to a Japanese private
education company to form Berlitz Japan (EM, Nov. 19 `90) helps the
company to tap Japanese students to buy our products, Maxwell said.
Berlitz provides language instruction and translation services.

New M-M-H Activity Series

The Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. has released two
new series of activity books aimed at boosting parental involvement
in elementary mathematics and science education. The two series are
called Helping Your Child At Home . . . With Mathematics and
Helping Your Child At Home . . . With Science, and consist of
activity books for each grade level in K-8 in mathematics and K-6
in science. The books present no-cost activities that can be done
at home to reinforce concepts learned at school and they are
correlated with M-M-H's basal elementary and science textbooks.

William Talkington, vice president of the M-M-H's School Division,
told EM that the two series are being sold directly to schools at
a price of $4.95 per volume-in-the-series. The company is also
offering a single-copy purchase price of $7.95. No plans are being
entertained to sell the series to the retail market, he told EM,
noting that the company is more intent on working with schools and
parents.

Books Strongest Performer For Times Mirror

The short term outlook for Times Mirror is not encouraging,
chairman Robert Erburu told attendees at the recent Outlook for the
Media Conference, adding, however, that he was still optimistic
about long term prospects. Book publishing and cable operations
have been the company's strongest performers in the year, he said.
As part of efforts to cut costs in the year, TM plans in 1991 to
reduce capital spending to less than $300 million and has set
stringent limits on acquisitions.

In the company's professional publishing group, Erburu said that
Matthew Bender and Jeppensen Sanderson finish 1990 with
double-digit gains in both revenues and operating profits. Bender's
18-volume Bender's Federal Tax Service has had strong growth in the
year. Richard D. Irwin was also expected to have finished the year
with double-digit revenue increases led by its basic accounting
texts. Mosby-Year Book and CRC Press are also having record years
with improved margins.

The professional publishing group expects to post total revenues in
1990 of about $750 million, an increase of about 15%, he said. The
outlook for this year is positive, with new introductions
supplementing selective price increases.

Professional publishing revenues for the first three quarters of
1990 were $541.6 million, up from $460.3 million in the like 1989
period. Consumer publishing posted revenues of $227.1 million, up
slightly from $224 million in the earlier period.

Banta Committed To Book Printing

Although commercial printing has overtaken book printing as the
largest segment for Banta Corp., the company remains committed to
both the general and education book markets, executives said at
PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference. Both chairman
Calvin Aurand and senior vice president Gerry Henseler reported
that books remain a significant contributor to Banta, and have
solid margins. In addition, Aurand told the analysts that Banta
would consider making an acquisition primarily in two
areas--hardcover books and soft cover manuals.

Banta's commitment notwithstanding, Aurand said growth in the
production of paperback books for education should be slower in
1991 than in `90. Aurand was hopeful, however, that business in the
general book area would remain strong and he was particularly
optimistic about the prospect for soft cover manuals. The growth of
the computer industry continues to feed the growth of the computer
manuals business, Aurand noted.

Aurand and Henseler were optimistic that Banta will hit its
targeted goals of a 9% growth in revenues and a 13% increase in
profits in 1990. Aurand said Banta was cautiously optimistic about
1991, noting that he is confident revenues will be there, but added
that margins are a concern.

The executives also said that the negotiations for the sale of
Banta Ventures, Banta's video production unit, are continuing with
the management of that operation. Banta said in October it was
planning to divest itself of the video segment to focus on its core
businesses of printing and graphics, a sentiment Aurand reiterated.
And while Aurand acknowledged this is not the easiest time for
management to get money, he said he was still confident a deal with
Banta Ventures management will be completed.

Scholastic's U.K. Unit To Acquire Deutsch Children's Books

Scholastic Inc.'s U.K. subsidiary, Scholastic Publications Ltd.,
has entered an agreement to acquire Andre Deutsch Children's Books,
the children's hardcover publishing unit of Andre Deutsch Ltd. The
acquisition is expected to be completed early in the new year.

The Deutsch unit, with estimated sales of about 1.3 million pounds,
publishes about 50 titles a year, including trade hardcovers and
paperbacks, and has a backlist of more than 500 titles. Acquiring
it will afford Scholastic a rapid expansion of its publishing
program. It would have taken us five years to build up Scholastic's
hardcover list, and this acquisition allows us to get there
immediately, said David Kewley, managing director. The acquisition
will significantly enable us to expand our hardcover and paperback
publishing from the substantial base of the Deutsch hardcover list
and our own Hippo paperback list.

Deutsch staff will join Scholastic on completion of the
acquisition, and its sales force and Gollancz, its distributor,
will continue to sell and distribute the children's list until
mid-year. At that time, Scholastic will move to new offices in
central London that will house all children's book publishing
staff, and its Hippo sales force will take over the Deutsch list.

celebrating 100 years of publishing with a special centennial issue
this month that provides a retrospective of 100 years of teaching
and chronicles landmark events in education during that period. The

Harcourt Brace World acquired it in 1968, and it was sold to Edgell
Communications in 1987 and acquired by Scholastic in mid-1989 (EM,
July 3, `89).

Separately, Scholastic has named David F. Rodriguez to the new post
of national sales director for the education marketing group. He
was formerly education marketing representative, a position being
filled by Nancy A. Farrell, previously account manager with The Ivy
League Network. Rodriguez will be responsible for developing sales
strategy, overseeing sales staff and new business development for
sponsored educational programs. Farrell will oversee development of
sponsored educational programs in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast
regions.

It's Curtain Time For AT&T Interchange


The fat lady finally sang.  AT&T is phasing out its proprietary online
publishing platform AT&T Interchange by the end of 1996, Michael Kolowich,
president of AT&T New Media Services, told EIR (see related story).

Why shut down the online version?  "With this move, we are acknowledging and
capturing industry and customer trends," Kolowich said.  "We are creating open
and inoperable standards," with the Web initiative.

Publishing Partners Jumping Ship

AT&T InterChange never really took hold as a leading electronic publishing
system.  The service literally only had a handful of publishing partners -
five to be exact - ZD Net, Gartner Group, The Star Tribune Online, The
Washington Post/Digital Ink and The Journal Register.

During the last few months, several publishing partners have been turning to
the World Wide Web to publish their information rather than use AT&T
InterChange.  For example, The Star Tribune Online (STO) announced that it
would upgrade its World Wide Web presence.  A STO/Web edition is scheduled for
release in February.  STO is a unit of Cowles Media Company.  SIMBA
Information Inc., publisher of this newsletter, is an affiliate of Cowles.

Gartner Group announced its Web publishing strategy this week (see related
story).

ZD Net, an electronic warehouse of computer product and industry news,
announced its Web site earlier this year.  Digital Ink and Journal Register
Company have yet to state their Web publishing initiatives.

Europe Online, which licensed AT&T Interchange last year, abandoned the online
platform earlier this year in favor of the Web (EIR, Nov.  17, 1995).

Interchangeable Parts

Kolowich said that "there is a tremendous amount of reusable[AT&T Interchange]
components that are applicable to Web use, such as software code and tools."

Where it's appropriate, "some AT&T Interchange publishing partners will
continue to provide their content on BizNet," Kolowich said.  Pieces of AT&T
Interchange's publishing partners content are already available on BizNet.

AT&T New Media Services expects to redeploy its AT&T Interchange development
staff.  AT&T New Media Services has 300 employees.  "None of those 300
employees are part of AT&T's severance package," Kolowich said.  AT&T is
cutting 40,000 jobs over the next three years (see related story).

AT&T Abandons All Online Systems For Web

AT&T is following in the footsteps of many other online services and content
providers and abandoning its other proprietary online systems o ImagiNation
Network, an online games service and PersonaLink, an e-mail service o and will
remodel these services based on World Wide Web standards.

AT&T said that a small portion of a $4 billion after-tax restructuring charge
against fourth quarter earnings would cover its online products being written
off or revalued.

Web Version Of AT&T BizNet By Mid-96


A World Web Web version of AT&T Business Network (BizNet), a newly launched
online service, will debut by mid-1996, said Michael Kolowich, AT&T New Media
Services president.  The company will phase out the online version of the
service.  BizNet, which launched this fall, is an online information service
for business professionals (EIR, Sept.  22, 1995).

BizNet, which has in excess of 10,000 registered users, is "growing rapidly,"
Kolowich said.  Since launch, the company has distributed more than 100,000
trial kits.

"We expect usage to be mushrooming on the Web," Kolowich said.  "What's more
challenging is the content [piece]...there's currently more content than
eyeballs habituated to it [the Web]."

The most usage on BizNet is currently being generated from the Dow Jones and
CNN content components (EIR, Oct.  20, 1995), Kolowich said.  Entrepreneur
toolkits, research tools and daily discussions are also popular, he added.

$10M+ Ad Campaign

As part of BizNet's launch, AT&T is spending in excess of $10 million on its
6-month marketing and advertising campaign that kicked off with various ads in
early December and during this past season's collegiate football bowl games,
Kolowich said.

Gartner Group Follows Other AT&T Interchange IPs To Web


Like other AT&T Interchange content providers including The Star Tribune
Online, Gartner Group plans to offer @vantage, its online market research and
analysis service on information technology on the Internet starting in the
second quarter (EIR, May 12, 1995).

The @vantage Web site, which will be developed independently of AT&T, was
motivated by Gartner's desire to broaden availability of @vantage, said Kate
Berg, company spokesperson.  Berg denied that the mirror site on the Internet
foreshadows a break from its eight-month-long relationship with AT&T
Interchange.

"We have a lot of customers that would be very upset if we moved off
Interchange," said Berg, noting that since launching in May 1995, @vantage is
profitable and has grown steadily to 1,000 users, most of which are Gartner
Group clients.

Gartner charges clients $2,000 and non-clients $4,800 annually to subscribe.
Assuming 60%-85% of the 1,000 @vantage subscribers are clients, @vantage
generated estimated subscription revenues of $2.4 million to $3.1 million by
the end of 1995.

@vantage also takes a small share of transaction revenues from its ten
partners which include BRP Publications, Dataquest, Esther Dyson's Release
1.0, Individual and Pathfinder Research, Jeffrey Tarter's SoftLetter, Amy Wohl
and Workgroup Strategic.

Momentum Picks Up In Business Information Market


The demand for data in new electronic formats and information on new
technologies has pulled the business information market out of its recession,
according to the newly published Business Information Markets 1999:  The
Strategic Outlook (BIM).  SIMBA is the publisher of BIM and this newsletter.

Business information growth rates have risen steadily over the last few years,
from 2.9% in 1991 to 5.1% in 1992 and 5.6% in 1993.  Business information
revenues reached $25.4 billion in 1994, a 9.5% increase from $23.1 billion in
1993.  Revenues are projected to exceed $27 billion in 1995.

BIM defines business information as any copyrighted or proprietary information
produced for a business or professional audience.  The research report
concentrates on 10 business publishing markets and media, including online
databases, print databases, trade magazines and newspapers, face-to-face and
audiovisual services, general business periodicals, research services and
reports, looseleafs, newsletters, CD ROM databases and business books.

Largest Segment By Format - Still Print

As it has in past years, print remains the largest business information
segment by format, with sales of $13.7 billion in 1994.  However, print's
market share continued to slip from 57.0% in 1993 to 54.3% in 1994.

Electronic services accounted for 37% of the business information market in
1994, according to BIM.  Sales of electronic services were $9.3 billion in
1994.  By 1999, SIMBA estimates that online services will account for close to
50% of business information revenues.

The remainder of the market consists of face-to-face and audiovisual
information services, which had revenues of more than $2.2 billion.
Face-to-face and AV accounted for 8.8% of the market in 1994, down from 9.1%
in 1993.

Database Revenues $13.8B In '94

Database publishing continues to be the largest business information segment,
with revenues of $13.8 billion in 1994.  Comparatively, database publishing
revenues were $12.1 billion in 1993.  BIM defines databases as any collection
of information from archival literature and text documents to real-time
financial services and market quotes to directories and fax updates.

Challenges Ahead

There are several obstacles ahead for business publishers, including the
uncertainty of advertising revenues, demand for wider distribution of data,
industry consolidation and increased market competition.

Reuters '95 Sales To Fall Shy Of Record '94 Levels


Reuters' 1995 sales growth will reach into the double digits, but will not
equal last year's record-breaking 23% growth, according to Reuters chief
executive officer Peter Job.  "Expect gentle reduction in this growth
rate...due to record sales back in mid-1994, when the market was very hot,"
Job told analysts at the Paine Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.

Reuters' sales are currently in a deceleration mode.  Job hinted that
full-year results will likely be less than the 17% growth posted for the first
nine months of 1995.  An annual growth rate of 15%-17% would bring Reuters'
1995 sales to between $4.14 billion and $4.21 billion.

Job described Reuters' 1996 revenue outlook as good, but said the company is
not assured of double-digit gains because of continuing consolidation in the
U.S.  financial market.  Reuters already has in place initiatives to reduce
1996 operating costs, in case the growth slowdown continues.

"Broadly, we feel we will have a reasonable set of financials for next year,"
he summarized.

Despite that forecast, Reuters continues to dominate the financial information
business.  Reuters' share of the $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion market has risen
from one-third to two-thirds, Job maintained.  Reuters generates 90% of its
revenue from information products, where it competes with Dow Jones Telerate,
Bloomberg and Knight-Ridder Financial.  Transaction products represent the
company's second-highest revenue generator.  Media products represent just six
percent of revenues.

International Expansion Targeted

In the next three to five years, Reuters will direct its growth efforts to
emerging financial markets such as Russia, China and especially Japan.
Reuters presently distributes financial information to 154 countries.  Only
one-third of these countries are mature markets, while the other two-thirds
represent growing or emerging markets with vast potential, Job explained.

To illustrate the growth opportunities in emerging markets, Job noted that the
average site in such markets has only two to three user accesses, while
developed countries average 10 accesses per site.  In Russia, for example,
Reuters seldom sees a competitor, and already enjoys "reasonable market share"
in China, Job noted.

New Business Information/Transaction Products

Reuters will also look to develop new business information/transaction
products for niche professional markets, like insurance and advertising and
marketing, where demand will come from managers who don't have access to their
competitors' financial statistics.

Specifically, Job pinpointed the insurance industry as a niche Reuters hopes
to target.  he also reaffirmed the company's commitment to providing
information for the advertising and media industry.  Reuters already owns a
20% stake in AdValue Media Technologies (EIR, Dec.  10, 1993).  "Contribution
[from niche professional markets] to sales growth, in my opinion, will quite
rapidly become material," Job said.

McGraw-Hill Companies More Innovative In '96, Dionne Says


Expect to see more innovation from The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1996, Joe
Dionne, MHC chairman and chief executive officer, told analysts at the Paine
Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.

"In the midst of all the talk of the software revolution and the information
superhighway, we believe that companies with content have a bright future
indeed," Dionne said.  The company believes that its breadth of content gives
it a distinct competitive advantage in the development of new electronic
services for businesses and consumers.

One year ago, MHC had not yet stated its Internet strategy (EIR, Jan.  6,
1995).  MHC has been cautious and slow to move to the World Wide Web.

New Electronic Products

So what's ahead for MHC in 1996?  The company is prepared to provide its
customers "with the information they want, in the form and frequency they
desire," Dionne said.

MHC will also enter the consumer market for the first time in 1996 with its
newly formed Home Interactive Division.  The company provided sparse details,
but expects to release its first group of electronic products for the 1996
holiday selling season, said Terry McGraw, MHC president and chief operating
officer.  In the corporate market, MHC is planning to create electronic
extensions of its existing product lines, especially World Wide Web services,
McGraw said.

1996 Will Be Challenging

While 1995 was a good year, Dionne said that 1996 "will be a more challenging
year," especially in the school sales area.  Despite these challenges, the
company expects "another year of double-digit increases," he said.

Financial services, which was an important part of MHC's growth in 1995, is
the company's fastest growing global business, said McGraw.  In particular,
MHC's Financial Services should see growth in the Far East.  Although
transaction volumes have been declining, sales increases are predicted in 1996
for Standard & Poor's Debt Ratings.

The company continues to develop new financial services products, including a
broader portfolio of risk evaluation products.  MHC launched its Bank Loans
Ratings products in June 1995 and is already generating new revenues from this
product, McGraw said.  "The rebound continues at MHC's DRI unit," which
performs econometric forecasting, according to McGraw.  He expects another
year of "progress and profitability."

Shepard's Faces A Tough Year

Within Educational and Professional Publishing, the company's largest revenue
generator, is Shepard's legal publishing unit.  Shepard's had a solid year in
1995 due to the release of its federal citator revision system, McGraw said.
However, Shepard's "faces a tough year in 1996," due to the planned sale of
the company's topical business, which will lop off $22 million in sales.
There won't be a new release of the popular citator revision system, he added.

Information and Media Services, which contains all of MHC's advertising-based
businesses, reversed four straight years of declining margins, McGraw said.
The company aims to improve margins again in 1996.  Business Week, the
company's largest ad revenue producer, also had an outstanding year.

Construction Information Better In '96

In 1995, there were "some signs of life" in the construction information
business, as the company continued to reshape this business (EIR, Jan.  6,
1995), McGraw said.  In the first 10 months of 1995, the construction industry
was up 1.0% from one year ago, he added.

EUROPEAN TV PRODUCTION TO GET FINANCIAL BOOST
More channels mean more content opportunities

     Increased channel capacity will lead to increased revenue
opportunities for European television production companies in 1996.
     "There are so many channels that you can't go on showing American
reruns forever," said Nicholas Littlewood, managing director of
London-based Communications Equity Associates International Ltd. 
"There is a thirst for new product, and we will see a number of new
television production finance companies coming into existence,
certainly in the U.K." 
     This does not necessarily mean the market will expand for
Hollywood-produced content.  Most European governments have been
trying to move away from Hollywood influences, opting to fund home-
grown projects instead:

     * Recently, the European Commission proposed a $265 million fund
for European film and television producers;
     * Proceeds from a U.K. lottery were used to encourage a domestic
film industry; and
     * The French government mandates that at least half of its
country's cable programming come from French producers.  French
producers make about 150 films each year.

     Indeed, the French government has been particularly hard on
American content.  For instance, it fought to keep Ted Turner's
Cartoon Network off the country's television screens before finally
relenting.
     This could open up a huge market for European film producers. 
While more channels are being created (and more distribution paths
such as cable and satellite), some European governments have vowed not
to fill the additional channels with programming from the United
States.
     "I don't see any radical changes," Littlewood said.  "So while
there is going to be more content in terms of channels, there are
still heavy restrictions on what is shown on specific French
channels."
     Other countries, however, appeared to have embraced American
programming.  Germany-based The Kersh Group admitted recently that it
was going to increase its American content dramatically.  Analysts
deemed this revelation a blow to the German television industry.

Consumer Wants

     While some European governments are looking to legislate
Hollywood out of their countries, consumers are sounding a different
note.
     "In terms of popularity, people by and large prefer American made
films," Littlewood said.  "They have a more universal appeal in Europe
than films coming from any one particular country within Europe."
     In France, for instance, U.S. films hold four of the top five
spots.  In Italy, U.S. films account for 75 percent of the market.
     Indeed, few European films have achieved international
popularity.  Recently, there have been some exceptions (the U.K.'s
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" and France's "Nikita" and "Cyrano" have
translated well to the United States) but the general rule of thumb is
that Hollywood films will play well in Europe.
     Some European producers see the trend changing.  With proper
funding, European films could compete with Hollywood.  And that
funding, as well as the unspoken Hollywood quotas, could lead to a
more competitive environment.

Convergence

     1996 could be the year of the takeover/merger in the United
Kingdom.  Many analysts predict consolidation in the cable industry
will continue.  Currently, the U.K. cable market is saturated, meaning
new alignments will be formed and companies will begin to sell off
their divisions.
     "The convergence between telephony and cable and interactive
services is undoubtedly happening," Littlewood said.
     The path is being smoothed somewhat by the British government,
which is considering legislation relaxing cross-ownership limits,
allowing more freedom for newspapers and broadcasters to be owned by
the same person.
     John Hall, managing director of U.S.-based John Hall & Co. Inc.
predicted cable finally will begin to make some inroads on the
satellite-dominated market.
     "European cable should do well this year in a market
traditionally dominated by the satellite companies," Hall said.

New Media

     The new 'new media' market will offer content providers a new
programming outlet, and everyone is looking for new areas of growth.
     Newspapers, such as The Financial Times, are expected to play
around with online services far more this year.  
     "There are a lot of exciting developments in interactive games,"
Littlewood said.  "Awareness of the Internet is surging."
     Hall agreed, predicting the Internet will hit a global market
this year.
     "There will be tremendous market opportunities for any company
that knows how to use the Internet," Hall said.   
     Interactive television, however, will not be much of a factor in
1996, analysts predicted.  The much-hyped technology still will be in
a testing phase for much of the year.
     "It hasn't taken off yet," Littlewood said.  "We are all waiting
to see what the results of that are."

COMPANIES TO WATCH IN 1996:

     * Pearson plc has transformed itself from a conglomerate into a
much more specific media company.  It has The Financial Times.  It is
looking very actively at new media.  It has reorganized a lot of its
old-fashioned publishing interests.
     * Reed Elsevier will be interesting.  It is moving into higher
margin businesses, discarding a lot of divisions, such as regional
newspapers and electronic book publishing.
     * Havas will be interesting.  The French economy is obviously
having a tough time at the moment, but I think they are in the process
of reorganization.

SEX SELLS: EUROPEAN MARKET READIES FOR ADULT-ORIENTED ONSLAUGHT
But don't look for X-rated material to stick around for long

     European consumers can expect an influx of adult-oriented
programming in the coming year if the development of the Internet
continues to follow current market trends.
     Indeed, many analysts are looking at X-rated movies and games as
the Infobahn's dirty little secret, saying they financially will drive
the digital highway's development to the tune of close to $1 billion.
     The international market for adult-oriented programming quickly
is filling up with companies looking for profits:

     * Playboy Entertainment increased its television presence from 17
countries three years ago to 130 territories today;
     * Graff Pay-Per-View Inc. adult programming is seen in Europe,
nine former Communist countries, parts of Africa, the Middle East,
Australia, Hong Kong and South America; and 
     * Graff's Home Video Channel boasted 200,000 U.K. subscribers at
the end of the second quarter.  Spice has about 20 million U.S.
households;
     * Penthouse formed a joint venture with Graff last fall to put
its content on European television, computer services and CD-ROMs.

     Analysts warn profits to be gained from adult-oriented material
are not necessarily limited to X-rated videos--even if they are one of
the most profitable pay-per-view applications has been adult movies.
     Adult-oriented games and gambling also are expected to make an
impact on the Infobahn's bottom line.  For instance, when the popular
Mortal Kombat II was released last year, it brought in $50 million in
the first week alone.

A Short Market

     Few industry observers, however, believe adult material will have
the drawing power to continue financing the digital highway.
     The same trends happened when the VCR was first released.  Adult
videos made up about 80 percent of the profits in the first year, but
they take in 10 percent now.
     "I don't think [X-rated movies] will be a major money maker in
the interactive business," said Jeff Bernstein, vice president of
programming for Request TV.
     While subscribers and revenues are up at many of the companies
peddling adult programs, so is the competition.  
     New adult satellite TV channels are launching in the United
Kingdom, across Europe and into the Far East.  Graff executives blame
Canada's more explicit adult services for the 8 percent drop in the
company's DTH satellite revenues.
     Adult programming has proved to be a risky venture for many
companies--such as U.K.-based Red Hot Television, which crashed and
burned in bankruptcy.  Even the genre's patriarch Playboy has had its
financial troubles over the years.
     "The true test will be in three years to see who's around and
thriving," Graff's Steve Saril told our sister publication
International Cable.

Graff's Financials

     The industry of sex is starting to be profitable for Graff, which
saw its second quarter 1995 consolidated revenues rise 6 percent to
$11.5 million.  The U.S.-based programmer owns the European-based Home
Video Channel, Erotica and The Adult Channel.  It also owns Spice,
Spice2 and Adam & Eve in the United States.
     For the first six months of 1995, revenues were up 15 percent to
$23.1 million.  Revenues for 1994 were $40.4 million, up 97 percent
over 1993.
     Graff executives point to Europe as their biggest growth area. 
The company entered the international market four years ago.  In that
time, it has had to learn to adapt to different foreign markets and
foreign regulatory regimes.
     To adapt, Graff tailors its programming to particular markets--
meaning it will show dressed (heavily edited) or undressed (unedited)
versions, said Christopher Yates, head of global expansion for Graff
programming.
     "We can tailor-make our service to a particular market," Yates
said.  "We have the largest library and we produce the most
programming.  We have all versions of all kinds of product.  We can
have four or five versions of a network if we need to."
     Playboy also offers different versions of its programming to
satisfy different markets, said Mary Herne, senior vice president,
international division for Playboy Entertainment Group.
     "Our programming works on both free TV and pay TV," Herne said.
     She noted a syndication deal was signed with Middle East TV
distributor Orbit to carry the non-nude version of Playboy's soap
opera "Eden."  It may be tame fare, comparatively, but it moves the
Playboy name and brand into the Middle East.
     In contrast, she said, there's Germany, "which has consistently
taken everything we've offered."
     Playboy produces about 22 feature-length movies and 26 half-hour
programs a year.

SIDEBAR

     The only countries that have been able to keep sex off TV have
been ones with either stringent conservative governments or a lack of
powerful satellite footprints.
     "There really isn't any sex on TV in China," said Randy Barbato,
director and producer of World of Wonder.
     In Africa, where Graff and Playboy are pushing to launch
channels, the sexiest show the directors found was a bathing suit
contest on broadcast TV.
     Middle East consumers circumvent their conservative government
with satellite dishes.
     A European trend in broadcast fare has been to put sex into game
shows.  Broadcast TV stations in Spain, Italy and Germany have prime
time shows that can be described as "Wheel of Fortune" with stripping.

BSKYB BEING INVESTIGATED

     The Office of Fair Trading in the UK is launching a wide-ranging
investigation into the programming supply arrangements of BSkyB
(British Sky Broadcasting), which could impact severely on the
satellite company's exclusive sports deals. The investigation will go
further than many in the industry expected and follows widespread
concern voice by a number of franchisees.  The Director General of
Fair Trading said the review "will be confined to the issues relating
to the supply in the United Kingdom of programming and related
services at wholesale level." The OFT is particularly concerned about
the length of BSkyB's sports contracts.  Exclusive sports contracts
have been a long-time feature of British terrestrial broadcasting, but
the OFT said that the market had changed over the last few years with
the growth of pay television.  The key deal in question is the five-
year agreement for soccer's Premier League, which includes a clause
enabling BSkyB to match rival broadcasters' bids for future rights.
The investigation will run in parallel with OFT's main six-month
review of the company's position in the pay-TV market.

NEW BIDDERS FOR PREMIER LEAGUE

     In the strongest indication yet that Nethold and DirecTV are to
challenge Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB in Europe, Channel 5's major
shareholders MAI and Pearson are understood to be planning a joint bid
with Nethold and Hughes Corp. (owner of digitally compressed DirecTV
package, which operates in the United States) for rights to the UK's
Premier League, which is coming toward the end of its joint contract
with BSkyB and the BBC.  Rumours that Nethold and DirecTV are to join
forces in Europe have recently been rife, with Nethold drawing in
experience staff from around Europe to its new television facility to
be based in the Netherlands.  BSkyB has already proved the vital role
football plays in driving up subscriptions and the purchase of
exclusive rights could prove to be the driving force in growing a
rival satellite package to challenge Murdoch.

KIRCH AND MMBG COME TOGETHER OVER MEDIABOX

     In a recent meeting at Deutsche Telekom office in Bonn, German
media magnate Leo Kirch finally agreed to cooperate fully with the
development of Mediabox, backed by MMBG's (Multimedia
Betreibergesellschaft), as a common standard for digital TV in Germany
and France, and ditching the development of its own unit D-Box.  The
decision has effectively managed to avert a standards war which could
have stalled the arrival of digital TV in Germany and seen Kirch-owned
pay movies channel Premiere's million or so subscribers equipped with
a totally incompatible system.  A spokesperson for the Kirch Group
commented, "It's in the best interests of customers if only one
decoder is needed."   MMBG will be restructuring its shareholding
following the arrival of Kirch, with the agreement possibly offering
some form of compensation to Kirch for costs incurred in developing
the D-Box.  MMBG's Mediabox looks set to become the standard in both
France and Germany and already has the backing of private cable
operator Veba, Deutsche Telekom, German state broadcasters ARD and
ZDF, French pay-TV broadcast Canal Plus, RTL, CLT and Bertelsmann.  So
far, a significant number of manufacturers have been signed up by the
MMBG, including Sony, Pioneer, Thomson, Philips and Sagem.  As we went
to press, the official accord was announced, with Veba said to be hold
to take a 25.1 percent state in MMBG.

OVUM ISSUES FINAL UPDATE ON ITV

     Ovum, the London-based market research company, has just issued
the fourth and final update to its report, "Interactive Television:
the Market Opportunity." The update contains a set of forecasts for
the interactive TV market to the year 2005. For the first time, the
forecasts include projections for key
countries in Asia-Pacifica--Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea,
New Zealand, and Singapore are covered.  John Matthews, principal
consultant with Ovum, said, "Interactive TV has been slow to take off,
but it offers significant opportunities in the medium and the long
term. According to Matthews the United States will be the first area
to become "cash positive" in interactive TV.  In 2002, Europe is
forecast to make a profit on capital monies
invested in the technology.  Ovum predicts that the Asia-Pacific
region will not become cash positive, even at 2005, the far range of
the report's coverage.
     Predictably, the United States will have about 26.4 million
households with cable access to interactive TV by the year 2005.  The
report also predicts that, by that year, revenues received by service
providers from advertising will be $780 million in the Asia-Pacific
region, $4.3 billion in Europe and $9 billion in the United States.

U.S. SOFTWARE COMPANIES LOOK TO GET LOCAL IN EUROPE
Developers invest in localizing their products

     U.S. software publishers are stepping up efforts to invade the
European market with foreign-language versions of their English-
language titles.
     The strategy in developing the international market sounds
simple: Developers need to read the markets they want to enter
properly.
     "Everything is a risk," said Hasbro Interactive Worldwide's Tom
Dusenberry.  "You have to hope you're betting on the right hardware
formats to go after.  You have to hope you're picking the right
product to make interactive.  That's something I lose sleep over."
     Developers looking to make money off of foreign-language versions
of their English-language titles need to determine which titles to
develop from the beginning of a production cycle.
     Developers also must account for how much memory various
characters or letters take up in different languages.  For example,
German takes up 50 percent more space than English.  Japanese also
requires a considerable amount of memory.
     Using this strategy, two companies, Interplay Productions Inc.
and Creative Wonders are hoping to increase revenues based on sales of
titles in Europe by 50 percent over the next year.

Peanuts In Europe

     Virgin Sound and Vision (VSV) also is channeling its enormous
financial resources into sought-after licensing deals and an
international launch strategy.
     "We're looking at products with  global appeal and global recoup
value, which allows us to put another hundred or hundred and fifty
thousand into the title," said Tom Turpin, VSV president and CEO.
     Virgin has inked deals with Softgold Gmbh in Germany and Hedarzi
in Israel to localize VSV title's for the developers' respective
markets.  The goal:  to create the same title in different languages
that reflects their respective idioms and nuances.
     "There's such a strong motivation (culturally) to get ahead in
those areas," Turpin said.
     Funded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, the content-focused
software company's first big title--Get Ready For School, Charlie
Brown--hit stores last fall and provides a window into the company's
philosophy.
     Sparing no expense, Virgin licensed characters from United
Features Syndicate and worked with Bill Melendez Studios, the firm
that created the animation for the Charlie Brown television specials,
to develop the title.

Big Bird in Europe

     Creative Wonders executives also are looking to popular
children's characters for profits, but they seem to have taken it a
step further.  Creative Wonders President Greg Bestick believes audio
elements have become a more important part of multimedia software, so
developers should secure authentic voices to reach discriminating
consumers.  
     The company dubbed in voices of local actresses and actors for
the characters in its line of Sesame Street titles.
     "We also focus on finding local voice content--new voices for the
different countries," Bestick said.
     One word of caution:  Keep the voice track separate from other
programming in a title.  "It's easier to localize if it's done that
way," Bestick said.

Interplay's Plans

     Localized products are more likely to sell if a publisher's
foreign release coincides with a domestic launch.  
     "Between 40 and 50 percent more products [sell] if the local
version comes out simultaneously with the U.S. release," Interplay's
Julie Roether said.
     If publishers release a U.S. version first, they risk losing out
on the sale of the foreign language version of a product.  
     If a German version of a product comes out much later than the
English version, it likely will have difficulty in the marketplace. 
Germans, who are very English literate, often will buy the first
version of a product even if it is in English.
     The biggest hurdle developers face in creating localized versions
of titles is making the commitment to do it.
     "The initial returns aren't there," said Bestick. "It's a leap of
faith."

PHILIPS PREPARES TO DEBUT DVD PLAYER IN ASIA
Company demonstrates prototype at MIP Asia

     As Philips Media prepares to distribute its high-density DVD
player in Asia, the media industry is standing up and taking notice.
     No other consumer electronics manufacturer has stated that it
will simultaneously deliver DVD as a peripheral for the PC and as an
accompaniment to the television.
     The company demonstrated for the first time its DVD player
prototype at  MIP Asia TV last week. Close to the new unified format
specifications, the two-hour video was in PAL on two widescreen TV
sets and was encoded in MPEG 2 in Eindhoven. It was stored on one
layer of a high density CD.
     While the quality of the picture can be improved, only members of
the Motion Pictures Experts Group could spot the flaws in the disc,
which showed the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral. Even so, the press
covering the event seemed impressed with the crispness of the picture
with the freeze-frame function.
     Market researchers predict 10 percent of consumers will but DVD
players by the year 2000.  
     Philips realizes the importance of backward compatibility of its
high- density player line in safeguarding the $120 trillion that
consumers worldwide have spent on CD-ROMs, said Peter Van der Poll,
general manager of Phillips Media Asia.
     Van der Poll stressed the interchangeability between applications
and played up the importance of the SD Alliance's acceptance of
Philips' modulation scheme last September.  When asked, Van der Poll
confirmed that with the purchase of an MPEG card, all Philips Video CD
products will work on a PC.
     Philips' officials declined to estimate the cost of the DVD
player, due to be launched in late 1997 or early 1998. 
     According to Van der Poll, Philips expects that the market for CD
drives will double in the next few years. The majority of the new
business will take the form of PC-based multimedia products.
     Philips set up its Asian operations in Hong Kong because the city
is the home of electronic publishing, film and music in the region. 
As in Europe, the company is promising local language products in
Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Malaysian, possibly Indonesian
and Tagalog.
     The company's hopes for the region are not limited to off-line
products.  Following the creation of United Philips Communications--
the joint venture with United International Holdings Ltd. that has
resulted in Europe's largest private cable multiple system operator--
Philips is weeks away from reaching agreements with three cable
operators in the region.
     The aim is to create more networks and develop three more cable
ventures over the next two years, said Van der Poll. 

Localizing Content

     As Philips tries to build up a CD catalogue, it will go to great
lengths to foster local content. "You need local content," Van der
Poll said.  "Up to 60 percent of our music business is based on local
content, local repertoire--we believe the same will be true for film,
for entertainment and definitely for education."
     The added benefit is that piracy will be reduced -- a problem
that in the past has been well documented in Asia, but which Van der
Poll said is slowly getting better. 
     Looking to the future, Van der Poll said that co-productions with
Beijing TV also are in the offing.  High-density CD-ROM will hit the
market by the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997.
     He would not venture to anticipate the price, but offered, "if
you want to be successful in a PC application, the price has to be,
after a year or so, the same as the standards we are with now.  It
will be of the same order of magnitude as the current CD." Rewriteable
CD is in the cards for 1998.

CZECH REPUBLIC

     The political and economic situation in Czech Republic has
stabilized.  No basic changes are expected in the political scene,
even after the Parliamentary elections in 1996.  Macro-economic signs
are very favorable, and it is widely presumed that Czech Republic has
gone through the difficult phase of transformation.
     The main reasons for foreign investment are the Czech Republic's
fast economic development and its stable political situation.  The
Czech consumer and the advertising market have almost reached the same
level as Western Europe.
     Nova TV, which began broadcasting Feb. 4, 1994, was the first
private national television channel in Central Europe.  The station
quickly had the biggest market share and the highest number of viewers
per day.
     State television reacted to the increasing ratings of Nova TV by
changing the programming, adapting the prices and becoming much more
flexible.
     There is only one private regional television station, Premiera,
which covers more than 50 percent of the Czech Republic.  It
concentrates on the economically strong areas--Prague and Central
Bohemia.

INTERACTIVE SERVICES CAUSE MILE-HIGH HEADACHES
1995 was the year of the bug; will 1996 be the year it hits big?

     A new, seemingly overlooked market is looming for film and
television producers looking to peddle their content: the airline
industry.
     Indeed, interactivity was the hottest buzzword in in-flight
entertainment in 1995, but the systems airlines hoped would give them
an edge over the competition were plagued with continued bugs and
delayed tests.
     Enthusiasm continues among major airlines, despite challenges.

     * Northwest was forced to shut down its test of an interactive
Hughes-Avicom international system last summer.  Even still, the
carrier began tests of a redesigned version of the Hughes system in
September.  
     * United Airlines abandoned interactive features on its GEC
Marconi-supplied IFE systems after problems surfaced on systems
installed onboard its new Boeing 777 aircraft.  
     * Tests of interactive IFE systems scheduled with British Airways
and American Airlines also were postponed because of technology
challenges.
     * Plus, In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) struggled with reliability
issues and scrambled to convince Continental, USAir and America West
not to cancel contracts.  IFPC began testing a new, debugged version
of its Flightlink IFE and communications system with Continental in
September.  

The Promise and the Glitches

     Even with the current problems, these advanced IFE systems hold
considerable promise.  
     * IFPC's Flightlink system, for example, is slated to begin live
multi-channel television and audio broadcasts via satellite by the
third quarter of 1997 and plans to have the capability to send faxes
to the ground from airline seats in the near future.
     * BE Aerospace, which has an IFE system boasts video-on-demand
capability, says it is hopeful its system (scheduled to be tested with
BA) will be ready for trials by March.  
     * Sony Trans Com teamed with Microsoft to develop a video-on-
demand product it hopes to be ready for customers by 1997.  
     * Matsushita Avionics Systems Corp., the vendor for the American
Airlines IFE program, hopes to have video-on-demand capability
available for that carrier's trial in the near future.
     * Cathay Pacific announced in August it would install two IFE
systems on its fleet, with plans to upgrade to interactive capability
by next year.         
     * In October, Alitalia went outside the pool of traditional
vendors to tap Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. (IFT) for a three-
month, 30-seat trial of its interactive video-on-demand system in its
recently revamped first class.  The system offers 22 video channels
with audio tracks in five languages. Videos played on the system are
completely under individual control and can be started, stopped, or
rewound by the passenger.
     If the trial meets with success, the carrier hopes to roll out
the system on seven more planes by mid-1996.
     "I still think there is a lot of smoke and mirrors out there,"
Dean Haehnel, president of the World Airline Entertainment Association
(WAEA), said about interactive IFE before the group's conference in
Amsterdam.  "There are a lot of companies demonstrating products that
have never flown, and there is still a lot of work to be done in the
area of interactive and video-on-demand. That is really the problem,
right now, the whole issue of reliability."

The Gambling Cure

     Another of the more promising---and unconventional---in-flight
innovations for carriers, vendors and passengers alike is in-flight
gambling.
     Finally, it seems, technology may have caught up with desire, as
Alitalia's IFE system premiered the capability for in-flight gambling,
though initially passengers will not play for money. 
     Also on the in-flight gambling front, Sky Games International
announced recently it had inked an agreement to provide its gambling
software for use with a major airline's in-flight entertainment
system. The software will be installed and ready for play as early as
next year.
     Sources say the contract was signed with Singapore Airlines, but
neither Sky Games nor the airline to date has confirmed this.
     Although in-flight gambling has raised a number of concerns,
industry studies suggest a single widebody jet equipped with
interactive IFE systems could generate up to $2 million a year -- half
of which would come from gambling.

ARE BROADCASTERS FALLING BEHIND IN THE RACE TO HDTV?

     As HDTV nears a critical juncture--the beginning of the FCC
terrestrial transmission tests--there is concern that
broadcasters are falling behind the satellite and cable TV
industries in the race for HDTV.
     Satellites already have carried HDTV, and cable just
announced plans for demonstration transmissions of the
technology.  Meanwhile, broadcasters have been forced to wait out
the FCC testing process.
     HDTV REPORT editor Charlotte Wolter polled leading experts
on whether the broadcast industry can keep pace as HDTV picks up
steam.  They said the cost of HDTV will be a significant problem
for broadcasters, more than for cable or satellites, which can
get the technology on the air more quickly and inexpensively.
     The good news is that broadcasters also are developing
models for the introduction of HDTV that will keep costs within
reach of most local stations and keep the industry in the HDTV
race.
     "Right now broadcasters face a tremendous cost imbalance
relative to cable companies," said Lynn Claudy, National
Association of Broadcasters (NAB) director, advanced engineering
and technology.  "A broadcaster is inherently a local beast and
ultimately, any HDTV service would incorporate some local element
of production."
     "Cable has an advantage in that they don't need a
transmitter for every headend," said Julius Barnathan, senior
vice president for advanced technology and strategic planning,
Capital Cities/ABC, "But...they would need new boxes that are
smart....Nobody gets off cheap."
     While cable wins a short-term public relations coup from the
HDTV initiative, the real impact, said James McKinney, chairman
of the Advanced Television Systems Committee, is to "reinforce
the absolute certainty that [broadcasters] must have a good
system."  In the past, he said, broadcasters assumed a standard
could be "good enough--not as good as MUSE or what we see
elsewhere--but good enough.  But this means they have to pick
something that is a golden standard, and if they don't, others
will be ahead of them."
     The cable demonstrations also have raised the specter that
broadcasters will be left behind.  "That's a significant portion
of the motivation to move ahead," said Howard Miller, senior vice
president of broadcast operations and engineering for PBS.  But
with its role in the FCC process, "Is cable going to march off
ahead," Miller asked.  "Not unless broadcasting chooses not to do
it."

Broadcasters Must Find Whether There Is a Business in HDTV

     Given its inherent cost disadvantage, broadcasters have to
decide how to compete in HDTV.  "Is terrestrial going to be [like
AM radio after FM appeared] and find a different local business,
or will it be able to continue to play competitively in this new
arena," asked Joseph Flaherty, vice president and general
manager, engineering development, for CBS.  "Certainly cable,
[direct broadcast satellite], home video and fiber can play in
the game."
     "The question remains, how do broadcasters secure profit out
of it," said McKinney.  "When color came on, broadcasters charged
extra if someone wanted a commercial in color."  Miller agreed,
"From the station standpoint, it's a very basic question: Is
there any revenue potential with this technology?  They have to
think very carefully about whether they will make the
investment."
     Nevertheless, there is optimism that conversion is possible.
During this week's NAB National Show, Flaherty will present a
detailed study that will state that stations have a wide range of
choices for conversion.  It will suggest a 4-step process,
starting with signal pass-through for as little as $1 million
--with digital HDTV.  Next, stations can add local 16:9
broadcasts with a wide- screen version of today's TV, then a
lower-quality version of the FCC standard, then finally full
HDTV.  Studio equipment, the most costly item, can be phased in
over 5-7 years on regular replacement schedules.
     Economies also can be found in studio conversion, said
Merrill Weiss, managing director, advanced television systems,
for NBC.  Serial digital systems now finding their way into
studios could be adapted for HDTV, he said, if the right choices
are made in data rates and formats.
     Each station, Flaherty emphasized, will find a schedule
appropriate for its market.  "Large markets have funds to do it
first and tend to be in tougher competitive environments.
Smaller stations do it later, and even in major markets they
don't do everything at once."
     Flaherty believes an industry that made the transition from
black and white to color can handle HDTV.  "People worried about
cost, and it took time for smaller stations, but it would be hard
to find a black-and-white station today.
It's not simple, not cheap; it's very difficult and takes good
business judgment, but we've done it before," he added.

HDTV DISPLAYS:  MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR
CONSUMER MARKET

     As the HDTV broadcast picture begins to clear,it has become
more and more apparent that a criticalelement is missing:
low-cost, large-screen displays of 40 inches diagonally or
larger.  The lack of suitable displays is a serious bottleneck in
the development of a consumer market for HDTV.
     Many are convinced the HDTV experience is apparent only on
screens 40 inches across and larger.  Large displays are
"absolutely" necessary, said Julius Barnathan of ABC.  "Let the
[40-inch CRT] stick out into an apartment," he joked, adding,
"This is a problem, a fundamental problem."
     "Until we have large screens, the American public is not
going to be swayed," said the NAB's Lynn Claudy.  "It has
to...really slap them in the face. That's possible with large
screens--4, 5, 6 feet."
     But CRTs are difficult to make that size and would be too
bulky for the average home.  "Sony made a 46-inch [CRT], but it
weighs hundreds of pounds. That size will be the end for tubes,"
said D. Joseph Donahue, senior vice president, technology and
business development for Thomson Consumer Electronics. "Today no
one knows how to make large flat panels [that size]--never mind
the economics, just to demonstrate."  The industry "might see
demos this decade," he said, but not flat-screen products.
     Some HDTV displays based on current technology will sell.
"The 27-inch [variety] is the most popular, at 4:3 [aspect
ratio]," said James McKinney of the Advanced Television Systems
Committee.  "What's important is screen height.  If you take the
same height and convert it to high-definition [9:16 aspect
ratio], you come out to 37-38 inches diagonally [a size CRTs can
manage]."
     "High-definition makes as much sense in a 17-as in a 40-inch
set," said Greg DePriest, vice president, advanced TV technology
and strategic planning for Toshiba America.  "I don't think HDTV
means the end of 17-or 22-inch sets."

**SPECIAL REPORT--AN INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD WILEY**

     HDTV REPORT editors David Bross and Britton Manasco sat down
recently with the Chairman of the FCC Advisory Committee on
Advanced Television Service, Richard Wiley, for a wide-ranging
interview on the state of the global HDTV industry and the FCC's
efforts in moving toward selecting a U.S. HDTV standard.  The
interview was conducted at Wiley's Washington, D.C., law firm
Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  Wiley was the chairman of the FCC from
1974-77 and also served as an FCC commissioner and general
counsel.  Here's what he had to say:

HDTV REPORT:  Why has the United States opted for a mandated
HDTV standard rather than having one evolve naturally in the
marketplace?

Wiley:  I can only speculate, to some extent, because it is,
obviously, an FCC determination.  They set up the advisory
committee.  I think the reason is we're dealing here with a very
important decision for the country.  When you look at when the
last television standard was set--in the 1940s--you realize
whatever decision you make is going to be an important one.  I
think it's one in which the government feels it wants the private
sector input, but it ultimately needs to make the decision
itself.  I think this commission, unlike decisions that past
commissions might have made, wants to make that decision.  I
think it's a very interesting process and hopefully will be an
effective one.
              One thing it clearly has done is to stimulate
private sector activity in this area.  Before the fall of 1987,
I'm not aware of very much that was going on in HDTV in this
country.  We've got some very impressive U.S. proponents, as well
as foreign proponents, and we have well over 500
people drawn from various private sector companies, many of them
U.S.-based, who are active in the work of the advisory committee.
And I think that out of this may come a very good decision.

HDTV REPORT:  If American-based companies knew that their
foreign-based competitors were active in HDTV prior to 1987, why
the lack of movement domestically?  Were there barriers to HDTV
development?

Wiley:  No, I don't think so.  Of course, we have not been as
big a factor in the television manufacturing business as we might
have, but I think that this effort has, perhaps, renewed some of
our resolve in this area.  It brought out some of our
technological prowess, which is good.  But I can't tell you why
we weren't involved in it before.  To some extent, we may have
leapfrogged some of the activity that has gone on abroad--if
digital-based technologies prove they will actually work.

HDTV REPORT:  Are developments in compression driving the
recent push toward digitally based HDTV systems?

Wiley:  Yes, I think there have been, as I understand it, some
compression breakthroughs that companies have developed.  I think
the stimulus of General Instrument coming forth with a digital
system is good.  I think it drove some of the other proponents to
examine what they are doing and to see whether or not they could
use that same technology to bring their product to the
marketplace.             A year and a half ago we had a meeting
in Chairman Sikes' office with a number of engineers in this
field and they felt that terrestrial broadcasting, digitally, was
not possible--perhaps not even in this century.
HDTV REPORT:  Is it taken as a given by the FCC that the
continued profitability of the local broadcaster is in the public
interest?

Wiley:  No, I don't think that's the basis on which the
commission decided to pursue terrestrial broadcasting.  The
commission has not said that it is trying to protect broadcasting
profitability or even the industry itself.  I think the
commission's theory is that terrestrial transmission may be the
quickest and the least expensive way to bring advanced television
service to the American people.
     At the same time, we're not trying to hold back other
technologies.  I'd encourage cable to work very closely with
broadcasting so that we can have an advanced television system
that will work for both broadcasting and cable.  And I've been
very pleased that the 2 industries have been working together in
harmony on this through the Advanced Television Test Center and
CableLabs.
     I think that's one of the great advantages of our system
here.  Also we've encouraged, and had a working party look at,
alternative media.  If there is a direct broadcast satellite
system in this country, it can go right ahead and provide
advanced television service.
     But the point is, we don't have that currently in this
country.  But we all have television sets.  We do have a very
ubiquitous broadcast and cable system in this country and I think
the commission has rightly determined that this is the best way
to proceed for now.  Clearly, Japan and Western Europe are
looking at a DBS service for HDTV and that should be technically
possible here as well.
     Nothing the advisory committee is doing should impede [DBS].
I think that's an advancement in the state of the art.  If it
happens, so be it.  There's one thing I would like to add,
however.  We are a little different than Japan.  We have 4 time
zones in this country--a very geographically large country.  The
FCC also has a commitment to localism in broadcasting and I think
that fits naturally with [its call for] a terrestrial means of
transmission.  But I don't see it as a protectionist view for
broadcasting, so I support what they've done.

HDTV REPORT:  Recently, Chairman Sikes has expressed concern
over the speed at which the test committee is moving--what is the
status of testing?

Wiley:  Well, I agree with him, of course, that we want to keep
pushing the process.  Yes, we've had delays, but I think the
theory has been that we're going to keep setting deadlines and
then back off the deadlines if there are developments that
necessitate it.  There are a number of reasons why we've
experienced delays.  Number one, the proponents have changed
their designs and their formats.  Four of them have gone to
digital modes.  They would not have been ready to be tested under
the old schedule.  And I think it's in the public interest to
have had that delay and I think Al Sikes agrees.
     Number 2, there have been delays in the delivery of
equipment to the advanced television test center.  The format
converter, manufactured by Techtronics, has been delayed.  I'm
not saying that in criticism of that company, because it is a
very complex product, but I think it is characteristic of the
problems that we are running into.
     We're sailing on a sea that has never been charted before.
The equipment that we are utilizing to test these systems has
never been made before.  The proponents themselves have never
been there.  So, I think some delay has probably been inevitable
and probably beneficial.  The bad news is there has been a delay.
The good news is there has been a delay.

Richard Wiley in the next news-filled issue of HDTV REPORT.

EVERYONE'S DOING IT:  HDTV SOFTWARE DEMAND HEATING
UP; INVESTORS EYE PROFITS

     This will be the year the tremendous investments that HDTV
production pioneers made inexpensive and untried equipment will
begin to pay off.  There finally will be enough demand for HDTV
production to provide a return to the production houses that have
geared up for HDTV, industry sources told us.
     "It's really picking up this year," said Club Theater
Network President Ron Ratner, whose company has an HDTV
production studio, including an HDTV telecine.  "I think we did
more in January and February in high-definition than all last
year, billable, not giving away stuff anymore."
     Some organizations that are potential buyers of HDTV
      programming are:

     * NHK: The Japanese national broadcaster plans to up its DBS
      broadcasts to
      6, and some say 8, hours per day by the end of the year.
       Movies converted
      to HDTV will take up a significant chunk of that time, but
      the broadcaster
      also has ordered travelogues, music programming and sports;
     * PBS: Public broadcasting is committed to demonstrating
      advanced television for the public, said Senior Vice
      President Howard Miller, but it currently is struggling to
      assemble equipment donations.  However, PBS plans
      original HDTV productions, probably in music, for 1991;
     * Cable: It is not clear if CableLabs' HDTV demonstration
      will include original programming, but it is linked to
      Scientific-Atlanta's HDTV production/transmission venture
      with Captain New York, which will produce and transmit
      special-event programming via satellite;
     *Europe: The advent of B-MAC broadcasts will require wide
     aspect-ratio programming, some of which will be original
     programming; and
     * Non-broadcast markets: There is growing demand in special
     effects for films and projection HDTV for amusement parks
     and public displays.

     While producers are beginning a wider variety of projects,
most of the pioneering HDTV producers are seeing an increase in
projects, not just for NHK but for other buyers as well,
including:

     * Zbig Vision Ltd.: NHK just commissioned a documentary
     called "Manhattan"
      and another called "Washington," for a total of one hour of
     HDTV.  Zbig
      also will produce a one-hour special on Franz Kafka for a
     French company,
      Telemax.  The show will be shot on a sound stage with
     actors inserted into
      a set of miniatures and models reproducing Prague of
      Kafka's time;
     * Captain New York: President David Niles said his company
     has done fashion shows for NHK, as well as music,
      travelogues, ballet,opera--universally acceptable
      programming.  An adventuresome project has been to film
      comedian Jackie Mason in HDTV.  He added, "There is serious
     talk of networks of movie theaters joining up this summer"
      for what he describes as "close-up concerts," where artists
      are filmed close up in the studio to give the audience the
      feeling of being at a small concert;
     * NHK: Rupert Stow, who coordinated the NAB's HDTV
     programming sessions,
      said NHK is "straining to fill 3 hours or more each day
     with electronically produced high-definition programming,"
     with nature programming popular.  "They tend to go overseas
     for entertainment, and some of the programs they are
     financing in this country are art- or entertainment-based;"
     and
     * Club Theater Network: Ratner predicted studios will use
     his telecine for "action movies or production-value movies,
     lots of blow-ups and lots of chase scenes."  The company
     also is doing special effects using a Symbolics machine and
     opticals with an HDTV Ultimatte.  In discussion are a
     long-haul demonstration with fiber optics network firm Vyvx
     and a project with cable.

*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market

*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market
years ahead of plans by other nations.  Most large Japanese
electronics makers have introduced new consumer HDTV products,
including televisions, videocassette recorders and adapters that
allow HDTV broadcasts to be seen on present TV sets.  But with
the new sets priced at 10 times or more than that of current
top-of-the-line models, consumers may not be rushing to the
stores.  The new equipment, displayed at an international
broadcast equipment show near Tokyo, demonstrates how far ahead
Japanese companies are in commercializing the technology.  Prices
for the new equipment on display at the show ranged from a
Mercedes Benz to a Ford.  Sony's new 36-inch HDTV set, one of the
less-expensive models announced, lists for about $17,700.  A
company spokesman insisted the sets will be bought by "ordinary"
Japanese, to whom Sony plans to sell an initial 100 sets per
month.  "Our current 32-inch model is priced at about $30,700.
In 5 years, we hope to bring that down to about $7,700," said
Hideji Matsuda of Toshiba's new media division.

ATTC SWEEPSTAKES:  WINNERS AND LOSERS,OR WILL THERE
BE PRIZES FOR EVERYONE?

     When the FCC makes the final decision on anHDTV terrestrial
transmission standard, sometime early in 1993, the commission
probably will be picking winners and losers, industry analysts
told HDTV REPORT.  One company or group of companies is likely to
celebrate while others mourn the lost millions they invested.
     The FCC is likely "to pick one of the systems that we know
about now and not likely to force some combination, like the
Zenith RF system and GI's encoding system," predicted James
McKinney, of the Advanced Television Systems Committee.  "Out of
the tests will come one victor."
     There are 2 major parts to the technologies--bandwidth
compression and the transmission system.  Asking contenders to
combine features of their systems could be both a technological
and copyright nightmare, and could produce the proverbial
camel--a horse designed by committee.
     The perception that the government probably will go for one
system has proponents jockeying to combine or redefine proposals.
"There have already been a few accommodations," said CBS' Joseph
Flaherty.  "Whether they combine or not will be a commercial
decision.  I don't think the government will force
[combinations]."  He added, "The digital systems are similar, but
there are enough differences that one could have an advantage
over the others."
     "There will be some losers," said Merrill Weiss of NBC, "but
a single winner is very difficult to predict."

Zenith-General Instrument Still Viewed as Potential Combination

     One combination generating frequent speculation is General
Instrument and Zenith.  "I think it would be a wonderful
combination," said McKinney, "but GI is more interested than
Zenith."  He added, "GI needed help, but they have gotten that
now in their combination with MIT.  That gave them a dramatic leg
up in the RF area.  Their weakness was in the transmission
system, the RF system, and that has now [probably] been covered
by MIT."
     Still, a Zenith-GI coupling is attractive.  "It would make
an obvious all-American winner," McKinney said.  Another factor
is that Zenith is a manufacturer of receiving equipment, while GI
and MIT are not.  Although the winner will have to license the
technology, "if an equipment manufacturer wins, they get to build
for free, so that's probably why GI is interested," he said.
     There is still time right up to testing date for proponents
to get together on their own, "but once they enter the [Advanced
Television Test Center] lab and put the equipment on the test bed
and run tests, then it's very difficult," warned McKinney.  "This
is big risk time.  I don't think everybody is going to win," he
said.  "They're all big boys and they know what they're doing."

LONDON ONLINE SHOW ATTRACTS RECORD CROWD

     by Tom Hogan

     [Editor's Note: "Information Today" Publisher Tom Hogan was in London
last month at Learned Information Europe Ltd.'s Online Information 95 meeting,
so we asked him at deadline to prepare this quick report. Next month, in his
first "European Report" column for "IT," U.K.-based information industry
writer-editor Richard Poynder will cover the conference in depth.]

     The Online Information 95 exhibition, held in London December 5-7,
attracted a total of 16,870 visitors, clearly establishing this event as the
largest electronic information meeting in the world. The meeting, formerly
known as the International Online Information Meeting or IOLIM, celebrated its
19th anniversary this year with an attendance growth of some 35 percent.

     "The widespread media coverage of the Internet has brought our industry
into the limelight," said Jill Cousins, director of marketing for Learned
Information Europe Ltd., sponsor of the meeting. "In fact, however, we have
been promoting the use of electronic information for the last 20 years. The
substantial increase in the number of visitors at this year's meeting reflects
the growing recognition of the importance of electronic information services
for general business and scientific use."

     The exhibition, held at the Olympia 2 conference and exhibition center,
housed 346 exhibitors and featured a special Internet floor under the banner
of "Internet World International Winter 95." Learned Information Europe Ltd.
will hold its main Internet conference, Internet World International 96, on
May 21-23, also in London.

     On the conference side, slightly over 1,000 attendees listened to
presentations as varied as "Online Pricing: Changing Strategies in a Changing
World" to "Assessing the Impact of the Internet and Online Services on
Traditional Publish-ers" to "Peace and Information in the Middle East."

     The complete 612-page proceedings of the conference can be purchased in
North America from Information Today, Inc., 800/300-9868.

COMPUTER SECURITY SURVEY: FINANCIAL LOSSES AND INTERNET BREAK-INS

     In addition to the problems of hackers, ex-employees, and unscrupulous
competitors, increased use of the Internet for business purposes is a growing
concern for information security professionals, according to the Third Annual
Ernst & Young/InformationWeek Information Security Survey.

     More than half of those surveyed reported security-related financial
losses in the past year--with 20 companies reporting losses in excess of $1
million. And of those using the Internet for exchanging information
externally, 20 percent reported successful or attempted break-ins in the past
year.

     Forty percent of the Internet business users expressed dissatisfaction
with Internet security, the survey found. At the same time, a commanding 87
percent of Internet users stated that they would use it more for business
purposes if security were enhanced. More than two-thirds of those not using
the Internet now, but planning to within a year, said they would increase
their potential use even more if its security were improved.

     Most companies surveyed admit that they do not have adequate tools or
properly trained personnel to defend against information security losses,
which can run into millions of dollars. But Daniel E. White, an Ernst & Young
partner specializing in information security, points out, "Companies are
demonstrating growing awareness of security problems and increased willingness
to devote additional resources to their solution."

     "Information security should be decentralized," said White. "As companies
rely on advanced information technology to exchange data among remote
locations such as plants, branch offices, and warehouses, effective security
systems need to be implemented in those locations, and the people in charge
locally must regard information security as part of their responsibility. To
assist in this effort, common guidelines for security must be developed
centrally and uniformly enforced at all locations."

     The report, which surveyed 1,300 chief information officers (CIOs) and
other senior information executives, looked at a wide array of other security
issues, ranging from problems of "telecommuting" employees with remote access
to a company's systems to the importance of being placed on security in new
client/server environments.

     Other key survey findings are:

     --   More than two-thirds of respondents surveyed reported encountering
          a virus in the past year.

     --   A lack of proven security tools/solutions is a major obstacle to
          good information security.

     --   A notable increase was reported in the number of security heads who
          report to the CIO (43 percent in 1995, 32 percent in 1994, and 27
          percent in 1993).

     "Our survey results over the past three years show that information
security issues are becoming better understood. And the increased awareness
that management is putting on computer security is very encouraging--budgets
are increasing, more tools are being implemented, and security professionals
are becoming more involved in the systems development process," White said.

     The survey also reports that nearly half the companies surveyed have
ongoing information security awareness programs, although fewer companies have
such programs as part of the orientation process for new employees. More than
three-fourths have a formal corporate information/data security policy.

     For more information or a copy of the survey, contact Bernard Wedge of
Ernst & Young LLP, 216/861-8884; e-mail: bernard.wedge@ey.com.

CADMUS DEBUTS JOURNALS.AT-HOME, TEAMS WITH UNCOVER CO. FOR DOCUMENT DELIVERY

     Cadmus Digital Solutions (CDS) has established JOURNALS.At-HOME
(http://journals.at-home.com) on the Internet's World Wide Web with the
electronic debut of 18 prestigious scientific and medical journals.
JOURNALS.At-HOME debuted last October with table of contents and abstracts for
the October issues of "Stroke," "Circulation" (twice monthly), "Circulation
Research," "Hypertension," and "Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular
Biology," published by the American Heart Association; "The American Journal
of Pathology" published by the American Society for Investigative Pathology;
and the "Journal of Immunology." In addition, complete articles in "The
Cutting Edge," a section of the "Journal of Immunology" and table of contents
for 11 journals published by the American Society of Microbiology went online.
Subsequent issues go online simultaneously with the mailing of printed
catalogs.

     Journals, electronic catalogs, and databases residing on JOURNALS.At-HOME
are linked externally to other sites and will soon be linked internally as
well, to meet the growing interactive and communications needs of scientists,
physicians, engineers, researchers, scholars, librarians, and teachers,
according to Cadmus. JOURNALS.At-HOME offers an evolutionary approach whereby
publishers can initially go online with table of contents and then add content
gradually. The content opportunities can include complete articles, letters to
the editor, images, editorial board profiles, subscription ordering, product
literature, online catalogs, and more.

     "With JOURNALS.At-HOME, we have created a single collaborative space
where the objectives of publishers, end users, and advertisers can all be
met," said Frederick Bowes, president, Cadmus Digital Solutions, and creator
of JOURNALS.At-HOME. "Helping content owners generate new revenues from their
online services is an important component of Cadmus Digital Solutions'
publisher-oriented approach."

CADMUS/UNCOVER PARTNERSHIP

     Cadmus also recently announced a strategic partnership with The UnCover
Company to provide online document delivery service within JOURNALS.At-HOME.
The UnCover Company provides a comprehensive, multidisciplinary database
containing over seven million article citations, indexing nearly 17,000
journals worldwide. JOURNALS.At-HOME will begin offering document delivery
service early this year.

     Without leaving the JOURNALS.At-HOME service and depending on each
publisher's configuration, researchers, educators, and professionals will have
the opportunity to quickly access complete articles from a journal's table of
contents, or abstracts residing in JOURNALS.At-HOME, and complete articles
cited and back issues of journals residing in the service. Users will generate
online orders directly with The UnCover Company and receive printed articles
within 24 hours via fax.

     "Through our collaboration with The UnCover Company, an industry leader
in the field of document delivery, CDS now has the ability to meet the
objectives of both end users and publishers," said Bowes.

     "Those seeking cutting-edge research can quickly and conveniently access
quality resource materials, saving valuable time. Publishers benefit by making
it easy for users to obtain legal copies."

     The UnCover Company and its parent company, The CARL Corporation, a
leading provider of library automation services, are owned by Knight-Ridder
Information, Inc.

     Cadmus Digital Solutions is part of Cadmus Journal Services, a producer
of scientific, technical, medical, and scholarly journals. Cadmus Digital
Solutions offers Internet publishing and content management services along
with new media products to professional and scholarly publishers, including
the more than 400 highly specialized journals already produced by Cadmus.

SEVEN DATABASES TO ADOPT OVID INTERFACE

     Ovid Technologies has announced that three Cambridge Scientific Abstracts
databases--Cambridge Life Sciences Collection, Cambridge Aquatic Sciences &
Fisheries Abstracts, and Cambridge Environmental Science & Pollution
Management are being implemented with Ovid software, to appear on CD-ROM,
networks, and online. Additionally, Ovid plans to create electronic
implementations of four academic databases--Bowker's Books in Print, the MLA
International Bibliography, PAIS International, and Sociofile. Each will be
equipped with Ovid software.

CAMBRIDGE DATABASES

     Cambridge Life Sciences Collection covers the international literature of
over 21 separate life science disciplines, including cell and molecular
biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, biotechnology, entomology, ecology,
immunology, microbiology, genetics, agriculture, and veterinary science. The
database is derived from 22 journals which abstract and index 6,500 worldwide
publications.

     Cambridge Aquatic Sciences & Fisheries Abstracts is the leading database
in aquatics science, produced in collaboration with four UN agencies and a
network of national research centers. Coverage includes developments in the
science, technology, and management of marine, freshwater, and brackishwater
environments and organisms.

     Cambridge Environmental Science & Pollution Management covers relevant
fields across the environmental sciences, monitoring 1,500 primary journals,
monographs, and conference proceedings and providing selective coverage of
5,500 secondary sources. The database is drawn from the primary sources for 11
abstracts journals. It covers the ecosystem and all forms of pollution,
including air, marine, and freshwater pollution; environmental engineering,
toxic hazards of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other substances; biochemical
applications in water treatment and pollution; and more.

     Ovid's implementations of all three databases will include special Ovid
features. Among these are Pull-Down Search Menus, combining field-specific
text descriptions with easy searching of all fields; Database-Specific Limits,
allowing users to restrict more precisely the result of a search to predefined
criteria, such as language, document type, and publication year; and Advanced
Output Configuration, permitting searchers to define the fields to be viewed,
printed, or saved.

ACADEMIC DATABASES

     Produced by the Modern Language Association of America, The MLA
International Bibliography indexes critical scholarship on literature,
language, linguistics, and folklore. The bibliography provides expansive
coverage of national literatures in more than 100 languages, as well as
linguistic research and analysis of every language family and group; it
contains entries for journal articles, series, monographs, dissertations,
bibliographies, proceedings, and other materials. In all, the bibliography
indexes more than 3,500 publications.

     The MLA International Bibliography on Ovid will incorporate the print
bibliographies since 1963 and will include more than 1.2 million records. Ovid
will offer the MLA thesaurus as a convenient pull-down tool, allowing
first-time users to employ the same concise vocabulary as experienced
searchers. A pull-down permuted index and a classification hierarchy will
further enhance advanced search techniques. Familiar Ovid features such as
on-screen search tips, database-specific limits, and configurable output will
make the bibliography exceptionally easy to use. The MLA International
Bibliography on Ovid will soon be available for networks and for fixed-fee and
pay-as-you-go online access. The database will be updated 10 times a year.

     Produced by Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), the PAIS
International database is a bibliographic index with abstracts covering the
full range of political, social, and  public policy issues. Coverage includes
documents published worldwide in any of six languages: English, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. The index headings and abstracts are
in English. Topics covered include economic, political, and social issues;
business; finance; law; international trade and relations; public
administration; government; political science; and any topics that are or
might become the subject of legislation. The database covers selected journal
articles, books, statistics, yearbooks, directories, conference, proceedings,
pamphlets, reports, government documents, and microfiche. More than 1,600
journals and over 8,000 monographs are indexed each year.

     PAIS International on Ovid will be available for stand-alone, network,
and online searching. Implementation features will include a Thesaurus and
Database-Specific Limits.

     PAIS International on Ovid will also include Configurable Output Options,
allowing users to define the fields that they view, print, and save.

     Bowker's Books In Print on Ovid will be available for stand-alone and
network searching and is already available via Ovid Online. Special Ovid
features will include Separate Records for each instance of a book title, an
Author Field that indexes an author's name and role (e.g, editor or
illustrator), and a Database-Specific Limits Menu that allows users to narrow
their searches without memorizing complex search codes.

     Produced by Sociological Abstracts, Inc., Sociofile is the leading
research database in the field of sociology and related social sciences,
including anthropology, economics, education, social work, and social policy
and development. The file provides abstracts from more than 2,400 core and
discipline-related serials (1974-present) published worldwide and enhanced
bibliographic citations of relevant entries from Dissertation Abstracts
International (1986-present).

     An Ovid implementation of Sociological Abstracts, the parent database of
Sociofile, is currently available online, and Sociofile will soon be available
for CD-ROM stand-alones and networks, as well as online. Ovid's version
features Automatic Natural Language Mapping to Sociofile's subject headings,
Database-Specific Limits, and a full Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms.

     For more information on the implementations of these CAS and other
databases, contact Ovid Technologies, New York, 212/563-3006, extension 400;
e-mail: sales@ovid.com. Visit Ovid's home page at http://www.ovid.com.

NEWSWIRE ASAP RELOADED ON DIALOG WITH PREDICASTS PRODUCT CODES

     Information Access Company (IAC) has announced that IAC Newswire ASAP
(File 649) has been reloaded on DIALOG with Predicasts Product Codes to
enhance searching capabilities. Also, as part of the Newswire ASAP reload, the
file is now available to non-North American searchers.

     Newswire ASAP provides the full text of wire stories from key worldwide
news sources. Among the wire services currently covered are Business Wire,
Newsbytes, and PR Newswire. It becomes the sixth IAC database on DIALOG to be
reloaded and standardized with DIALOG's uniform fields this year. Uniform
field tags facilitate cross-file searching across the entire DIALOG system.

     Newswire ASAP offers both current and retrospective information on
companies, industries, products, people, trends, and technologies. It provides
historical perspective and current awareness on worldwide events, helpful for
tracking global political and economic news, conducting competitive
intelligence, and monitoring worldwide industry and technology.

     The complete text and indexing of wire stories are usually available for
searching within 36 hours of transmission, according to IAC. All words within
the text are searchable, facilitating searches for quotes, figures, or any
mention of a company name or personal name found in the text. Controlled
vocabulary searching may be used to limit searches to substantive stories
about specific companies, industries, products, people, or events.

     In addition to the standardization, a significant enhancement to topical
searching is now available in Newswire ASAP with the addition of Predicasts
Product Codes. Predicasts Product Codes provide a hierarchical numerical
coding system that enables online searches to focus as broadly or narrowly as
required. Predicasts Product Codes, which include over 21,000 unique codes,
are also available on IAC Promt and IAC Trade and Industry Database, and other
IAC databases. The addition of this coding system enables users to combine
other Predicasts-coded IAC business databases using DIALOG OneSearch.

WILL TODAY'S DATABASES SURVIVE? A QUESTION OF VALUE

     by Leonard M. Fuld

     [Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of three articles by
publishing consultant and writer Leonard Fuld addressing the future of online
databases and the changing information climate. His two subsequent articles
will run in the February and March issues of "IT."]

     The information Ice Age is here. The Internet has opened the information
seeker's mind. Yet, at the same time, it may have begun the Ice Age for
traditional databases. As found on the Internet, information has become cheap
to get and relatively easy to find. Not that the data is necessarily high
quality or even timely; it's just that it's low in cost and may actually meet
the average person's needs. Practically overnight, large numbers of folks who
are not info-junkies or trained information professionals have discovered
electronic information. The big question facing the database producers now is:
"What do we do for an encore?"

     Database publishers should take a lesson from rock-and-roll bands. Like
rock bands, databases have seen evolutionary change: creation, extinction,
absorption, and even enhancement. I remember seeing a family tree of sorts
that tracked the path that rock-and-roll has taken, where particular musicians
have gone, what band they joined, and where they moved next. Databases have
followed a similar course of development. The ones that did not meet a need
died. Those that did meet a need either grew or were merged into larger data
pools.

     Database historians looking back at the late 1990s will likely point to
this period as one of meteoric change. They will indeed have a great deal of
material from which to draw their conclusions. Just examine today's electronic
publishing headlines:

     --   Low cost + sophistication: InfoSeek, an inexpensive Internet search
service, is accessed over 1 million times a day and processes over 500,000
full-text inquiries. The basic monthly subscription charge is $9.95, with
relatively modest search fees for some special services it offers. InfoSeek
Search includes such databases as Associated Press Online, Reuters Business
Report, Commerce Business Daily, and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. The
service even offers customers the ability to create relatively sophisticated
information filters. These filters will help customers limit the amount of
information they need to see. Has InfoSeek laid down the gauntlet to DIALOG
and LEXIS-NEXIS? You bet. Is this cheap, low-quality information? No, just
reasonable information, inexpensively obtained.

     --   "Have it your way," two lines of attack: PR Newswire, a database
containing corporate press releases from many (but a limited number) of U.S.
corporations, leapfrogged traditional database delivery systems. You can now
tap into PR Newswire directly through the Internet, or you can phone an
automated faxback system. By calling a special number and following the menu
directions, you can order one or a series of press releases--all at no charge
to the caller. Use the phone pad or the keyboard; it makes no difference to PR
Newswire. Either way, you get the data.

     --   Volume discounts: CD-ROMs are making online access to directories
almost obsolete. Why pay thousands of dollars to access countless names online
when you can buy a series of discs that hold over 80 million names, addresses,
and telephone numbers for approximately $100?

     Instead of heeding these warning signals and racing to upgrade their
products or the means to deliver their products, many publishers and database
distributors have merely taken baby steps. Some have decided that growth
through acquisition of other databases is the way to fend off competition.
Others have improved their front-end search engine--or at least its
appearance. Is bigger necessarily better? Is prettier better than smarter?
These are questions demanding answers.

     To a certain extent, the larger and richer the database the more valuable
it becomes--up to a point. Big databases take more maintenance and become
difficult to tailor and enhance. Adding fields or features becomes a complex
task, as the data itself has become less uniform, more diverse than its
smaller predecessor. It is very possible future publishers will look back 10
or 20 years from now and view behemoth databases as data dinosaurs, not
malleable or user friendly.

     The survivors, the entities that will actually thrive, will do so because
they have adapted to the new information environment. In this environment,
there will be two classes of databases: those that are low priced, offering
little added value to the user, and those that charge a premium for
specialized data that have been--or can be--massaged.

     The low-priced databases will be forced to practically give away their
files and their data. These database publishers can expect slim margins. Their
users can expect rudimentary results and will not pay a high price for what
they receive. In contrast, the high-priced databases will deliver high-quality
results, not just data. Publishers of such databases will need to maintain the
infrastructure to retain the quality and to constantly add enhancements.

     Most of today's database publishers operate in the high-priced arena and
presumably would like to stay there. All this costs. They have built expensive
support, communications, and data processing facilities. I include the IAC,
Chemical Abstracts, and Derwent databases in this group. Yet the Internet is
forcing the price per unit of raw data down to extremely low levels. The
average consumer, even the corporate librarian pressed by a tight budget,
would rather choose the free alternative than the fee-based one.

     Plummeting database prices have already begun to squeeze the profits out
of the bottom line. Without the margins to support the existing business, the
traditional database publishing infrastructure itself may erode. The result
may be the bankruptcy of certain databases. This would be a loss to both the
publishers and to the public.

ACCESS, ACCURACY, AND ADDED VALUE

     If today's database publishers want to thrive in years ahead, they must
enhance offerings to their information-savvy public by dramatically improving
their product quality. The quality issue goes far beyond spell-checking or
indexing. It goes to the core of the product itself. Future database quality
will be measured by three criteria: access, accuracy, and added value.

     Access refers to the ease of entry into the system and to the data
itself. The more the user has access to the knowledge embedded within a
database, the more useful and user-friendly that database becomes. In
contrast, the greater the black box effect, the less the user will want to
use--or to pay--for that source. For instance, if a searcher needed to find
information on local area networks but just plugged in the term LAN, would the
database find all related terms and technologies? Right now, the answer is hit
or miss. The skilled searcher may know to look for all synonyms, but the
professor, salesperson, purchasing manager, or executive, who is frequently
the ultimate user, may not. Future database publishers will have to cater to
this group of decision-makers; besides, economics will dictate that databases
migrate to this broader population and further away from the librarian who is
often the database gatekeeper. These decision-makers want answers, not merely
data; the services that can most easily provide them with answers will win.

     In the future, access will mean that, despite the fact that searchers may
not have known all the relationships and technical synonyms, they will easily
find the complete answer. And if they can't find it in the high-priced
databases, then they will naturally select the low-priced database
alternatives, despite all the deficiencies and inconveniences they represent.
Even today, if PR Newswire offers some of the news (albeit biased), why should
the cost-conscious manager go to Information Access Corporation's PROMT or to
the Dow Jones or Reuters news services? PR Newswire's content may be biased
and somewhat unstructured, but it's also inexpensive and easy to find. For the
harried manager who just wants information, it may suffice.

     Accuracy is the second criterion and perhaps conceptually the easiest for
today's publishers to meet. Databases filled with errors or poor abstracting
will suffer alongside the more accurate ones. At the same time, error-prone
databases or those lacking specificity will lose against even poorly managed
Internet Usenet groups or Internet-available databases. After all, where is
the benefit in the consumer's eyes? Why pay for only partial or inaccurate
data, when you can get the equivalent for a lot less money?

     Unfortunately, accuracy, while important, remains the least visible of
the three criteria. Typographical errors aside, other types of errors are
elusive, only caught by a few. Once again, the busy manager or academic may
miss the inaccuracies, casting a longer glance at the final bill.

MORE INSIGHT, LESS DATA

     Finally, added value represents the greatest threat--and opportunity--to
database publishers in the 1990s. Database publishers are currently spending
great amounts of money on adding content to their information pool, without
doing much to enhance its value in the eyes of business decision makers (a
large part of the market). Decision makers want fewer, more focused
findings--not more data in the form of paper. Database producers need to add
this value. They need to create information summaries, or maps of the data,
anything that will help the consumer answer questions earlier and more
perceptively. Instead of receiving endless printouts, decision makers want
summaries that will help point them in the right direction. Users want these
systems to identify trends, and to winnow out the valuable from the valueless.
Users, in short, want insight, not just more data.

     Business managers want to receive early warnings of market shifts or a
competitor's new product development. They do not want to read more history
and countless articles repeating the same message over and over again. The
ultimate customers are willing to pay a premium for time-saving notices.

     Many of today's better-constructed databases already have the built-in
structure, the indexing, to offer their users a better end product. In
particular, I am thinking of the Derwent patent databases, Chemical Abstracts,
and the Predicast/IAC series with their specific product and event codes.
These and others like them contain embedded coding that should help these
publishers further enhance their end products' value. Give me a cluster
analysis of patents to help me determine a competitor's technology strategy,
or provide me with signs that a competitor may be changing its target market.
This is added value. In certain cases, third-party vendors offer some of these
solutions today. However, the publishers themselves need to offer these
products. They know their products best and would benefit the most from an
improved, more user-friendly deliverable.

     Either the publishers need to enhance the way they store the data, or
they need to work with concerns that can enhance the front end, the means to
massage the existing data. The more automated a database publisher can make
the product, the more data the user will need. It's a win-win situation for
everyone: the decision-maker as well as the publisher.

     Today's lack of added value has become the greatest barrier--a knowledge
barrier--for the online database world. I know many corporate executives who
refuse to examine the database printouts their library sends them simply
because the volume is too great, or the information gems are too difficult to
identify. The searchers themselves are often at a loss as to how to present
the data in a more sophisticated form. Hence, insights that the database
search could yield never surface. Critical knowledge is missed.

     Currently, the database industry apparently thinks it is delivering
value-added business information--at least as far as the advertisements read.
"Competitive intelligence" and "business intelligence" crop up in the database
press all the time. By and large, database publishers and the systems they use
to distribute the data do little more than group or compile it like pieces of
information. I have seen few products that truly analyze or even save the user
a great deal of time.

     True, publishers have found ways to pool data into blocks of information,
but they have failed to add enough value, to turn this information into
decision-producing intelligence. The information consumer realizes this. The
database community should be warned of the axiom: "Nothing kills a bad product
faster than good advertising." Publishers need to dramatically improve their
value-added offerings or suffer the consequences of dwindling usage.

     Publishers must learn how to mine the value inherent in their products.
Those that do will continue to command the value/price high ground. Their
customers will be equally happy with the improved, time-saving,
decision-producing results they receive.

     Whether or not the database world realizes it, its environment has
already begun to change. With an increasing number of sophisticated electronic
competitors entering this new world, the competitive climate is growing
harsher. The publishers and distributors that survive will be the ones who
recognize and act on this changing information climate.

WHAT'S AHEAD FOR 1996?

     Once again "Information Today" is starting off a new year with some
forward thinking by presenting the predictions of a number of executives
selected from varied segments of the information industry. We asked them to
tell us what they foresee developing in the industry and at their companies
during 1996 and beyond.

     Here's a look into the future of one of the most exciting, most
important, and most rapidly evolving industries--one that is taking the world
in new directions. Let's see where some of our industry leaders think we're
headed.

     Morris Goldstein
     Chief Executive Officer
     Information Access Company

     If 1995 was the year of Internet access, then 1996 is the year of the
World Wide Web. It is the beginning of an era in which content, computing, and
telecommunications converge, altering the world's business landscape as we
know it today.

     The center of activity in the computing world will shift from a
client/server platform to the World Wide Web. Large software players (such as
Microsoft, IBM/Lotus, and Oracle), as well as major online services (America
Online, CompuServe, and Microsoft Network, to name a few), will make the Web
environment their number one priority for software and service development.

     As part of this shift, we will see the emergence of groupware
capabilities for the Web, greater ease of use, expanded functionality, and a
dramatic acceleration of information usage among novice end users and
information professionals. In parallel, new publishing ventures will exploit
the commercial potential of the Web by developing low-cost, multimedia
alternatives to traditional print and electronic media, thus helping to expand
the information industry's financial model from a usage-supported paradigm to
one that is partially advertising supported.

     In a related development, specialty services such as executive
recruitment, travel, real estate, financial services, and insurance brokerages
will expand their Web-based offerings, enabling their customers to easily
locate business and leisure opportunities, weigh options, and make competitive
price comparisons.

     As corporations de-emphasize restructuring and reengineering to
concentrate on "top line growth" in order to command leadership positions in
their markets, 1996 will witness center stage growth in the areas of knowledge
creation and ongoing knowledge management. At the core of this opportunity
will be the corporate information specialist, whose expertise in monitoring
the external marketplace and creating actionable knowledge will be critical to
the successful outcome of daily corporate decision making. Companies that are
tuned into the dynamic nature of this process will commit budget funds to the
creation and management of knowledge as a means of stimulating innovation and
revenue growth.

     At the same time, public and academic libraries will develop as the
preferred electronic information "hubs" for their communities and continue to
improve their services by offering remote access to patrons who wish to
utilize the Internet and other electronic services from their dorm rooms,
faculty offices, and homes. For this reason, many libraries will make
significant investments to support access to services that require intelligent
workstations.

     During a period of accelerating paradigm shifts, it's unlikely that the
information industry and even the concept of databases will remain status quo
 . . . but that's a good topic for next year's predictions!


     Steve Arnold
     President
     Arnold Information Technology

     A new medium has been invented in the last 12 months. "Internet" is the
word applied to a cluster of technologies that is blending and breeding at a
very fast rate. A normal publishing year has 12 months; the Internet year has
three months. No one doubts that for the electronic information community,
there are both opportunities and challenges.

     Over the next 12 months, five forces (what I call "vectors") will gain
momentum. The first is rising cost and competitive pressure in traditional
information companies. Particularly stressed will be those firms in legal,
scientific-technical, and professional publishing. The old models are
evolving, and authors are going direct to readers. Governments can no longer
afford to print paper copies of their prodigious output. The Internet is less
costly and does not kill trees.

     Second, the Internet makes available a delivery and content platform that
allows customers to experience information, not just read it. New businesses
will flourish in response to keen customer demand for old information in new
packages. The game model is replacing the reference book model.

     Third, the traditional database world is in the process of transforming
itself from text to a multiobject format. The result is a new syntax and
rhetoric packaged in compound complex digital documents (C2D2). Why just read
about an experiment when one can see it take place and examine the data sets
it generated.

     Fourth, the era of intelligent text processing and agents that perform
value-adding functions once associated with human workers will become part of
the desktop. New online companies will exploit these technologies
aggressively, meeting little or no resistance from established online "brand"
names. There are not enough human indexers or money to pay them. Software is
fast and comparatively economical.

     Fifth, the pace of change will enable the technologically adept and
disable the technologically inept. Companies that refuse to embrace the new
medium will fall far back in the competitive pack.

     The opportunities are unparalleled in the history of communications, not
just electronic publishing. For many firms and individuals, the challenges
have never been greater. One thing is crystal clear--once these vectors of
change have been let loose, they will be difficult to control.


     John J. Regazzi
     President and CEO
     Engineering Information Inc.

     Lately I find myself tossing off a phrase that I believe so well
describes the world today and especially the current nature of the information
industry. I wish I could attribute it to its proper source: "The future," it
goes, "isn't what it used to be."

     It seems a day doesn't go by without at least one article or news story
on the Internet. Whether the story concerns virtual reality programs from PARC
or the confluence of video, audio, and text via computer in the home, or just
old fashioned get-rich-quick scams in cyberspace, news stories abound. And why
not? Once communication lines were opened, the rush to gain knowledge, to
exchange information instantaneously, or just to send some informal messages
to colleagues was unstoppable.

     Dealing with this momentum of information exchange will color all of
1996. The scientific and technical information community, of which I am a
part, will embrace new credos in each of its sectors. Authors will find new
channels of scientific communication; primary publishers will digitize and
disseminate or die; secondary services, perhaps most vulnerable, will need to
rediscover how to link reader and writer by some other means than abstracts
and indexes; libraries will be forced to find a means of controlling
technology, lest they are eroded from within; and readers and researchers will
discover that the systems' "walls of silence" have come down, but that there
are no instant answers in this new digital world. In short, not what it used
to be.

     The year 1996 will also mark, I believe, a landmark, because of the
current breadth and pace of change in the information industry. Soon
researchers and managers will be able to roam the world seeking information
independent of time and space. Whether in an airplane over London or on a
commuter train outside Chicago, you'll be able to send a voice mail message,
a paper copy, or even a video image to your office in New York or Tokyo with
a simple effort. A wider variety of files will be available online and
digitally 24 hours a day, accessible anywhere in the world. The freedom and
breadth of universal access may be the most significant benefits of the new
communication and information technologies of our age. Access, retrieval, and
display technologies will dwarf the capabilities of today, making the fax
machine seem as quaint as the manual typewriter.

     The final shift in this new information world--the shift of
leadership--will be initiated in 1996. Information production and
dissemination, once a labor-intensive task, is fast becoming a process
involving two parts. The production of knowledge will be open to many, as
technology lowers the barriers of entry to the traditional publishing
business. Dissemination, however, will be a capital-intensive business,
reserved for the few who can afford to support global, nonstop markets. The
traditional mainstays of the scientific and technical information
infrastructure--the technical societies, governments, the not-for-profit
associations--will be greatly disadvantaged in this capital-hungry enterprise
and will yield their leadership positions to the multinational, publicly held,
global communications companies now emerging.

     The year 1996 will mark the passing of these and other mantles, and after
that . . . well, you know, the future is not what it used to be.


     Bela Hatvani
     President
     SilverPlatter Information, Inc.

     The year 1996 will see an impressive growth in electronic publishing and
distribution. We are encouraging and, more importantly, facilitating this
growth through our ERL Technology. With ERL, we are not only broadening the
possibilities for access to electronic information, but we are enabling
partners to publish their own ERL-compliant documents through our Partner
Publishing Program. We will expand this program dramatically in 1996, enabling
publishers throughout the world to bring up their own publications in
ERL-compliant form.

     We will continue to work with our partners by equipping them with the
tools that will enable them to create an ordered Worldwide Digital Library on
the Internet. Our program for document management will link the magnificent
compendiums of bibliographic reference files that we distribute for over 100
major information providers to full-text documents in a methodical way through
the Internet, through direct dial to document sources, through fax, and
through other methods.

     We will come out with beta releases of the World Integrated Library of
Documents (WILD thing). This project is focused on creating pieces of
interoperating digital library technology that will enable our collaborating
partners to co-create with SilverPlatter the first of many embryonic and
interconnected digital libraries, which will exploit our base information
store and which will also allow publishers and technology providers to extend
this base.

     We will continue to serve our library and end-user customers with
hassle-free products and services. We will be releasing the Search Advisor,
which enables information intermediaries to put their search strategies into
scripts to allow end users to ask simple questions from a simple interface and
get accurate results.

     This industry is just beginning. We are about to see a sustained
explosion that will continue to grow the industry in a creative and chaotic
way. It is an exciting time for all involved.


     Deborah M. Hull
     Chief Operating Officer
     Ovid Technologies, Inc.

     The year 1995 saw the proliferation of a powerful new model for
information retrieval--the World Wide Web. In spite of its drawbacks, it has
captured the popular imagination in a way that no technology has done since
the introduction of the PC. Just as the PC ultimately transformed the working
world even without living up to its touted potential in the home, the Web will
change forever the way that information retrieval is perceived. As a
distributed, client/server model that is easy to use and develop, the Web
makes manifest that information retrieval is for anyone, that it cannot be
contained within one collection or product, and that adherence to standards
can bring a certain unity and presence to what has previously been a
staggering variety of products for specialized audiences. The many, and even
serious, information retrieval problems of the Web will not put this genie
back in the bottle.

     At Ovid Technologies, we have already been fully committed to standards
in our products, including Z39.50, SGML, and the NISO Thesaurus. We are
embracing not just the Web but the information retrieval model it implies. Our
client/server system architecture and all our products are designed for
maximum flexibility in fitting into existing environments--locally at a
research site or remotely via our online service. More importantly, we have
built a rich infrastructure for linkages from our databases to other database
products; to local OPAC holdings via Z39.50; to expanded product views via
internal Ovid links (for example, linking all the articles from one issue into
a table of contents or linking a document to one similar to it); and to other
services via URLs. An increasingly important linkage for us is to full text
from bibliographic records; between the various structural elements of full
text; or between cited references and full text. We see our growing full-text
collections as increasingly important in the "post-Web" world, where the end
result of a search is naturally expected to be a document rather than a
citation.

     Although in 1996 many companies will be scrambling to make products and
services on the Web, those of us already in the information retrieval business
will do well to think creatively about bringing the advantages of our type of
products into the simplified, graphic world of the Web. I think that 1996 will
be the year in which information retrieval goes mainstream, affecting even the
"traditional" research models.


     Tim Collins
     Division General Manager and Vice President
     EBSCO Publishing

     Many key issues of 1996 will relate to the struggle to effectively use
technology to integrate numerous products and services into comprehensive
solutions that allow information professionals to provide service to users at
lower costs.

     We will see this with the way information from periodicals is searched
and delivered. Librarians will no longer need to contract with different
vendors for each of the following services: subscription service, current
awareness service, periodical abstract/index databases, online search and
retrieval service, and document delivery service. Companies such as EBSCO
offer services that allow librarians to provide access to table of contents,
abstract, ASCII full text, and image full-text data through one search. The
services provide the ability to order documents or to learn where in the
library these documents are located if they are not available electronically.

     Electronic access to databases will become even more distributed
throughout organizations. More searching will be done directly from faculty
and employee desktops and less will be done from central libraries. School
libraries will provide searching through larger networks in the library, and
the extension of searching to the classroom will become more prevalent. Public
libraries will offer online services through their growing networks and will
begin to provide access to more computers dialing in from homes.

     The World Wide Web will become more and more prevalent and will emerge as
a legitimate source for accessing quality commercial data through
sophisticated search and retrieval software. It will mature and no longer have
the reputation as a fun place to find interesting, but not critical, free
data. Libraries will begin to find themselves competing with consumer online
services and Web sites for the attention of their constituents. Careful
comparison of data being offered by these sources will become critical.

     Primary publishers of consumer titles will experiment with ways to
provide their data inexpensively online to the masses and will look to
advertisers to cover the costs of online service providers much the way they
cover the cost of printers and typesetters now.

     A significant number of primary publishers of scientific, technical, and
medical data will cross the threshold and make their data available
electronically. Many pricing models will be used but, by the end of the year,
some models will emerge as being viable for the long run.

     Customizing services to the unique needs of individual users will become
a more important component of success. As companies struggle to provide
comprehensive solutions that merge multiple products and services it will be
a challenge to include the customization that each separate product and
service provided when it was offered alone.

     The provision of training and support to library professionals on the use
of these services will be an important factor in the purchase decisions at
small libraries as well as for large state-wide projects.

     Competition will be fierce among information service providers as they
struggle to establish or maintain their place in this rapidly changing
industry. Those that will be successful will be the ones that integrate
technology effectively and provide practical solutions at reasonable prices.


     Joe Bremner
     President
     Database Development

     As always, there seem to be more questions than answers. It is good to
see that the publishing industry--not the telephone or computer companies--is
absorbing the electronic information business. Significant acquisitions have
been made by companies like Wolters Kluwer, Thomson, Reed/Elsevier,
Knight-Ridder, and Pearson.

     In the last Commerce Department survey, the U.S. publishing industry and
related services had total revenues of nearly $200 billion, while the
electronic information industry (separately classified by the Commerce
Depart-ment) was approximately $15 billion. There was no way that this $200
billion industry was going to sit by and watch someone else steal its
franchise.

     We have argued for many years that the ascendancy and growth of the
"online business" was really a publishing anomaly that would be absorbed into
the publishing industry once its capabilities and potential capabilities
matured and were recognized. Those capabilities include its being a natural
successor to the structures in place in the publishing industry for
researching, assembling, editing, presenting, and distributing all types of
information.

     The publishing industry understands these processes better than any of
the other competitors who are scrambling to define the multimedia future. The
depth and diversity of the skills present in the publishing industry will
challenge the ability of computer or telecommunications players; it is not at
all clear that the rapidly conglomerating "entertainment" or "multimedia"
conglomerates will have significant scale or distribution advantages.

     Why? Well, of course, it's the Internet, which, stated another way, is an
open network that provides a kind of access to distribution for small players,
a development that may be unique in industrial history.

     What does this view of the future mean? One of the significant effects of
technology in this environment will be continued disintermediation of
aggregators and distributors. In an open network environment, how does one
define where WESTLAW ends and America Online begins? Given the passable job
that existing intelligent information agents do, and imagining how much more
powerful their successors will be, won't these tools further level the
distribution playing field--the open Internet-based playing field?

     Do the fits and starts of the Microsoft Network reveal a lack of
strategic "publishing" skills mentioned above? If the playing field remains
open, and the technology exists, publishers will create their own electronic
environments, target their traditional audiences--programmers, pilots, brides,
bankers, business managers--and bring them to that environment, using all of
the skills that helped them "own" those audiences in the past, and they may
not need Microsoft or other online services to help them.

     What will this mean for players like UMI, NEXIS, and ISI? Will they be
able to develop value-added services to maintain their holds on distribution
rights granted by publishers?

     The only thing I am certain of is that life will be exciting.


     Dr. K. Wayne Smith
     President and CEO
     OCLC Online Computer Library Center Inc.

     In 1996, we expect to continue pursuing our public purposes of furthering
access to the world's information and of reducing information costs. We will
also continue to aggressively pursue our goals of making OCLC's services
available around the clock, around the world.

     In 1996, we believe the OCLC community of 21,000 libraries in the U.S.
and 61 other countries will be thinking most about the following:

     1)   The Internet, the World Wide Web, and Web software will continue to
          grab headlines and shift paradigms. They will impact planning for
          library services at the local, regional, national, and international
          levels.

     2)   Libraries will increasingly bring their organizational and retrieval
          skills to bear on the Internet. They will start helping people find
          information on the Internet.

     3)   Libraries will continue to move closer to their dream of an
          electronic virtual library that integrates technical services,
          public services, archiving, and other library functions into a
          unified whole. More library patrons will log on to their libraries
          from their homes or offices.

     4)   As the pace of technological change quickens, the gap between
          information haves and have-nots will continue to grow. Libraries
          already recognize this growing gap and will try to narrow it.

     5)   Electronic scholarly publishing will begin to come of age in 1996.
          There will be a critical mass of electronic journals available from
          publishers that will provide libraries with new service and
          collection options and readers with a new way of accessing journal
          information.

     OCLC will be active on all of these fronts in 1996, from developing a
Java interface for its electronic journals to leading 185 libraries in an
Internet resource cataloging project, to offering financial subsidies for
libraries to trade in their older workstations for state-of-the-art machines,
to providing new products and services that will further reduce libraries'
costs.

     The OCLC community will mark the 25th anniversary of the OCLC Online
Union Catalog (OLUC) in 1996. With its 34 million records, some 600 million
location listings, and its more than 4,000 years of recorded knowledge in 360
languages, the OLUC has become a unique information resource highly valued by
scholars and researchers around the globe. It is a good example of what is
possible and probable on the emerging, global, digital, information highway.


     Patrick J. Tierney
     President and CEO
     Knight-Ridder Information, Inc.

     Organizational reengineering, converging technologies, and global
economics are inexorably reshaping the way organizations use information.
Managers must recognize that productivity is key, and no single information
product can satisfy all the requirements of all information users.

     Increasingly, information specialists, our core customers, are redefining
the function of the information center to make the best use of new
technologies, to build and manage organizational knowledge, and to deliver
information throughout the organization. They are being asked to serve as
consultants as well as researchers; to provide a "virtual library," available
24 hours a day to the desktop; to synthesize information from both internal
and external sources, including the Internet; and to deliver it to their
corporate clients. At the same time, their clients are becoming more
information-savvy and are placing ever greater demands on them as information
specialists.

     To meet their needs, Knight-Ridder Information is focusing its efforts on
providing integrated information solutions -- those that enable these
specialists to gather and deliver information quickly on an enterprise-wide
basis. One key product, KR ProBase, was introduced in Europe and North America
in 1995. Its familiar Windows-based interface gives searchers fast, easy,
point-and-click access to the outstanding collection of DataStar
databases--without learning a new search language. In 1996, we will extend
that convenience to the DIALOG service as well.

     The Internet has become the hot new medium for communications, and more
and more, it is an advertising-based medium, which will have a dramatic impact
on the future of services developed for it. At the same time, the "Intranet,"
or internal network utilizing Internet technologies, is emerging as a way to
build information sharing systems, which can blend internal and external
information sources for use throughout the organization.  Taking advantage of
the opportunity to bring information solutions to the desktop, we are
introducing the first two products in a new line of end-user services: KR
BusinessBase for the Windows operating system and KR ScienceBase for the World
Wide Web. And to ensure network-based document delivery, our 1995 acquisition
of The UnCover Company will permit us to significantly enhance our KR
SourceOne delivery service.

     The changes we are observing are not restricted to the U.S. As
technological advancements circle the globe, there is an increasing worldwide
demand for easy access to local information, and in many cases we see
technologies such as wireless communications that leapfrog the existing
infrastructure. Our KR Global-Reach service was developed to meet this need.
Introduced in 1995 and rapidly expanding, KR GlobalReach uses the Internet to
bring vital regional data to countries around the world, in their local
business languages.

     As we enter 1996, we are at the dawn of a new era of customer
expectations for information services. To meet those expectations, information
service pro-viders must go beyond our traditional offerings to create an
integrated suite of new and innovative tools that help information
professionals extend their reach into all functions of their organizations and
help information users increase their overall productivity.

     President

     When I was younger, nothing used to turn me off to a discussion more than
when one of my seniors would say that something had already been tried or
done. Using a past experience to win an argument seemed irrelevant and unfair.
They were saying, in effect, that "There is nothing new under the sun," which
can destroy one's sense of adventure and discovery.

     However, now that I've been in the electronic information business for
over 25 years, I find myself in the position of feeling compelled to recall a
few pieces of history in order to justify my predictions for the future.

     In the mid-1970s, after a few years of relative obscurity, online
services such as DIALOG and SDC Orbit began to assert themselves as viable
tools for information delivery. In 1975 I happened to be in charge of
marketing at Data Courier, and I remember online royalties for our ABI/Inform
database reaching $40,000 that year, an amount we considered quite good.
Today, UMI, which now owns that database, enjoys online royalties in the
millions.

     But the story doesn't end there. Because the word spread that there was
money to be made in online information, a kind of gold rush mentality swept
over the information publishing community, and databases of every shape, size,
and subject began appearing on one online service or another. Putting
something up online seemed to be the straightest path to fame and fortune.

     What people tended to forget, however, was that online users were
actually being asked to pay for the information they retrieved, and it turned
out that putting something up online didn't make it irresistible. There were
many more databases that produced very little revenue or failed altogether
than there were success stories such as ABI/Inform.

     Similarly, in the late '80s and early '90s, CD-ROM technology burst upon
the scene, and the gold rush began again. I wonder how many CD-ROM discs are
gathering dust in publishers' warehouses because people simply didn't want or
need the information they contain, no matter how attractive the technology was
or is.

     We now find ourselves faced with a new technology, the Internet, and the
frenzy has started all over again. Getting something up on the Internet,
establishing a site on the World Wide Web--surely this is the path to fame and
fortune in the mid-'90s and beyond.

     Somehow I doubt it.

     What I really think will happen, and here comes my prediction, is that
the zillion or so Internet users will come to understand in 1996 that really
valuable, accurate, reliable information comes with a price tag--just as it
always did in print, on microfilm, on CD-ROM, or online. Solid intellectual
property costs money. And if it costs money, then it better serve a real need.
Marshall McLuhan notwithstanding, the medium isn't the message. The message is
the message.

     Therefore, I hereby declare 1996 to be the "Year of Content." (Accent on
the first syllable of "content.") And my advice to publishers is to first make
sure you've got something people really want, regardless of the medium of
delivery, before investing time and money in the technology du jour. The
consumer is wiser than we may like to believe.

QUINT'S ONLINE: Censorship as Marketing Opportunity

     By Barbara Quint

     What this country needs is some good five-cent censors.

     Before you report me to the ACLU or have me barred from the next dinner
dance of the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee,
let me explain. On second thought, go ahead and report me. It's a free
country. I can say whatever I want. On third thought, maybe I will amplify my
remarks. Expensive market studies have shown that readers of leading trade
press publications dislike one-paragraph columns. See how quickly commercial
interest can affect political correctness!

     Harry Cohn, the much maligned movie mogul who founded Columbia
Pictures--and of whom, observing the large crowd at Cohn's funeral, comic Red
Skelton remarked, "Just goes to show. Give the people what they want and
they'll turn out."--anyway, Harry Cohn used to drive producers and directors
nuts with his somewhat vulgar test for whether a picture worked or not. It
concerned an itch in his posterior regions. Regardless of the anatomical
location, any good marketer or product designer better have an innate gift for
recognizing rashes and other allergic reactions when it comes to consumers.
The best and most successful products scratch itches, wherever they may occur.

     Censorship is an itch of long standing, an itch that crawled out of the
caves with the human animal, an itch that won't go away. Considered on its
broadest level, maybe it shouldn't go away. Review your own lives, especially
those of you over a certain age (and any age is a certain age). Don't you find
yourself almost as appreciative of some of the things you have never known,
never heard, never thought of as you are of the things that you have? How many
of us shake our heads and tsk-tsk at the deplorable depravities of the "other
generation"? Of course, what each person considers depravity varies. For some
it may mean ladies without hats and gloves on a public street; for others it
means ladies of the street. Some may condemn rap music ("Albums to Commit
Felonies By"), others New Age sound ("Will somebody PUH-LEEZ shut that
elevator door?!").

     Basically most people want to engineer silences as well as sounds.
Perhaps we all should be intellectual and spiritual "tabulae rasae," cool
dudes open to all experiences. Then again, maybe many of us are already double
parked, too busy with the problems at hand to reflect on problems
unrecognized. Or maybe our personal learning styles only absorb and create
true knowledge in a quiet corner huddled around a limited and manageable array
of data. Hurricanes of data can lead even the chronically curious to shut the
door on an open mind--at least until the winds die down.

     And so people turn to censorship, to systems that shut off information
flow. The more massive the data flow and the more stress factors related to
the data content, the more the censorship reaction occurs. Can we stop it? No.
Should we try to stop it? Maybe not.

A P.C. DISCLAIMER

     A brief pause for political correctness. In this column, my definition of
censorship is very broad. The dark side of censorship usually occurs when
people try to control not just what they themselves experience, but what
others can experience as well. Although people may have a right to not listen,
to not research, to not have to argue their positions, they don't necessarily
have the right to force on others the same silence or to deny others the
information needed to satisfy personal goals and beliefs.

     Borderline areas occur when one person does have legitimate
responsibility for the minds of others, such as parents for children or
teachers for pupils. As a rule, the closer the monitor and the monitored come
to a peer relationship, the less the legitimacy of the control. So parents of
2-year-olds have more right to control the perceived reality of their progeny
than parents of 12-year-olds, and practically none over 22-year-olds.
Kindergarten teachers have more sway than college professors. Employers may
even have some rights over the minds of employees--at least when they're
paying the employees for their "thought time" and for the information services
they use to support the thinking. (Has anyone seen that America Online
commercial where the guy laughs that his boss doesn't know he's really playing
games at work? Censor!!)

     The demands of alternative values or alternative scenarios for reaching
the same ends can also complicate issues of censorship. People oppose
censorship because they do not want truth silenced, but people support
censorship because they do not want truth buried under a deluge of lies,
half-truths, and noise. Even ardent defenders of academic freedom, for
example, will often still endure the "censorship" of the peer review standards
of scholarship.

     Democratic governments have longstanding barriers erected by
constitutional law against controlling the minds and mouths of the individuals
the governments serve. Most protections against censorship focus on government
as censor, probably because of the inequality of power between individuals and
"city halls." However, a government's obligation to protect the lives of its
constituents elicits constitutionally valid exemptions, as in the classic
metaphor of "crying 'Fire!' in a crowded theater."

FILTERS NOT CENSORS

     Let's focus on "authorized censors," those authorized by the very best
authorities--individual users shaping their own information environments. When
searchers go shopping, they often look for what vendors won't provide them as
well as for what they will. Rather than censorship products, perhaps we need
a new name for these "wanted-information-only" services. What about
information filters? Some information filter services follow traditional
product lines, yet perhaps use more high-tech production modes. Others
constitute software that the individual can apply or ignore to suit particular
information flow problems. Others form the basis for developing new
information environments.

     Of course, all database designers censor merely by setting rules of
inclusion and exclusion and defining scopes of coverage. The Internet may have
brought back the '60s, tie-dye morality (or amorality, depending on your world
view), but even the most complacent among us would have to admit that
commercial online sources represent The Establishment. Actually some databases
have biases that can be useful. Look at PR Newswire, the collection of
electronic press releases, the "company line online," so to speak.

     Frankly, PR Newswire often serves as a useful filter. For one thing, it's
honest about its biases. Business articles that appear in newspapers or the
trade press usually invoke some journalistic credibility, although they often
consist only of rehashed press releases. Then again, sometimes searchers don't
want critical, investigative reporting; they just want the official line. And
sometimes knowledgeable experts get too cute, and the official line turns out
to be the truth after all. In any case, it's convenient to have a database
that filters for the "official" version of reality.

     Electronic mail management software has grown more sophisticated as the
threat to users' time schedules has grown more dire. Any e-mail and listserv
user who travels out of town for a week or more can tell you of the cold
terror awaiting on return to base. Why do you think they sell so many laptop
computers? They're defense mechanisms from online overload. "Post-Boolean"
search engines in some e-mail managers can now rank messages by relevance,
allowing users to set priority levels. Online e-mail managers can sometimes do
the same. Do users ever miss anything important? Maybe, but some users may
decide it's better than losing large chunks of every workday.

     It's not only e-mail that needs filters. Many voicemail systems offer the
option of ranking messages. And why do you think they put speakers on your
answering machine? Of course, none of us would ever be rude enough to not pick
up the phone until we identified the caller and maybe the reason for the call.
Naah!

     The Internet's propensity for electronic frontier freedom has led to the
introduction of "real" censors. Trying to avoid lawsuits, bad press, and
Congressional virtue, vendors have started supplying rating and blocking
tools, like the V-chip, against "naughty bits." As the Internet continues its
inevitable march, the need to categorize and rank content will increase.
Already services such as the McKinley Group and Point Communications promise
to identify the "best" and most reliable Web sites.

     As television and the home computer overlap, new product opportunities
may arise. Frankly, cable television, not to mention direct satellite
broadcasting, is already out of hand. Even with a "TV Guide," you cannot
identify everything you could view at any given moment. As an occasional
C-SPAN binger, I was overjoyed to see a forum from them on the new Microsoft
Network (MSN). Imagine my dismay when it turned out that they only loaded the
previous day's schedule. What the heck good is that? But if I had an online
guide to all of the C-SPAN schedule along with all of the other cable and free
television broadcasts, I could start to craft an infotainment product of my
own. If the computer could turn the television and/or VCR on and off, the
online guide could form the basis for filtering mechanisms.

     The other day I saw a rather rowdy panel on C-SPAN where several major
television producers pounded on a congressman advocating the V-chip. The
producers didn't want any rating system for violence, electronic or otherwise,
because they think it will deter advertiser support and effectively censor
some shows off the air because of removed funding. On the other hand, the
bluntest opponent of the V-chip inadvertently admitted his own censoring
habits. Children under 5 in his household cannot watch any television. They
can only watch videotapes from Disney. His personal parental programming got
me to wondering. What happens after age 6?

     When I was 6 and 7 and 8 and so forth, television operated under a rigid
broadcasting code that only allowed the pure of heart and mouth on the air.
Now that's not going to happen these days, and maybe it's for the best. On the
other hand, I'm not sure that Bart Simpson or the Terminator is desirable as
a universal role model for impressionable youth either. Maybe parents could
program restricted access during the daylight hours or when they're not home.
American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies show flicks filmed under
equally restrictive codes. Nickelodeon shows old television and kid programs.
For youthful viewing, we could add program selections from PBS stations,
Discovery Channel, TLC (The Learning Channel), and maybe some news broadcasts.

     Of course, some people would put a Boolean NOT in front of all those
selections and turn their filters the opposite direction. Hey! It's a free
country.

     Regardless of the product produced, information vendors should keep
monitoring users for situations that lead to complaints about too much data
noise or too much of the wrong kind of information stimuli. Battered consumers
are a market opportunity. Remember, "silence is golden."

DATABASE REVIEW: THREE NEW DATABASES EXTEND DIALOG BUSINESS AND SCI-TECH
DATA LEAD

     By Mick O'Leary

     The year 1995 was one of furious activity in the arena of online business
information. Three major services--DataTimes, Profound, and NewsNet--received
extensive makeovers, involving colorful GUIs, new pricing schemes, and more
databases. This occurred in a climate of anticipation around new market
entrants, such as Microsoft Network, which has content from many leading
business database producers, and forthcoming services from AT&T and MCI. Amid
all of this hype, some of the other established services may appear to be a
little behind the curve. Even venerable DIALOG looks like it has some catching
up to do.

     In recent years DIALOG, with its pricing scheme that still depends
heavily on connect rate and its lack of a flashy, graphics-laden GUI, has
lagged behind some industry trends. Nevertheless, when it comes down to
content, DIALOG is still looking over its shoulder at the followers. Although
others may proclaim themselves as the "leading" or "most comprehensive"
business service, DIALOG is unrivaled or, at least, unsurpassed. The
definition of the "best" business service is in the eye of the beholder, but
by several definitions, DIALOG remains top dog. For its coverage of companies
and industries, for its depth of U.S. and international information, and for
its collection of textual, numeric, and directory files, DIALOG can make the
strongest claim for being the most comprehensive online business service.

     Three new business databases announced on DIALOG during the fall
strengthen its position. Two of them, D&B European Financial Records and
Kompass Eastern Europe, enrich DIALOG's large collection of company databases.
The third, International Business Directory, fits with DIALOG's strengths in
both business and sci-tech information.

NEW DATA FROM D&B

     DIALOG and Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) have long been one of the strongest
online service/database producer partnerships. DIALOG was the first external
supplier for D&B and remains a major third party host for D&B databases. The
newest database, D&B European Financial Records, extends DIALOG's set of
detailed financial data to non-U.S. companies. European Financial Records is
comparable to Duns Financial Records Plus, which contains financials for over
a million U.S. businesses, nearly all of which are privately held.

     European Financial Records (EFR) covers 2.4 million businesses in 13
Western European nations. Those most heavily represented are the U.K., France,
the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, with smaller numbers of records
from Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra, and San Marino.

     The data in an EFR record is similar to that found in Duns Financial
Records Plus:

     --   Company profile with name, address, phone, primary and secondary SIC
          codes, officers, number of employees, banks, premises, and year
          started

     --   Corporate family, including subsidiaries with percentage of
          ownership, branches, and immediate parent

     --   Financials (including sales, profits, net worth, assets,
          liabilities, debts, and capital), assets and liabilities broken down
          into over a dozen items, and three years of annual totals expressed
          both in local currency and in U.S. dollars

     --   Thirteen key ratios, with three-year annual totals

     Most of these fields are searchable, so that a record can be customized
to almost any desired set of fields. The ability to pick and choose among data
elements is welcome in this expensive database--a full record is $75 and
connect rate is $90/hr.

     EFR must be used with the same caveats that apply to DFR and other D&B
databases. Many company records are not complete and may have only summary
financial information. Figures may be D&B estimates when data from the company
itself are absent. Financials are also based on annual totals, which may not
reveal the company's current situation.

KOMPASS LINE EXPANDS

     European company information is also the focus of the latest in the
Kompass series. Unlike the D&B files, which concentrate on financial data, the
Kompass databases emphasize product information with detailed product listings
from thousands of companies worldwide.

     The Kompass databases are produced by an international consortium of
business directory publishers. Other Kompass databases cover Western Europe,
the U.K., and the Asia/Pacific region, as well as several individual
countries. They concentrate on manufacturing and industrial firms that sell
business-to-business, including related service companies. Kompass Eastern
Europe lists 100,000 companies from Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Croatia, and the Yugoslav region.

     A Kompass record provides a brief company profile containing name,
address, phone, fax, type of business (manufacturer, distributor, etc.),
industry sector, sales, number of employees, principal officers, and summary
parent/subsidiary information. Product line information is more specific, with
a thorough listing of the company's products and services. They are arranged
according to the Universal Commodity System, a classification widely used in
Europe. The system classifies 45,000 different products and services, allowing
for precise description of a company's product line.

     Most fields in a Kompass record are searchable. Product terms are
arranged hierarchically so that a search on a broad product class will
retrieve all of the more specific subclasses within it. Befitting Kompass'
wordly flavor, records can be obtained in English, German, French, Spanish, or
Italian; product names can be searched in any of the languages. The records
for each country are updated annually on a rotating basis; thus, at any time
a given record may be substantially out of date. Kompass Eastern Europe is
exclusively on DIALOG, where it joins several other Kompass files.

TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRANSFER

     The International Business Directory is misnamed, since it is actually a
directory of technologies for transfer from both profit and nonprofit
organizations. It is based on the The World Bank of Licensable Technology, a
directory produced by the Canadian Industrial Innovation Centre.

     The database lists over 26,000 technologies that can be licensed in
manufacturing, chemicals, electronics, medicine, agriculture, energy,
construction, and communications. Technology descriptions are provided by
hundreds of licensing organizations including companies, research labs,
universities, and government agencies. The directory is international, with
input from over three dozen countries, although three-quarters of the content
comes from the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.

     Each record briefly describes the technology, its uses and advantages,
development stage, patent number, and licensing terms. Not all records have
this complete description; many have only summary descriptions and may lack
other record elements. Records also contain supplier information, industry
sector names, and a contact person. Most record fields are searchable.

     The International Business Directory is DIALOG exclusive. As a mixed
business and technical database, it is a small but useful addition to DIALOG's
great collections in each area. DIALOG's status as the leading business
service may be subject to honest dispute, but as the best common source for
business and sci-tech data, there is no question.

     [Mick O'Leary has been using and writing about online information for
over 15 years. He is the director of the library at Frederick, Maryland, and
a principal in The Data Brokers, an information consultancy.]


                       D&B EUROPEAN FINANCIAL RECORDS
                           KOMPASS EASTERN EUROPE
                      INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DIRECTORY

     SYNOPSIS

          Three new business/product directories provide detailed financial
     and product information for millions of companies, especially in Europe.
     They extend DIALOG's unsurpassed collection of company and business
     databases.

LEGAL LINE: LAW FIRM HOME PAGES MADE EASY

     By Cary Griffith

     One of the most memorable announcements of 1995 was West Publishing's
plans to create home pages for the more than 800,000 attorneys listed in
"West's Legal Directory." At the time, it was the kind of announcement that
surprised many people, considering the amount of work the project would
require. But now two occurrences make West's announcement even more memorable.

     Six months after the announcement, the legal industry is beginning to see
the results of West's labors. These results are worth some examination.

LEGAL INDUSTRY INTEREST IN THE INTERNET IS GROWING

     In six months the legal industry's attention to the Internet has gone
from marginal interest on the part of a few practicing attorneys to something
much more significant. How significant? An anecdotal survey of large law
offices finds that, of the dozen or so contacted, all either had home pages,
were contemplating home pages, or at the very least had Internet access. For
some their presence may be limited to simple access through a local Internet
provider. But if you ever get on the Internet with a World Wide Web (WWW)
browser, you'll find that the legal industry's Internet presence is taking
some interesting turns.

     At the 1995 ABA TechShow, the Internet presentations were among the most
attended sessions. At the time (March 1995), over 50 medium or large law firms
were listed as having WWW home pages. Today, even barring West's announced
home page development, the number is too great to count and still growing.

     Why are law offices expressing an interest in WWW home page development?

     "It allows people in the general public to obtain information about a
firm without any barriers," says Joe Lester, a Bloomington, Minnesota,
attorney who offers a Web site focusing on business and technology law
(http://www.mnlaw.com). Like many other Internet observers, Lester points to
two important features that make an Internet presence worth considering,
particularly for law offices.

     Once a home page is located, most provide the researcher with a variety
of information they can't find anyplace else: links to examples of the
attorney's work or links to related home pages or subjects that can be very
useful.

     "It's an alternative to going to a printed directory," explains Lester.
"You can [do a] search, based upon categories of information, that would lead
you to a variety of firms, and then from there, link into more specific types
of information that may or may not be of interest."

     Another reason Internet observers like Lester are pointing to the
importance of an Internet presence is because of the advertising/marketing
exposure. "For the firm it is extremely high-value marketing. The firm can
provide useful information, at a very low cost, that's much more accessible
than traditional print advertising or directories."

WEST'S HOME PAGE PROGRAM

     Given the growing importance of having an Internet presence, many firms
are trying to figure out how to get started, without realizing they may
already have a WWW home page.

     According to a press release dated August 3, 1995, West Publishing was in
the midst of creating "home pages for all of more than 800,000 profiles
contained within West's Legal Directory (WLD) . . . West Publishing will
create a WWW home page for each of the private practice attorneys, law firms,
corporate counsel, government attorneys, and other legal professionals listed
on WLD. Each home page is accessible free of charge to users browsing the WWW
and to clients interested in gathering information on legal professionals."

     Part of West's continued development includes improving the e-mail field
for each WLD profile so individuals have easier access to Internet e-mail. And
each professional's WLD profile will have an Internet URL field. The URL field
will link the user to the firm or attorney home page. In this way WLD will
become a locator for each attorney's home page.

     The preceding commits to a significant amount of home page development.
Unfortunately, in many cases those home pages will not reach their full
potential. Unless attorneys take an interest in their home pages, they won't
provide any more information than what's already noted in their WLD listing.
But it's worth noting that West's press release went on to state that "in
addition, West is offering an opportunity for law firms to customize the
design and information contained with their Internet home page."

     For a sample of an informative home page design, consider the law offices
of Briggs and Morgan (http://www.briggs.com). Internet users accessing this
site first view an introductory page like the one depicted in Figure 1.

     The introductory screen contains little more than the Briggs and Morgan
logo and a phone number. But notice the reference to "Briggs and Morgan's Web
Pages." The plural is significant, because if you scroll through Briggs'
introductory screen you'll find it's actually very brief. In fact, the entire
home page takes up approximately three screens. But each Briggs screen is
packed with a lot of information, and the details can be acquired by simply
pointing and clicking.

     Anyone who has spent much time browsing the Internet will recognize this
design. The beauty of the Briggs page is in its simple design and in the way
it leaves further perusal to the browser. For example, if I wanted to view the
biographical listing for a Briggs attorney, I could simply click on the
Profiles icon (third from left near the middle of the screen--see Figure 2).
That takes you to a list of Briggs and Morgan Attorney Profiles, which
identifies every Briggs attorney in alphabetical order. If you want to see
more information on a particular attorney, simply click on the person's name,
and you're taken to the full WLD listing for the attorney.

     Similarly, if I was interested in learning more about Briggs' practice,
I could click on About or Practice. If I wanted to learn more about the
advantages of Briggs' law firm I could click on Advantages. And if I wanted to
view some of their publications, I could click on Alerts or Other
Publications.

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR

     How much does it cost to get West's assistance in creating a customized
home page on the Internet? According to West, it depends on what you want to
list. But general costs can be anywhere from $1,500 per year (for solo
practitioners) to several thousand dollars a year for a large law firm with a
very detailed listing. The price really depends on firm size and on the
complexity, layout, and content of the home page design.

     However, if a law firm compared the prices of outsourcing or setting up
a home page itself (design of home page, establishing themselves as a WWW
site, etc.), the costs would easily exceed $30,000. Similarly, if a firm
outsourced the design of a home page and rented space with a local Internet
provider (to house the home page) the approximate annual costs could be as
much as $9,000.

     West offers an extremely comprehensive service, guaranteeing what it
calls 7/24: The home pages are available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
West also offers a directory that can be searched in a variety of complex
ways, enabling users to find home pages for attorneys they would otherwise
have to find through other, weaker search engines.

     Interested users can view a demonstration firm site on the Internet.
Tennyson & Keye, a fictitious law firm West created as an example of its WWW
home page services, can be found at http://demo.wld.com. If you have the right
equipment, you can even view the Tennyson & Keye home page's video
presentation.

     One surmises that West is offering all firms a home page as both an
enhancement of its directory and as a way to give those attorneys not
currently participating with a full page in the directory more enticement to
do so.

     Nothing in life is free, but if you compare the price of going out and
creating your own home page (a process I'm in the middle of--and I expect it's
going to cost around $50 per month, which doesn't include the actual page
creation), West's deal looks very good.

CONCLUSION

     1995 was a year of both remarkable news and phenomenal growth on the
Internet. On occasion, both of these phenomena intersected. West's
announcement regarding home page development was the kind of intersection most
attorneys appreciated.

     Providing home pages for the attorneys listed in WLD not only makes
marketing sense for WLD but also presents a great marketing opportunity for
every attorney practicing today.

CD-ROM COMMENTARIES: WHAT WILL DRIVE CD-ROM DRIVES IN 1996?

     By Peter Jacso

     Survival instinct, that's what will drive them. CD-ROM drive
manufacturers (and CD-ROM database publishers) have been under a great deal of
pressure lately from all sides. The phenomenal growth of Internet access, the
plummeting price of hard disks with gigabytes of capacity, the incredibly
successful ZIP drives of Iomega, the launching of the phase-change dual
technology (PD) discs, and the promise of super-high-density discs prompted
many industry observers to write obituaries for CD-ROM.

Count me out. I still believe in the feasibility of CD-ROMs. There have been
constant improvements in CD-ROM technology. We saw some of this in 1995; more
will come in 1996.

TRANSFER RATE IMPROVEMENTS

     CD-ROM drives had been tagging along at the 150 KB/second transfer rate
for quite a time, until the first double-speed (2x) drives--transferring 300
KB of data per second--appeared on the market in 1992. Single-speed drives
were acceptable for text and audio databases. Single-speed, however, turned
out to be inappropriate for animation and the first video clips, even if they
were of postage stamp size. This ushered in first the double-speed and, in
1993, the unusual triple-speed (3x) drives from NEC. They were followed in
1994 by the first quadruple-speed (4x) drives and another odd drive, the
quintuple-speed from NEC. There are other drives with odd transfer rates, such
as the 4.5-speed Toshiba, Panasonic, and Plextor models, and the 4.4-speed
Pioneer.

     The rate at which transfer speed has been increasing since 1992 has been
quite impressive. It was obvious that we wouldn't have to wait long for
sextuple-speed drives, and, indeed, in 1995 they arrived from NEC, Plextor,
and TEAC. Mitsumi, the number-one drive manufacturer for OEM purposes due to
its low prices, has a 6x drive for less than $300 (which translates to about
a $200 OEM price). This time, Mitsumi doesn't skimp on buffer size, featuring
a 128 K buffer. Toshiba demonstrated its 6.7-speed XM-3701 drives (in both
internal and external versions) at Fall COMDEX. Why 6.7x? Because it just
breaks the 1 MB/second transfer rate and is certainly a good eye-catcher in
the ads.

     Yes, you guessed right. The first 8x drive--from Diamond--just started
shipping, and NEC and Chinon plan to ship their 8x drives by the time you read
this. Others may join the fray, although I am somewhat skeptical. I wonder if
it is worth stretching the transfer rate further at this time. To achieve this
speed, the discs must be spinning at 4,000-5,000 revolutions per minute,
depending what part of the disc is being read. (Your Walkman spins the disc at
about 450 rpm, for the sake of comparison.) This generates a lot of heat,
noise, and resonance, and may not result in a perceivable performance
improvement for the user.

     Though motion video could benefit from faster transfer rate, it is
unlikely that there will be any multimedia titles that would include video
recorded with a view toward this 1.2 MB/second transfer rate. Title developers
in 1995 still optimized their video compression for the double-speed drives
(still the largest segment of CD-ROM drives). This will probably change this
year for the annually updated or newly released titles, which are likely to be
optimized for a quad-speed, 600 KB/second transfer rate that will become
dominant in drives. Running such titles on drives sporting transfer rates
higher than quad speed is only marginally beneficial, except when files are
copied (instead of being played back) from the CD-ROM, as in the case of
installing program suites.

     Displaying text and playing audio files from an application do not call
for a higher rate than 150 KB/second. Still images shown as a slide show even
with recorded narration are more than happy with a quad-speed transfer rate,
so why torture the mechanical parts of the drive by spinning it madly? It is
like running to the bus stop even when there is no bus in sight. Much more
important is the balanced performance of the drive. Transfer rate is only one
element of the drive's speed. Equally important is the access time of the
drive.

ACCESS TIME IMPROVEMENTS

     In order to transfer data, first the read mechanism has to get to the
appropriate section. This is known as access time, measured in milliseconds
(ms). This has also improved by the same factor as transfer rate over the
10-year timespan, but in a reverse pattern. The first drives had 900- to
1,000-ms access time (and IBM's entry to the field was via a drive with a
pathetically high 1,500-ms access time and a ridiculous price tag of $1,200).
In a year or two, access time halved, then went down to 300- to 350-ms,
stagnated there for a while, and now typically hovers around 200 ms.

     A few current drives and most of the new ones that will come out this
year sport access times of less than 200-ms. This is very important, because
users jump from sector to sector not only in bibliographic databases (e.g.,
when a subject search yields records scattered all around the disc) but also
in multimedia applications (e.g., when a hyperlink is activated to jump from
the article on Hungarian music to the biography of Franz Liszt). It is rather
disappointing (and misleading) when a headline in a good magazine that sells
about a million copies claims that "Speedy 6x Drives Make CD-ROM Searches a
Snap" ("PC World," December 1995). It is akin to saying that faster planes
make getting from New York to Boston a snap. Flying time and commuting time
between the city and the airport together define the effective travel time.
There may be some further improvements in decreasing access time but the
current champion, the Plextor 4Plex with a 135-msec average access time, will
be hard to beat soon.

JUKEBOX IMPROVEMENTS

     For quite a long time Pioneer was the only manufacturer of a jukebox
(CD-ROM changer) accommodating six discs in a cartridge. Then came the
seven-disc version from Mountain Network in 1994. These were a godsend for
such megadatabases as MEDLINE or the CDMARC database from the Library of
Congress. There were significant innovations in late 1995 that will have an
impact on the market in 1996.

     Gateway started to include (for a $100 premium) dual-disc minijukeboxes
last year. NEC released four-disc, then seven-disc minichangers, both with a
quad-speed transfer rate. They had the attractive innovation of not requiring
you to handle the entire cartridge when replacing a disc but just ejecting and
inserting a single disc. The 350-ms access time, however, was a letdown. NEC
probably will improve on both jukeboxes in trying to catch up with the new
six-disc Pioneer changer sporting 4.4x transfer rate and 150-ms average access
time. With the ever increasing availability of ready reference titles, even
home users will demand such CD-ROM changers--at a reasonable price--to hold
several discs on tap. There are super jukeboxes storing hundreds of discs
quasi-online, and these will facilitate the management of such gigantic image
databases as UMI's Business Periodicals Ondisc, Ovid's Core Biomedical
Collection, and other upcoming CD-ROM megadatabases.

PORTABILITY IMPROVEMENTS

     The most visible CD-ROM technology development in 1995 was the
proliferation of CD-ROM drives built into the latest generation of notebook
computers. There are many users, however, who don't have built-in CD-ROM
drives in their notebook computers. Until now, the best they could do was to
have a double-speed CD-ROM drive with a parallel port connector (less commonly
with a PC Card, or PCMCIA, Connector), and with a bulky AC adapter. This
scenario is also going to change.

     There were plenty of stylish, sleek, affordable, and more powerful
portable CD-ROMs at the COMDEX show, and mouth-watering promises for the first
and second quarter of 1996. PC Card-type connection is to become the norm. The
double-speed PacRIM Labs CyberMan CD is remarkable for including a 16-bit,
44-KHz, wavetable synthesis chip and a 256 K buffer in the CD-ROM--which is
multisession-capable and also plays CD-i discs. EXP Computer, Inc. was the
first portable (if somewhat bulky) parallel-port-based CD-ROM player that did
not require an AC adaptor. It now has the drive with a PC Card interface, and
promises to have quadruple- and sextuple-speed drives by June. These, however,
will require an AC adapter because of the significant power consumption.

     CNF Inc. and Chase Advanced Technologies offered the two most stylish and
lightweight double-speed portable drives, the Cardport CD and the DISQ,
respectively, at the very competitive price of $220 to $230. Both companies
promise a 6x portable drive by March or April. Axonix--a longtime provider of
portable CD-ROM drives for notebook computers--has both 4x and 6x variants,
with an amazing 160-ms access time. Axonix is currently testing the
possibility of using the keyboard connector for power supply instead of a
separate adaptor. I am not the only one who would be overjoyed at this,
because in notebook computing every ounce and extra cable count.

     Even at these aggressively increasing transfer rates and moderately
decreasing access times, CD-ROMs will remain an order of magnitude behind
current hard disks on both counts. But they were never meant as hard-disk
replacements. The alternative media and drives (magneto optical, phase-dual,
super-density, the ZIP, and the JAZ) that seem to be threatening CD-ROMs have
their own niche. As we shall see next month, they complement well what CD-ROMs
are used for these days.

CD-ROM REVIEW: "GALE BUSINESS RESOURCES:" GOOD CONTENT, CLUMSY INTERFACE

     By Linda Rosen

     Gale is known throughout the library community for high-quality reference
products in the form of books, online databases, and even CD-ROMs. That's why
it's so puzzling that the company's latest attempt to put many of its volumes
of business reference information on CD-ROM is so clumsy. If it weren't for
some of the useful content in this product it would not be worth looking at as
a viable reference tool for a library. As it currently exists, "Gale Business
Resources" is a misfire that can certainly be recovered if Gale puts some
development and effort into it.

     The main defect in the product is its interface. Amazingly, this is a
DOS-based product. Although there is a "graphical interface" through which the
user can navigate with a mouse, the buttons and screen design throughout are
very "non-standard." By this I mean that when you single-click on a button in
a Windows-based software product, you will get an immediate response. In the
"Gale Business Resources" product, you need to double-click on that button and
even then response is mighty slow. In a discussion with a spokesperson at
Gale, I learned that the intended market for this product was public and
academic libraries, who, Gale decided through its own research, were not using
Windows-based computers and were unlikely to do so until at least later this
year. Since business and corporate libraries were not a target market, Gale
decided to go with the DOS platform only. This is the main reason not to buy
the product now.

CONTENT IS KING

     Interface aside, (but it's extremely hard to ignore it while using the
product), some of the content and ideas that Gale has for the product have
merit. You can't go wrong with standbys like the "Encyclopedia of
Associations," "Companies and Their Brands," "Consultants and Consulting
Organizations Directory," and "Ward's Business Directory" (to name a few).
These appear to be the gems of the product in terms of content. Others include
"American Wholesalers and Distributors Directory;" "Business Rank-ings
Annual;" "Encyclopedia of American Industry;" "Finance, Insurance and Real
Estate USA;" "International Directory of Company Histories;" "Manufacturing
USA;" and "Service Industries USA."

     A total of 30 volumes of Gale's business references with full text of the
"Fortune 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission Reports" (on a separate
CD-ROM) and the "US Industrial Outlook" are also included.

     A selection of Gale products are available on CD-ROM and through online
databases. For example, the "Encyclopedia of Associations" is available in
both of these formats. "Gale Business Resources" brings many of the best Gale
reference products together in one place. The idea is great, but so far the
execution leaves much to be desired.

SEARCHING BY COMPANY, BRANDS, INDUSTRY, EXTENDED

     The main screen (which never leaves you, even if you don't want to see it
in the background the entire time) provides four buttons to begin your
research. So far, so good. But try to click on a button as you might in a
Windows-based application and nothing happens. Click again and finally the
system slogs through to the next screen. If you are used to working in DOS and
have the patience to endure yet another interface that doesn't look like or
behave like anything else you use, you might be willing to use this product.

     You cannot successfully run "Gale Business Resources" in a DOS window if
you are using Windows. The speed degrades so completely that it simply isn't
worth it.

     Select the "Company" button and you are presented with a scroll-type
listing of companies to choose from. The product includes information on
210,000 firms (many are divisions within a company). You have to choose a
company and then look at the brief profile to determine if it's really the one
you want. If you choose Novell as the company, for example, you are presented
with several listings: for Novell, Novell Inc., and Novell Corp., and it's not
initially clear which is the main one you want. You can choose to mark a range
of companies in this screen.

     Once companies have been selected, you can view the details in one of
several formats (Full, Brief, Mailing, or Custom). One company I chose had
only SIC and brands listed but no mailing address information. It's hit or
miss. Move from the Company Information screen to Industry Information, and
you are offered a listing of SIC codes and descriptions for the industries in
which the companies are engaged. Industry Information that's available for
most of the industries on this disc includes Market Share Reports, Rankings,
Articles & Essays, Associa-tions, and Statistics.

     In my quest to find information on the software industry I viewed each of
the items available. Market Share Reports is data culled from Gale's "Market
Share Reporter" and tends to be quite dated, especially for information on
this fast-paced industry. Rankings, too, tended to have data not much more
current than 1993. Articles & Essays appears to come from the "Encyclopedia of
American Industry" and does not include current articles from industry
publications. For the report on software, the very latest information included
was excerpted from a March 1994 article. Articles & Essays should more
properly be called Industry Background and History. Current, it is not.

     The Associations section is, of course, based on the "Encyclopedia of
Associations." This has always been a great product, so it's hard to look bad,
even in this clumsy interface. If your goal is to find associations, however,
the books, online version, or dedicated CD-ROM version are better choices.

     Statistics appear to come mainly from the "U.S. Bureau of the Census and
County Business Patterns." This again is not current data (no fault of Gale),
but Statistics might not be the right moniker for this section--again, it
might be more accurate to call this section U.S. Government Industry
Statistics.

BRANDS AND THEIR COMPANIES, COMPANIES AND THEIR BRANDS

     One of the more useful resources in this product is Gale's "Companies and
Their Brands," searchable through the Product and Brand Name button on the
main menu. You can find information on more than 116,000 brands and 15,000
products in 1,000 industries. The same procedures apply as with a company
search. You choose a brand or product name with a scrollable list, mark the
ones you want, and then look at the companies with which those brands are
associated. You can then move into company or industry information as
described above. Again, if the interface and speed of the product were at all
modern, this could be a very useful tool for finding brand information and
then exploring the companies and industries associated with it.

EXTENDED SEARCH

     Ostensibly, the Extended Search option from the main menu allows you to
simultaneously search multiple fields in the "Gale Business Resources"
database. As the manual suggests: ". . . you could search for all software
companies in California with revenues between $100,000 and $250,000, or all
companies with a 212 area code that manufacture ophthalmic goods." Although
the capability is there, the execution of the interface and the slowness of
the search system bog down this process. The Extended Search is built around
a series of tab cards that each offer a different access point to the data. As
in other parts of the program, the response you get by clicking on these cards
is not what you would expect in a Windows application, but it sort of looks
like it and kind of behaves like it.

     Extended Search "Cards" are available for Contacts (company name,
officers' names, parent company, phone), Location (city, state, ZIP code, area
code), Industry (SIC, industry description), Scope (number of employees, year
founded, revenue, stock exchange, ticker symbol), Profile (description of
business, publications, seminars, and special services offered by the
company), and Products (brand name and description). The concept is good, the
underlying information is uneven, and the search software is inadequate for
this type of sophisticated search. Too bad, it would be great otherwise.

SEC REPORTS AVAILABLE

     If you happen on a company for which an SEC report is available (1,000
10K reports are included for top public companies), you'll see an SEC Report
button to choose in the company profile. Click on this and the system will
prompt you to insert the second CD-ROM, which includes the full text of these
reports. Awkward, but not unreasonable.

A FINAL WORD ON THE INTERFACE

     An additional ongoing problem with the program is the lengthy text
screens that provide no other navigation mechanism than to continually press
the Page Down button on the keyboard or to double-click the mouse on the tiny
More button on the screen. There is no "slider" down the side of the text box
to indicate the length of the article or to be able to quickly navigate
through it. This makes exploration of the Articles & Essays section, for
example, quite painful.

     Information can be printed and exported from any portion of the program.
Exported data is put into an ASCII file and can also be downloaded as comma
delimited. Again, this is a clumsy way to deal with data today. Cutting and
pasting has become second nature to many people. Exporting to an ASCII file
and then bringing the file into a word processor harkens back to dark days of
database searching.

IN CONCLUSION

     The price for" Gale Business Resources" is $7,995 per year and includes
quarterly updates. If you priced out the separate costs for all of the
resources included in this product, the cost of having them on this one disc
is a good deal. However, access to the data is severely affected by the poor
interface and the value of the information is therefore compromised by this
inaccessibility. If you're going to spend nearly $8,000 for a CD-ROM product,
you probably won't be too concerned about buying a PC with Windows. Gale is
missing a great opportunity in corporate libraries and especially in small
businesses where a tool like this could be really valuable.

     Cut down on the price, modernize the interface and search software, and
remove the dated material from "Gale Business Resources," and you might really
have something.

MULTIMEDIA MEDLEY: COMDEX '95 AND MULTIMEDIA IN '96

     By Peter Jacso

     Las Vegas, which I visited recently to attend Fall COMDEX, claims to have
become a family destination. I had my doubts as I waded through the sleazy
complimentary magazines scattered on the sidewalks. But I have never doubted
that Las Vegas was the perfect host for this computer show, which it has been
for the past 17 years.

     The show has been getting bigger and better every year. This time, it
attracted 210,000 visitors and over 2,000 exhibitors. Multimedia was even more
at the heart of the show than it was in 1994, as it came not only from CD-ROMs
but from the hundreds of World Wide Web sites.

     As usual, a visit to COMDEX makes it easy to predict what computers and
information technology applications the next 12 months will bring into our
homes and offices. Here I only give a condensed report of what the multimedia
landscape is likely to look like, but in later columns this year I will
discuss particular issues more closely.

MULTIMEDIA TO GO

     The most impressive trend to me was the coming of age of affordable,
genuine multimedia notebook computers. IBM undoubtedly had the show stopper
with its incredible ThinkPad 760CD, featuring a 90 MHz Pentium, 8 megabytes
(surprisingly low) of RAM, a 12-inch active-matrix screen capable of 16
million colors at 640X480 mode, or 65,000 colors at 800X600 mode, a
1.2-gigabyte hard disk, a quadruple-speed drive, and an MPEG-2 chip for video
playback. All this in a sleek design. It's no surprise that this horsepower
allows stunning broadcast-quality video. At the $10,000 price (including
shipping and handling!), however, it will not be the mainstream multimedia
laptop in 1996. Nonetheless, it was as impressive as Batman's car.

     But there were also numerous notebooks capable of very decent multimedia
performance for $3,500 to $4,500. Among the big guns, Texas Instruments leads
the way in price/performance with its entry-level Extensa 550CD multimedia
notebook. For just under $3,000, it has a 75 MHz Pentium processor, 8
megabytes of RAM, 1 megabyte of video RAM, 10.4-inch dual-scan display (256
colors at 640X480), PCI bus architecture, 16-bit sound card, microphone and
speakers, 524-megabyte hard drive, and double-speed CD-ROM. Many lesser-known
manufacturers (AMS, Sager, Patriot) have this typical entry-level multimedia
configuration at even lower prices. Some notebooks with similar
capabilities--such as the Vectra 4000 from NEC and the Gateway Solo
V75--seemed to be overpriced and are likely to be reduced by early this year.

     I saw many mouth-watering midrange multimedia notebooks (Toshiba
Satellite Pro 410, NEC Versa 4000, Gateway Solo) for about $4,000 to $5,000,
sporting 90- or 100-MHz Pentiums, 8 to 16 megabytes of RAM, 540- to
720-megabyte hard disks, active matrix or dual-scan screens, and
quadruple-speed built-in CD-ROMs. Toshiba announced at the show the price of
the Tecra 700 Series, which will represent the high end of the multimedia
notebook market this year. The Tecra 700CT has a 120-MHz Pentium, 16 megabytes
of RAM, a 1-gigabyte hard drive, 11.3-inch active matrix display capable of
65,000 colors at 800X600 resolution, 16-bit audio, and a quadruple-speed
CD-ROM drive. At a price of $6,000, it certainly will not be an impulse buy.
Gateway announced a similar notebook at the same price, and others will follow
suit.

DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA PROWESS

     On the desktops we shall see 100- to 120-MHz Pentiums, with 16 megabytes
of RAM, 15- to 17-inch monitors (with 65,000 colors at 800X600),
quadruple-speed drives, 1.2-gigabyte hard drives capable of full-screen,
full-motion video (through MPEG-1 chips on the motherboard), and hi-fi audio
quality (through DSP--Digital Signal Processor--chips instead of sound boards)
for about $2,300 to $3,000. IBM sets the tone for the mainstream multimedia
desktop with its Aptiva series. Although its case design is nondescript at
best, what is inside the box is impressive and sufficient for good multimedia
playback. You will not see new models featuring Intel 486 processors and
double-speed drives, as these will become passe this year and will be sold
only at close-outs.

AUDIO HARMONY AND CACOPHONY

     Recorded audio performance cannot be much improved beyond CD-quality, but
the synthetic music renderings certainly will get better, because in almost
all the new audio cards you'll find wave-table synthesis support for MIDI
playback. Audio installation will be much easier because the majority of the
new multimedia systems will come with DSP chips, and users will not need to
know any more about them than they do about math co-processors. While sound
boards will still be sold (for the sake of those who want to upgrade their
existing systems), it will be a much easier task to install the new
plug-and-play sound boards if you are using Windows 95 and let the hardware
wizard take over the "seating" arrangement as a maitre d'.

     Enhanced CDs will probably be a disappointment. I have played with half
a dozen titles, and (as I will detail in my February column) most of them were
unimpressive and overpriced. Some of my reasons, of course, may be subjective.
It is, however, an objective fact that the much-heralded Enhanced CD,
particularly the CD Plus (Blue Book) format, will have a very rocky start. As
if it had not caused enough cacophony and confusion, why are there three
different enhanced CD formats (Track Zero, Track One and CD Plus)? The latter
format will not run on any of the NEC, Toshiba, and Sanyo drives manufactured
before August 1995. This represents at least hundreds of thousands of drives
and a pretty large number of angry customers who will ditch their Sony CD Plus
discs and be utterly skeptical about the Enhanced CD concept (see my sidebar,
"CD Plus Turns Out to Be CD Minus" on page 34).

     What gave me some peace of mind amid this cacophony was listening to the
series of sound clips from Network Music in the most elegant and comfortable
booth of the show. We have heard and seen a lot of CD-ROMs with audio clips,
but this series exudes professionalism and quality. There are five volumes
(business/office, high tech, pop culture, etc.), each with 30 music samples in
30- and 60-second, short-tag and loop versions of perfectly recorded music at
11 and 22 KHz, and 100 sound effects that you may edit (for perfectly timed
fade-in and fade-out) and convert to different sampling rates, frequency, and
even to compressed format to include in your multimedia presentation. There
are certainly cheaper alternatives, but you get what you pay for. Along with
stock film and video footage, this type of mediaware will be significant this
year.

DIGITAL VIDEO DELIGHT

     Delightful digital video will finally arrive  this year in a convenient
and affordable way. The key to that will be MPEG compression/decompression.
MPEG-1 playback chips on the motherboards or on the video accelerator cards
will be widespread and will provide full-screen, full-motion video at least at
videotape quality. MPEG-2 decoder chips (for broadcast-quality video) will be
limited to the high-end market because of the price. However, MPEG-1 movies
(320X240 resolution and 24 frames/second) will be played back also without
hardware decoders. I have heard claims that MPEG clips played with
software-only decoders will produce decent video on 33-MHz Intel 486
processors, but my own experience clearly suggests that a 75-MHz Pentium and
double-speed drive are required as a minimum. As this will be the entry-level
multimedia machine, I believe that many of the multimedia titles will have
MPEG videos by mid-1996.

     CompCore impressed me the most with its MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 hardware
products and particularly with the video quality of the SoftPEG software-only
decompressor. There have already been many contenders for hardware MPEG
solutions, but this fairly young company managed to license its technology to
such industry heavyweights as NEC, Packard Bell, Hitachi, Cirrus Logic, and
ATI. It is akin to starting with a few Grand Slam trophies while still
unseeded.

     Horizon Technology is another promising provider of software-only MPEG
playback technology with its TrueMotion-S. The company also has a multimedia
authoring package (Open! Info Manager) that facilitates the making of
multimedia presentations that include motion video. Sirius' Motion Pixels
technology was yet another impressive demonstration of software-only playback
of highly compressed video files, though not MPEG files. Beyond playback
quality, the crucial issues for developers will be the licensing arrangement
and the performance at the compression stage. We shall see a lot of CD-ROMs on
a lot of Pentium PCs with much better video than in 1995.

     It is too early to predict what will happen this year with the proposed
Zoomed Video Port (ZV Port) standard, which would allow transfer of
full-motion, full-screen video with minimal CPU utilization, through a new PC
Card (the card earlier known as PCMCIA). It sounds amazing but I'll believe it
(and report about it) when I see it.

WHAT MAY NOT FLY IN 1996

     There were a couple of announcements of products that may not be
available in volume in 1996 or that may not have a sizable market. Intel's
Pentium Pro is unlikely to have wide appeal. That's the new name for the
processor that has been mentioned until now as the P6. It is a bad name. Not
because I would prefer "Sextium," but because users will be confused,
especially as both the Pentium and Pentium Pro line will have a 150- and
166-MHz product. It also gives the impression that the Pentium itself is not
for the pros. At that high speed, it certainly is.

     The PowerPC has been depicted for nearly two years as the Promised Land
for those who want to use both Mac and DOS/Windows products on the same
computer, and it was characterized as a perfect cooperation among Apple, IBM,
and Motorola. While Apple has indeed come out with PowerPC-based systems, IBM
had no desktop computer featuring this processor, and you could not run IBM
applications on the Macs equipped with PowerPC chip. At COMDEX there was again
a pavilion dedicated to PowerPC, and it wasn't only birds chirping the new
magic word CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform). But I doubt that we
shall see any such desktop computers this year that will run both Mac and IBM
applications without third-party emulation software.

     Of course the big question for multimedia users is whether high density
or super-density ROMs of several gigabytes capacity will steamroll the
680-megabyte CD-ROMs of today. I saw the impressive prototypes; I saw the
joint communique from the formerly warring Sony/Philips and
Toshiba/Time-Warner teams (and their own brochures), but I'd bet my computer
that the super-density drives will not be shipping in 1996.

     In the meantime, we were able to witness at COMDEX how good old CD-ROM
technology keeps improving. As this is an issue not only for multimedia but
also for non-multimedia CD-ROM applications (and because I'm running out of
space), I'll discuss CD-ROM drive developments in this month's CD-ROM
Commentaries column (page 26).

     Las Vegas may have gotten cleaner than it was in the 70s as depicted by
Scorsese in his current movie, "Casino." While it still is unlikely to hit the
Boy Scouts' list of recommended places to visit, it is the perfect place for
COMDEX, and especially for the show's multimedia exhibits. Sometimes I had to
pause and remember whether I was in a casino on the Strip or in the Multimedia
Pavilion. Not a bad dilemma.


[The following sidebar is included in the article.]

                     CD Plus May Turn Out to Be CD Minus

          The CD Plus solution has been heralded for a year as the panacea for
     the problems of playing back music on an audio CD player from CD-ROMs
     that have both computer files and audio CD files--without damaging your
     speakers or your ears with white noise as the audio CD player tries to
     play back a computer file. Users are warned to skip the first track where
     the multimedia file resides, but users don't always pay attention. Many
     just toss in the CD-ROM and press the play button.

          In the CD Plus format, the audio CD file is on the first track,
     followed by a gap and then by the computer file. Sensing the gap, the
     audio CD player stops, but the CD-ROM reader can get to the computer
     file. The September issue of "Computer Life" magazine depicted such a
     wonderful, fairy-tale scenario about CD Plus that I could hardly wait to
     get my hands on a CD Plus-format disc. There were none available, so I
     held my breath and waited for COMDEX.

          It seemed to me to be absurd that while the CD Plus format was
     endorsed not only by the Recording Industry Association of America but by
     Sony and Philips, Sony had none available at that time, and at its booth
     Philips showed upcoming titles in every format except CD Plus. Well, it
     turns out that you will not be able to use titles in CD Plus format if
     you have--among others--a NEC or a Toshiba drive manufactured before
     August 1995. Chances are good that you do, as these drives have been
     best-sellers, sold in the hundreds of thousands not only directly to you
     but to PC manufacturers (as OEM products) who built these drives into
     their computers. And don't forget multimedia kit manufacturers who bundle
     sound boards with CD-ROM players.

          When I finally got my first CD Plus title ("Bob Dylan's Greatest
     Hits," from Sony), I was less than pleased to see that there was no
     warning about the fatal incompatibilities. The outside label  tells you
     that you need a 486SX 25-MHz or faster system, 8 MB of RAM, Windows 3.1
     or higher, 640X480 resolution, 256 colors (8 bit), double-speed or faster
     multisession CD-ROM drive and 8-bit sound card. In other words,
     single-speed, single-session drive owners need not apply. That's all.

          Only when you open the box at home will you find the following
     ominous sentences in the user booklet: " . . . certain CD-ROM drives may
     not properly recognize CD Plus discs. With [the enclosed] Corel drivers
     for Enhanced CD, you may be able to upgrade your CD-ROM drive to make it
     CD Plus compatible." But for many drives, this upgrade does not help.

          Sony's way of dealing with the incompatibility problem was to put no
     outside warning label alerting consumers to it, because users would not
     know whether their machines were affected, since most PCs have OEM
     drives. This is neither a heart-warming attitude nor a convincing
     argument. Hundreds of thousands of users have CD-ROMs that are clearly
     labeled by the NEC or Toshiba logo. Even in the case of OEM drives, users
     could often find out from the CONFIG.SYS file if they have drive that is
     not CD Plus compatible. Sony could have attached on a floppy the Corel
     CD-ROM Advisor program (included inside the package on a separate CD). It
     could have been made available from Sony's Internet site to let potential
     customers check whether their drives were capable of recognizing a CD
     Plus format disc.

          As I was fiddling with the installation, I bumped into a file that,
     although in a proprietary format (presumably to be used by the Corel
     Advisor program), was easily deciphered. Having snooped around in this
     file, let me do what Sony should have done by advising you about the
     brands and models of those multisession and double-speed or faster CD-ROM
     and CD-R drives that are unlikely to appropriately handle CD Plus format
     discs: NEC CDR601; Multispin 4x Pro, CDR510, and Multispin 74-1; TEAC
     CD-50; Plextor DM-XX24K; Aiwa ACD-300; Hitachi CDR-6750 and CDR 37-50;
     Reno CD-ROMX2A; Yamaha CDR100; and Ricoh RO1060C. These latter two are
     recorders/players. The Toshiba XM3501 and XM-3601 are likely to skip on
     audio, rendering them useless.

          The fatal incompatibility problem and Sony's attitude are likely to
     spoil the (post-) Christmas spirit and will dampen the enthusiasm of the
     public not only for the CD Plus format but for the entire enhanced CD
     concept. Not long ago, MediaVision went bankrupt over its sound card's
     incompatibility problems and its attitude toward handling of returns.
     Disney burnt its fingers with the bug-ridden CD-ROM release of "The Lion
     King" a year ago. Intel was grilled for shipping processor chips that
     calculated incorrectly in some situations and paid dearly for not
     advising customers sincerely.

          Sony will lose some of its credibility, and cooling down disgruntled
     customers and CD Plus distributors will cost Sony more than spelling out
     specifically the limitations of the CD Plus titles would have done.

INTERNET WAVES: THE INDESTRUCTIBLE, INDISPENSABLE INTERNET

     By Shirley Duglin Kennedy

     The Internet, a technological child of the Cold War era, was originally
designed as a Department of Defense communication network that could withstand
a nuclear attack. Specifically, if a portion of the network was decimated by
The Bomb, data packets could be rerouted, so communication would not be
totally disrupted. This explains why an ailing computer or router in Atlanta,
for instance, does not bring the entire Net to its knees--although data
"traffic" to that part of the world may be somewhat slower.

     This efficient design and function are aspects that make the Internet so
valuable in today's global economy. As information professionals, most of us
have eagerly embraced the Internet as a multifaceted tool, using it for
information retrieval, networking, and communications. Scientists and
researchers, of course, were using the Net long before most of us realized
that it even existed. These days, a staggering range of folks are using the
Net to ply their trade or practice their profession.

SOMEBODY'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR SAFETY AND SURVIVAL

     The reliability of the Internet's distributed structure makes it ideal
for disaster planning and emergency management. The Natural Hazards Research
and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder
has done a great deal of work in this area, and you can see the results on its
home page, at http://adder.colorado.edu/~hazctr/Home.html. Among the things
you'll find here is the full text of all session summaries from the Hazards
Research and Applications Workshop held in Boulder last summer. Many of the
sites listed below were mentioned in the Hazards Center's bimonthly
publication, "Natural Hazards Observer." Subscriptions are free to subscribers
within the U.S.--as are subscriptions to the online publication, "Disaster
Research." Send e-mail to hazctr@spot.colorado.edu for information.

     As you might expect, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)
home page, at http://www.fema.gov/fema/index.html, is one of the best
clearinghouses for emergency management information on the Internet. One of
FEMA's most popular publications, "The Emergency Guide for Business and
Industry," can be found at http://www.fema.gov/fema/bizindex.html.

     The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a Web site
(http://www.icrc.ch) that provides a wide range of information on civil
conflict, disasters, disaster victims, and the ICRC's role in dealing with
these problems. You'll find press releases, fact sheets, in-depth articles,
illustrated brochures, position papers, texts of various treaties and other
publications, as well as links to other Red Cross/Red Crescent organization
Web sites.

     The Natural Disaster Reference Database home page
(http://ltpwww.gsfc.nasa.gov/ndrd-cgi/ndrd), constructed by the Earth Sciences
Directorate of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, contains bibliographic
information on research results and programs related to the use of satellite
remote sensing for disaster mitigation.

     The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's National Drought Mitigation Center
offers an electronic clearinghouse of the latest scientific and technical
information on drought at http://enso.unl.edu/ndmc.

     A free, 70-page publication entitled "Emergency Preparedness Guidelines
for Mass, Crowd-Intensive Events," is available from Emergency Preparedness
Canada (EPC). Request this via e-mail to cominfo@jackson.epc.epc-pcc.x400.gc.
ca. Check out other publications available from EPC at http://hoshi.cic.sfu.
ca/~epc/.

     The National Institute for Urban Search and Rescue home page
(http://niusr.org/~usar) provides copies of its newsletter, a compendium of
seismic information sites on the Net, and earthquake preparedness information
for child safety.

     The Los Angeles bureau of "The Economist" magazine has set up a site that
includes text and images from an article entitled "Fear of Trembling," which
appeared in the April 22, 1995 issue. In addition to a large amount of
information on earthquakes and earthquake engineering, you'll also find an
exhaustive list of pointers to related Internet resources
(http://www.earthlink.net/~the-econmist).

     Additional earthquake-related sites include:

     --   The National Center for Earthquake Engineering
          (http://nceer.eng.buffalo.edu)

     --   The Southern California Earthquake Center
          (http://www.usc.edu/dept/earth/quake/index.html)

SELECTED STATISTICS

     Here are some interesting tidbits from "The Internet Index" by Win Treese
(11/11/95 edition):

     --   Percentage of public libraries (serving populations of 100,000 or
          more) offering Internet access: 25. Percentage providing assistance
          for Internet users: 5.

     --   Number of Internet mailing lists known to the Indiana University
          Support Center: 12,850.

     --   Number of airlines with Web sites: 42.

     --   Number of Internet service providers (worldwide): more than 1,400.

     --   Best estimate of the number of Internet users (7/95): 20-30 million.

STRICTLY BUSINESS

     Stop! Don't trash that fax machine! A recent survey of Fortune 500
companies by Gallup/Pitney Bowes found that firms with e-mail capabilities
send just as many faxes as firms without e-mail. Also, the poll found that
faxes were preferred over e-mail, voice mail, or overnight delivery service
for a quick answer.

     As for smaller businesses, only 21 percent of their owners with awareness
of the Internet were actually using it, according to a Gallup/MCI survey.
Thirty-five percent said it was too expensive; 35 percent said the technology
was too complex, and 46 percent admitted they were "cyberphobic."

     Business misuse of the Internet is another issue entirely. Recently,
Virgin Atlantic Airways (U.K.) was fined $14,000 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) for placing a "misleading" fare ad on the Internet.
According to the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" (11/22/95), this was the first
time DOT had fined an airline for information posted on the Net.

     "The Internetwork Mail Guide," which details methods of sending
electronic mail from one network to another, has long been one of the most
useful documents on the Internet. Provided by Scott Yanoff, the recently
updated version is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.csd.uwm.
edu/pub/internetwork-mail-guide. A Web-based version is available at
http://alpha.acast.nova.edu/cgi-bin/inmgq.pl.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

     Although geared to reporters, the Web site of the news office at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government
(http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/~ksgpress/ksgnews.htm) offers "one-stop shopping"
for anyone interested in national or international politics. Here you can find
faculty sources, events, research, and publications. The site also links to
the Online Political Information Network, a well-organized set of links to
most major sources of government and political information on the Internet.

     A site worth checking for election information is U.S. News Online
(http://www.usnews.com), which includes a special Election '96 section
featuring stories, photos, background information, and links to candidates'
Web sites. You can also read the weekly news magazine here, and access daily
news updates, photo essays, sound bites, and a variety of special features.

     A good set of links to Department of Defense and NATO sites can be found
at: http://ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu/history/ehawk/arm_index.html.

     The U.S. National Archives Center for Electronic Records has made
available its "Title List: A Preliminary and Partial Listing of the Datafiles
in the National Archives and Records Administration," at http://gopher.nara.
gov:70/1/inform/cd/electr/titlelst. Included are entries for more than 9,000
of the approximately 23,000 electronic records files held by the National
Archives. Titles are listed by government branch and, within branch, by record
group. The list is available as one huge file (1.3M), or as 19 separate files.
(Note: You must read the "Introduction" and "Status Codes/Comment Codes" in
order to understand the files.)

     Government contractors or wanna-bes should definitely check out
http://www.govcon.com, which features, among other things, "Commerce Business
Daily," teaming opportunities, mergers and acquisitions, employment
opportunities, and full text of such documents as the Federal Acquisitions
Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards. There is also a directory of
8(a) certified government contracting firms, and an "interactive yellow
pages," which helps locate experts in various fields to provide assistance in
federal government contracting.

ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING DILEMMA

     According to an article in the 11/17/95 issue of the "Chronicle of Higher
Education," researchers whose work is published online before it comes out in
print are trimming valuable weeks off the one-year limitation they have if
they wish to file a patent on their findings. Some journals are in the
practice of running abstracts--or entire articles--online weeks before the
hard copy becomes available. And papers are often posted on a Web site prior
to a conference where their findings will be announced. While the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office  hasn't issued an official ruling on "electronic
disclosure," a spokesman indicated that patent lawyers should assume that
anything available online should be considered "published."

CREDIT CARD SECURITY RISK UPDATE

     Is the widespread fear of sending a credit card number over the Internet
justified? Not when you consider the alternatives, concluded Peter H. Lewis,
a "New York Times" reporter who addressed the subject in an article last
November. "Sending a credit card number over the Internet to an electronic
merchant is probably the safest way to make such a transaction," Lewis wrote.
"In the last week, for example, I handed my credit card to a waiter who
disappeared with it for five minutes. I faxed my credit card information to a
business in New Jersey, and the fax probably lay exposed to everyone in that
office for hours and perhaps to the cleaning crew that night. I called a hotel
and gave my credit card data to a reservation clerk and continued my
recklessness by ordering some merchandise from a clothing catalog, again by
reading my credit card information to some unseen operator. . . . Compared
with the risk of handing my credit card to a stranger, which I do nearly every
day, sending it over the Internet is pretty secure."

INTERNET INSIGHTS: SEARCHING OUT AND ASSESSING WEB SITES

     By Paul Blake

     [Editor's Note: This marks the first round of Paul Blake's new bimonthly
column, Internet Insights. As a London-based writer/editor for Learned
Information  Europe Ltd., Paul has written IT's European Report column for
some time. Recently he changed his focus at Learned to concentrate more on the
Internet. In his new column, he will discuss the dynamic happenings on the Net
in the context of the information industry and give publishers, information
professionals, and information users insights into how they can exploit this
new medium.]

     There have been a welter of recent developments aimed at making searching
the Internet easier and more precise. While it is probably overly optimistic
to claim that the difficulties of finding information on the Net have
disappeared, the latest enhancements to search engines, such as Yahoo!, Lycos,
and Open Text, amount to a significant step in the right direction.

     One of the most impressive new entrants comes from IBM, which has teamed
up with Ontario-based Open Text Corp. to launch a World Wide Web-based search
service that retrieves data both from Web pages and from information providers
such as Disclosure, Information Access Company, and Cambridge Scientific
Abstracts.

INFOMARKET SEARCH

     Called the infoMarket Search service, it lets users search multiple
databases simultaneously across the Net. Users are able to search sources
through a single interface, with infoMarket Search able to access text and
multimedia data and then merge results together. The service was free of
charge to users at the time this column was written, though charges will be
announced early in 1996.

     According to Open Text, its retrieval engine is unique in being able to
search millions of Web pages in under five seconds and for its understanding
of the structure of documents found on the WWW. Open Text's technology uses
automated "crawlers" to index the complete text of Web documents. These index
every word on every page, as well as recording the structural context of each
indexed string. They constantly search for new documents to index and revisit
sites frequently to add to the master index.

     At launch, the sources accessible via infoMarket Search are Yahoo!, the
Open Text Index of Web documents, the content of 13,000 Usenet newsgroups, and
the McKinley listing of rated sites on the Internet. In the latter case,
Internet resources have been reviewed and evaluated by research specialists
and McKinley's editorial advisory boards for content, currency, organization
of the resource, ease of use, and accessibility. According to IBM,
negotiations are under way with a variety of other content providers, ranging
from "news services to digital libraries and image databases."

     IBM says that publishers with content distributed among different
platforms or locations will be able to use infoMarket Search to create
tailored "virtual services" for their customers. Users will also be able to
install infoMarket agents to enable them to search internal and external
sources through one interface. "The aim of the infoMarket service is to enable
end users to enter a single query that is capable of interrogating nearly all
of the common database formats, supports numerous search engines, and delivers
content to  the predominant end-user platforms," explained Jeff Crigler, vice
president of IBM infoMarket. "The service can also be modified to meet users'
particular requirements or systems."

YAHOO! AND OPEN TEXT

     Open Text is also involved in a move to add a search capability to
Yahoo!, one of the Web's most comprehensive subject guides. Yahoo!, which
catalogs Web pages according to subject headings, now also offers the ability
to search its entries using the Open Text retrieval engine.

     Using Open Text, Yahoo! users will be able to conduct searches for
specific words and phrases, multilevel Boolean searches, as well as weighted
searches. Inquiries can be narrowed to specific categories in Yahoo!'s
hierarchical index, and users will also be able to use structural operators
such as document title, sub-headings, body copy, and footnotes as qualifiers
for their searches. Additionally, Open Text will offer the ability to retrieve
documents "similar" to those a user has already found.

     "The Open Text technology expands Yahoo! with a 'back of the book'
word-by-word index of the Internet, which complements our 'front of the book'
hierarchical index," said Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo!. "This will boost
the efficiency and productivity of both browsing and more serious searching on
Yahoo!, and broaden its appeal to a wider range of Internet users."

LYCOS SPIDER

     One of Yahoo!'s rivals, the Lycos Spider, has not been sitting still
either. It has a fresh interface, along with support for HotJava and
"backlinks"--which let users who have clicked to Lycos from another site
return directly to the original site by clicking on an icon on the Lycos
search screen. A new search form lets users set display options, such as to
one-line summaries, or for hits that are "loosely matched" or "very strongly
matched."

     Lycos has also added reviews of the top 5 percent World Wide Web
sites--graded for content, presentation, and the "experience" of accessing
them. As part of a $3 million acquisition of Point Communications Corp., the
Lycos search engine has integrated Point's review and rating guide to the Web.
After carrying out a search of the Web, the user will be able to view the
search results from the Lycos catalog, together with ratings of sites
retrieved.

     A team of about 30 Point reviewers employs a 50-point scale to rate Web
sites for content, as well as for presentation and the experience of using the
site, defined as whether the site is worth the time, and whether the user
would recommend it to others. Web sites landing in the top 5 percent are
awarded Badges of Excellence. Current holders include the Global Health
Network, Mobil Oil, and Lucas Arts.

     The Lycos Web site has also integrated Point Communications' Point Now
service, which provides brief items of business news, stocks, and weather,
with hotlinks to CNN and other news sources. Lycos itself was launched last
June as a commercial avenue for the Spider search technology first developed
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Eight million sites, or 91 percent of the
Web, are indexed by the service.

WEBCOMPASS

     Established software vendors are also getting in on the Web searching
act. Quarterdeck has unveiled software that allows users to send a single
query to multiple Web search engines, then receive a summary of results
including subtopics. Using WebCompass, searchers can also automatically update
results, store them locally on the PC, and assign rankings to them.

     When a user enters a query or topic of interest, WebCompass polls
multiple search engines, such as Lycos and InfoSeek, for relevant Web pages.
The content of these pages is summarized and presented to the user. When there
are a large number of results, WebCompass automatically groups the summarized
pages into subtopics, giving the user the option to drill down on specific
topics.

     WebCompass also lets users build a personalized index of topics that they
are interested in and store retrieved data in a database based in the
Microsoft Access 2.0 file format. The software can be set to perform regularly
scheduled queries on selected Web sites to update existing information in the
database. The user can additionally assign a rating system, from one to five,
for the importance of topics and subtopics, which the WebCompass search engine
will use in the future to sort data during updates.

     "The idea behind WebCompass is to let the user multiply the power of the
many Web search engines available by performing one search from his or her PC.
We hope it will greatly reduce the time people must spend searching and
analyzing the data available on all of the search engines on the Internet,"
said Emerick Woods, vice president and general manager of the Internet
business unit at Quarterdeck.

     WebCompass, Personal Edition, which will cost under $100, works with any
Web browser and runs on a 486-based PC with a minimum of 8 megabytes of
memory, with 16 megabytes recommended.

BOOK REVIEW: THE COMPLETE INTERNET COMPANION FOR LIBRARIANS


     by Allen C. Benson
     Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., 1995
     ISBN: 1-55570-178-7 (softcover)
     407 pages, $49.95

     Reviewed by Virginia Gatcheff Gehrig

     If a library can only buy one book to learn about the Internet, "The
Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is the book to buy. This
comprehensive book covers all aspects of the Internet, from hardware
requirements to training staff members. Benson's text is easy to read and is
geared for those new to the online world. Yet, experienced Internet surfers
will not be bored. His specific audience is "librarians who are responsible
for planning and setting up their organization's computer system." Those
involved in online reference services or anyone who exchanges information over
the Internet will also benefit from this book.

     "The Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is divided into six
parts. Part One, "Overview of the Internet," describes the Internet for
newcomers and explains what hardware and software is required to gain access
to the "information superhighway." A list of national Internet service
providers is included.

     Part Two, "Tools and Protocols," describes in detail how to use the three
main communications services of the Internet: ftp (file transfer protocol),
telnet, and e-mail. Part Three, "Search Utilities and the Client/Server
Model," focuses on resource discovery tools such as Archie, WAIS (Wide Area
Information Servers), World Wide Web browsers, and gophers.

     Part Four, "General Resources," gives a broad overview of the types of
information services available on the Internet such as listserv discussion
lists, Campus-Wide Information Systems, and Usenet newsgroups. Part Five,
"Integrating the Internet into Traditional Library Services," focuses
exclusively on how a library can use the Internet effectively. This section is
explained in more detail below. Part Six, "Internet Resources Arranged by
Subject A-Z," is a selective list of Internet services and resources.

     Chapter 21, "The Librarian's Role in Implementing Internet," gives
practical advice for the librarians assigned to the task of establishing the
Internet in the library's environment. A significant portion of the chapter is
devoted to training, and examples in the books can be used during training
sessions. The chapter also gives ample training outlines and suggested
content. Benson also discusses the issues of copyright and digital information
and how portions of copyright law apply to libraries and computer systems. The
chapter includes a recommended Internet use policy and tips on how to use
public relations to garner community support of the Internet in the library.
Sample community demonstrations are included for adult services, youth
services, high school, and college students. Most helpful may be the section
on how to integrate the Internet into existing services and how to add value
to Internet services. The chapter closes with some profiles on how librarians
are becoming involved in online publishing with such efforts as local history
archives and locating and repackaging information.

     Chapter 22, "Implementing Internet Service In-House," takes the Internet
beyond the reference room and provides ideas for using the Internet throughout
the library. This chapter shows how the Internet can be used in technical
services, acquisitions, and collection development.

     Chapter 23, "Reference Services," returns to the reference room and
details how to effectively use the Internet in answering the three most common
types of reference questions: author/title questions, fact-finding questions,
and subject questions. Benson discusses the problems associated with locating
and accessing information, primarily the Internet's tremendous size and vast
resources. He offers some time- and trouble-saving tips for searching
efficiently and introduces the reader to Infopop. (Infopop is a Windows-based
application that allows users to create their own indexes on Internet
resources.)

     Examples are used extensively throughout the entire book. In several
places, exercises are included to encourage the reader to become familiar with
the Internet and how it works. "The Complete Internet Companion for
Librarians" also includes a list of library-related discussion lists and tells
how to subscribe to them. Benson's book is a valuable resource for librarians
implementing the Internet. Its specific focus on the library's use of the
Internet makes it preferable to other general reference books.

FASTER AUTHORING SYSTEMS AND DISC DRIVES

     Like many other things in our technologically advancing society, CD-ROM
capabilities are constantly "new and improved." Here are two examples: a
high-speed authoring system and a faster CD-ROM drive.

DATA/WARE'S HIGH-SPEED CD-AUTHORING SYSTEM

     Data/Ware Development has released its Server Enterprise Authoring System
(S/EAS), a high-speed CD-authoring system. S/EAS is the latest addition to
Data/Ware Development's line of optical storage and CD-authoring systems. Like
the Enterprise Authoring System (EAS) from which it is derived, S/EAS includes
all of the hardware and software required to author CDs in an automated,
lights-out environment.

     According to Dale Smith, vice president of new product development for
Data/Ware, large organizations in fields ranging from banking and insurance to
telecommunications and government are turning to data distribution by CD as a
cost-effective alternative to COM or paper. "In addition to reducing the
expenses associated with producing, distributing, and storing COM and paper
documents," said Smith, "CDs make it fast and easy to access data. The result
is improved productivity and customer service."

     S/EAS requires no mainframe processing to produce CDs. Instead, a
UNIX-based SPARCserver handles all pre-processing and processing steps.

     S/EAS accepts data or images from 3480/3490 tape cartridges, a LAN/WAN,
or a mainframe. After data or images are downloaded to S/EAS, custom software
prepares it for recording to CDs and also extracts indexes from reports as
required. After the pre-processing phase is finished, S/EAS masters the data
to make it conform to the ISO 9660 standard for recording and reading data on
CDs. S/EAS can operate multiple 2x or 6x CD writers simultaneously and can be
equipped with robotic feeders. Each feeder can hold 75 CDs, enough to last an
entire production shift.

     To view data, end users simply insert a S/EAS CD into a standard CD-ROM
drive in any PCrunning Windows.In addition to rapid data access, users can cut
and paste data to other PC applications such as word processors, databases,
and spreadsheets. They can also print and fax on demand.

     For more information, contact Data/Ware Development, Inc., San Diego, CA,

TOSHIBA'S 6.7 SPEED CD-ROM DRIVE

     Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Disk Products Division (TAIS
DPD) has announced the XM-3701 Series of 6.7-speed CD-ROM drives that support
a 1,000 KB/sec. data transfer rate.

     "Toshiba's new XM-3701 Series drives meet the needs of OEMs, VAD/VARs,
and distributors who need to provide cutting-edge performance and high-quality
drives to their customers today," said Jerry Higgins, vice president of
product marketing, CD-ROM, TAIS DPD. "These new drives with their 1,000
KB/sec. sustained data transfer rate and 120 ms random seek time provide
CD-ROM users with the performance necessary to support smooth full-motion
video and complex high-end graphics transfers from CD-ROMs."

     The new XM-3701 Series' fast rotational speed of 6.7x was achieved
through enhanced error correction, employment of a digital signal processor,
and an improved optical pick-up head and spindle motor. In addition to the
6.7x rotational speed, the drives also support rotations of 1x and 2x.

     The XM-3701 CD-ROM drives employ the variable speed playback system used
in previous Toshiba CD-ROM drives. The variable-speed playback system allows
the drive to read data before the disk reaches a specific rotational speed of
1, 2, or 6.7 times standard rotational speeds. As a result, the CD-ROM drive
provides improved drive read times. The variable-speed playback also decreases
power consumption to 5.9 watts average.

     The low-mass optical pick-up and digital servo control featured in the
XM-3701 drives ensure fast access to complex data, video, and audio files
located anywhere on the disc. The digital servo control provides greater
tracking precision and head position, ultimately giving the drives their 120
ms random seek time.

     The XM-3701 Series drives comply with MPC-3 and-2 specifications and are
compatible with Kodak multi-session Photo-CD and CD-Plus, red book, yellow
book, and CD-ROM XA. The drives are also CD-Bridge, CD-i, and CD-i Ready
compatible and can be used as a CD-Audio player, independent of the computer
system.

     The XM-3701 Series drives feature a sealed enclosure that maintains a
contamination-free environment for data integrity. The result is a high MTBF
of 100,000 hours. The SCSI-2 interface XM-3701 Series drives support CD-DA
transfers over the SCSI bus for maximum bandwidth utilization and feature a
256 KB data buffer.

     The drives may be mounted horizontally or vertically for user
flexibility. The tray-type electrical disc loader eliminates the need for a
caddy, and the drives feature a media removal prevention function. The XM-3701
Series drives are available in internal and external models. The XM-3701B
internal drive has a suggested list price of $415, and the TXM-3701D external
drive has a suggested list price of $515.

     The TAIS Disk Products Division markets a wide range of industry-standard
Winchester and CD-ROM disk drives. For additional product information, contact
Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Disk Products Division, Irvine, CA,
714/457-0777.

BUSINESS&INDUSTRY DATABASE NOW ON CD-ROM

     Responsive Database Services, Inc. (RDS) has announced that its
innovative Business&Industry (B&I) online database is now available on CD-ROM.

     Designed to meet the needs of professional, novice, and occasional
researchers, "B&I on CD-ROM" enables easy and precise retrieval of facts,
figures, key events, rankings, industry overviews, and trends dealing with
companies, industries, markets, and products throughout the world.

     "B&I on CD-ROM" delivers full-text articles, informative abstracts, and
thousands of numerical tables from over 600 leading trade magazines,
newsletters, business publications, regional newspapers, and international
business dailies from 30 countries.

     According to RDS, since "B&I" offers both professional search software
and Easy Menu Search software (for DOS and Macintosh platforms), users of all
experience levels will find it useful. In public and academic libraries, "B&I"
can be a powerful research tool for students and faculty as well as for
salespeople, personal investors, job seekers, and non-profit development
offices gathering information on companies or industries. In corporate use,
"B&I on CD-ROM" can serve as a cost-effective supplement to online searches
and also enable employees to retrieve information when library staff is
unavailable.

     "`B&I on CD-ROM' embodies many of the features, improvements, and
benefits that users of business information files are asking for," said Dick
Harris, president of RDS. "In today's searching environment, time,
cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and good results are especially important."

     All records included in "B&I"--which is available online as DIALOG File
9 and DataStar BIDB--are indexed at a detailed level to assure precise
retrieval. Each record has an enhanced title that describes the article's
content. Original articles published in languages other than English include
an enhanced title and an informative abstract in English.

     "B&I's" indexing terms and search codes are based on common-use business
terminology. With its "controlled vocabulary" terms, searchers use
natural-language words and phrases such as market size, market share, industry
forecasts, company overview, market testing, product introduction, mergers and
acquisitions, joint venture, trends, demographics, African-American market,
Generation X market, green market, cooperative campaigns, cobranding, umbrella
marketing, and more.

     "B&I" enables users to search arrays of product codes by utilizing
industry names, thus eliminating the need to select or input product codes. In
addition with DIALOGLink, "B&I on CD-ROM" will automatically extend searches
by dialing out and logging on to "B&I's" online service.

     The "B&I CD-ROM" includes approximately 300,000 records--the full
database as it appears online for the most recent 15 months. The annual
subscription price is $3,995, and the public and academic library subscription
price is $2,400.

     For more information, contact Responsive Database Services, Inc.,

THREE NEW DISCS FROM GALE

     Gale Research has recently announced these three new products:

EASY ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS

     Financial consultants, brokers, and market researchers can get fast
access to SEC reports for nearly 900 of the top 1,000 companies with "Gale's
SEC Connection," a new CD-ROM business resource.

     Individual entries can be accessed via a menu of six search criteria:
company name, industry, SIC code, city, state, and/or ZIP code of the
company's headquarters. One or more criteria can be selected for broad or
narrow searches that will lead the user to the report(s) sought.

     Each report may include (but is not limited to) information on marketing
strategy, financial information, legal proceedings involving the company,
properties held, insurance, income taxes, executive officers and directors,
subsidiaries, and products the company manufactures or sells.

     Users can access information by company name, industry, SIC code, city,
state, or ZIP code; can "jump" to major portions of the report; and can print
information or download to disc. Search function operators allow users to
combine items for customized searches.

     Minimum system requirements for the single-user version are: IBM or
compatible PC with 80286 processor (80386 or faster processor recommended),
MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 3.3 or higher and MS-DOS CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX)
version 2.1 or higher, 640K bytes of RAM memory (500 K available), a hard disk
with 5 MB of free space (minimum), 16 MB for optimal speed of software, VGA
graphics card and monitor (color recommended), and an ISO 9660-compatible
CD-ROM drive with cables and interface card.

CD SPEEDS GRANT RESEARCH

     Key information on 167,000 grants from 5,227 funders is available
electronically with "Grants on Disc," new from the Taft Group, an imprint of
Gale Research.

     The annual subscription CD-ROM includes quarterly updates with
information on more than 30,000 recently awarded cash grants, or 120,000 new
grants each year.

     Powerful search functions offer quick access (via menu, hotkey, or mouse)
to detailed information on recent grant recipients, including name and
location, dollar amount of recent grants, recipient type, and grantor's
contact information, all of which can be viewed simultaneously in different
windows.

     Items within grant listings are fielded to allow searches using free text
or a combination of terms including grant amount, recipient location (city or
state), recipient ZIP code, recipient type (nine major codes plus 215
subcategories), funder location (city or state), funder ZIP code, and funder
area code.

     System requirements for "Grants on Disc" are IBM compatible 80386SX PC or
higher (486 recommended), DOS 3.3 or higher, Windows 3.1 or higher, a hard
drive with minimum of 2 MB available, 4 MB of RAM (8 MB recommended), VGA
monitor, a mouse or pointing device, and an ISO 9660 CD-ROM player.

     "Grants on Disc" is available from The Taft Group by calling
800/877-TAFT.

CAREER SEARCH GUIDANCE

     A recent Gallup poll reported that 72 percent of employed adults, if they
could plan their lives again, would try to get more information about job or
career options. Nearly one in five said they obtained their current job
through a series of random circumstances. But now people can get help with
"Gale's Career Guidance System," a new CD-ROM resource.

     Said Gale Research careers editor Linda Thurn, "You can save hours of
research time by keying in one occupation name and searching on it for
information on all aspects, rather than looking for salary data in one print
source, job descriptions in another, potential employers in another, and so
on."

     "Gale's Career Guidance System" combines profiles of more than 1,200
careers and 210,000 potential employers with background information from the
U.S. Department of Labor, allowing job hunters to identify the right career,
assess its economic outlook, then find the contact people at the companies
most likely to hire them.

     The "System's" Expanded Edition provides additional guidance by including
self-assessment tools that match personalities to appropriate careers, then
direct the user to needed training or educational programs and available
financial aid.

     The user can thoroughly explore more than 210,000 U.S. companies in the
potential employers section and can identify target employers in a number of
ways, including geographically, by SIC code, by industry group, or by the type
of occupations they employ.

     The U.S. Department of Labor's two popular publications, "Occupational
Outlook Handbook" and "Dictionary of Occupational Titles," are also included.

     Designed for use in career, employment, and outplacement agencies,
"Gale's Career Guidance System" uses either an MS-DOS or PC-DOS platform (3.3
or higher) on an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer (80286 processor
required, 80486 or faster is recommended). System requirements include 640K
bytes of RAM (520K free), a hard disk with 6 MB minimum of free space (16 for
optimal speed) and a VGA color card and monitor.

     For more information, contact Gale Research, Detroit, 800/877-GALE.

WINDOWS 95 CAN WAIT

     Of the 16,752 total worldwide CD-ROM titles in print at the end of 1995,
only 1.2 percent will be Windows 95 native, according to a survey by the
Woodstock, Vermont-based market research firm InfoTech, Inc. Windows 95 native
CD-ROMs will total 204 worldwide for 1995, and 55 percent of these offer new
content.

     Consumer CD-ROM publishers are embracing the new OS more eagerly than
inhouse or institutional publishers, the survey shows.

     InfoTech forecasts that around 6 percent of total worldwide CD-ROM titles
in print will be Windows 95 native by year-end 1996. By contrast, InfoTech

TOP WEB SITES TO ADD INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA

     AND YOU CAN VIEW IT THROUGH "SHOCKWAVE"

     Millions of Netscape Navigator 2.0 users can now experience multimedia in
a Web page and the dynamic impact of multimedia documents for the first time.
"Shockwave for Director" brings "Director" productions--with interactive
graphics, sound, and animation--to the Internet. Web developers are using
"Shockwave" now for interactive entertainment, merchandising, advertising,
product demonstrations, and education.

     Macromedia, Inc. has announced that dozens of major Web sites are using
its "Shockwave for Director" to transform the World Wide Web from static pages
to interactive multimedia. Many of the most popular sites on the Internet are
adding high-impact multimedia productions, which can be viewed using Netscape
Navigator 2.0 with a free "Shockwave" plug-in. Now available for the first
time, the "Shockwave" plug-in can be downloaded from Macromedia's Web site
(http://www.macromedia.com).

     Web publishers who are preparing to unveil new media content include a
who's who of the Internet and multimedia worlds: CNN Online, Time Pathfinder,
CondeNet Online, 20th Century Fox, MTV Online, Turner Online, Apple Computer,
Disney's "Toy Story," Intel, USA Today Info, "Advertising Age,"  M/B
Interactive, Sony Music Entertainment, "Melrose Place," Internet Shopping
Network, American Cancer Society, @Home, On Ramp, c/net online, Clement Mok
Designs, Radical Media, Siegel & Gale, ad-hoc Interactive, and Maytag.
Cybernauts can visit Macromedia's Web site to be introduced to the multimedia
Web and for links to the first "shocked" sites showing interactive multimedia.

     "`Shockwave' is a breakthrough that brings the Internet to life," claims
Fred Sotherland, vice president, creative director of c/net: the computer
network. "Now more like television than a print medium, the Web is fun,
dynamic, and interactive. At last, the Internet has what it takes to dazzle
consumers and keep them coming back."

     "Netscape's goal is to make the Internet as open and dynamic an
environment as possible," said Marc Andreessen, founder and vice president of
technology for Netscape communications. "By working with Macromedia's
"Shockwave for Director,"  we are greatly expanding the capabilities for
communicating over the Internet by providing users with richer media and more
compelling means of expression."

     "Shockwave for Director" is targeted at graphic artists, animators, and
other creative nonprogrammers who can immediately use their multimedia skills
to create Web pages with interactive media content. Internet users will be
able to easily download compressed "Director" multimedia movies as quickly as
the typical digitized image. Since "Director" is seamlessly integrated into
the browser (and other tools), "Director" movies run immediately, at full
speed, on the user's desktop.

     To achieve these performance gains during downloads, "Shockwave for
Director" includes a post-processor called Afterburner, which compresses
"Director" files by about 60 percent and optimizes the content by media type.
"Shockwave" files are often smaller than the original static graphics on Web
sites. Support for streaming, which boosts download performance still more,
will be added to future versions of "Shockwave for Director."

     For more information on Macromedia products, call 800/326-2128,

MULTIMEDIA STARTER KIT FOR THE INTERNET

     Quarterdeck Corporation and Paradesa Media have announced "Larry Magid's
Essential Internet," the first multimedia Internet product available for the
World Wide Web. Aiming for true mass market distribution with over one hour of
rich multimedia content, the title is expected to have a retail price of under
$20. "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is targeted toward the large number of
new Internet users purchasing multimedia PCs.

     "The multimedia aspects of this product make it unique among a sea of
Internet starter kits that rely on books to explain and guide you through the
Internet. This not only teaches you about the Web, it takes you there," said
Michael Lerner, Paradesa Media executive director.

     The CD-ROM was designed to guide beginning users through the intricacies
of the World Wide Web. Larry Magid, syndicated columnist, best-selling author,
and experienced Net surfer, explains in basic English how the Internet works
and how to navigate through its main services. Using sound, video, and
animation, Magid combines his wealth of knowledge on personal computing and
the Internet with his ability to explain technology in the simplest of terms,
providing users with a true hands-on Internet tutorial.

     "If the World Wide Web was created to make the Internet easier to
navigate, "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is the answer to untangling what
has become a very crowded and often intimidating World Wide Web," said Emerick
Woods, Quarterdeck vice president and general manager of the Internet business
unit. "This is the first and only multimedia starter kit that not only helps
a user understand and figure out what the Web is all about by literally
walking through it and explaining it in simple terms but also will immediately
connect the user to the Web to find out for themselves."

     Magid explores some of his favorite Web sites right on the CD-ROM. If the
user is interested in learning more, he or she can simply click on a hypertext
link to connect to the Web page being discussed. "Essential Internet" is
developed in HTML to emulate a World Wide Web page. Users surf cyberspace and
learn how to link with millions of computers quickly to locate information
without the cost of being online. And when they're ready, they can investigate
how much it costs to sign up for the service and can instantly get online
using Quarterdeck's Connect & Play feature.

     "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is available at major computer retail
stores nationwide. Updates to the CD-ROM can be downloaded for free by
accessing the Larry's World Web site (http://www.larrysworld.com). The package
comes bundled with Quarterdeck Mosaic, Message Center for news and e-mail,
Connect and Play, and up to 30 days of free Internet access from NETCOM
On-Line Communications, Inc.

     For more information, contact Quarterdeck, Marina del Rey, CA,
310/309-3700, Internet: http://www. quarterdeck.com/, or e-mail: info@

SOFTWARE FOR CONSUMER SATISFACTION

     The Interactive Multimedia Assoc-iation (IMA), a worldwide trade
organization representing more than 380 interactive multimedia technology
providers, has officially launched an industry-wide campaign to help consumers
better match CD-ROM software titles to their personal computing systems. The
IMA's CD MATCH program is designed to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce
retail returns of multimedia titles, which are running as high as 30 percent
for some titles.

     Endorsed by a number of leading CD-ROM title publishers and retailers,
the CD MATCH campaign will provide millions of consumers with free software
that automatically runs a check of their multimedia PCs and provides a
printout of system capabilities.

     Simultaneous with the announcement of the consumer education program, the
IMA also debuted its specifications for a uniform label for CD-ROM titles. The
program promotes a uniform labeling system for on-pack display that exactly
matches the format and type of information on the CD MATCH printout. Combined,
these two elements will enable consumers to make more informed CD-ROM title
purchasing decisions, improve user satisfaction levels, and reduce returns.

     The IMA CD MATCH software is available at no charge through the
association's home page on the World Wide Web (ftp://ftp.ima.org/pub/cdmatch).
The free software will also be available to consumers via magazine bundles and
companion packs in early 1996. For more information, contact the IMA at
cdmatch@ima.org.

MULTIMEDIA FRONTIERS

     If you're really interested in multimedia technology, read on: Here are
examples of some of the more interesting uses that we've heard of. The four
applications described below may not be what you would use in your library,
but they do represent new frontiers. If you learn about multimedia and know
where it's headed, you'll understand what effects it may have on your
environment in the future.

AN INTERNET-LINKED MONTHLY CD

     "Multimedia World," a publication for multimedia enthusiasts, and
CompuServe have joined forces to produce the first monthly CD-ROM magazine
with hyperlinks to the Internet and to an online service. "Multimedia World"
is distributing this special edition of its CD-ROM companion "Multimedia World
LIVE!" with every newsstand copy, at a cover price of $4.95.

     The customized version of "LIVE!" incorporates numerous hyperlinks to
both the CompuServe Information Service and the World Wide Web using
CompuServe's interface software. By selecting one of these hyperlinks, "LIVE!"
users then may launch directly to related sites either on the CompuServe
Information Service or on the Web, such as "Multimedia World's" home page at
http://www.mmworld.com.

     "`LIVE's' seamless integration of online hyperlinks represents a new and
dynamic way for our readers to access the information they want," said Russell
Glitman, editorial director of "Multimedia World." "If readers are interested
in more background on a certain topic, a link can connect them immediately to
additional editorial content that resides online."

     The November issue of "LIVE!" contained linked articles on "Multimedia
World's" cover story for that month and an interactive test report of video
cards, CD-ROM drives, and multimedia systems. In these interactive reports,
users rank their own criteria to generate results customized to their personal
preferences.

     "LIVE!" will also include a selection of games, utilities, clip media,
and drivers, as well as links to popular online software libraries.
"Multimedia World" has reserved 200 megabytes on "LIVE!"  for interactive
advertising, software demos, and hyperlinks to Web sites.

     "`Multimedia World LIVE!' is a natural extension of our mission--to reach
and inform the mediaphile," explained Greg Mason, publisher of "Multimedia
World."

     Multimedia World is privately held and published in San Francisco by PC
World Communications, a subsidiary of International Data Group. For more
information, contact Scott Laughlin of PC World Communications, 415/978-3329.

A 24-HOUR ENTERTAINMENT CHANNEL ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB

     Online entertainment developer and consumer Internet access provider Only
Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. has launched its OMI Channel, featuring
original programs and live entertainment.

     The first programming concept of its kind to be implemented on the World
Wide Web, the company claims, the OMI Channel is accessible at
http://www.only.com and features a complete slate of regularly scheduled
original entertainment, comedy, news, drama, and lifestyle programming.

     "As a national Internet service provider and developer of original World
Wide Web entertainment, the OMI Channel will allow us to leverage our
resources and present the online industry with a business model that makes a
lot of sense," said John K. Sloatman, president of Only Multimedia & The Wave
Network, Inc.

     Among the many original and light-hearted OMI Channel programs are "Only
Soap," an episodic soap opera complete with sex, romance, murder, and
intrigue; "Frankly Zappa," which takes viewers into the streets of Los Angeles
in search of Frank; and OMI's own versions of an exercise program, morning
news, daytime talk, and entertainment coverage. OMI is accepting third-party
program proposals.

     The OMI Channel will also feature a strong music industry presence,
including several radio stations, each with their own unique domain and online
programming schedules. The company has already brought a visual aspect to
radio; it has created the Jimi Hendrix Foundation home page and has produced
several live concerts.

     Only Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. says it is the first company to
use a fleet of multimedia vans to cover live events on the World Wide Web in
real time using photos, video, and live text, a feature that will be called
upon extensively in daily OMI Channel programming.

     For more information about Only Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. and
the OMI Channel, contact Kathryn Thyne at 818/753-0037 or visit the Web sites
at http://www.wavenet.com and http://www.only.com.

A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR PHOTO-REALISTIC MULTIMEDIA

     A new multimedia production company has introduced a new multimedia
technology that combines photo-realistic backgrounds with live actor
animations to produce more detail than normal 3-D images.

     Two experts in multimedia production and publishing have formed a new
multimedia production house called The Armchair Travel Company, Ltd. It has
been co-founded by William Donelson, who spent 10 years with the Media Lab at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and William Beckett,
who has many years of experience with leading U.K. multimedia publishing
companies, including Virgin Interactive Entertainment. The new technology,
called Virtual Travel, was debuted in the company's first CD-ROM game, a
murder mystery called "Foul Play--Mystery At Awkward Manor."

     Virtual Travel uses special photographic techniques and computer software
to simulate the experience of walking through an environment and turning
around to examine it from all angles. The technique uses still frames which
are then made into movie walkways and panoramas. Virtual Travel can use
software specifically developed by Armchair Travel when it is necessary for
animations of live actors to be inserted into the panoramas. Alternatively, it
can use Apple's QuickTimeVR, which has other advantages but does not currently
offer superimposition of animations.

     "Photographic imagery can provide infinitely more detail than even the
most carefully rendered 3D imagery," asserted Donelson, who first conceived of
the Virtual Travel technology in the mid-1970s while working at MIT.

     "The excellent quality achievable using these techniques, combined with
the fast postproduction of Apple's QuickTimeVR technology, is set to
revolutionize the creation of background imagery in multimedia software,"
Donelson said. "You can soon expect to see high-quality interactive tours of
fascinating locations around the world, as well as the innovative use of these
techniques in games."

     Beckett, who has produced multimedia titles that have won British,
American, and European awards, is directing the new company's marketing
efforts.

     The Armchair Travel Company has worked closely with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Apple Computer on the innovative use of
Virtual Travel. Besides its West London office, the company has a
manufacturing and sales base in Memphis.

     For more information, in the U.S. call 800/843-9497, or contact the
London office at 44-171-386-5454, Fax: 44-171-386-5455, e-mail:

AUTO-GRAPHICS' IMPACT/ONLINE GETS TEXAS SCHOOL LIBRARIES CONNECTED

     The Texas Education Agency (TEA) is implementing a statewide technology
initiative known as the Texas Library Connection (TLC). Through this
initiative, it will provide current, relevant information to all citizens of
its school communities regardless of geographic location or district size.
Based on input from the library community, the Instructional Technology
Division of TEA will work with Auto-Graphics Inc. of Pomona, California, to
implement two related information resources projects through this initiative.

     The first resource to be developed identifies the actual, physical
location of books, audio and video tapes, computer software, filmstrips, and
other audio-visual resources by merging all the electronic records of school
library resources into one database. Until now, Texas did not have a statewide
resource-sharing database. The new database, called the TLC union catalog,
identifies the needed book or audiovisual item and points to the location of
the item at the user's local library or at any other district, regional, or
state library.

     The second resource provided by TLC is the electronic full text of
magazines, journals, newspapers, and other informational databases that can be
accessed remotely. Students searching for subjects in these databases will
find the entire magazine or newspaper article about that subject, rather than
simply a citation referring to an article in a newspaper or magazine that may
or may not be available in the student's local library.

     "In order to succeed," said Anita Givens, senior director for
instructional technology, "students must learn the skills necessary to
discover and select relevant information and to use that information to
accomplish specific objectives. TLC provides Texas students with the
opportunity to learn real-world information utilization skills and with access
to an expanded world of resources."

     Students statewide will be able to access Impact/ONLINE and the TLC
database either through direct connections to the Internet or through dial-up
services provided by another state initiative, TENET, the Texas Education
NETwork. Utilizing the TEA's Internet network, TENET, which is already in
place, provided a significant cost savings to the state.

     The diverse geographical aspects of Texas have made connecting the
libraries that serve Texas' 3.6 million students in over 1,000 school
districts a challenge. Gloria McClanahan, director of library media services,
said, "One vital part of this initiative is to ensure universal information
access to students throughout the state of Texas, especially those students
who reside in remote, rural areas."

     Auto-Graphics originally made the database available through the use of
client/server software, but the company also developed a World Wide Web
location so that the database is accessible to any individual using the
Internet with any type of software and hardware. Students can simply do a
search from their school library, and if the resource is at another library,
they can request that the item be sent to their local school library by
creating an interlibrary loan request.

     "Impact/ONLINE will give the state of Texas the ability to provide
resource sharing to every school," said William Kliss, vice president of sales
and marketing at Auto-Graphics. "It will remove the walls from the school
libraries, allowing students to quickly search a much greater resource and
obtain expensive or difficult-to-find materials easily."

     Impact/ONLINE builds in ease-of-use features designed to make students
self-sufficient when accessing information. This includes user-friendly
interfaces and context-sensitive help messages. It also provides librarians
with time-saving cataloging tools for preparing books and other information
resources, enabling these materials to be easily located. Librarians will
minimize the amount of time spent identifying and cataloging material to
enable them to spend more time with students and staff.

     With the advent of Impact/ONLINE, schools that are not currently
automated will have increased choices available to them to automate and have
their records included in the statewide database. This further increases
access to information for students and others throughout the state. There is
also a telecommunications infrastructure initiative in progress that is to
focus on rural areas, with the goal of connecting all remote area schools and
libraries, as well as for use with telemedicine.

     For more information, contact Auto-Graphics, 800/776-6939, 909/595-7204,
Fax: 909/595-3506.

LEWIS AND CLARK COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CREATE DIGITAL LIBRARY WITH AMERITECH
LIBRARY SERVICES

     Dr. Dale Chapman, president of Lewis and Clark Community College in
Godfrey, Illinois, has finalized a strategic alliance with Ameritech Library
Services to support the college's technology initiative to enhance teaching
and learning by the year 2000. By providing its library with Ameritech Library
Services' products and services, including Horizon, NetPublisher, InfoShare,
and WebPAC, Lewis and Clark plans to transform its traditional college library
into a totally integrated library system.

     "We want to have the most advanced technology in the U.S.," said Chapman.
"As a forward-thinking community college, our vision is to empower students
and faculty by integrating technology into the learning process to develop
lifelong education. Our library will play a key role in making this vision a
reality. We plan to create the digital library of the future."

     Lewis and Clark plans to install the following products: Horizon, the
client/server library information system that includes integrated library
automation modules and a variety of easy-to-use interfaces; InfoShare, the
UNIX database server with Z39.50 support for locally storing and managing
citation databases; WebPAC, the server software for libraries that enables end
users with a Web browser to search any Z39.50-compliant database on the
Internet; and WinPAC, the graphical user interface for searching any
Z39.50-compliant database and gopher servers on the Internet.

     "I commend Dr. Chapman and his staff for their commitment to bringing
advanced technology to their students and library patrons," said Maribeth
Ward, vice president of Ameritech Library Services, Academic Market. "In the
near future, community colleges will need to have the capability to provide
access to library resources virtually anywhere, anytime. I see Lewis and Clark
as a model for other community colleges to follow."

     Lewis and Clark serves 6,000 students in all or part of seven counties in
southwestern Illinois. It is the only Illinois community college outside of
the Chicago metro area to offer an associate degree in library technology. The
college recently received the Illinois community College Board's institutional
quality award for academic excellence. The North Central Association of
Colleges (NCAC) recently awarded Lewis and Clark with a 10-year academic
accreditation, the longest term given by the association.

     For more information, contact Ameritech Library Services Academic
Division, Evanston, IL, 708/866-0150, Fax: 708/866-0178.

ITALIAN BOOK VENDOR'S RECORDS AVAILABLE IN RLIN

     Over 18,000 in-process records created by the Italian book dealers
Casalini Libri from 1994 through July 1995 have recently been added to the
RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network) Books file. This heralds the
beginning of a new service from The Research Libraries Group (RLG)--direct
access to and local use of major book vendor records.

     Libraries can use such records in several ways. They provide valuable
citations for new and recent publications. In the case of the Casalini
records, bibliographers or acquisitions librarians can export them with RLIN's
pass or put command to create order records in their local systems. Libraries
that have already received materials described in the records can export them
to use for local cataloging--or can do their cataloging directly in RLIN and
then export the result to the local online public access catalog (OPAC).

     With such book supplier records available in RLIN, individual libraries
are spared the local time and expense of evaluating, loading, and maintaining
these files themselves. In its negotiations with other book vendors, RLG is
concerned about keeping prices as low as possible in order to encourage use of
these records and to assist users in minimizing technical processing costs.

     RLG President James Michalko said that this step responds directly to
RLG's mission. "We're growing RLIN in many ways to enhance its usefulness to
research with early works, currently received materials, primary sources, and
unique cataloging, from the American Antiquarian Society's records to UN
Library data. This new kind of information from Casalini is of particular
import to collections serving international scholarship. It will be of great
value in supporting users of all kinds."

     The Casalini records cover materials of all kinds available in Italy, the
Vatican City, San Marino, the Italian canton of Switzerland, and Malta. They
describe publications in various formats including monographs, serials,
monographic series, microfilm, audiovisual, and CD-ROM. In the future,
Casalini Libri will be adding records regularly to RLIN via Internet file
transfer protocol.

     Casalini Libri order information is included on each record, but these
records represent far more than just a book dealer's title list. Each has been
prepared by expert staff directly from the published works, gives complete
bibliographical information, and, if necessary, includes notes in English with
additional details (which may not be evident from the strict bibliographic
description of the work) that Casalini Libri believes to be of significance to
selectors. Important noncommercial publications, even though they may not be
for sale, are also included. And in particular circumstances, unrevised
reprints, extracts, and theses are described.

     "This new service combines the value of records like the Casalini's with
RLIN's ability to integrate service into the local processing environment,"
said Linda Lerman, RLG bibliographic services officer. "Negotiations are
progressing with other book dealers who count RLG's members and RLIN users
among their best clients. A key goal is to help shorten the distance from
initial publication to having a work in the library, ready for use."

THE LIBRARY CORPORATION UPDATES INTEGRATED TECHNICAL SERVICES SOFTWARE

     The Library Corporation recently released a new set of enhancements to
the ITS for Windows Integrated Technical Services Workstation software. The
update includes enhancements and features suggested by technical services
staff at various levels:

     --   Several record saving options are now available. Users may save to
the active (master) file, an export (transaction) file, and/or an external
system, in any combination, simultaneously. These options may be toggled on
and off at will. A separate option permits users to save a single record to a
separate new or existing MARC file without altering default configuration
settings.

     --   A publisher's ISBN prefix may now be used to generate a Result Set
that lists all of that publisher's works.

     --   Users may limit a search to an entire country instead of a single
political subdivision. For example, to search for items published in the U.S.,
users may enter "??u" as the place of publication.

     --   Configuration changes that were made on-the-fly may be abandoned at
any time in favor of the last saved default configuration.

     --   Enhancements to the MARC editor make it easier to move among open
records. Users may now select multiple entries from a Result Set and have
multiple MARC editors open at once. In addition, users may move among open
records with a keystroke or mouse click.

     --   Users may now choose to search until a dataset produces a Result
Set, and then continue the search with the next available dataset. Users may
also choose to search all datasets at once and produce a separate Result Set
for each.

     "Records come up quickly, and being able to look at more than one record
at a time is most helpful," said Debra Mattingly, director of the Washington
County (Jonesborough, Tennessee) Library. "I find it useful to tile
horizontally so I can easily cut and paste from one field or record to
another. This is especially helpful with multiple 949 holding fields."

     The Library Corporation (TLC) is a principal supplier of automated
library management and reference systems. TLC develops and markets
computer-based bibliographic information retrieval and automation systems to
public, university, school, and special libraries in the U.S., Canada, and
around the world.

INFORMATION DIMENSIONS DELIVERS ELECTRONIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR
INTRANETS

     Information Dimensions, Inc. has announced the availability of its
TECHLIBplus OPAC for Intranets, expanding its TECHLIBplus electronic library
management system to include Intranet patron access. This allows corporations,
government organizations, and specialized libraries to cost-effectively
deliver their automated library services to a broader audience by leveraging
the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.

     TECHLIBplus OPAC for Intranets provides direct access to the library
catalog with complete item status details and user request features using
popular Web client software. The system utilizes Information Dimensions' BASIS
WEBserver, which integrates popular Web servers, such as those from Netscape
Communications Corporation, with the BASIS Document Manager. This provides a
secure environment designed for publishing and managing large-scale document
collections that reside behind a firewall.

     TECHLIBplus is a fully integrated library system designed for special
libraries and corporate information centers. It offers full library
services--acquisitions, cataloging, searching, circulation functions for books
and other materials, serials tracking, as well as control functions such as
ordering, renewing, receiving, claiming, and routing. TECHLIBplus is built on
Information Dimensions' BASIS Document Manager, which provides an
extended-relational database structure optimized to manage text and documents.
In addition to traditional bibliographic descriptions, TECHLIBplus provides
access to tables of contents, abstracts, and full-text documents, and it
manages compound documents containing text, word processing markup, graphics,
and images.

     "The Web is already an integrated part of the computing infrastructure
within most enterprises, making it an ideal platform for document-centric
applications," said Bill Forquer, vice president of marketing at Information
Dimensions. "Electronic library management is an ideal Intranet application
because companies will be able to achieve easier access to library resources,
lower their cost of computing, and improve ease-of-use and maintenance."

     Information Dimension's Intranet strategy is built around its BASIS
Document Manager and BASIS WEBserver products, which provide for managing
large-scale document collections. These tools include complete library
services, full-text retrieval, robust document storage management, link
management, document control, document delivery, security, and authentication.
Recognizing the significant role of the corporate library in managing
information assets, Information Dimensions has made electronic library
management for the Intranet an essential component of its strategy to deliver
Intranet-based document management solutions. Additional Intranet application
areas include regulatory compliance, competitive and market intelligence,
technical document publishing, policies and procedures, research, and records
management.

     TECHLIBplus and OPAC for Intranets are available immediately. Prices for
TECHLIBplus begin at $20,000 on IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun OS, Solaris, and Digital
UNIX platforms. TECHLIBplus is sold internationally through Information
Dimensions' direct sales operations, value-added resellers, and distributors.

     For more information, contact Information Dimensions, Dublin, OH,

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MAINE LOGS 62 MILLIONTH OCLC ILL REQUEST

     The University of Southern Maine, located in Portland, logged the 62
millionth OCLC interlibrary loan request on October 20 for an article on
social work. The request was for the article "Integrative Model for Group
Work" in the quarterly serial "Social Work with Groups." The Department of
Veterans Affairs Learning Resources Center, in Togus, Maine, filled the
request on October 24.

     The 62 millionth OCLC interlibrary loan request came 37 days after the 61
millionth. "I was working away--just doing what I do every day," said Adrienne
Andrews, interlibrary loan assistant at the University of Southern Maine
Library who made the request. "I've been doing this for seven years and I
thought, 'If I hit it, I hit it, and if I don't, I don't.'"

     That laid-back attitude doesn't mean Andrews wasn't excited after
reaching the milestone. "I was really surprised to see the number, " she said.
"I shouted, 'I did it!' I think I startled some of the staff in the other
room."

     "We were all thrilled for Adrienne," said Casandra Fitzherbert,
interlibrary loan librarian at the University of Southern Maine Library.
Barbara Stevens completes the three-member interlibrary loan staff at the
library, a staff that helped make the University of Southern Maine one of the
top 20 lenders in New England this year, according to Fitzherbert. Total
lending and borrowing tops 20,000 transactions annually, she said.

     The University of Southern Maine comprises two campuses. In Portland, the
primary academic disciplines include psychology, business, and nursing. In
Gorham, the emphasis is on geoscience, music, and education.

     Located on the coast of southern Maine, the University of Southern Maine,
Portland campus, serves approximately 9,000 students. "As a state-supported
school, we also serve the general community," said Fitzherbert.

     The university library is located in a renovated cookie factory that had
been empty for some 25 years. "It's been renovated and now it's a very
high-tech, seven-story library in the heart of Portland."

     Northern Illinois University, in De Kalb, logged the 61 millionth OCLC
interlibrary loan request on September 13.

     The OCLC interlibrary loan system was activated in 1979. In the 1994/95
fiscal year, 5,400 libraries arranged over 7.5 million loans on OCLC's
interlibrary loan system.

     OCLC Online Computer Library Center is a nonprofit computer library
service and research organization whose computer network and services link
more than 21,000 libraries in 63 countries and territories.

     For more information, contact OCLC, Dublin, OH, 614/764-6000, Fax:
614/764-6096.

LOTUS INTERNOTES WEB NAVIGATOR BRINGS THE WEB TO THE NOTES DESKTOP

     Lotus Development Corp. has announced the forthcoming Lotus Notes Release
4, with its InterNotes Web Navigator, that makes it easier for users to
incorporate Internet information into their core business processes.

     The InterNotes Web Navigator translates Internet content directly into
Lotus Notes applications, allowing users to manipulate that information using
capabilities with application development, security, replication, mobile
access, and messaging.

     InterNotes Web Navigator takes full advantage of Notes Release 4's
intelligent agent builder, the Notes macro language or LotusScript to
automatically conduct searches and retrievals on the Web. Using this
capability, a user with responsibility for analyzing competitors, for example,
could program agents to retrieve Web pages from competitors' Web sites when
information is posted or altered. The Navigator could bring those pages to a
Notes database containing competitive information, then Notes would distribute
the updated information to the company's sales force every morning.

     InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML 3.0 documents,
including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and URLs, into Notes
for management in Notes. Notes users can also browse and retrieve Internet
information that exists beyond the Web, such as ftp, gopher, and Usenet, and
integrate it into Notes applications.

     Because InterNotes Web Navigator resides on a server, it eliminates the
need to provide TCP/IP on every client. Administrators have the option to
allow and deny access to specific sites, and frequently accessed pages can be
cached. Users can conduct Verity full-text searches, manage the data by
selected views (by category, by date, by name, etc.), or replicate the Web
database to their laptops for disconnected use. The InterNotes Web Navigator
also lets users mail Web pages to colleagues complete with hypertext links
intact, share bookmarks, or create a 'Web Tour.' Users can also rate favorite
Web sites and generate URL lists.

     The InterNotes Web Navigator and Lotus Notes 4 will support the same open
standards as the Internet, including TCP/IP and SMTP, HTTP, and HTML. The
InterNotes Web Navigator will ship in every Lotus Notes Release 4 client at no
extra cost. It will be available on Windows, OS/2, Mac, and UNIX, and will
support SPX, NetBIOS, Appletalk, and Banyan Vines.

     For more information on Lotus Notes in North America, contact Lotus at
800/346-1305.

KENT STATE UNIVERSITY USES OCLC TECHPRO SERVICE

     Kent State University, located in Kent, Ohio, is using the OCLC TECHPRO
service to catalog new books, backlogged gift materials, and university
dissertations and theses.

     "We decided to contract out our cataloging to reduce the cost of running
our technical services operation and to reallocate some of our staff to public
services," said Jeff Gatten, head of collection management at the library.

     Kent State University is sending more than 70 books by courier to OCLC
each working day. TECHPRO staff catalog the books and send records back to
Kent State via Electronic Data Exchange using OCLC's Internet ftp service.

ISI INTRODUCES RESEARCH ALERT DIRECT INTERNET-DELIVERED ALERTING PRODUCTS

     The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) has announced a new line
of Internet-delivered alerting services called Research Alert Direct (RAD).
These newly created services bring customized, affordable research information
directly to the end user's desktop. Six product packages--Journal Tracker,
Personal Alert, Professional Alert, Corporate Alert, Topics Select, and Focus
On--comprise a suite of profiled services available to the researcher and
information specialist. All Research Alert Direct products are drawn from
ISI's multidisciplinary database searching over 16,000 leading international
science, social science, and arts and humanities journals, books, and
proceedings.

     Research Alert Direct provides current, complete bibliographic
information that matches a user's profile. Information is drawn from the
contents of recently published journals, books, and proceedings as they are
processed for the ISI database. The product offerings include English-language
author abstracts as well as features such as author keywords, Keywords Plus,
and electronic ordering capability utilizing The Genuine Article (TGA), a
document delivery service provided by ISI. TGA processes all requests within
24 hours of receipt--within 30 minutes for special-request fax deliveries.

     Research Alert Direct products were developed to fulfill market requests
for flexible yet powerful electronic current awareness services. All of the
RAD products offer Internet delivery of current research information directly
to the desktop at an affordable price and at a frequency determined by the
user.

     Journal Tracker provides researchers with a cost-effective way to track
the tables of contents of up to 25 journals.

     Professional Alert and Personal Alert deliver customized, confidential
profiles to an individual or to several individuals within a department. These
profiles utilize ISI's unique capability to perform cited reference searching.
Searching on citations--the references or bibliographies published within
scholarly articles--provides users with the most targeted and refined profiles
on the market today. Unlimited profiling consultation is provided by ISI's
knowledgeable information specialists.

     Corporate Alert is designed to allow many corporate users to receive at
their desktops the tables of contents of journals at a reasonable cost.
Subscribers will work with ISI staff to set up individually defined profiles
from a selection of journals agreed to in the custom contract.

     Topics Select allows users to choose from a wide variety of predefined
search topics in the biomedical, physical science, engineering and technology,
and social science areas.

     Focus On is designed for users requiring substantial coverage of a
research field, along with the ability to search the data sets. These data
sets will use a Windows-based search engine to provide sophisticated
information search and retrieval capabilities. This product will be offered on
diskette or through the Internet. The Focus On data sets will provide broad
coverage of the current research literature.

     "We believe that Research Alert Direct provides a strong response to
critical challenges facing researchers today--timely access to affordable and
relevant information about leading scientific and technology developments,"
said Merle Jaffe, vice president and general manager of specialized current
awareness products, ISI. "Researchers and information specialists can define
personalized profiles or select predefined topics. The bibliographic data
delivered to their desktops will be customized to meet their needs, and
full-text ordering can be done electronically."

     Currently in a beta test phase, the Research Alert Direct products will
be offered to the entire research community in the first quarter of 1996.

U.S. PATENTS CITATION DATABASE NOW ON THE WEB

     Community of Science, Inc., a leading World Wide Web electronic
publishing company based in Bethesda, Maryland, has introduced a fully
searchable version of the U.S. Patents Citation Database on the World Wide
Web. The U.S. Patents Citation Database on the Community of Science is a joint
venture of Community of Science and CHI Research, Inc., an internationally
recognized research consultancy specializing in the development and analysis
of science and technology indicators.

     This fully searchable U.S. Patents Citation Database contains all of the
approximately 1.7 million U.S. patents issued since 1975 and, according to the
company, is the most comprehensive source of patent information available on
the Internet.

     The database is updated weekly and permits subscribers to search all of
the important "front page" information about each patent: number, dates,
assignee, inventor, title, abstract, exemplary claims for recent years, and
U.S. and international classifications. In addition, the database tracks the
"lineage" of each patent--how each patent cites previous patents or is cited
by subsequent ones.

     Citation analysis is a key enhancement of the patent database and makes
it significantly more powerful than other databases of its kind.
Technologically significant patents tend to be cited more frequently than
those that are of lesser impact.

     The U.S. Patents Citation Database on the Community of Science has
extensive search capabilities. All important fields in the database are fully
indexed and can be searched using standard Boolean query mechanisms. It is
also searchable through a unique approach to the U.S. Patents Manual of
Classification, which permits searchers to identify specific areas of interest
through a meta-database query and to navigate across the classification
hierarchy using browse-and-search combinations to retrieve sought-after
information.

     The U.S. Patents Citation Database can be accessed on the Community of
Science Web server at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL):
http://cos.gdb.org. The service will be free of charge for all Community of
Science member institutions and available for $500 for individual accounts, or
somewhat higher for library and corporate accounts, for 12-month periods.

     For subscription and access information , contact Charles Wise at
Community of Science, Inc., 410/563-5382, e-mail: cw3@bestpl.hcf.jhu.edu.

JUPITER AND YAHOO! PUBLISH WEB SURVEY RESULTS

     A joint venture between Yahoo!, publisher of the Yahoo! browsable
Internet directory and search engine, and Jupiter Communications, a new media
research, publishing, and consulting firm, the Yahoo!/Jupiter Web User Survey
has been completed.

     According to the companies, the survey was designed to be the most
complete explication of the demographics and habits of the World Wide Web
community.

     The report gives a sharply focused picture of who is using the Web today,
what they are doing, what they want to do, and where the medium is headed
through the end of the decade.

     "The large numbers of current users accessing from home validates the
notion that the Web is truly a developing consumer medium," said Jupiter
managing director Kurt Abrahamson. "The World Wide Web will be a transactional
platform and a vital advertising venue. The survey results back up the
strength of the Web for all sorts of commercial ventures aimed at consumers."

     Some key findings revealed by the survey have been released. The home is
the predominant access point. Online services were found to provide relatively
few users to the Web as compared to direct Internet access. However, six in 10
users of the Web also have access to a commercial online service. Web users
can be described as both well educated and affluent. Substantial time is spent
online, with the average user's online time being approximately 20 hours per
week. A large portion of respondents (61 percent) reported that they are
spending less time watching television because they were spending time online.

NONPROFIT FORUM LAUNCHED ON COMPUSERVE ONLINE SERVICE

     A new online resource for charitable organizations worldwide has been
launched on CompuServe. The private subscription service is called NonProfit
Forum.  This national/international online information service brings a
multitude of tools to professionals, trustees, and volunteers of nonprofit
organizations and greatly enhances peer-to-peer networking.

     Online articles and discussion topics in the forum include: nonprofit
news and trends; professional and association news; leadership, management,
governance and trusteeship; legislative issues; financial accountability;
volunteers; planning; philanthropy and fund raising; planned giving; training
opportunities; computers and technology; career strategies; job postings; and
more.

     "Whether you're a staff member or a volunteer, running a charity and
raising money are tough jobs," said founder Sheree Parris Nudd, an 18-year
nonprofit veteran. "It can be hard to have the time to sift through all the
information that is out there to find what you need. That's where NonProfit
Forum comes in. If we don't already have information pointing to the resource
you need, we go out and find it for you."

     Because NonProfit Forum is a private service, a special CompuServe member
ID is required in order to subscribe. Software kits are available by calling
800/524-3388 and requesting a NonProfit Forum kit from representative #762.

     The first month of NonProfit Forum is free. After that, the subscription
is $15 per month for unlimited time inside the forum. (The fee does not
include the basic CompuServe fee of $9.95 per month.) Membership is open to
anyone.

TONI OLSHEN

     The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) has named Toni Olshen,
associate university librarian at York University, to the position of visiting
program office with ARL's Diversity Program. Olshen will concentrate her
research on diversity issues in both large academic and public libraries in
Canada. From November 1995 through May 1996, she will work with Kriza
Jennings, ARL program officer for diversity and minority recruitment, to
incorporate the Canadian research library perspective into ARL's diversity
program. She will also work with Jennings in developing model processes and
will learn to lead ARL diversity workshops focusing on Canadian libraries.

     Support for Olshen's role as visiting program officer is provided by York
University. The diversity program assists libraries in addressing a multitude
of diversity-related issues. Its primary concern is the development of
workplace climates that welcome, develop, foster, and support diversity. The
program seeks to develop an awareness of human differences that leads to a
valuing of and respect for these distinctions.

     An ARL visiting program officer (VPO) appointment is made when there is
a match between the Association's agenda, the expertise and availability of an
individual in an ARL member library, and the support of the member library
director. Inquiries about the VPO program may be directed to Jaia Barrett, ARL
deputy executive director (jaia@cni.org).

DATA/WARE DEVELOPMENT'S COLOR LABELS PRINT DIRECTLY ON CDS

     Data/Ware Development, a San Diego-based hardware developer and
manufacturer, has announced the release of ChameleonDirect, an automated,
4-color CD label printer. It prints text and bitmaps directly on
hydroscopically coated CD media, available from Eastman Kodak, MTC, TDK, and
Ricoh. These CDs accept the bubble jet ink used by ChameleonDirect and provide
near silk-screen quality color and resolution.

     In addition to providing a way to enhance CDs with a colorful logo or
other design, ChameleonDirect eliminates the manual labor associated with
printing and applying paper labels. Eliminating paper labels also prevents
out-of-balance effects in high-speed CD-ROM drives and the risk of media
damage due to label delamination.

     Additionally, ChameleonDirect requires no CD caddies or carriers, and
applies no heat or pressure to CDs during printing. The printer includes a
built-in motorized CD tray that transports the media through the print station
and returns it to the front of the printer. Customers don't have to deal with
awkward rear-to-front feeding or replacing worn-out cardboard print caddies.
The front loading/unloading design gives users the option of manually loading
individual CDs for printing, or using the ChameleonTransporter, labels can
automatically be printed on up to 75 CDs without operator intervention.

     For more information, contact Data/Ware Development, San Diego, CA,
619/453-7660, Fax: 619/453-2794.

ELECTRONIC COURSE MATERIALS FOR LEXIS-NEXIS MILLENNIUM INITIATIVE

     Under an agreement with LEXIS-NEXIS, seven law professors from Harvard
University Law School will create electronic course materials for law school,
authoring an electronic series of lectures and casebooks for use with
LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office. Student Office is a software suite of the
LEXIS-NEXIS Millennium Initiative.

     The Harvard professors will develop an integrated first-year law school
curriculum covering legal analysis, research, writing, and argumentation. They
will also electronically publish course materials that can be adapted to the
different needs of individual law school programs.

     First available for use in the fall 1996 semester, this four-year series
of electronic course materials will be based on the Folio Infobase software
platform that law students access through LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office.

     This agreement represents the first commissioned project of the LEXIS
Electronic Authors press, a component of the LEXIS-NEXIS Millennium
Initiative. The initiative is a program that integrates technology and the
teaching of law by working with law schools and faculty in the progression to
an electronic legal education program. Under the initiative, law faculty are
furnished with the software platform to transform course materials into
electronic casebooks and students are enabled to use their personal computers
to access and organize information from a variety of sources. The LEXIS
Electronic Authors Press is a new publisher of electronic casebooks authored
by law professors for students to use with the LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office
suite of software.

     For more information, contact LEXIS-NEXIS, Dayton, OH, 513/865-6800.

IHS ACQUIRES ERM'S ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY DATABASES

     The Environmental Resources Management Group has announced the sale of
ERM Computer Services and ENFLEX environmental, health, and safety (EHS)
databases to Information Handling Services Group (IHS Group) of Englewood,
Colorado. The new company to be formed, IHS Environmental, Inc., will be a
part of IHS Regulatory Products, Inc. and will produce and market the ENFLEX
environmental, health, and safety databases and the EarthLaw Environmental and
Safety Libraries.

     IHS Environmental will maintain a strategic alliance with the
Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group and will continue to draw on
the resources of this international environmental consulting organization to
provide clients with environmental, health, and safety regulatory information
and to produce additional value-added environmental information products.

     According to both organizations, the combination of expert environmental
health and safety knowledge and  a keen understanding of the information
business will enable IHS Environmental to expand the products and offer new
delivery mechanisms for the constantly changing environmental, health, and
safety marketplace.

     Chris Meyer, president of IHS Regulatory Products and CFO of the IHS
Group, said, "By combining the relative strengths of IHS Regulatory and its
EarthLaw environmental database with ENFLEX and a strategic alliance with the
ERM Group, IHS will be a premium provider of information on U.S. and
international environmental, health, and safety laws, rules, regulations and
their implications on business."

     ERM Computer Services and IHS Regulatory Products are recognized as
leading suppliers of environmental, health, and safety regulatory information
with the focus on providing this information to professionals in industry,
government, and education sectors. ERM's introduction of ENFLEX for Windows in
December 1994 increased the client base and set a standard for environmental,
health, and safety regulatory products in Windows.

     ERM Computer Services' 60 employees will remain with the company and
operations will continue to be conducted from the Exton, Pennsylvania
headquarters. Brian Gurnham will continue as president of IHS Environmental.
The same editorial staff of environmental, health, and safety information
professionals will continue to prepare the ENFLEX-EarthLaw database and
support the ENFLEX-EarthLaw product line.

     The combined ENFLEX-EarthLaw product line provides current and
comprehensive coverage of federal, state, and international environmental,
health, and safety regulatory information. It offers extensive coverage of
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation
(DOT), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Coast Guard,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations and corresponding coverage for
all 50 states. With the addition of EarthLaw's industry standards and military
specifications, ENFLEX-EarthLaw is a complete source for environmental,
health, and safety regulatory information. These products are available on
CD-ROM, online, magnetic media, and the Internet.

     For more information, contact Environmental Resources Management Group,
Exton, PA, 800/544-3117.

INSPEC TO COVER ELECTRONIC JOURNALS

     INSPEC has announced that it is extending its coverage of journals
available in electronic form. The type of electronic journals that will be
selected for indexing must contain peer-reviewed articles, which are
permanently stored in an archive maintained by a publisher. Examples of
journals that will be scanned for the database include "The Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Research" (published by the AI Access Foundation) and
"TCAD" ("Technology Computer Aided Design"), a forthcoming publication of the
IEEE.

     To accommodate electronic journals, some new fields have been created on
the INSPEC Tape Services. These are Document Number and URLs (Uniform Resource
Locators). The Document Numbers will be used for wholly electronic journals
(or for electronic journals published in parallel to print) that give articles
a unique number. Where they are believed to be stable, URLs will be given both
at the individual article level and at the level of the complete journal or
electronic document collection.

     In addition, INSPEC is enhancing journal records from the start of this
year by adding the following data:

     --   The ANSI Z39.56 Serial Item Contribution Identifier (SICI) codes
     --   The name of the publisher of the journal

     This has previously been given in the INSPEC record for nonserial
publications. Journal publisher information only appeared in the List of
Journals.

     For more information, contact IEE/INSPEC Department, IEEE Operations
Center, Piscataway, NJ, 908/562-5549.

OCLC FIRSTSEARCH, EPIC NEWS

2.5 MILLION INSPEC RECORDS ADDED; 5 MILLION RECORDS NOW AVAILABLE

     OCLC has increased its coverage of the INSPEC scientific and technical
database available on OCLC's FirstSearch and EPIC services, with the addition
of some 2.5 million records dating from January 1, 1969.

     Published by the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), the INSPEC
database is a comprehensive source of published reference
literature--conference proceedings, scientific and technical journals--in
physics, electrical engineering, computing and control, electronics, and
information technology.

     INSPEC records dating from 1987 have been available to researchers
through the FirstSearch service (on a per-search basis) and EPIC since
November 1993. OCLC has updated this database weekly since it became available
and will continue to do so after the addition of the INSPEC backfiles.

     "INSPEC is an essential resource for its breadth of coverage in all
fields of physics and electrical engineering," said Rick Noble, OCLC vice
president, reference services. "It's a cornerstone of FirstSearch's list of
engineering and technology databases."

EBSCOMAGS INCREASES FULL-TEXT AVAILABILITY

     OCLC's FirstSearch and EPIC services now offer the EBSCOMags database
from EBSCO Publishing. Featuring abstracts and indexes from more than 2,300
periodicals and ASCII full text online from more than 1,000 of those
periodicals, EBSCOMags is the fourth database on FirstSearch and EPIC to
support full text online.

     EBSCOMags is the FirstSearch and EPIC version of EBSCO Publishing's
MasterFILE FullTEXT 1,000 database. The database contains abstracts from
business, humanities, general science, social science, health, trade, and
vocation periodicals. In addition, it provides cover-to-cover indexing and
abstracting for "The New York Times" and "The Wall Street Journal" as well as
700 full-text consumer health brochures and 3,500 full-text Magill book
reviews.

     FirstSearch and EPIC users can search the EBSCOMags database as well as
other bibliographic databases to identify citations of interest. Users can
order delivery of the full text of the citations if the full text is available
in the EBSCOMags or other FirstSearch or EPIC databases, such as ArticleFirst
and FastDoc. FirstSearch and EPIC allow users to limit searches to citations
that have ASCII full text available online.

     The database contains abstracts and indices of periodicals published from
1984 to present, with the earliest full-text articles dating from 1990.

     EBSCOMags is available as a per-search and subscription database on
FirstSearch and is database 85 on EPIC.

     The FirstSearch service is designed for people who use libraries, with an
end-user interface that allows users to move through the online search process
in a few steps.

     EPIC, a full-featured online reference system that provides subject
access and keyword and Boolean searching to a variety of databases, is used
mostly by librarians and experienced searchers.

OVID IMPLEMENTS SPORT DATABASE

     Ovid Technologies, Inc. and the Sport Information Resource Center
recently agreed to make the SPORT Database available with Ovid software for
CD-ROM, hard disk, and fixed-fee online platforms. The new implementations
will complement Ovid's pay-as-you-go version of the SPORT Database, which is
currently available via Ovid Online.

     The SPORT Database contains bibliographic records, many with abstracts,
of serial and monographic literature in the areas of sport, recreation,
exercise physiology, sports medicine, coaching, physical fitness, as well as
the psychology, history and sociology of sports, training and conditioning.
The database's scope is international, and it covers materials from 1949 to
the present.

LILLY COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF COMMUNITY MEDICAL INFORMATION NETWORKS
OPERATOR

     Eli Lilly and Company and Integrated Medical Systems, Inc. have announced
that Lilly has completed its acquisition of Integrated Medical Systems, Inc.,
a developer and operator of medical communication networks. This follows the
announcement on August 3, 1995, that both companies had reached an agreement
in principle.

     Lilly acquired a minority interest in IMS as part of its purchase of PCS
Health Systems, Inc. from McKesson Corpora-tion in 1994. In partnership with
IMS, PCS became the first pharmacy benefit manager to offer electronic links
to physicians. The industry-leading information technology capabilities
offered by PCS also include online connections to more than 54,000 pharmacies
and 1,300 health plans.

     "The acquisition of IMS provides an opportunity for Lilly to forge closer
ties with health care providers and payers by giving it the ability to get
information quickly to people who provide care and make health care
decisions," said Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., president of North American
pharmaceutical operations for Lilly. "The IMS and PCS networks and technology
working together will provide physicians with the clinically-based patient and
drug information they need to support the delivery of quality, cost-effective
prescription therapy that will ultimately benefit consumers. IMS delivers
practical, cost-effective communication and information solutions that are
actively used by our clients throughout the United States," said Kevin Green,
president and chief executive officer of IMS. "This merger will permit us to
accelerate further development and deployment of our networks and provide
additional value to our customers through advanced technologies and a broader
array of products and services."

     Lilly is a global research-based pharmaceutical corporation headquartered
in Indianapolis, Indiana, that is dedicated to creating and delivering health
care solutions.

     IMS, of Golden, Colorado, is a provider of physician-focused, electronic
communication networks and services delivering decision-critical information
to the health care industry.

IIA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR WHITE PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO CURB INTERNET
PORNOGRAPHY

     The Information Industry Association (IIA) has announced its support for
a proposal submitted by Representative Rick White, (R-Wash.), which would
protect minors from accessing pornographic material on the Internet, while
providing incentives for online service providers to regulate material on
their services that could be deemed "harmful to minors." The language is
currently being debated by House Conference Committee conferees to H.R. 1555,
the "Telecommunications Act of 1995."

     IIA is the leading trade association representing over 500 companies
involved in providing and distributing information products and services
worldwide. Since its founding in 1968, IIA has been at the forefront of policy
decisions and initiatives that have shaped the National Information
Infrastructure.

     The White language would make it illegal for online service providers to
knowingly send directly to minors or to electronically display any material
that is deemed harmful to minors, ensure limited liability for Internet access
providers regarding content not under their control, and protect online
service providers from liability if they screen offensive material.

     "IIA and its members have always championed the responsible use of online
services. The White proposal represents a sensible balance between the need to
protect our children from pornographic material and efforts to invigorate the
Internet through the free and open exchange of ideas without fear of excessive
government regulation," said Ronald G. Dunn, president of IIA.

     Previous proposals to impose liabilities for online service providers
have been troublesome to IIA and its members, particularly because they failed
to reflect marketplace realities, threatened First Amendment rights, and
excluded incentives for users to act responsibly.

     "Government oversight and regulation is no substitute for market-based
solutions and parental empowerment. The White proposal would not only create
incentives for the development of encryption technologies, thereby limiting
the possibility of a 'chilling effect' on the Internet, but would give parents
a larger role in deciding what is appropriate viewing material for their
children," Dunn said.

     For more information, contact the Information Industry Association,
Washington, DC, 202/639-8262.

     Librarians who have developed innovative information systems may be
eligible for a cash award of $1,500 and recognition at the National Online
Meeting in New York.

     The annual Library Technology award from UMI honors librarians who
develop systems that make it easier for library patrons to find and use
information.

     UMI is now accepting nominations for the 1996 award. A special entry form
is not needed. To nominate someone, write a one- to two-page essay that
includes the name of the librarian and a brief description of his or her
accomplishments. Librarians may nominate themselves.

     Any library technology established in 1995, which directly benefits
public, academic, or corporate library patrons, is eligible for consideration.
Entries must be postmarked by March 1 and mailed to UMI 1996 Library
Technology Award, Attn: Thomas Pack, 620 South Third Street, Louisville, KY
40202-2475.

1995 WINNER--NAVIGATING THE INTERNET

     Last year's winner, Robert H. Miller, assistant library director at the
Salem (Oregon) Public Library, helped the institution become the first public
library in the state to navigate the Internet.

     Miller managed the final planning stage of a project that made the
library, in partnership with the City/County Data Center, the full-service
Internet provider of choice to the Salem area. The system also made local
government files available online to the community and established a new
channel for voters to communicate with elected public officials.

     As a result of his pioneering efforts, recognized by UMI and his home
community, Miller will serve as the independent judge for the 1996 Library
Technology award. The award was established in 1991 in cooperation with
Information Today, Inc., sponsor of the annual National Online Meeting.

HEALTH CARE ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

     A new survey suggests that the information revolution is redefining
access to health care. Consumers are more accepting of health information,
including advice about treatment received through a telephone or online
service, even if it means giving up a face-to-face visit with a care provider.

     These are among the findings of a statewide survey sponsored by Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM). The survey was released recently
at a national conference in Minneapolis entitled, "Health Care on the
Superhighway: The Information Management Revolution."

     The survey was conducted last October among benefit decision makers in
companies with 100 or more employees and among Minnesota residents who receive
health care coverage from an employer with 100 or more workers.

     "The survey is the clearest evidence to date of how dramatically access
to health care is being redefined by both employers and employees," said Jim
Woodburn, M.D., medical director of national accounts for Blue Plus, the HMO
affiliate of BCBSM. "How people get information--and in some cases, even
treatment--is less important than the quality and convenience of the
information."

     Woodburn said that personal contact with care providers remains important
for many health-related issues, but giving up some face-to-face contact might
be an acceptable trade-off for health information received over the telephone
or with a computer.

     The survey asked consumers and employers to evaluate three different
electronic services. The most highly regarded by both groups is a 24-hour
telephone service in which a nurse diagnoses a health problem and provides the
caller with recommendations for self-treatment.

     About eight out of 10 health care consumers surveyed--77 percent--said
they would use such a service, and 81 percent of employers in companies of
more than 100 employees would be likely to offer the service if it was
available.

     A telephone or online service that provides information on health care
topics of general interest would be used by 63 percent of the consumers and
offered by 61 percent of employers, according to the survey.

     The third option posed in the survey--telephone or online directories
that list health care providers and specific information on quality of care,
patient satisfaction measures, and fees--would likely be used by 60 percent of
consumers and 61 percent of employers.

     Both employers and their insured workers and families place a high value
on the quality of electronic information services. However, convenience ranks
nearly as high as quality among the factors that would influence consumers'
decisions to use telephone or online services. The services' cost is cited as
an influential factor by only 38 percent of consumers.

     Cost, however, is paramount to employers, cited by 62 percent as an
influential factor. Quality--cited by 55 percent of employers--ranks second
among issues that would shape an employer's decision to offer electronic
services as part of a company health plan.

     "What makes the findings especially striking is the high acceptance of
electronic information services even though both employees and employers
believe they would depersonalize health care," said Woodburn.

     While majorities of both consumers and employers said that electronic
services could depersonalize health care, the survey found that, for 44
percent of consumers, electronic information might be a satisfactory
replacement for face-to-face contact with a health care provider.

HEALTH CARE IN THE YEAR 2000

     Both employers and employees are convinced that electronic health
information services will dramatically increase access to health care in the
year 2000, but they are less certain about the impact on quality and cost.

     The two groups were asked to assume that in the year 2000, 25 percent of
all information about treatment options was provided through electronic
services. Based on that scenario, 83 percent of employers and 77 percent of
consumers said health care would be more accessible. However, only 68 percent
of employers and 57 percent of employees said care would be more affordable
five years from now. Sixty percent of employers said that quality of health
care would improve, but a minority of employees--49 percent-- agreed that
quality would be higher at the turn of the century.

ABOUT THE SURVEY

     The survey was conducted by Rockwood Research. Interviews of both
employers and people covered by an employer-provided health plan were
conducted by telephone between October 19th and 26th, 1995.

     For more information, contact BCBSM, Eagen, MN, 612/456-1502.

IEEE-USA SAYS INTERNET FILTERS OFFER BEST PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN

     IEEE-U.S. Activities (IEEE-USA) is urging Congress to heed the growing
promise of Internet filtering technology as the best way to protect children
in cyberspace. With divergent House and Senate approaches contained in
telecom-reform bills still awaiting conference-committee action, Internet
content control continues to be a bone of contention between proponents of
federal regulation and free-speech advocates.

     "Internet filters work as a child-safety cap on the personal computer,"
according to IEEE-USA Board Chair Joel B. Snyder. "This technology can give
users and their families control over choices on the Internet, without
government having to resort to unnecessary and ineffective controls on the
free flow of information."

     Driving the legislative debate so far have been fears that the
unregulated growth of cyberspace has opened opportunities for purveyors of
obscene or indecent materials to reach children now going online at home and
at school. While some believe that federal restrictions on content providers
are the answer, IEEE-USA argues that government censorship attempts will not
work on the transnational Internet and warns that government controls threaten
to choke a vibrant medium founded on free information exchange.

     The 33rd Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting in Stockholm,
chaired this past summer by Internet pioneer and IEEE Fellow Vinton G. Cerf,
led to a new IETF working group that is developing the necessary technical
standards for reader-selectivity products. In the U.S., a broad industry
consortium announced in September that it will create a consensual
content-labeling system, the Platform for Internet Content Selection,
scheduled for release in early 1996.

     Most content-filtering methods fall into one of three categories. Host
access control features software packages that run on the user's computer and
exclude access to sources known to contain objectionable material or that
allow access only to sites designated as acceptable. Information filtering
using source labels would allow specific materials to be rated by their source
and filtered. Information filtering using third-party ratings combines the
advantages of third-party monitoring with fine "granularity," an ability to
sort materials within even a single document. Consumers could subscribe to a
rating service to select or exclude content based on that organization's
criteria.

     In the near future, responsible adults may be able to combine a variety
of technical approaches to create the most appropriate environment for
children in their care. For example, parents might install labeling-compliant
browser software on the home computer, subscribe to a third-party service, and
configure the browser to verify for age-appropriateness with the labeling
service before downloading text or pictures or connecting to chat groups. They
might also configure the browser to block children's access to items the
service has not labeled. Or, if parents want to permit somewhat greater
access, they might set the browser to consult the sources' own labels.

     IEEE-USA has pledged the efforts of U.S. engineers to assist in realizing
the full promise of the new technologies. In creating a cyberspace environment
appropriate for children, "technology alone is not a substitute for
conscientious parenting, adult supervision, and common sense," said Snyder.
However, he adds, "U.S. engineers can be part of the solution by educating the
public on the effective use of Internet resources, by helping to develop the
next generation of electronic filtering technologies, and by using their
technical know-how to enable their families and community schools to explore
cyberspace wisely."

NLIGHTN OFFERS WEB ACCESS TO PIERIAN PRESS DATABASES

     NlightN, an Internet-based information service, has announced plans to
offer a Core Reference Services package of four databases from Pierian Press,
a leading publisher of reference resources.

     The four databases--A Matter of Fact, Directory of National Helplines,
Media Review Digest, and Consumers Index--will be offered to libraries and
other institutional subscribers for an annual fee of $595. The price, which is
competitive with the cost of an annual subscription to the print volumes,
includes a large back-file of reference listings from previous years. In
addition, the package has been designed to allow up to four simultaneous users
at each subscriber site.

     "Packaging these four databases and offering them online represent a
fundamental shift in the way reference databases are delivered to
institutional subscribers," said Brower Murphy, CEO of NlightN. "Internet
access is a natural way to expand the resources available to smaller
libraries."

     "NlightN has made it possible for us to deliver first-rate reference
materials at a reasonable cost," said C. Edward Wall, founder and president of
Pierian Press. "This will benefit smaller public, school, and special
libraries that can now offer some 'core' resources they couldn't afford
otherwise."

     The A Matter of Fact database contains approximately 75,000 full-text
statistical excerpts on current social, economic, political, health and
environmental issues with more than 12,000 new abstracts added annually.
Approximately 40 percent of the full-text excerpts come from congressional
hearings and the "Congressional Record," reflecting public policy formation at
the highest levels. In addition, more than 1,000 serial sources are monitored
to identify the statistical excerpts included in this knowledge base. "Library
Journal" recently cited A Matter of Fact as an "absolutely essential reference
resource for the digital age."

     The Directory of National Helplines is a specialized directory of social,
economic, health, and environmental helplines for people in need of support
and advice. The helplines are sponsored by national organizations and agencies
that provide services to runaway children, work to prevent domestic violence,
offer AIDS counseling and research updates, dispatch emergency response teams
to handle toxic spills and other environmental disasters, provide enabling
technologies to persons with physical disabilities, and more.

     The directory also includes numerous TravelLines, providing toll-free
numbers to travel services and agencies that send free information or provide
free services for their respective areas of responsibility. The directory
contains approximately 1,000 resources, about 60 percent of which are national
service/support lines.

     Media Review Digest is a core media reference tool and standard catalog
of media information, offering a comprehensive guide to reviewed and evaluated
nonprint media. The version of the database offered online provides coverage
from 1989 to the present, including approximately 50,000 media resources and
more than 100,000 reviews, evaluations, awards, and prizes from over 150
reviewing sources and organizations that present awards. The media forms
covered in the digest include educational and feature files; videocassettes;
videodiscs; filmstrips; educational and spoken-word records, tapes, and
compact discs; CD-ROMs and other optical media; and slides, transparencies,
kits, maps, anatomical models, games, and other miscellaneous media items.

     Consumers Index provides access to more than 90,000 evaluations, tests,
alerts, warnings, and recalls of specific products, services and facilities
covered in about 120 periodicals and/or related services of federal agencies
(e.g., news releases from related agencies). Also included are citations with
abstracts for more than 70,000 articles on all aspects of consumerism and
consumer protection. Products and services of primary interest to consumers
are covered, including automobiles, motorcycles, boats, kitchen appliances,
audio and photographic equipment, food and beverages, health and nutrition
products, travel and vacation destinations. In addition, sources of potential
risk to consumers are monitored by the database, such as "incidents" at
nuclear power plants in the U.S.

     NlightN, a division of The Library Corporation, was formed in 1994 to
develop and market an online research service. Incorporated in 1975, The
Library Corporation is one of the largest library automation vendors in the
U.S., supplying more than 12,000 libraries.

     Pierian Press has been serving school, academic, public and special
libraries, and library patrons since 1968. Pierian Press publishes databases,
reference tools, and journals, including "Library HiTech" and "Reference
Services Review."

CANADIAN CENTRE FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ENHANCES CHEMINFO
DATABASE

     The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) has
undertaken significant upgrading to the CHEMINFO database. Enhancements
include database design changes and important new content. CHEMINFO has a
broad audience including chemical manufacturers and suppliers, health and
safety professionals, and employees who handle chemicals in their jobs.
Produced by CCOHS's occupational health and safety specialists, the CHEMINFO
database contains practical, summarized occupational health and safety
information on more than 1,000 chemicals.

     CHEMINFO's chemical profiles describe potential workplace hazards and
control measures as well as detailed evaluations of health, fire, and
reactivity hazards. CHEMINFO also contains chemical-specific recommendations
on topics such as storage and handling, personal protective equipment,
accidental release, first aid, and international hazard classifications.

     All CHEMINFO records now include The European Union EINECS/ELINCS Number,
Hazard Classification, Risk Phrases and Safety Phrases; U.S. Department of
Transportation Infor-mation; and American Industrial Hygiene Association
(AIHA) Workplace Environmental Exposure Limits (WEELs) and Emergency Response
Planning Guides (ERPGs).

     In addition, developmental CHEMINFO records, which currently contain
physical property information, TLVs, PELs, and flammability information, now
include IARC, NTP, and  ACGIH carcinogenicity evaluations, NIOSH respiratory
protection guidelines, resistance of materials for protective clothing,
sampling and analysis information, and stability and reactivity information.

     Design changes to the CHEMINFO database include new print formats that
allow users to print all regulatory data and occupational exposure limits
information in one concise print format.

     The CHEMINFO database is updated quarterly on both the MSDS (A1) and
CHEMSource (A2) CD-ROMs and is available for as little as $250 Canadian/U.S.
per year.

     For more information, contact CCOHS, 800/668-4284 or 905/570-8094; Fax:

EASTMAN KODAK DONATES $1 MILLION TO NATIONAL DIGITAL LIBRARY PROGRAM

     During a recent news conference at the 1995 Federal Imaging Conference in
Washington, Eastman Kodak Co. CEO George Fisher presented a letter committing
to the first installment of a $1 million gift to the Library of Congress'
National Digital Library (NDL) Program. The NDL Program aims, in collaboration
with other institutions, to digitize 5 million items by the year 2000 and make
them freely available over the Internet.

     "The Library is grateful to George Fisher and Eastman Kodak for their
support of the National Digital Library Program," said the Librarian of
Congress, James H. Billington. "Kodak, a leader in electronic imaging
technology, today demonstrates its commitment to the program through its
generous gift."

     During the news conference, Bob Zich, the Library's director of
electronic programs, narrated a demonstration of the NDL Program. The Library
participated in the Federal Imaging Conference as an exhibitor, and a Library
employee served as the conference's chairman. The Library's World Wide Web
site can be accessed at http://www.loc.gov.

     Private sector contributions to the NDL Program, including Kodak's, now
exceed $19 million. The program, which began in October 1994, has a goal of
$45 million in private contributions by the year 2000. The Library has
requested an additional $15 million in appropriated funds to reach its overall
goal of $60 million for the NDL Program by 2000, the 200th anniversary of the
Library of Congress.

     For more information, contact the Library of Congress, 202/707-2905.

QUESTEL OFFERS "INSIDE THE PTO ALERTS"

     Questel Publishing, a division of Questel--Orbit, Inc., has announced the
availability of a new electronic e-mail service. "Inside the PTO Alerts," a
derivative of the monthly newsletter "Inside the PTO," reports on
late-breaking intellectual property news and events taking place at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the Court of Appeals for the Federal
circuit, in Congress and at other venues.

     "With the dramatic growth of intellectual property in just the past
decade, the passage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and
the proposed privatization of the PTO, there is a pressing need for IP
professionals to keep abreast of the increasing number of complex changes
occurring in patents, trademarks, and copyrights," said John A. Jenkins,
president of Questel--Orbit, Inc. and editor-in-chief of Questel Publishing.
"But attorneys and law librarians are very busy, so it is our staff's
responsibility to sift through all the news and deliver only the most
important to the desktops of these professionals."

     Recent "Alerts" informed subscribers of the U.S. and European Union's
failure to reach agreement on an important international trademark treaty;
congressional talks on copyrighting works sent over the information
superhighway; and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear a case concerning
the competency of lay juries in understanding technical patent suits.

     Other "Alerts" have covered changes in rules and regulations, policies
and procedures, and personnel at the PTO, which is under increasing pressure
from Congress to spin off from the Commerce Department and become a government
corporation. At present, "IPTO Alerts" is free to subscribers of "Inside the
PTO" and to others who request it.

     For more information or to subscribe to the "IPTO Alerts" service,
contact Questel Publishing, McClean, VA, 800/326-1710; e-mail:
IPTO@questel.orbit.com.

MADOFF TO BUILD TICKER PLANT
WITH FD'S TiPS SOFTWARE

  Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc. plans to install
its own ticker plant using FD Consulting Inc.'s TiPS ticker plant
system. A long-time Telekurs (formerly Standard & Poor's) Ticker
III user, Madoff is expected to discontinue its use of the
consolidated feed product.

  Peter Madoff, head of trading and architect of the firm's
trading systems, declined to comment on the move. But sources
close to the firm say Madoff's decision to build its own ticker
plant is part of the firm's continuing effort to gain more
control over all elements of its trading operation.

  The new ticker plant will consolidate direct feeds from CQS
(Consolidated Quotation Service), CTA (Consolidated Tape
Association), OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority) and NASDAQ
(Level 1). Until now, Madoff, an electronic market maker, has
been operating without these direct feeds.

  Not everyone thinks building an in-house ticker plant makes
sense -- especially when there are consolidated data feeds
available from Telekurs, Reuters and others. But not everyone
uses a price box to price nearly 10,000 automated executions per
day. At Madoff, more than at other firms, the bottom line depends
on the accuracy and timeliness of the market data source used to
price trades.

  As a registered specialist on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange and
electronic market maker in over 300 listed securities, Madoff
executes 95% of its trades without human intervention. Madoff
guarantees its clients execution at the best consolidated inside
quote for quantities up to 3000 shares. If Madoff's execution
price doesn't match the best bid or offer as it appears in the
NYSE's time and sales log, for example, Madoff is obliged to make
up the difference.

  Madoff won't disclose the data source it uses to price its
transactions. The firm is known to purchase data services from
Telekurs, Bridge, Instinet, Quotron and others.

                         Once Burned...

  During an average trading day, a time lag between a
consolidated data feed product such as Telekurs Ticker III and
direct lines from SIAC, OPRA or NASDAQ might result in a
discrepancy of a fraction of a point.

  But during peak periods of volatility, such as last October's
Black Friday, the same time lag might result in a discrepancy of
several points -- especially for trades in United Airlines stock,
for example.

  If Madoff had priced its Black Friday transactions with a data
feed that lagged the best bids and offers as they appeared on CQS
(the Consolidated Quotation System), make-goods on those trades
would be costly. Costly enough to easily justify the price tag of
an internal ticker plant.

  Electronic market makers obliged to execute at the best
consolidated inside quote can't afford to be out of sync with
SIAC's CQS feed at any time. For Madoff to operate with anything
less than direct CQS, CTA, OPRA and NASDAQ feeds leaves the firm
vulnerable.

  Apart from the issue of time and price discrepancies created by
fast-moving markets, consolidated data feed hosts can experience
downtime while markets continue to trade.

                        Speeds and Feeds

  Telekurs' Ticker III has been delivered at two different output
speeds, 9.6 and 19.2 kilobits per second, since Sept. 89, two
months after the product was acquired from Standard & Poor's.

  All new customers for Ticker III take the feed at 19.2 kbs and
Telekurs is offering the higher speed feed to its customers at no
additional charge.

  During the most recent October market break, Ticker III's 9.6
kbs feed suffered significant delays -- up to ten minutes behind
CQS, according to Telekurs officials.

  Recent tests conducted at a major brokerage suggest that
Telekurs' 19.2 kbs feed has substantially eliminated the capacity
problems of the slower speed feed.

MICROSTAT TO LAUNCH STOCK
QUOTE SYSTEM BASED ON NeXT

  Executives from Microstat Development Corp., a small quote
systems developer in Vancouver, are making a long pilgrimage
eastward this week to unveil a stock quote system and broker
workstation to the New York financial community. Called Omen III,
the system is the first such application designed for the NeXT
Inc. microcomputer, the sleek black multimedia box that Steven
Jobs' new company has begun to ship.

  Omen III is the third broker workstation Microstat has
introduced since it was founded in 1983. The product's
predecessors, now defunct Omen I and three-year-old Omen II, were
developed as simple stock quote systems for brokers who wanted
information from the Vancouver and Toronto stock exchanges. A PC-
based product with simple charting capabilities, Omen II still
has 200 users in Vancouver. Says Microstat CEO Fred Daniels of
the earlier product: "It's a hybrid of a dumb and intelligent
terminal."

                            Not Dumb

  With the NeXT platform serving as a base, the new Omen should
be anything but dumb. Intending to create a "financial
information gateway," the company began designing Omen III two
years ago, says Microstat chairman Wayne Crookes. Development on
NeXT began last May.

  But the NeXT platform differentiates Omen III from other broker
systems only in limited ways. Three Omen III features incorporate
NeXT's voice and image processing capabilities: instead of beeps,
limit alarms are voice-based; a client's voice can be recorded
and stored in the system; and a picture of the client's face can
be scanned in or stored on video.

  Other Omen III features include: simple and expanded quotes;
order entry and order history; creation of forms; security access
and password lock; electronic mail, including electronic
communication of voice, graphics and text; real-time and
historical charting with dynamic updating; commission calculator;
dynamically updated indices; automatic phone dial and audible or
visible reminder services; currency conversion; client user lists
updated with real-time information; dynamically updated lists of
securities ranked as they become more or less active; report
generation; and the Sybase relational database, which is offered
free to NeXT buyers.

  Omen III has two other real-time charting features: an intra-
day bar chart with three-minute tick intervals and a 60-second
tick chart. The company has also developed "peak and dip" limit
alarms, which alert the user to a stock that begins to go down
after steadily moving upwards, or vice versa. Unlike simple price
alerts, Omen III's limits are triggered by the price's rate of
change versus current value.

                       Development on NeXT

  "We are not porting to Next but building an interface from
scratch," says Soheil Zargarpour, Microstat's chief engineer and
research and development manager. He says the company chose to
develop the system on the NeXT platform because it was looking
for object-oriented programming capabilities, a relational
database manager, preferably Sybase, a multi-window environment
and powerful graphics. NeXT machines provide all these features.

  The system Microstat plans to begin selling this spring is
designed to handle feeds from a variety of vendors and exchanges
and is currently negotiating contracts. It has already contracted
to provide PC Quote Inc.'s data feed, which carries data from all
North American exchanges and is broadcast via satellite at 19.2
kilobits per second.

  Feeds will be transmitted via satellite, telephone lines or
cable television to a ticker plant designed by Microstat. A
fault-tolerant version of the ticker plant runs on two 386
microprocessors and two high-end NeXT computers with a 660
megabyte hard disk drive and 16 megabytes of RAM. Microstat will
operate its own ticker plant for Vancouver-area customers. The
ticker plant will also be available for purchase.

                   Between RAM and a Hard Disk

  The ticker plant converts exchange feeds into an Omen III feed
and broadcasts it to a NeXT server at the user site. The server
will be connected via ethernet LAN to "diskless" NeXT
workstations with 48-megabyte swap drives, Zargarpour says. Swap
drives allow memory to be shuffled between the RAM and the hard
drive.

  As a NeXT-based product, the system runs under UNIX and is
configured in the Objective-C language, which Zargarpour says
allows easier maintenance and upgrading of the code.

                           What NeXT?

  Microstat is seeking five beta test sites for the new product.
However, while the first commercial version of Omen III will be
available only on NeXT, Microstat intends to port the product to
other systems, which it will not name. The system will support
multiple news services, but has yet to determine which will be
offered initially.

  The company refuses to discuss the price of a fully configured
Omen III system, but it could get costly. At a recent talk in New
York, Stephen Jobs said Next computers were selling at around
$10,000 apiece, although those without optical disk drives can go
for about $2,000 less.

  Nor has Microstat come to any firm decision about how to market
its product, although the company hints that it is negotiating
with Businessland, which has the distribution rights to NeXT.
Businessland is helping organize Microstat's presentation of Omen
III to New York brokers this week.

MCGRAW-HILL ACQUIRES
MUNI GIANT J.J. KENNY

  McGraw-Hill Inc. has announced its intention to buy all the
outstanding shares of J.J. Kenny Co., a recognized leader in
municipal bond brokerage and information services. The move puts
Kenny under the same umbrella as Standard & Poor's Corp., which
markets the Blue List Bond Ticker, a product that competes with
Kenny's information services.

  The purchase includes both of Kenny's principal businesses,
Kenny Information Systems Inc. and J.J. Kenny Drake Inc., Kenny's
brokerage firm. Both operations will be added to McGraw-Hill's
Financial Services Group, which includes S&P's Ratings Group, S&P
McGraw-Hill, DRI McGraw-Hill, The Tower Group and McGraw-Hill
Securities Trading Inc. J. Kevin Kenny, the company chairman and
chief executive officer, will report to Harold McGraw III,
executive vice president at McGraw-Hill.

  "Kevin Kenny is going to stay on [after the purchase]," says
Michael Beauchamp, executive vice president at Kenny. "Pretty
much business will be as usual....we don't anticipate any major
changes."

  Kenny Drake claims to be the U.S.'s largest interdealer broker
of municipal bonds, based on number of transactions and total
dollar volume. Kennybase, Kenny Information System's flagship
product, purportedly is used to clear 90% of all municipal bond
transactions among registered dealers and dealer banks.

  Kenny Drake's broker screen system is used by dealers as a
trading tool. A Kenny Drake screen, which can be leased from
Kenny for $1,500 per month, displays live bids and offers from
the municipal dealer market.

                         Odd Bedfellows

  But the buyout will make for odd bedfellows. Also under McGraw-
Hill's wing is S&P and its Blue List products which compete with
Kennybase and Kenny Drake in the municipal bond information
business. The Blue List Bond Ticker can be accessed through
Telerate Inc. terminals; it is also available through Bloomberg
Financial Networks.

  Kenny says it isn't worried about the similarity of its
businesses with S&P's. "We don't see any overlap," says
Beauchamp. "[S&P] doesn't have a municipal data base -- that's
one of our core businesses -- and they don't have a brokerage
unit, and that's our other core business." A spokesperson for
McGraw-Hill declined to comment.

  "The Blue List, either on the ticker or through the
publication, tends to be more a library of offerings," says Cathy
Callender, vice president at Kenny. "We tend to have hotter, more
timely offerings."

                       Development Goes On

  The acquisition will not affect the ongoing efforts to enhance
the Kennybase bond information service, according to Beauchamp.
In late 1990 Kenny is scheduled to release Kennybase II, an
upgrade to this PC-based service that expands the number of
descriptive data items for each bond from nine to 100. About
1,100 clients use Kennybase.

  Kennybase describes approximately 1.5 million municipal issues,
and is updated as many as 14,000 times a day. Among the new
descriptive items to be included for each issue in Kennybase II
(where applicable) are insurance descriptions, adjustable rate
information, clearing eligibility, zero type, underwriter
information, when-issued information, refunded bond descriptions,
escrow and redemption descriptions.

  The Kennybase system costs $175 per month, plus 25 cents per
inquiry. The system runs in the DOS environment, as will
Kennybase II. Access to the Kennybase database is via dial-up
phone line.

LOTUS-INFOTECH DEAL FOR SIGNAL
AND QUOTREK FINALLY HAPPENS

  After months of haggling and paper shuffling, Financial News
Network, Inc. has bought Lotus Information Network Corp. (LINC)
from Lotus Development Corp. As expected, FNN will merge LINC and
its market data services with its smaller Data Broadcasting Corp.
business (Micro Ticker Report, Sept. 5, 1989). FNN is 45-percent
owned by New York-based Infotechnology Corp., which also owns
United Press International and other electronic information
ventures.

  The sale ends Lotus Development's five-year-old safari into the
market data business and consolidates three leading quote
services aimed at the individual investor -- LINC's Signal and
Quotrek and Data Broadcasting Corp.'s Marketwatch. Although the
purchase price wasn't announced, Lotus is thought to have sold
LINC for between $10-$12 million, or almost twice the $6.25
million it paid for the old Dataspeed business in 1985 (MTR,
October 1985).

  The combination of Signal, Marketwatch and Quotrek will serve a
real-time subscriber base of more than 10,000, about evenly split
between the two PC-based services and the portable Quotrek. These
subscribers account for more than half of all non-professional
real-time users of U.S. stock market data. (Marketwatch also
offers a 15-minute delayed service and Signal offers end-of-day
pricing.)

  FNN/Infotech's plan is to split the existing Data Broadcasting
Corp. into three pieces, the Marketwatch product, a network
services company and a technology company. Scott Dinsdale, who
was named president of DBC after former president Joseph Taussig
was elevated to Infotech, will remain in charge of DBC's network
and technology operations. Current LINC management, headed by
Douglas Smith, will run the market data services.

  The combination looks positive for both firms. Instead of being
an also-ran, FNN/Infotech overnight becomes the market share
leader in the low-end real-time business. It also acquires its
own ticker plant, a solid marketing organization and
relationships with dozens of third-party software suppliers. At
the same time, the LINC business will now be owned by a parent
that really wants to own it and will have access both to
additional Infotech content -- like UPI and Comtex -- and to
higher-bandwidth technology that will allow it to expand.

STANDARD & POOR'S CORP. ANNOUNCES
NEWS SERVICE AND CLIENT

  After months of hedging, Standard & Poor's Corp. has announced
the launch of a news service designed to compete with Dow Jones
News Service, (IMD, Nov. 27, 1989). St. Louis-based brokerage
Edward D. Jones is the first announced subscriber to the S&P
service.

  Called S&P News, the service delivers business and financial
news to the brokerage community, a market that "has been relying
on a single source for news," says Jeffrey Bell, S&P group vice
president for retail investor services. He says 7,000 companies
report earnings and other news to the S&P news staff, who turn
the information into stories that can be "more quickly read than
[those of] existing services." Unlike the Dow Jones service, he
says, S&P News "is not designed to be printed in a newspaper the
next day, but for real-time delivery and retrieval."

  S&P is also competing with Dow Jones on price, charging up to
40% less, Bell says. He refuses to discuss details but says S&P
"prices on a per terminal and quantity basis." Says Bell: "We
think it's necessary to provide a lower price alternative as an
important way for us to enter the business."

                      Discount the Increase

  Before volume discounts, Dow Jones charges $499 per month for
the first office, as well as monthly per-terminal fees of $21.50
for news retrieval and $13.50 for scrolling news. Some of Dow
Jones' recent price changes actually represent an increase. News
retrieval charges have been raised by one dollar per terminal per
month, and the scrolling news charge has gone up fifty cents --
according to sources at major firms.

  Those sources also say Dow Jones is offering a discount price
plan -- the "90/20 plan" -- that offers incentives to take Dow
Jones news in 100% of a firm's offices. Tim Turner, vice
president for marketing and sales for Dow Jones' information
services group, refuses to disclose details but confirms that the
company is offering "volume discounts based on size of firm,
number of terminals and length of contract." However, he says
discounts apply even if less than 100% of the customer's offices
take Dow Jones, although in that case the customer would get a
deeper discount.

  Turner denies that the new discount policy has anything to do
with S&P's bargain rates, noting that Dow Jones has long competed
with Reuters and Knight-Ridder. Instead, he claims the discounts
stem from "concerns on the Street for all costs" and says the new
pricing policy accommodates the uncertainty about staff size
currently plaguing the brokerage community.

                      He's Glad He Switched

  Cost is a key reason Edward D. Jones chose to buy S&P's news
service rather than the Broadtape, says Rich Malone, a partner in
charge of the brokerage's data processing operation. Without
disclosing numbers, he says it was cheaper for the firm, which
has a single broker in each of its 1,500 branch offices, to have
S&P's news service delivered directly to the brokerage's central
system, which then transmits the information, along with
Telekurs' Ticker III feed, to branches.

  Although its research and marketing departments use the Dow
Jones service, Malone says it would have been more expensive for
the firm to offer that service to its brokers, because the vendor
would have charged each branch office for the service. The branch
offices were already getting Marketscope, the S&P real-time
electronic stock news reporting service, but no full news
service.

  By redistributing the S&P service itself, Jones bypasses
intermediate vendors. Both Automatic Data Processing Inc. and
Beta Systems, which caters to regional brokerages, carry the
service. S&P is negotiating with other vendors, including Quotron
Systems Inc. and ILX Systems Inc., says S&P's Bell.

  Bell also says that while S&P headquarters houses 25 reporters
dedicated to its news product, the service can actually draw on
the resources of 800 editorial staff worldwide, most of whom
report for specific McGraw-Hill publications. S&P News is most
likely to draw on the information gathered by the 100 or so
reporters who are part of McGraw-Hill News, particularly those in
its Washington, D.C. bureau, Bell says. Each news service has
access to the other's stories and can choose to run them if they
are appropriate to its audience, Bell says. McGraw-Hill News is
geared to corporations rather than brokerages.

REUTERS TO LAUNCH MONEY 2000
BY END OF FIRST QUARTER

  Reuters Holdings PLC will launch its digitally delivered Money
2000 service worldwide at the end of the first quarter. The
release is part of the company's efforts to migrate data
delivered over its aging Monitor network to its new Integrated
Data Network (IDN).

  Money 2000 is a foreign exchange and money markets service that
will eventually carry all data currently held in the Monitor
International Money Rates (IMR) database, as well as Reuters
news. Money 2000 upgrades, and eventually will replace, the
Reuter Monitor Money Rates service and the Reuter Monitor Money
News service.

  Money 2000 will be delivered to standalone IDN terminals at 9.6
kilobits/second. It will be delivered to clients' internal
distribution systems initially at 9.6 kilobits/second over
Reuters' IDN-based RQF data feed, which is slated for release
early this quarter (story below). Sarah Dunn, product manager for
Money 2000, says the service will be available over the 56
kilobits/second Marketfeed 2000, which is also based on IDN,
"slightly later."

                    Enhancements After Launch

  In its first phase, Money 2000 will deliver a subset of the IMR
database in logical form. This will comprise spot, forwards,
deposits and cross rates for all major currencies. Reuters
intends to add money market instruments to the service in a
series of "post-launch enhancements."

  Until these enhancements are made, data not delivered in
logical form will be accessed in page format. Data, both record-
and page-based, will be accessed in up to three "zones" on the
same screen. This capability will be available immediately to
users of dedicated terminals. Users receiving the service via
RQF, meanwhile, will have to wait until that feed has the
capability of delivering page-based data alongside logical data.

  The record-page mix will be made possible by the use of
preformatted displays or "tiles" on the user's screen. A user
will be able to place one tile, fed by the logical feed, in each
zone on his screen. A tile is eight to ten lines high and 80
characters wide, Dunn says. The user can also place up to a page
of page-formatted data in a zone, depending on the size of the
zone. Dunn says zone size depends on user preference. In
addition, zones can be configured to hold users' own lists of
instruments for limit-minding.

                         His Latest Rate

  Money 2000's logical, record-based format, Dunn says, will give
the user more flexibility over the old Monitor-delivered foreign
exchange and money markets services, which use a page-based
format. "For example, rather than a client having to retrieve the
Monitor page and know that page code in advance in order to look
at a particular price," she says, "he could put in a code for
Deutschemark (DEM=) to retrieve the latest spot rate." Money 2000
will use Reuter Identification Codes, based on the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications' code, to access
rates. Money 2000 subscribers would also be able to feed logical
data into local applications such as Microsoft Inc.'s Excel real-
time spreadsheet.

  In addition to the foreign exchange and money markets data
already available via Monitor, Money 2000 will offer some futures
and options data from Reuters' Futures 2000 service. Money 2000
will also feature precious metals and sovereign debt overviews.

  Money 2000 continues Reuters' transition from Monitor to IDN.
Previously, the two networks have been discrete in terms of
content, with IDN carrying equities and exchange-traded data and
Monitor concentrating on the over-the-counter markets.

  Reuters has high hopes for the service. Speaking last month at
Mediaweek '89, a yearly analysts meeting sponsored by
PaineWebber Inc., Michael Reilly, Reuters' vice president,
investor relations, said the company has more than 100,000
terminals serving the money markets. "All of those are eligible
to be changed over to Money 2000," he said.

REUTERS' RQF, RMF WILL HAVE
THREE-TIERED PRICING STRUCTURE

  Reuters Holdings PLC's RQF and RMF digital feeds, scheduled for
North American release early this year, will have the same three-
tiered pricing structure as Reuters' other international data
feed products.

  Reuters has scheduled North American release of RQF, the Reuter
Quotation Feed, for very early this quarter. RQF is a record-
based digital feed that provides a window into Reuters'
Integrated Data Network-based Marketfeed 2000. Meanwhile, rollout
of RMF, the Reuter Monitor Feed, will depend on individual
managers of Reuters' regional operations. RMF, also based on IDN,
provides a similar window into page-oriented data that's also
carried on the Reuter Monitor network.

  Glenn Wasserman, Reuters' international data feed products
manager, says the pricing structure for RQF and RMF will be
applicable worldwide. He says the structure breaks down into
three components.

                    Multi-Level Configuration

  The first component -- functionality -- depends on the
bandwidth the user takes. For example, a feed with entry-level
configuration, Wasserman says, would provide simultaneous access
to a certain number of instruments in real time. A higher-level
configuration would give access to more instruments
simultaneously, requiring a wider bandwidth, and thus would cost
more. RQF can provide as many as 1,800 simultaneous updates to
prices of up to 133,000 instruments. The feed's top speed is 9.6
kilobits/second. RMF is also available at 4.8 kilobits/second.

  The second component is a service charge, which varies
according to the number of services a user is taking on his
chosen delivery feed. For example, the charge would be lower if a
user decides to take only Equities 2000 through RQF, rather than
taking additional IDN-based services such as the pending Money
2000 (story, above).

  Reuters will also charge a population fee, essentially a
workstation fee, for the two feeds. The fee will depend on the
number of workstations accessing the feed. Wasserman says clients
are contractually obliged to report usage. Reuters will further
charge clients if they redistribute RQF or RMF data to other
locations.

                         Monitor to IDN

  The launch of RQF and RMF is part of Reuters' effort to
rationalize its data feed product line as it attempts to
integrate its IDN and Monitor networks. The end result will be
the dismantling of the Monitor network and the use of IDN as
Reuters' only network -- a move popular with investment analysts
tracking Reuters' fixed cost structure.

  RQF is aimed at customers that don't require the breadth of
coverage provided by Market-feed 2000. Also, RQF would be
attractive to users without the resources to develop an internal
delivery system capable of handling such volume of data.

  The feed initially will be record-based only, Wasserman says.
But, as Reuters switches delivery of Monitor data to IDN, the
company will make contributed data in page format available via
RQF. "The RQF will be the first device on the IDN network that
will be able to supply both the IDN record-oriented exchange data
and what we have in the past delivered via Monitor -- the
contributed data," Wasserman says.

  Eventually, Reuters will use RQF as its standard platform for
delivery of both record- and page-oriented data, although
Wasserman says it will continue to support any installed
terminals receiving RMF or Monitor.

  RMF is essentially an upgrade of Reuters' RDCDF feed that will
allow the company to standardize its terminals worldwide on a
386-based PC hardware platform. RMF offers similar functionality
to RDCDF, except that it allows users access to up to 100 pages
from the Monitor database concurrently, compared with 32 pages
via RDCDF (MTR, May 1989).

LME BUYS QUOTE FEED SERVICE
FROM REUTERS AFTER FEES BATTLE

  After a protracted battle in which other vendors collectively
accused Reuters Holdings PLC of anti-competitive practices, the
London Metal Exchange has opted to purchase the quote system
Reuters developed for the LME. The LME will sell the feed to
third-party vendors for redistribution. The deal insures that by
June 1990, the system will deliver all prices simultaneously to
all vendors, including Reuters.

  After winning the bid to design and develop the LME's quote
system, Reuters had proposed that all third party vendors wishing
to distribute the feed pay Reuters a flat fee (Micro Ticker
Report July 24, 1989). Because off-the-floor trading information
was to be collected using Reuters Monitor terminals, these prices
would have been available to Reuters customers sooner. Customers
of other vendors would have had to wait for the LME computers to
receive and reroute the Reuters-supplied information.

  Vendors quickly formed a coalition to oppose this arrangement,
and their voices apparently were heard. Under the purchase
agreement finally reached between Reuters and the LME, other
vendors will pay no fees to Reuters. The exchange fee schedule
will be finalized in the next three weeks, and Reuters will not
get a cut, says Gerard Buckley, the LME's market information
manager.

  Spokesman for the vendor group, David Taylor, could not be
reached for comment, but a source at one vendor says that "it's a
classic case of Reuters going in and grabbing a monopoly. They've
done it before and they'll no doubt do it again."

                         The Metal Feed

  The system compiles LME futures prices from interfirm telephone
trading and from two open-outcry sessions, called Ring and Kerb,
that occur in both the morning and afternoon. Open outcry prices
are collected by LME staff members on the floor, while telephone
trades are entered into Reuters Monitor terminals by eleven LME
member firms. The data is processed on two LME-owned Hewlett
Packard 9000 Series microcomputers, one of which runs in stand-by
mode.

  In the new system, the only way Reuters monitor customers can
get telephone market prices is from the LME feed. The Reuters
Monitor terminals used to collect upstairs trade data have been
modified so that the prices are transferred directly to the LME's
processor rather than to other Reuters Monitor terminals on the
Reuters network. The LME says all vendors, including Reuters,
will receive the feed at exactly the same time. The Reuter
Monitor terminals used for price input have also been modified to
reduce data entry errors.

  Options prices on the LME's metal contracts will eventually be
included in the feed, Buckley says. Options are only traded by
telephone.

                          More Sources

  The LME is the largest metals exchange in the world, trading
copper, zinc, lead, aluminum, nickel and tin. Founded in 1877, it
has never had a quote system of its own. Interested parties had
to subscribe to vendors, like Reuters and Knight-Ridder Unicom
Ltd., that collected the data from the floor, or from market-
makers, such as Rudolf Wolff & Co. At the LME, trading is
performed both on the floor (open outcry) and off.

  "Most people, especially in the States, who think they're
getting an LME feed are actually just getting a feed from one of
our member firms," says Buckley. "What we're offering is
information from a combination of at least 11 of our member
firms, plus the actual LME staff on the floor of the exchange."

  The system was designed by Reuters and Investment Intelligence
Systems Corporation Ltd., a London-based software firm.

IF CONTENT IS KING, DISNEY IS PERCHED ON TOP

     It's a little early to gauge the specific impact The Walt Disney
Co.'s acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. will have on interactive
media.  Disney formed a multimedia unit eight months ago, but its
fledgling stab at the CD-ROM market so far has had mixed results. 
Although Disney recently joined forces with three Baby Bells to
produce video programming carried via telephone lines, for the most
part it has focused squarely on content and shunned direct investments
in the information superhighway.  But if content is king, you have to
like Disney's new position.

STATIC HANGS OVER DEVELOPING ITV INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT '95

Although no one could claim 1995 was the best of times for
interactive television, the worst fears of industry skeptics
were not realized either.

As the ambitious plans of both cable companies and telcos to
deliver near-term digital deployment fell by the wayside, a new
sense of purpose began to emerge based more on economics and
true customer demand than pipe dreams.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) didn't help matters
much; it clouded the waters with a patchwork of regulations for
telephone companies seeking to package and deliver video
programming that continued to unravel throughout the year.  The
case for the telcos, which saw numerous federal court cases turn
in their favor, finally made its way to the Supreme Court
earlier this month.

Many telcos also appeared to give up altogether on the video
dialtone (VDT) route, first pulling their Section 214
applications with the FCC and then eyeing other means of
delivery such as via a traditional cable TV franchise or
wireless cable.

The fuzzy interactive and programming picture did not stop
companies from embracing big-money programming/technology
partnerships.  The year saw the rise of two notable telco
consortiums - TELE-TV, a venture among Bell Atlantic, Nynex and
Pacific Telesis; and Americast - the brainchild of Ameritech,
BellSouth, GTE, SBC Communications and the Walt Disney Co.  The
year also saw Disney's bid to swallow Capital Cities/ABC,
Westinghouse's purchase of CBS Inc., and Time Warner's plans to
buy Turner Broadcasting Systems.

Which is not to say the year was without its feuds.  As the year
grinds to an end, U S West and Time Warner continue to trade
barbs in court over Time Warner's proposed Turner acquisition
and new blueprint for a company reorganization.

Following are the year's top ITV highlights as reported in
Interactive TV Strategies and its predecessor, Entertainment
Technology:

January 1995:

*     Nearly all of the telcos, except for SBC Communications
and SNET, win the right to own the programming on their VDT
networks in a case in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

*     Rochester Tel wraps up its 52-customer VDT with a whimper,
and a question mark as to whether it will seek to deploy
commercial programming services.  The telco was to remain quiet
on video plans for the rest of the year.

*     The FCC gives Bell Atlantic the green light to provide
some programming for its VDT trial in Fairfax, Va.

*     BellSouth nixes its plans to have an anchor programmer as
part of the VDT  service it plans to offer next year in Atlanta
in order to win speedier FCC approval.  The anchor programmer
issue is to plague telcos throughout the year.

*     The FCC approves Puerto Rico Telephone's plans to conduct
a VDT trial comprising services delivered via ADSL and fiber-to-
the-curb technology.

*     The commission also OKs five of Ameritech's Section 214
applications to build VDT networks in the metropolitan areas of
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.  As the year
progresses, the telco all but abandons near-term VDT plans in
favor of providing programming as a traditional cable franchise.

*     Sprint's local phone division, Carolina Telephone in North
Carolina, makes plans for a VDT trial in Wake Forest.

February 1995:

*     GTE and AT&T can their plans to conduct a VDT trial over a
hybrid fiber/coax network in Manassas, Va., signaling AT&T's
move away from participating in trials using technology "that
may not be in use a year from today."

*     Zing Systems receives a patent for its interactive
programming delivery system and an endorsement from Hewlett-
Packard, which will include the technology in its KAYAK set-top
boxes.

*     Cory Mitchell joins SNET to head up the telco's multimedia
services decision.  Mitchell is to resign before the year's end.

March 1995:

*     More than 100 major media companies, from film studios to
special-interest programmers, sign up to provide content on Bell
Atlantic's Stargazer VDT trial/system in northern Virginia.

*     Sprint announces plans to test interactive marketing via
the San Jose, Calif.-based Interactive Network, in which the
company invested $5 million.  The initiative was to be hamstrung
at the gate due to Interactive Network's failure to stay
financially afloat.

*     Legislation is introduced in Congress that would allow
cable TV converters, and the digital converters of interactive
television, to be sold by manufacturers and retailers rather
than the cable operators leasing them to customers.

*     Howard Stringer exits his post as president of the CBS
Broadcast Group to head up the Bell Atlantic-Nynex-Pacific
Telesis media and technology venture, eventually to be named
TELE-TV.

*     Bell Atlantic drops AT&T as the systems integrator for its
VDT platform, claiming it would rather learn and initiate the
integration functions itself.

April 1995:

*     In their first foray into wireless waters, Bell Atlantic
and Nynex agree to invest $100 million into Albany, N.Y.-based
CAI Wireless Systems Inc.

*     Cable billing and subscriber management company CableData
gets its first telco bid to provide support for BellSouth's
planned VDT trial in Atlanta in 1996.

*     IBM debuts its Digital Library to help companies digitize
their existing content as well as create new digital programming
for a variety of platforms.

*     After numerous delays, Scientific-Atlanta ships the first
300 headend systems for the delivery of the Sega Channel.

*     SBC Communications becomes the last of the regional Bell
companies to win a federal court ruling allowing it to provide
video programming to its in-region customers.

May 1995:

*     Bell Atlantic pays BroadBand Technologies (BBT) $7 million
for the right to acquire a noncontrolling stake in the company.

*     Bell Atlantic asks the FCC to suspend consideration on its
two pending Section 214 applications so it can review the
technology.  Before month's end, the telco is to withdraw its
applications to build hybrid fiber-coax VDT networks altogether.
The telco says it will resubmit applications based on switched
digital video technology.

*     Prevue Interactive Services begins working with BBN Hark
to develop voice-recognition technology it will incorporate into
its advanced navigator Prevue Express.

*     Your Choice Television, the time-shifted TV brainchild of
Discovery founder John Hendricks, signs an agreement with TCI to
begin digital compression, signal delivery and national
satellite delivery of its service.

*     High-definition television (HDTV) continues to be a hot
industry topic as the government debates whether or not to
auction off spectrum and consumer electronics companies rethink
methods to get the technology out of the gate.

*     NBC announces plans to break its ties with America Online
and Prodigy to form a broad-reaching multimedia agreement with
Microsoft that will see the companies jointly developing
products to be distributed online and on CD-ROM, as well as via
interactive and broadcast television.

*     The FCC makes yet another effort to prop up its regulation
of telco-provided video with the requirement that telcos seek
waivers to run programming on their VDT networks.

*     The commission gives GTE the green light to build VDT
networks in Ventura County, Calif.; Pasco and Pinellas counties,
Fla.; Manassas, Va.; and Honolulu.

*     In yet another clone court case, the U.S. District Court
in Connecticut grants Southern New England Telephone (SNET) the
right to provide in-region TV programming.

June 1995:

*     U S West becomes the second telco to pull its Section 214
applications from the FCC.  The telco pulls its five pending
applications, citing uncertainty about the staying power of VDT
technology.

In a related interactive sign of the times, U S West abruptly
cans its in-room interactive hospitality service, CityKey,
leaving Bell Atlantic as the sole provider of in-hotel
electronic yellow pages with its InfoTravel service.

*     The financially beleaguered Interactive Network lays off
most of its staff and begins sharply cutting back on service.
The company says it only has enough money to continue operations
for two months.

*     The IT Network, parent of the Interactive Channel, merges
with HB Communications and changes its name to the Source
Exchange.  The company looks to expand distribution among cable
systems.

*     ACTV, the company behind Canadian cable operator Le Groupe
Videotron's commercial interactive TV service, brings its
technology to the States for the first time in collaboration
with Ventura County Cablevision in Southern California.

*     Howard Stringer announces Edward Grebow, a former
colleague at CBS, will take the reigns as president of TELE-TV.
Creative Artists Agency wunderkind Michael Ovitz signs on to
oversee affairs as well.

*     Cable operators TCI, Continental and Comcast agree to
carry Zing ITV signals and help fund the production of Zing

interactive call-in show, will be the first GSN game to be
featured on the NTN Entertainment Network.

November 1995:

*     In the "looks like a computer feels like a television"
department, an increasing number of online services are
beginning to create programming that is demographically targeted
like a cable channel.  Among the latest and greatest ideas are
"The Hub," a Generation X stop developed on America Online
developed by AOL and New Line Television, and NBC's new fashion
site.

*     Ameritech makes two more agreements for the provision of
franchise cable service, this time with the local authorities in
Fraser and Northville Township, Mich.  The telco also takes its
first steps toward cable delivery on Chicago's South Side.

*     Southern New England Telephone (SNET) sets the
requirements video information providers must meet to take part
in the one-year expansion of its West Hartford, Conn., VDT
trial, which still is awaiting approval from the FCC.

A few weeks after that announcement, Cory Mitchell resigned as
head of SNET's multimedia division and the telco folds it into
its publishing unit.

*     Cox Cable ditches its plans to deliver interactive
television in Omaha, Neb., which at one time looked like the
site for the most robust programming between a cable company and
telco.  U S West says it still is committed to eventually
rolling out interactive TeleChoice services.

*     A consortium of computer hardware and software companies,
and broadcast and cable television houses begin developing a

and QVC are among the founding members of the so-called
"Intercast Industry."

December 1995:

*     A consortium of consumer electronics heavy-hitters -

Japan.  The group, called Intertext, will incorporate technology
from Wink Communications directly into TV sets they manufacture.

*     SBC Communications revs up a 1,800-home trial in
Richardson, Texas, which will precede its 47,000-home build out
of a fiber/coax network over which the telco plans to deliver
telephony and programming services.

*     Time Warner adds customized, on-demand news and sports
programming to its Full Service Network and lays groundwork for
its first bank-at-home application and on-demand pizza delivery.
Customers, about 3,200 at this point, still are not paying a
monthly fee.

*     The issue that would not go away - whether or not telcos
have the right to own and package programming on their own
networks - finally gets its day in the Supreme Court.  A
decision from the is expected this summer.

*     Pacific Telesis sets up another strategic move into
wireless delivery.  The telco agrees to purchase 100 percent of
the stock of Wireless Holdings Inc. and Videotron Bay Area Inc.,
both joint ventures between Transworld Telecommunications and Le
Groupe Videotron Ltd.

*     U S West and Time Warner continue to trade barbs in court.
This time the telco amends its lawsuit asking the court to
prohibit Time Warner from going through with its proposed
reorganization of Time Warner Entertainment.

*     The FCC OKs the acquisition of CBS Inc. by Westinghouse
without setting specific conditions about the company's
commitment to children's television.

COURT REAFFIRMS 'MUST CARRY'; CONGRESS DEREGULATES CABLE ANYWAY

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
and the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., both have
separately said cable TV still dominates the multichannel
delivery of video.

Nonetheless, House and Senate conferees working on a compromise
version of telecom legislation loosened the bill's regulations
on cable TV even further than either the House or Senate telecom
bills originally did.  The conferees, though, are expected to
delay full deregulation of cable TV rates until three years
after enactment, backing away from the bills' original plan.

The legislation largely undoes the Cable Act of 1992, which
imposed rate regulation, and ends the cable-telco cross-
ownership ban, a key part of the Cable Act of 1984.

But another part of the Cable Act of 1984 sparked the FCC to
create its "must carry" rule requiring cable operators to carry
local broadcast channels.  The rule - an attempt to ensure the
newer medium would not eliminate broadcasting - was reaffirmed
earlier this month by the U.S. District Court for Washington,
D.C.

Cable operators, led by Turner Broadcasting, took their
challenge of the rule all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,
which last year remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for
a rehearing.  The High Court, in a 5-4 vote, said the lower
court had not received enough proof for the FCC's case that
broadcasters would be harmed.

Significantly, the four of the five justices in the majority
wanted the case not to be remanded but overturned outright as a
violation of cable operator's First Amendment Rights.  Now, the
High Court will get a second chance to do just that, since
there's no question whether Turner will appeal the 2-1 ruling of
the district court's three-judge panel.

Writing for the majority, District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin
said there was no other alternative available to the FCC than
must-carry.  Antitrust law, he said, is time consuming and
leased access is costly while "many of the stations invoking the
must-carry protections are economically vulnerable."  Nor would
an FCC complaint procedure fit the bill, he said, citing the
"enormous administrative burden" of such a process.

Sporkin dismissed the challenge of the rule as an uncompensated
taking by the government in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
But, when he considered whether the rule is a content-related
restriction requiring strict scrutiny for its First Amendment
impact, he admitted the rule comes "very close."

But, he added, "we do not believe that they [at the FCC] cross
the line."

The very day the district court released its opinion, the
conferees on Capitol Hill held their second meeting in as many
weeks and adopted a set of changes to the vastly different
telecom bills passed by the House and Senate this summer.
Regarding the bills' language on deregulating cable operators,
the conferees chose the House bill as their mode, but loosened
its provisions even more.

Conversely, they imposed tougher conditions on cable TV's future
competitors - the telephone companies.

The House telecom bill, H.R. 1555, keeps the FCC from
investigating a cable rate complaint until 3 percent of the
cable system's subscribers have complained - the FCC now swings
into action on one complaint - and it orders the FCC to resolve
rate complaints in 90 days and to set only minimal standards for
set-top converter boxes.  But the conferees changed H.R. 1555's
language to raise the definition of a "small city" - one where
the cable operator immediately escapes rate regulation - from
35,000 to 50,000.

That, said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W. Va., will only aggravate
President Clinton's concerns that the bill goes too far on cable
rate deregulation.  The president has threatened a veto, citing
that very concern.

Regarding telco-provided video, the conferees also hewed to the
House language, but again with big revisions.  Although H.R.
1555 would have let telcos operate "video platforms" such as
video dialtone (VDT) networks under reduced regulation, the
conferees instead required VDT-type networks to conform to a
modified version of the Title VI rules governing cable TV.  A
telco won't have to get local franchise agreements, but will
have to make at least two-thirds of its capacity available to
unaffiliated programmers.

That's the very sort of "must carry" rule cable operators
protest.  Telcos say it will rob them of much of the opportunity
to cash in on programming, the source of the real money in VDT.

While deregulating cable TV, the conferees also gave a big
benefit to cable's old nemesis, the broadcasters.  The latest
changes make broadcasters the only ones able to receive licenses
for the 6 Mhz of spectrum set aside by the FCC for "advanced
television (ATV)" -even though the spectrum also can be used for
paging or mobile data.  The spectrum is valued at $35 billion to
$100 billion but the conferees eliminated language from the bill
that would have the spectrum auctioned.

As for broadcasters' existing analog spectrum, which the FCC
would like to regain so that it can be auctioned, the conferees
eliminated any criteria from the bill for determining when the
spectrum must be returned.

The conferees are deregulating cable TV, in part, so that it may
acquire the capital needed to build networks to compete with
local phone companies.  The Cable Act of 1992 was said by the
industry to have hurt revenues, but the FCC last week issued a
report on cable industry competition that claims the industry
"posted strong growth over the past year."

The report said subscribership has increased by 2.5 million to
just under 60 million and average capacity has increased to the
point where 96 percent of operators provide more than 30
channels.

This hurts the industry's argument that it is suffering under
the increased rules.

The report also concludes that cable TV is still "the primary
distributor of multichannel programming to consumers," meaning
the FCC found there was only limited competition from digital
broadcast satellite (DBS) services or telcos offering video
dialtone.  It noted cable subscribership "continues to dwarf"
the combined subscribership of all competing services combined.

It also pointed to a increase in horizontal concentration of
cable systems, meaning that operators are consolidating,
particularly on a regional basis.  The industry now is
"moderately concentrated," it asserted.  About half of all 129
national programming services are vertically integrated -
meaning they also own a network - said the FCC, noting that this
total of programmers was up from 106 the previous year.

FCC'S 214 COFFERS DWINDLE AS AMERITECH YANKS ITS PERMITS

What once was a beanstalk-like stack of Section 214 filings
sprouting at the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC)
Common Carrier Bureau, now is fast dwindling to a mere mound.

Ameritech earlier this month relented its Section 214 permits -
authorization the telcos need to obtain before they can begin
building video dialtone (VDT) networks - just weeks before they
expired.  Current FCC regulations mandate that a telco act on
its permits within a year of its approval.

The FCC last December approved Ameritech's five applications to
construct VDT networks that would serve 1.2 million homes in its
service region.  Yet the telco, which has been plowing ahead
with plans to operate as a franchise cable operator, for now has
all but abandoned any near-term VDT plans.

"Right now it's full speed ahead with cable.  There were two
main reasons for the withdrawal," Ameritech spokesman Dave Onak
tells ITVS.  "We have been getting increasing community support
for us to operate as a cable franchise operator.  And the FCC
still has not finalized their VDT rules."

Ameritech currently has notched eight franchise agreements with
the local authorities primarily in the outlying areas of
Detroit.  The telco also has agreements with the Chicago suburb
of Glendale Heights and the Cleveland suburb of Berea.  In
addition, it has just begun the franchise process in Chicago to
provide service in that city's south side (ITVS Nov. 27, 1995).

Onak says Ameritech continues with its brisk construction pace
despite the fact that the FCC has yet to approve the
applications.  Additionally, Illinois cable operators are suing
the telco and the authorities in Glendale Height.

Nevertheless, Ameritech intends to begin offering programming
service during the first half of 1996, Onak tells ITVS.  "We've
got a court ruling that says we can do so, so why not?"

Programming will be selected and packaged by the Americast
consortium in which Ameritech is partnered with BellSouth, GTE,
SBC Communications and Disney.  Americast thus far has signed
agreements with Encore, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom and other
programmers (ITVS Dec. 11, 1995), and the original package will
comprise about 80 to 90 analog channels.

Ameritech is in engaged in franchise discussions with an
additional 40 communities across the Midwest, Onak says.  The
telco has no plans to attempt to provide cable service outside
of its five-state region.  "We've got enough to keep us busy in
our own backyard," he says.

During the past year a handful of telcos - including Bell
Atlantic and U S West -  have amended, and then outright pulled
their applications for commercial VDT before they ever got to
the approval stage at the commission.  Of concern is the rapidly
changing technological landscape and the commission's lack of
clarity on just how, when and where the telcos can operate VDT
service.

Bell Atlantic in the late spring withdrew two of its Section
214s and currently has only one 214 application pending, which
seeks to provide VDT service over a switched digital video
network in Florham, N.J.  The application was filed nearly three
years ago and spokesman Harry Mitchell tells ITVS the telco is
letting it sit because it includes up-to-date technology. Bell
Atlantic has no plans to file any other Section 214s in the near
future.

"The wild card is the federal legislation," Mitchell tells ITVS.
"We are prepared to make the filings if necessary but we are not
going to tip our hand if we don't have to."

The FCC says it will finalize its VDT regulations by early 1996
if the federal government does not pass telecom reform
legislation making it a moot point.

THOMSON BRIGHTENS STARSIGHT'S UNIVERSE WITH $25M INVESTMENT

On-screen program guide developer StarSight Telecast Inc. got a
hefty shot in the arm last week when Thomson Electronics agreed
to invest $25 million in the company, incorporate its technology
into its products, and engage in a joint marketing effort.

Thomson's investment, for which it gets 3.33 million shares of
StarSight common stock, buys the company a 13 percent interest
in StarSight, which also is owned by Viacom, Cox Communications,
Tribune Co., Time Warner and Providence Journal Co.

The proposed agreement also gives Thomson the right to acquire
up to 1 million additional StarSight shares during the next two
years at $7.50 per share and up to 1 million additional shares
of common stock during the next three years at $10 per share.

Under terms of the agreement, Thomson - whose U.S. consumer
electronics interests include RCA, GE and Proscan -  will
incorporate StarSight technology into selected product lines.
The cost to deploy StarSight ranges from $10 to $30 per piece of
equipment, according to Larry Wangberg, president and CEO of
Fremont, Calif.-based StarSight.

"Over time, as the cost of the memory goes down, this cost will
be reduced," he adds.  "Ultimately in the digital world the
deployment of StarSight will concern just the downloading of a
code, and that price, of course, will be very attractive."

Wangberg says the partnership greatly bolsters one of
StarSight's three core businesses - consumer electronics.  The
other areas of concentration are wholesale distribution and
licensing, which the company recently got into.

StarSight currently has agreements with 11 other electronics
manufacturers, and Wangberg says he expects they will react
favorably to the Thomson deal.

"I expect they are going to see this as positive news because it
greatly strengthens StarSight's financial position and ensures
that our business will continue to grow," he says.  Wangberg
also anticipates the Thomson investment, coupled with the recent
$5 million investment in the company by its current partners,
will carry StarSight through 1996.   He declines to project when
StarSight will stop bleeding red ink.

As part of the new agreement, StarSight and Thomson will jointly
market StarSight-equipped Thomson products.  "In some areas we
will be spending more money, and in other areas the spending
will be coming down," Wangberg says.  "It is very dependent on
the mix of revenue and the timing."

AT&T, HEWLETT-PACKARD PARTNER ON BROADBAND SOFTWARE PLATFORM

In a move Carly Fiorina, president of AT&T Network Systems North
America, called "creating a new center of gravity for the
industry," AT&T and Hewlett-Packard last week outlined a plan to
jointly develop turnkey broadband network solutions for public
and private wireline and wireless networks, including
interactive television.

Aside from developing technology and products for ITV - which
will come later down the line - the companies together intend to
create an open network software platform and develop
applications to run on it, according to Willem Roelandts, senior
vice president and general manager of HP's computer systems
organization.

AT&T Network Systems, which next year will split off from AT&T
as part of a separate systems and technology company, just weeks
ago at the Western Cable Show announced it was teaming with HP,
and cable modem developers Hybrid Networks and Intel.  The
cooperative plans to set specifications for interoperability and
develop products for high-speed PC delivery.

The announcement already has received "positive responses" from
Time Warner, Comcast and several other cable operators, Fiorina
says.

The new AP agreement advances their relationship much further.
The first fruits of the deal will see both companies immediately
selling  high-speed cable modems.  Fiorina says within six
months the team also will be building products and services,
eventually to include home shopping, video and telephony, around
a common protocol using HP's "Openview" and AT&T's "BaseWorx"
software.  The companies are working closely with CableLabs to
ensure their standard is the one adopted by the industry,
Roelandts says.

Within the next year, AT&T and HP also will introduce advanced
headend equipment and additional integrated data-management
software.   "We see the potential of this relationship extending
into the future beyond next year and we have high hopes for what
else we can do together," Fiorina says.

The companies together are taking a different tack than other
competitors, including Motorola, IBM and Microsoft, in a move
Roelandts and Fiorina say is by design.

"Microsoft is driven by a very different view of how the
industry will evolve, and I am relatively confident that our
view is backed by a lot of network service providers out there
that have invested a lot in their networks," Fiorina says.

"There is not much value to be derived from merely providing a
pipe with no value associated with it."

YOUR CHOICE TV  TO LAUNCH SINGLE-CHANNEL PPV SERVICE

Your Choice Television (YCTV) is planning to launch a single-
channel pay-per-view version of its time-shifted program service
aimed at making it easier for cable systems with limited channel
capacity to offer YCTV.

The new proposal, which will offer a limited quantity of popular
television shows, is the most low-tech level of Your Choice
service.  YCTV also offers a more  robust multichannel PPV
version of time-shifted programming and an application for real-
time video on-demand (VOD), which primarily has seen use only in
trials.

The single-channel service will come in six-hour blocks of
programming and will be delivered via YCTV's satellite, which
has been up and running since April.  Suggested retail price for
the new service will be 99 cents, according to Randall McCurdy,
YCTV's vice president of sales and distribution, who says the
price "is low enough that people don't think about the cost but
high enough that they associate some value with it."

McCurdy tells ITVS Your Choice already has agreements in place
with several cable operators for the new service, but declines
to offer specifics.

"We see this as a migration path," McCurdy tells ITVS.  "A lot
of our subscribers have systems that are currently in several
levels.  Some have real digital systems that they are testing
the delivery VOD on, some have systems ready for near video on-
demand and some are on the tail-end of the rebuild and are
locked into one channel for a good while.  This is a scaleable
solution."

McCurdy says the lower-level service is a good way for YCTV to
reach cable systems that might otherwise not be able to use its
programming.  "Initially there are a lot more operators with one
channel, so we will be able to reach a lot more people with this
first," he says.

As for YCTV's foray into the market, McCurdy says the company is
pretty much finished with participating in the trials of the
cable companies and telcos for now.  "We've basically closed
down the trial mode.  We are focusing on commercial deployment
now," he says.

INTERNET LIKELY TO DRIVE BUSINESS AGAIN THIS YEAR
Economic realities signal shift from interactive television

    In the world of interactivity, 1995 was the year when "interactive
services" and "interactive television" truly meant two different
things.
     The on-rush of the Internet through the computing platform meant
that interactive services predicted to thrive through the television
found a more immediate home.  Interestingly, the clarion call in 1996
of purists in the interactive television industry is that the Internet
is an intermediate step to true interactivity. 
      Observers say many issues are on the table for 1996, such as the
impending passage of the telecommunications bill now in Congress and
other policy issues, such as privacy.  In addition, many are waiting
to see whether cable modems will be deployed this year as cable
operators are predicting. 
      But most of all, said Peter Waldheim, chief executive officer of
the Interactive Television Association, Washington, D.C., the
"seamless process between PC applications and interactive television"
will continue unabated. 
     "We'll see a big push in the high-speed cable modem market to
deliver full-motion video to the Internet and create enormous
opportunities over the PC that don't exist right now.  And that, of
course, leads directly to the TV set," Waldheim said. 
     Many in the industry were caught off guard by the drama of the
shift toward the Internet and general level of interactive activity,
said John Hall, managing director, John Hall and Associates.
     "It's sort of been a Wild West year, '95," Hall said. " I think a
lot of us were taken by surprise by how much happened in '95."
     Indeed, Waldheim of ITA said companies are doing more trialing of
interactivity now than two years ago, despite some high-profile test
postponements. 
     Another key indicator of industry changes in 1995 was that the
base price the industry puts on bringing interactive services to the
home has dropped to about $1,000 per home, compared with the
assumption that an economic model would have to be between
$3,000-$5,000, Waldheim said. 
Thomas Cardy, senior vice president, Communications Equity Associates,
Tampa, Fla., said economic realities have led the shift to
Internet-based applications. 
     "Right now there's a proven market for online and computer based
services,   to the extent that you can interact and people are willing
to pay for it now," Cardy said.  "There's a business there.  There's
some question as to how you make money from an interactive television
service right now."
     Cardy said to a large extent interactive television is caught in
a generational quagmire, with older people satisfied to use their
television sets to watch TV. 
     "The folks who have the propensity to interact over some
electronic link, most of them already have a computer now.  The folks
that just have a TV probably don't have the propensity (to interact),"
Cardy said. 
     "Hall of Hall and Associates said it is doubtful that the
momentum built up in 1995 by the Internet's World Wide Web can be
sustained this year. 
     "I don't think it's possible or even healthy for the Internet and
access providers to grow at the same pace in '96 as they did the last
seven or eight months," Hall said.  "One of the critical issues in 96,
particularly for advertisers, is people are going to take a look at
the money they're putting in the web sites and take a look at the
bottom line and see what what's working."
        Analyst Connie Luecke, who follows regional telephone companies
for Duff & Phelps, Chicago, said many of those companies ae looking at
more immediate profit opportunities, such as in long distance, that
interactive television doesn't offer. 
        "I think they [RBOCs] have other things on their plate right
now that they're more interested in and more involved in," Luecke
said.  "From a perspective of what is going to be their bigger focus
and what's going to provide the most revenues and earnings over the
next few years, their focus is going to be long distance." 
   Robert Smith, president of the Interactive Services Association,
said companies will need to keep any eye toward regulatory issues in
1996.
    "You're going to see an increasing scrutiny of this industry by
federal and state government and legislators and regulators," Smith
said. "The online Internet industry is going
to have to deal with public policy makers in a very big way."

DBS COMPANIES SEEKING MARKETSHARE FROM CABLE
CATV operators keep upgrading to keep ahead

     The cable television industry spent its recent past trying to bar
the door to the euphoria of telephone companies inching their way in
on its turf through the lure of interactive TV.
But the rise of the Internet as an intermediate step to full
interactivity and the promise of quicker cash payoffs in segments such
as long distance have slowed some telecos' charge into video.
     Does that mean cable operators can retreat a bit into 1996 from
the threats to their bottomlines? Hardly.  Another relatively nascent
industry, direct broadcast satellites--those 18-inch dishes that
measure smaller than a patio barbeque--are giving cable a serious
scramble. 
DBS is "clearly an exploding market," said Harold Spielman, chief
executive officer of market researcher McCollum Spielman Worldwide,
Great Neck, N.Y.  And according to the Satellite Broadcasting &
Communications Association, 20 million U.S. homes will have satellite
service by 2000.
    "We know that RCA, for instance, has had difficulty just keeping up
on the manufacturing end of their systems, Spielman said, noting that
DBS street prices have dropped over recent months to below the
$600-mark for the equipment.  "I suspect we'll see the prices come
down more."

Fastest-Seller in History

     The largest DBS provider DirecTV Inc., a unit of Hughes
Electronic Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., for instance, unabashedly
calls DBS "the fastest selling consumer electronics product in
history."  Linda Brill, DirecTV director of communications, said the
service is up to 1.1 million subscribers after going nationwide only
in October 1994.
     DBS companies say they beat cable in choice, price and
variety--offering some 175 channels, including 60 pay-per-view
channels, and $2.99 movies every half hour.  And sports packages, such
with public policy makers in a very big way."
     The onslaught from DBS isn't expected to stop anytime soon. 
EchoStar Communications Corp., Englewood, Colo., successfully launched
its satellite into orbit Dec. 28, 1995, marking its corporate remake
from large to 18-inch dishes.
     "Our buy rates are 150 to 200 percent; cable is 30 percent,"
chimed Brill.  "Cable has had a monopoly now in this country for 20
odd years and consumers have been chomping at the bit for an
alternative."

Cable Acknowledges Threat

   Steve Effros, president of the industry group Cable
Telecommunications Association, Fairfax, Va., concedes that DBS has
posed a competitive challenge, but one that is no different than, say
"Ford is...to General Motors."
   Effros contends that cable and its 55 million households in the
United States haven't lost households to DBS, but that DBS largely has
been a rural phenomena where people don't have cable access.  
    "We have not seen any significant reduction in the numbers of
cable homes," Effros said. "Indeed, we've had the largest increases in
the last five years since DBS started.  You could try to suggest
that...we would have even larger increases if it hadn't been for DBS.
But I don't know if that's true."
     Effros said upgrading has been a way of life for the cable
industry in staying topical and meeting competitive challenges from
all rivals.  
      The key hardware announcement at the Western Show--that giant,
multiple system operators Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and
Time Warner Inc. invested $175 million to purchase 350,000 Motorola
Inc. CyberSURFR modems for initial installation in April 1996--showed
the industry's resolve to sniff out immediate cash opportunities while
it awaits interactive TV. 
    And, for instance, Cablevision Systems Corp., recently announced a
$300 million investment in a fiber-optic telecommunications system in
northeast Ohio that will bring video-on-demand, computer connectivity
and interactive services.

Always Upgrading           

    "We're always upgrading," Effros said. "This is just a constant
infrastructure process.  We can't move as fast as an industry that
just starts off with a given technology."
    A recent study from Frost & Sullivan estimates that expenditures
for cable associated hardware and technology services will grow by
about 6 percent per year to 1999 to $2.36 billion.  
    Effros said much is riding on the cable industry's development of
modem technology, as a way to help beat back DBS "as soon as we start
interconnecting computers via broadband systems because it's something
DBS can't do."

Industry Must Do More

    Spielman of McCollum Spielman Worldwide said the satellite industry
must do more to explain to consumers what it has to offer.
        "I think that the service deliverers have done such a terribly
poor job of explaining in their advertising what this is all about.
The consumer really does not know," he said.
    Spielman said DBS marketing is reminiscent of the "obscure"
advertising of home video cassette recorders when they were introduced
some 15 years ago.
        "I think that's the same situation with this," Spielman said. "
People do not know what a dish will do, what they will get from it.
They have no perspective on cost."
    Additionally, as new companies see dollars signs in DBS, some
question whether rivalries among the satellite firms companies will
stunt the industry's growth."

TELEPHONY, CABLE PROPELSALES OF VOD SERVERS 
Storage demands are expected to maintain impact on prices

     Telephone and cable television companies will be the two leading
segments that will drive the sales of video-on-demand servers through
2000, a research report says. 
    Sales of servers, which initially will be priced high because of
their storage needs, will increase from $131 million in 1994 to more
than $1.3 billion in 2000, according to the report,
"Video-On-Demand--Technology and Economics," from  Hodge Computer
Research.
     Each segment has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, the
report states. 
    "Due to recent legislation allowing telcos to deliver video
programming, they will become very large players in this arena," it
states.  "They will be able to deliver programming to their
subscribers on their own telephone lines. [These lines] may be used to
carry normal telephone traffic simultaneously with the delivery of
video."
     There is no reason to believe the telephone companies cannot be a
formidable force in video services, the report says.  They presently
are delivering programming in numerous test locations--and the
barriers to telco program provision are rapidly falling. 
     Telcos also have "direct connections to nearly every home in the
United States, or at least every one that would be a candidate for pay
per view (PPV) Interactive TV," according to the report, released to
IVN's sister publication Video Technology News.
     Cable operators, meanwhile, already have a large installed base
of video service subscribers.  The report estimates that there are
58.8-million cable households in the United States.  They are served
by 11,217 cable operators.
    "Only a few firms currently offer ITV services, and those only on
a trial basis," the report says.  "Total subscribers are estimated at
fewer than 5,000.  Of these, we estimate approximately 2,000 are
served by massive banks of VCRs into which cassettes are manually
inserted in response to the customer's telephone call."
    The percentage of cable subscribers who also have bought pay
services has declined steadily since 1988, when 85 percent of cable
subscribers (42.4 million) bought pay services, according to the
report.  By 1993 this percentage had decreased to 72.6 percent. 
(Because of the increase in TV homes, the actual number of pay
subscribers increased to 42.7 million.)
      Video servers initially will be priced very high due to the
immense amounts of disk storage and RAM memory required to deliver
hundreds of movies to thousands of subscribers, according to the
report.  The two most significant cost factors in a video server are
the disk farm on which the video programs are stored and the RAM used
to buffer the video data prior to transmission, the report explained.
      Hodge predicts that VOD server pricing will fall from $1.35
million in 1995 to $797,000 in 2000.

CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D, COMMUNICATIONS EXPECTED TO STORM MULTIMEDIA
MARKET

     Three-dimensional graphics, improved chip functionality and
enhanced communications are the top three developments expected to
penetrate the home market for multimedia in 1996.
     But don't anticipate major changes on the multimedia landscape
before the second half of the year, according to key manufacturers and
industry analysts, who spoke with Multimedia Week Editor Judith
Abrams.
    The most visible multimedia enhancement expected in the software
and chip businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.
    "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew of
features and performance that just aren't available today," said Ken
Wirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc. 
"By the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of
PC systems come 3-D enabled."                    
    More consolidation in the chip industry, with companies attempting
to buy each other and integrate several functions onto a single chip,
is expected in 1996, with companies that have strong markets in one
area (audio, video or communications), trying to expand.
    The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, but
more functions could be on the way.
    Whether new chip designs make it to the motherboard is another
question.
    Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, an
enhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia
extensions, sometime in 1996. However, "I don't think it will be ready
until the second half of 1996," said Richard Chang, an analyst with
Bear Stearns & Co. 
    Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means of
delivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in
1996.
    "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a game
through the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"
said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It
can take you two days to download the video we put on a couple of
CDs."
    Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmission
companies will begin work on new services, but delivering service is
another story.
    Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modem
technology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digital
simultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.
    Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.
    "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points." said
Robert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average
price will go down because of the growth in the budget category. It's
going to continue to sell."
    Meantime, multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to
drop prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995
will continue.
    "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that were
popular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with
International Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 price
points, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh
features.

COMPANIES POSITIONING TO DRAW IN CONSUMERS
Pricing models, security remain thorny issues

     As the delivery of interactive service made a sharp turn in 1995
toward the computer and Internet--and for now away from the
television--the star of electronic banking suddenly has never shined
so brightly. 
          Financial institutions, interactive services companies and
software developers all are positioning themselves to get electronic
banking in the forefront of consumers' psyche.
          Toward the end of last year, Intuit Inc. and America Online
agreed to offer banking to AOL members in the first half of 1996.  And
Microsoft Corp. outlined its plans for banking software in December. 
On the interactive television side, Barnett Banks in Florida signed up
with Time Warner's Full Service Network to create a so-called
"virtual" banks in the Orlando trial.
       Procedures, pricing models and security concerns all must be
worked out this year, but companies that deliver electronic banking
services say the potential for consumer acceptance is high, based on
high consumer reliance on automated teller machines and voice response
systems, experts said.
          "What we're beginning to see is sort of a seamless process
beginning with banks using PC applications for interactive banking
that will lead to interactive television banking," said Peter
Waldheim, chief executive officer of the Interactive Television
Association, Washington, D.C., which plans to release a study in the
first quarter of the year, "Interactive Banking at Home '96."
       "1996 will be a terrific year in terms of expanding the numbers
of banks now beginning to map their banks' future in electronic
media," Waldheim said.
    Indeed, many of the nation's major banks and financial services
companies, including Citibank, Wells Fargo and American Express
publicly stated last year that they would go a step further and offer
free electronic banking access.
     "It's really not about the financial institutions, it's really
about consumers and first making them aware and giving them a good
offer.  By good offer, I mean free," said Matt Lawlor, chairman and
chief executive officer of Online Resources and Communications Corp.,
McLean, Va. 
       Lawlor said pricing will be vital to consumer acceptance of
home banking.  Three pricing models are emerging, he said.  "If you
want the consumer in masses, then the pricing has to be down there. If
it's a bill payment then it ought to be down there where the cost of a
stamp is," Lawlor said. 
          Harold Spielman, chief executive officer of market researcher
McCollum Spielman Worldwide, Great Neck, N.Y., however, cautions
against euphoria over electronic banking. "This [electronic banking]
is one of those things where it seems to me its time for a piece of
good research on what people are actually doing or not doing.  It's
totally vague right now," Spielman said. 
      Catherine Corby, director of electronic delivery strategy for
Barnett Banks, Jacksonville, Fla., agreed that in 1996 banks will need
to show consumers how electronic banking will benefit them. 
    Telecommunications Research Inc., an Arlington, Va., researcher,
predicts that about 5 million U.S. subscribers will be banking online
by 2005. 
    A key issue to pushing electronic banking is deciding which
interactive services and software companies to partner with.  
     That presents a challenge for the banks since in the past they
have gone it alone when it came to innovation, ITA's Waldheim said.
      "One of the things that is very exciting about interactivity,
particularly interactive TV when it comes about, is that it will be up
to the cable company or the telephone or the platform to market the
bank to a certain degree. It's in their interest that banks on their
platforms are successful," Waldheim said.
     Security of accounts and transactions remains an issue, but many
industry officials believe that is easily and ultimately solvable
through marketing since consumers typically have confidence in their
financial institutions. 
    " As the banks move forward, they have systems to address the
security issues," Online Resources' Lawlor said. "What the consumer
will get is the confidence of their institution."

SKEPTICS OF ELECTRONIC BANKING WERE MORE RECEPTIVE LAST YEAR

    As director of electronic delivery strategy for Barnett Banks,
Florida's largest banking company, Catherine Corby spearheaded the
Jacksonville-based institution's recent inclusion in Time Warner
Cable's interactive television trial, Full Service Network, in
Orlando.
    In an interview with Interactive Video News Editor Marvin Greene,
Corby takes issue with electronic banking models proffered by software
companies and says financial institutions need to put the technology
on consumers' front burners.

IVN: What was 1995 like for electronic banking, and what's ahead for
this year?  

Corby: I think the skeptics were finally driven into seclusion [in
1995]. The key for really breaking out for the consumer is when we are
really using our PCs to receive mail.  Not just turning the PC on once
every two weeks, but having it become a vital part of our lives. 
     At the point that merchants can deliver bills electronically to
consumers on their PCs that are integrated with their financial
services programs or interactive services that they're working on, at
that point I think home banking will be prevalent.  Until then, I
think it's going to take customers with patience who are willing to
get around or overlook some of the shortcomings with the current
services, or institutions that simply don't overpromise what they
can't deliver.
     What I've learned from consumers after working with interactive
services for 15 years in the financial services world is if you do a
poor implementation of a technology, you set that opportunity back
several years because consumers have long memories about what didn't
work.  And it's hard to convince them it's better now.

IVN: Explain how electronic banking is going to work on the Full
Service Network in Orlando with Time Warner.

Corby: What we've tried to do is to create the same kind of an
environment that you have when you come into one of our current
banking stores, from the perspective that you learn about us, you
learn about our values, you learn about our products and services
through the merchandising that we do.
    When you come into our venue on the Full Service Network you will
be presented with the opportunity to walk around and browse as you
might in a store, or to go very quickly to the specific area where you
want to conduct a specific transaction.  We don't force you into one
mode or the other. The customer chooses...all in a virtual
environment. 

IVN: Your model of electronic banking differs from that of software
companies like Intuit and Microsoft?  What do you think of their
approach?

Corby:  If we keep going down the model that Intuit, for example, is
setting out, then the personal finance software becomes the heart of
the banking relationship.  And the information for any one financial
institution gets filled in.  In that environment, home banking becomes
defined as paying my bills, seeing my balances.  That is not a broad
electronic delivery service in the home.  That is a transaction
service.  
    For the financial institutions, if we go and accept that model and
don't challenge it and try to build more consumer value, then I think
we're going to be working ourselves into a very narrow place into the
home in the world of electronic commerce.  I think we have the chance
today, and that's why we got involved with Time Warner, to develop a
much more comprehensive service, one that really is an electronic
store.

IVN:  You have been quoted previously as saying home banking has to be
"engaging, informative and fun."  How do you make banking fun?  

Corby:  I think there are two ways you do it.  You take it just the way
retailers has managed to make shopping fun in stores while other
retailers have not paid any attention to it and have a totally
different market.  You can't make banking fun if it's looking at a PC
screen that has a bunch of account statements and numbers on it.
      But if you can create the store electronically and let people
browse, and go to what interests them and learn about you and your
institution through the electronic media, I think it's possible. The
other thing is you have to take all the clerical aspects of it away.

IVN:Do you think the television is a good medium for electronic
banking.

Corby:   I think the issue of TV or PC is irrelevant. Because the fact
is that      the TVs are becoming more like PCs and the PCs are
becoming more like TVs. What you need to think about is whether you're
talking about a 10-inch interaction or a 10-foot interaction, because
they are different things that take place in different rooms in the
home.  One involves group activity.  One involves more single
activity.  You have to think about it that way.
     I believe the 10-foot environment is a place where you can bring
financial services into the home. It's not necessarily where you're
going to sit down and do detailed financial management.  But that's
not what consumers do every time they think about doing banking. 
Sometimes they're curious and they want information. They're thinking
about, "Maybe I want to move to a new house and I wonder what's
involved."  
    If we can get ourselves positioned so that when they start thinking
about those kind of things, they think to turn to their financial
institution to learn. Then we're able to sell.

IVN:How big of a concern is security on electronic mediums for
consumers?

Corby:   I think it's a very big issue for consumers as well as for
financial institutions.  It's one that we're addressing. But it's a
huge issue and we're going to have to pay attention to it all along.

BELL LABS TOUTS VIDEO DEVICE

    Bell Laboratories says a 1969 invention, the charge-coupled device,
now used worldwide in solid-state video cameras, has become part of
the first panoramic viewer to provide a 360-degree live-action view
from a single vantage point.  The system can be used in a wide variety
of applications where other cameras cannot, such as movie theaters,
interactive TV, videoconferencing and home shopping.  It also could
provide panoramic surveillance in prisons, department stores, casinos
and day-care centers.   Unlike other panoramic viewers that use a
rotating lens or multiple cameras, the Bell device has no moving parts
and operates from a single vantage point, allowing it to be used for
both still pictures and full-motion video photography at all
distances.

CATV SERVICE GROWTH AHEAD 

    Paced by the upgrading of cable systems to offer telephony,
video-on-demand and interactive services like home shopping, U.S.
sales of cable TV-associated hardware and technology services will
grow from $1.78 billion in 1994 to $2.36 billion by the year 1999 at a
6 percent compound annual rate, projects a new Frost & Sullivan study.
In the study, "Profiles of CATV-Related Companies,"  services
including engineering, construction and network management will rise
from 10 percent of revenue in 1994 to 25 percent in 1999 and
transmission and distribution lines will increase from 15 percent to
24 percent. Competition will encourage cable operators to invest in
construction programs they otherwise might delay due to revenue losses
from rate reductions mandated by the FCC, the study said.

INTERNET SHAKEOUT PREDICTED

    Cable and telephone companies will create even more competition in
the increasingly crowded field of companies providing Internet access.
That will led to a shakeout of such providers, says a report by the
Yankee Group in Boston. There are more than 1,400 Internet service
providers to the corporate and consumer markets; Yankee predicts there
will be 60 providers by 1999.  "Most of the local `mom and pop'
operations and smaller regional providers will be crushed by their own
growth," said Greg Wester, Yankee research director.

ITV PROFITS EXPECTED IN 2001

    Ovum, a London-based market research company has issued the fourth
and final update to its report, "Interactive Television: the Market
Opportunity,"  which contains forecasts to 2005.  Principal report
author John Matthews said the United States will be the first area to
become "cash positive" in interactive TV, in 2001. In 2002, Europe is
forecast to make a profit on  capital investments.  The Asia-Pacific
region will not be profitable until 2005, the report said.  The United
States will have about 26.4 million households with cable access to
ITV by 2005, the report said.

TELECOM BILL DELAY STALLS INTERACTIVE INDUSTRY
Resolution of issues not likely until February

     Affordable technology and economies of scale have been the great
inhibitors to credible deployments of consumer interactive
applications.  Most industry observers point to the lack of investor
certainty in the legislative and regulatory climate as primary
culprits to the industry's stalled development.
     "The industry is waiting for Congress to provide the new rules
necessary in this new era of convergence," concedes Senate Commerce
Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-SD), the senator commissioned
with reforming the Communications Act of 1934 in the image of the
Republican Revolution. "And that is what we are trying to accomplish."
      Yet it appears that Congressional meddling has provided even
more uncertainty because of its inability to reach agreement among the
two chambers, with the communications industry, and with the White
House about how to pass a telecommunications regulation reform bill.
      The situation has been further exacerbated by the budget
impasse, which not only is preoccupying Congress and the White House
from completing legislation, but also is steadily deteriorating an
already contentious relationship between Congress and the White House.
       That contentious relationship between the legislative and
executive branches has resulted in constant changes to the bill
throughout the process as Republicans attempt to exert their
deregulatory vision of communications policy against constant veto
threats by the president.
        Regulatory attorneys have been taking advantage of the time
spent debating on legislation to provide their clients with the only
source of certainty.  "At least now we know how to manipulate the
system," jokes a Washington attorney who specializes in challenging
cable regulation.  
         The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) likewise has felt
the impact of the telecom legislation debacle, tentatively basing
regulatory decisions on the interpretation of legislative tea leaves,
yet unwilling to commit itself for fear of alienating a Congress that
has threatened its very existence.
       Investors, however, want to know that if they invest in new
interactive technologies and new applications, communications
attorneys representing potential competitors will not cause delay.
      "Most technology-driven cable companies and interactive
application start-ups are severely undervalued right now," says Philip
Getter, vice president of investment broker Josephthal Lyons & Ross,
New York.  "Investors are skittish about committing money to an
industry with an uncertain regulatory future."
       The answer, investors and industry players agree, is a quick
resolution to Congressional efforts at completing telecommunications
regulation reform.  "The potential benefits of this bill to the
interactive, multimedia, and entire communications industry is mind-
boggling," says House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Jack
Fields (R-Texas).  
       With a completed bill, investors would get their certainty,
lawyers will still have work to do during the transition, start-ups
will have access to more capital necessary for interactive
applications, and consumers will receive a litany of choices to
communication providers, most of which will use interactive
application to differentiate their value.
       Currently, a conference committee report, dated Dec. 22, 1995,
is being circulated around the Hill awaiting signatures from
conference participants to buoy support in preparation for a vote in
both chambers.  
       In that conference report, the cable industry would be freed
from pricing regulation three years after the enactment of the bill,
unless they face "demonstrable and effective" competition, in which
case they could expect immediate relief upon FCC approval.
    The hold up, however, is on the liberalization of foreign ownership
restrictions and cyberporn regulation.  Advanced TV spectrum policy --
whether to auction it or provide it for free to incumbent broadcasters
also is an issue of substantial contention that drew comment from
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS). The Clinton administration claims
that the auction of broadcast spectrum could garner $50 billion for
the U.S. Treasury, a "hysterical" estimate, according to Republican
staffers. 
        Congress and the White House have until Feb. 20 to resolve the
issues, though, as the Senate will not consider any unscheduled votes
until then.  Although the House has looser rules about votes this
session, the less disciplined bunch has more Republican Revolution-
oriented issues to take up while the Senate gets its schedule in
order.
        Many observers consider the cable provision, though, the most
important for the interactive industry because the cable industry is
most likely to pursue the more complex consumer applications.

EURO HDTV SOON TO BE A REALITY?

The United Kingdom has finally backed down and
reached an agreement with its other European partners
over a high definition television strategy for
Europe.

After over three years of wrangling and debate, a
united EC stance has now been made leading to the
possible development of a HDTV standard in the future
(Satnews passim).  A meeting of the EC
Telecommunications Ministers agreed upon a GBP160
million subsidy and the rights for broadcasters to
choose the most advanced broadcast technology
available.  The Council of the EC has now accepted
the 'Action Plan' produced by the telecomms
ministers.

The UK had consistently objected to the GBP700
million subsidy plans raised by community members and
the backing of D2-MAC as the transmission standard on
the grounds that the technology could soon be
superceded by digital HDTV services and that the
imposition of a standard was protecting businesses
rather than the consumers.

Patrick McLoughlin, the newly appointed trade and
technology minister, said after the meeting on 16
June: "European companies can now be at the cutting
edge of this technology and UK providers will be well
placed to take advantage because of their expertise
and experience."

McLoughlin replaced Edward Leigh in an internal
government reshuffle. Leigh caused a May meeting of
ministers to stop making a critical decision on the
future of Euro HDTV after he left early to attend the
launch of Astra 1C.

"This is an excellent outcome for Europe and UK
industry and consumers.  After three years of hard
negotiation we now have a realistic and forward
looking action plan for the development of the coming
generations of TV technology," said McLoughlin.

Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that the funding
would be used to introduce widescreen HDTV television
programme production, transmission and marketing, but
it would be available on a co-financing basis.
Participating companies will have to find at least 50
percent of the total sum required before applying for
an EC subsidy.   Community funding will be phased out
on a sliding scale as time goes on.

"Early entrants in both the developed and less
developed markets will qualify for maximum support
because they accept the highest risks.  Those
undertaking HDTV will also receive a special quality
premium for the same reason," said the EC statement.

IBM 'FINALLY' ANNOUNCES EURO SATCOMMS SERVICE

IBM has finally announced the official existence of
its IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to the
chagrin of the other satellite network operators who
are keeping a somewhat discrete silence over the
whole affair, reports Data Broadcasting News, the
sister publication to Satnews.

After many months of waiting and broken internal
deadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of the
new service to become officially released.  Many
software revisions and internal quality assurance
certifications contributed towards the internal
delays.  Many observers who have seen the system
believe that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.

The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK.

Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s can
be attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The
"general availability" date is slated for 30
September 1993.  Countries will be free to set their
own dates.

Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 to
the power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.
Error correction significantly reduces this
occupance.

IN SatConnect is designed to be operated
independently of other telecommunications networks,
although it can be linked with the existing IBM
Information Network services like the IBM Information
Exchange EDI service to collect data. With the
system, the information provider will link into IBM's
network to transmit data for distribution. Receive
sites will use conventional VSAT hardware combined
with IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSAT
receivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centre
of the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.

Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,
and advanced data masking technology has been
included to provide integrity for transmitted data.
As the system is digitally-based, video, audio and
data can be merged and transmitted securely.

Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at a
set time even though it has been loaded by the
information provider onto the transmission system in
advance. Real time data throughput will be supported
on the system during 1994 once a second release of
software is made during December 1993.  IBM is
presently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"
who wish to send large files to multiple locations
rather than the continuous small-file feed companies.

Real time feeds are considered an important business
area and they will be approached once a steady stream
of customers has been found.

The information provider is charged for connection to
the SatConnect service. There is an initial charge of
GBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for the
transfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use is
charged according to a tariff.  Receive sites cost
GBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual charge
thereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,
existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40
percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costs
down significantly in the process.

Individual per-megabyte charges will be GBP12.40
after the initial 500 megabyte threshold has been
passed.

IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. to
market and distribute its satellite receiver
equipment.  Although IBM is not making the use of
Comstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing the
potential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstream
equipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-
IBM product" and will feature in all promotional and
sales literature.

The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellite
broadcast receiver and LNB are provided under the
marketing agreement.

One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth can
be changed "over the air" in accordance with users'
needs.  The DBR401 receiver will have four pre-
selected data rates programmed as standard reducing
the requirement for field maintenance.

Data sent to the receiving PS/2 computer can
immediately be routed to a LAN server or mainframe if
required, thus freeing local receiver resources and
permitting the prompt processing of data.

* Minimum system requirements for the PS/2 receiver
are: MCA-based bus; 20MHz clock speed; 8MB RAM; slot
for IN card; RS-232 port; OS/2 version 1.3 standard
edition or OS/2 version 2.0

IDB OPENS UK C-BAND EARTH STATION

IDB Communications Group has formally inaugurated
service to its 11-metre C-band earth station in the
United Kingdom.  The station, located at Brookman's
Park outside London, is the first privately-owned C-
band uplink in the UK and the first IDB owned and
operated facility outside of the US.

Brookman's Park is the location of a large array of
transmitting apparatus for the British Broadcasting
Corporation, the UK state broadcasting company.

The earth station will be utilised by IDB Worldcom,
the telecommunications arm of IDB, in cooperation
with the Russian Satellite Communications Company
(RSCC) to operate StatCom, a voice and data
communications service linking the US and other
European cities with the Russian Federation and CIS
countries.

A Russian Statsionar 5 satellite located at 53
degrees east longitude will be used to host the
service.  Customer premises equipment providing
connectivity to the network will comprise of
integrated 3.8 and 4.5 metre C-band earth stations.
StatCom has been running since May 1993 with a
temporary 7 metre antenna.

IDB hopes that emerging and isolated businesses, such
as the oil and gas companies, will find the service a
more viable and cost-effective method of
communications compared to present-day alternatives,
such as the Inmarsat system.

Edward Cheramy, president of IDB, said: "The oil and
gas industry is expected to spend over US$20 billion
in the next decade, developing oil and gas fields in
the Russian Federation and the newly independent
states.  It is estimated that telecommunications
expenditures will surpass US$300 million during that
time period.  IDB and RSCC are well positioned to
serve these major telecommunications requirements."

* RSCC is a state enterprise of the Russian
Federation Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

EC TO ADOPT COMMON APPROACH ON EARTH STATIONS

A recent meeting of the Telecommunications Council of
the European Community has passed a draft directive
aimed at creating a single market for satellite earth
station equipment.

If approved, the directive will assist the
manufacturers of satellite communications equipment
achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete
effectively in European and world markets.

The directive, COM(92)451, would extend the ruling of
directive 91/263/EEC on telecommunications terminal
equipment to include the harmonised certification and
testing of equipment and to guarantee the use of
approved satellite communications in all member
countries.

"The development of satellite communication has been
up to now held back by the fragmentation of the
Community market, in contrast to the situation in the
US where this technology is more widespread," said an
EC statement.

INTEGRATED INMARSAT-M TERMINAL LAUNCHED

ABB Nera has launched a new integrated satellite
telephone system that utilises Inmarsat's newest
Inmarsat-M personal communications standard.

The new offering, known as Saturn Mp, is being aimed
initially at journalists and other world travellers
who require voice and data communications services
often where terrestrial alternatives do not exist.

Saturn uses Inmarsat-M, a new digital satellite
communications standard that has enabled significant
call tariff reductions and reductions on the size of
transmitting and receiving apparatus.  The unit
weighs a total of 9kg and measures 405 x 290 x 120mm,
and is encapsulated in a lockable briefcase.  The
antenna and RF electronics are integrated into the
briefcase's lid.

"The media often find themselves in parts of the
world where conventional communications systems are
frustratingly poor or simply do not exist.  The
Saturn Mp provides them with an instant method of
communication from virtually anywhere in the world,"
said Martyn Braime, managing director of ABB Nera.

ABB already produces a range of communications
equipment for land and marine use, and the latest
product will help complement its existing portfolio
says the company.  ABB also claims to be the UK's
largest supplier of satellite equipment for use on
the Inmarsat system.

"SECURE" VIDEOCRYPT HACKED --CLAIM

Videocrypt, the ever-powerful video encryption system
marketed by News Datacom has been hacked, according
to top signals piracy specialist John McCormac.

There have been many hacks on the Videocrypt system,
but McCormac says that the present one is the most
damaging to date, and it addresses key flaws in the
security system.  It has been tested by McCormac and
confirmed to decode all Videocrypt channels.

Quaintly named as "Ho Lee Fook", the piracy work is
claimed to be based within Central Europe.  The hack
works by effectively acting as a super Videocrypt
smart card, giving unlimited access to channels.

"The card is approximately 16 millimetres longer than
the official Sky card. It is a blue printed circuit
with a single surface mount chip and five connector
pads," said McCormac, explaining that unlike other
hacks, this one does not use a wafer from a usual
legitimate card, but is instead a specially-
engineered chip.

During a period of testing no "kill" messages were
sent to the card, shutting off service to the BSkyB
channels.  McCormac speculates that a filter may have
been added telling the on-board circuitry to ignore
kill or disable messages sent within the Videocrypt
datastream.

Commercially, the hack may be renamed SVA1000, but
like many things in the hacking marketplace, things
can change on a daily basis. Commercial piracy
marketers will incorporate the HLF hack within
existing decoders, and a price point of GBP99 has
been mentioned in some circles.

Due to UK legislation, it would be an offence for
Satnews to give details of the marketing source in a
UK-published publication.  There are reports that one

TCI TURNS EAST FOR CABLE

Telecommunications Inc., the world's largest cable
television operator, is looking East with the
investment in Cable Soft Network, a supplier of cable
TV programmes to Japan's 160 cable TV operators.

The investment, worth around US$2.8 million, follows
on from investments made by rivals Time Warner
Entertainment into Japanese cable television
operating companies.

When compared to the US marketplace, the Japanese
market for cable television services is quite
immature.   Over ten million people nationwide tune
into US cable systems, compared to 700,000 people
tuning into Japanese services.  Japanese industry
forecasters expect this figure to rise to over one
million households by the end of 1994.

EURO-TURNER STARTS, NTL UPLINKS

Turner Broadcasting Systems says that TNT and The
Cartoon Network, its two new European distributed
television services, will commence operations on 17
September 1993 aboard the Astra 1C satellite.

And National Transcommunications Limited (NTL) has
been awarded a five-year contract to uplink the two
channels.  The channels will be originated and played
out at Chrysalis Television Facilities in London and
uplinked from NTL in Winchester.

Alastair Hamilton, director of satellite systems for
Turner International, said: "After careful
consideration of all the uplink proposals, we felt
that NTL offered us the best technical solution, and
in a timeframe commensurate with our launch plans for
the new network."

NTL is noting an upturn in demand for satellite
uplinking services, and it is presently building a
new teleport at Winchester to cater with forecast
demand.  A digital pipeline will be serviced to
London to carry programming sourced by broadcasters
using London either as an origination point or a feed
point through the BT tower.

NTL already has an uplink location in Croydon near
London and in central London on the Chrysalis
Television building. It also services occasional use
clients through its Rapido flyaway terminals.

Initially two 8-metre uplinks have been installed,
although an 11 metre and an 13 metre antenna are
planned.  NTL believes that its Winchester location
is particularly well suited for uplinking because of
the relative RF-free environment.

"NTL is uniquely positioned to provide uplinking to
Astra 1C from our teleport near Winchester," said
John Okas, business development director at NTL.  "We
are delighted to be serving Turner International and
we expect to sign other contracts shortly.  NTL is
now an established force in satellite broadcasting
and providing real competition to BT."

CAMBRIDGE CONFIDENT OF EXPORT BOOM

Cambridge Industries, formerly Cambridge Computer, is
confident that its 1993 export sales will be better
than previous years because of its new ARX200
receiver.   The receiver was launched at Cable &
Satellite '93, and significant interest was shown by
dealers present at the launch.

Alan Oxley, export sales manager for Cambridge, says
that the new product has especially been welcomed by
multi-lingual customers because it can easily receive
transmissions from different satellites, with a
number of decoders being connected into the receiver.

"In Mainland Europe, Astra and Telecom [band] twin
systems are becoming more popular.  We predict demand
will be high enough to introduce a twin LNB input
version of the ARX200 by September, to simplify
installation and remove the need for a switchbox,"
said Oxley.

THREE-FOLD EXPANSION SET FOR EURO DMX SYSTEM

International Cablecasting Technologies -- ICT Europe
-- says that they are expanding their 30-channel
digital music delivery service to 86 channels only
months after the network's European launch.   The new
service will make DMX the largest delivery route for
continuous music presently available.

Jerold Rubinstein, chairman and CEO of ICT in the US,
said that the new enhancement would retain the
company's competitive edge and enable it to give
European cable network operators a greater level of
flexibility in the customisation of channel offerings
in accordance to local tastes or network
restrictions.

Initially the system will be increased from 30 to 60
channels by October 1993, and this will in turn be
increased to 86 channels by the end of 1993.

Included in the new European channel line-up are
specialised international formats such as World Beat,
Flemish Music, Irish Folk, Hebrew Traditional and
Indian programming.

"At DMX we are, and always will be, a music
programming service.  As we move forward into
narrowcasting and niche programming, we reaffirm our
vision of DMX as a music service dedicated to
offering subscribers more choice, more variety and
more of the music they want," stated Rubinstein.

The new channels to be carried on ICT Europe's DMX
service are: German (Easy Listening, Oldies/Schlager,
Folk, Hits & Rock); French (Chansons/Easy Listening,
Hits, Oldies & Chanteuses); Dutch (Easy Listening,
Hits, Dutch Mix, Flemish Mix, Oldies & Childrens);
Irish (Folk); Swiss (Folk); Spanish (Flamenco);
Nordic (Swedish, Norwegian and Danish); Israeli
(Hebrew Hits, Hebrew Traditional); Italian
(Traditional); Russian (Hits) and Ethnic (Indian,
Turkish & Oriental (Eastern Mediterranean).

Satnews has requested an evaluation model of DMX from
ICT and will provide a full review for subscribers
once it has been received and evaluated.

At the National Cable Television Association show in
San Francisco, ICT unveiled DMX Select, a 'music
library in the sky' which offers virtually limitless
digital audio programming options to the cable
television operator.  With the new system, operators
will be able to customise the DMX offering.  Some
cable systems will not be able to distribute the
additional music channels planned by DMX, and the DMX
Select unit will enable them to mix and match
channels to form a composite output.

SETTLEMENT OVER INTELSAT LAW SUIT LIKELY

A litigious law suit between Intelsat and Martin
Marietta has reached a tentative settlement over the
controversial launch of Intelsat 603, a satellite
stranded in low orbit that had to be recovered by US
Space Shuttle astronauts.

A joint statement by the two parties said that the
companies had negotiated terms to settle the
litigation.

Martin Marietta sued Intelsat, seeking relief from
future damages claims. Intelsat counter-sued for the
value of the satellite, lost revenue, and recovery
costs for the satellite.  The satellite has now been
relaunched and is operating successfully.  Martin
Marietta admitted that its Titan rocket failed to
launch the satellite, but pointed out that Intelsat
had 'self insured' and agreed to fund all losses in
the event of a claim.

A US District Court hearing had preliminary came down
in favour of Martin Marietta, although a federal
appeals court sent the decision back to the lower
court, saying that it should look whether Martin
Marietta had made its best effort to launch the
satellite.

The companies have agreed on terms to settle the suit
and agreement from the Intelsat board of directors,
set to meet in September, is now required.  The
companies are remaining tight-lipped over the other
conditions and terms.

Intelsat previously contracted with GE Astrospace to
purchase two satellites. In April, Martin Marietta
purchased GE Astrospace's parent company, making it
fighting against a company it was doing business
with.

Some industry sources say that the agreement is
likely to be based on Martin Marietta honouring the
GE Astrospace contracts with a significant discount
plan.

CIT UNVEILS NINTH ANNUAL SATCOMMS REPORT

The London-based research organisation CIT Research
has launched its ninth annual report into Satellite
Communications in Europe.  The 1993 report analyses
the changes that have been made in the European
marketplace over the past year, and forecasts how
they will change over the short to medium term.

During 1992 satellite carriers (such as Eutelsat,
Inmarsat and PanAmSat) earned ECU835 million from
European operations, with broadcast television
accounting for 55 percent of revenues.  Business
services accounted for 14 percent and telephony for
31 percent of revenues.  Eutelsat was the dominant
carrier, closely followed by Intelsat and SES, owners
of the Astra satellite.

CIT says that Astra has managed to get the reputation
of being a "hot bird" for European television
distribution (DTH), much to the dismay of Eutelsat,
and SES revenues are likely to be ECU220 million in
2002, compared to ECU270 million for Eutelsat.

Clearly Eutelsat's perceived dominance will fall with
SES' rises.

By the close of 1992, CIT estimated that there were
around 6.7 million DTH terminals in Europe, with the
UK and Germany responsible for 77 percent of the
share.   Low cable penetration (and take up) and
strong programming markets were cited as drivers for
this demand.

In Eastern Europe, CIT believes that there are around
800,000 DTH terminals installed, with 44 percent of
these in Poland.  Consumer weakness in the former
Eastern European countries is seen as a barrier for
the introduction of cable television networks or
premium programming.  Instead, viewers are likely to
tune into free satellite delivered programming,
maximising their resources after purchasing a
satellite receiver system.

Digital compression of signals is also set to pose
some benefits to European broadcasters and viewers
says CIT.  "The arrival of digital compression will
eventually radically change the structure of the
satellite TV marketplace, although CIT feels the
change will not be as fast as many insist," says the
report.

BSKYB AND QVC FORM EURO SHOPPING NETWORK

British Sky Broadcasting and QVC Inc. have joined
forces to launch a 24-hour service headed live from
London from 1 October. The service would be carried
on the Astra 1C satellite.

The new alliance was formed at the National Cable
Television Association exhibition.

Barry Diller, chairman of QVC said: "I could not be
more pleased to form a partnership with BSkyB to
bring home shopping to the UK and beyond."

Diller believes that the UK has great potential for a
teleshopping success, and that it would not face
adverse competition from existing teleshopping
companies.

Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and British Sky
Broadcasting, said: "We are amazed at the growth of
direct selling by television and think this will add
a new dimension to BSkyB."

Spain and Portugal will not be covered by the BSkyB
venture, as they are being handled through a deal
with Grupo Televisa, signed in April, which will
provide a Spanish language service for Brazil, Mexico
and Spain.

CONFUSION OVER C-SMATV LICENCE REQUIREMENT

A ruling by the US Supreme Court says that federal
regulation of the cable television industry extends
to satellite systems that serve apartment buildings
with more than one owner, even though no public
access right of way is used.

The ruling reverses a federal appeal court ruling
which said that such communal systems were exempt
from regulations.

Under the 1984 Federal Cable Communications Policy
Act, a franchise is required by operators who provide
service over a cable system, but an exemption was
made for operators who "..serve only subscribers in
one or more multiple unit dwelling under common
ownership, control or management" when no public
right-of-way access (such as a street or pole) is
used.  The common instance of this exemption is where
the owner of an apartment installs a satellite dish
on the roof and installs a distribution circuit into
individual apartments.

The latest ruling upholds the opinion of the Federal
Communications Commission.

the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, an
organisation set to up to increase television choice
in rural areas not served by conventional cable
networks.

The first DirecTV satellite is to be launched later
this year, with a second satellite a few months
later.  North American viewers signed up to the
system will be able to view up to 150 channels of
free, subscription and pay-per-view programming from
April 1994 using equipment manufactured by Thomson
Consumer Electronics and sold under the RCA branding.

BRIGHT FUTURE FOR ARIANESPACE SAYS BIGOT

Arianespace has clearly demonstrated its expertise in
the commercial space transport business over the past
five years, according to chairman Charles Bigot at
the recently Arianespace shareholders' general
meeting.

Since it began launching satellites, an average of
seven launches a year have been made by the company,
bringing in handsome revenues and rewards for the
company.  Bigot says that the success has been due to
regular and consistent operations, coupled with
commercial success that continues to consolidate
Arianespace's position as the "..world leader in its
business."

Announcing Arianespace's 1992 results, Bigot said
that total revenues were FFr4.85 billion, leading to
a FFr145.5 million net profit after charges.  A
FFr1.6 billion provision for technical and commercial
risks of launch has also been made.

In the last 18 months, Arianespace has booked 19 new
orders, helping consolidate its position in a
fiercely competitive marketplace.  Business in the
Asia-Pacific region has also been lucrative for the
company, who expect to make greater inroads into that
marketplace in the coming months.

Arianespace now has 40 satellites waiting to be
launched aboard its Ariane 4 launch rockets, worth
around FFr18 billion in revenues and contracts.

The company is slowly preparing to roll out its
Ariane 5 launcher and expects these to enter service
late in 1996.  Arianespace has signed a contact with
Societe Europeenne de Propulsion for Vulcan engines
which will be at the heart of the new systems.  A
three-year transition period will follow where Ariane
4 and Ariane 5 launchers are used according to launch
needs.

Many other companies, particularly those in the Far
East and former USSR, are looking at satellite
launching as a lucrative source of revenue.  Bigot
says that Arianespace believes that excessive
protectionism is not the best way to counter the
threat, but rather create structured competition
allowing the free-market forces to rule.

Arianespace recently signed a contract to launch an
Israeli Amos-1 telecommunications satellite in 1995.
The satellite, referred to as having military
applications, is being used for civilian purposes
says a spokesman for Arianespace.    Since 1988
Israel has launched two satellites into a low earth
orbit as part of a trial of a military communications
and reconnaissance network say observers.

FBI INVESTIGATES COURTROOM SNOOPING

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been joined into
an investigation by judges after a TV station allegedly
hid cameras throughout a courthouse in Cincinnati to see
whether court employees were loafing.

Judges at the Hamilton County Common Please Court ordered
the investigation after the allegations were levied
against WKRC-TV.

Presiding Judge Thomas Crush says that he was told by a
station reporter that the cameras had been installed to
monitor work output by county employees.

William Moll. president and general manager of the accused
station, said that the company would cooperate fully with
the investigation and that disciplinary action could not
be ruled out after the investigation is concluded.

The FBI was called in as US federal law prohibits the
electronic interception of others' communications when
they expect privacy.    Cameras were found after a search
of court rooms.

TALK SHOW CHANNEL LAUNCHED IN US

A new 24-hour talk show format cable television channel
has been launched, with the announcement made at the
National Cable Television Association conference and
exhibition.  Multimedia Entertainment will launch the
channel late in 1994.

Paul Fitzpatrick, former president of the Weather Channel,
will head up the new channel which is designed to offer
all new programming focusing on the major breaking news
topics of the day in a talk-show format.

Key interviewers and personalities will augment studio and
telephone participants.  The majority of new talk show
hosts used by the channel will be 'home grown' and
developed as the channel progresses.

Interaction from viewers is being seen as a key component
for the venture.  A database will be kept noting people's
interests, and should a topic suddenly become newsworthy
they will be called and their views and comments sought
for use on air.   Extensive use will also be made of
viewers' polls and opinions.

Multimedia Entertainment says that the launch of the
channel is the result of extensive research conducted over
several years that has highlighted a niche for the
channel.

"Cable operators will find The Talk Channel to be an
attractively priced alternative to some of the programming
options currently in the marketplace," said Fitzpatrick.

PANAMSAT INTRODUCES COMPRESSED VIDEO SERVICES

PanAmSat has recently started the operation of the world's
first commercial compressed digital video service for
multinational programming distribution.

A 24-hour CDV feed with MTV Latin America, Fox Latin
America, NBC Canal de Noticias, Cinecanal and TV5, was
initiated on behalf of programmers who wished to relay
services into the region.

Long-term agreements with broadcasters have been signed.
Programming is relayed by fibre to PanAmSat's Homestead,
Florida, USA uplink and operations centre before being
encoded and compressed using GI's DigiCipher 1000 Milti-
Channel Per Carrier product.

The use of DigiCipher enables six channels to be carried
in the same bandwidth formerly used by one analogue
signal.   By the end of the year, PanAmSat will be
distributing the CDV signals to around 500 cable headends
and wireless cable installations in Latin America for
rebroadcast.

"PanAmSat's success in Latin America has proven the need
for innovative satellite technology," said Fred Landman,
president of PanAmSat.  "Our reputation as the preferred
satellite in Latin America promoted demand we could not
keep up with.  By using compression, now we're once again
able to provide 24-hour broadcast distribution services on
PAS-1."

GENERAL DYNAMICS DISCOVER ROCKET FAILURE

General Dynamics Corp. say that a loose screw led to a 25
March malfunction of an unmanned Atlas rocket, whose
failure left a US Navy satellite in a useless orbit.  The
failure has now been corrected and will not hinder future
launches.

"General Dynamics believes, and the independent oversight
review board concurs, that it has taken a conservative and
prudent approach to the corrective action needed to return
Atlas to flight," said a statement issued by the company.

A US Navy satellite, manufactured by Hughes Aircraft,
entered a worthless orbit due to a malfunction stemming
from failure of a precision regulator in the Atlas
booster-engine power control subsystem, leaving it 3000
miles lower than a contractually required orbit of 9000
miles.

The failed launch could not have came at a worse time for
the company as it was the first of nine launches for the
US military in a three-year, US$1.6 billion programme.

Some industry analysts believe that the March failure will
make it hard for General Dynamics to win future business,
especially in the face of already stiff competition.

ADVERTISING FAILS TO MAKE MARK ON SATELLITE

In their thirst to maximise revenues, satellite
broadcasters are often failing to take into account the
needs of advertisers, instead concentrating on the
introduction of subscription services, a report published
recently claims.

Datamonitor published a report which says that revenue
from satellite advertising will contribute around 8
percent of all Europe-wide satellite channel revenues by
1997.  Advertising is set to account for US$761 million
(10 percent) in 1993.

The report says that by 1997, revenues from subscription
services will be worth US$16,500 million.  Datamonitor
cites a claim that many advertisers are feeling deprived
of valuable viewer penetration by the subscription
channels, or are being held to ransom for occasional
spots.

Many channels that do accept advertising are often
comparatively unwatched when compared to the blockbuster
subscription channels.

FCC DELAY TO COST CONSUMERS US$250 MILLION

A decision by the FCC to delay the enforcement of new
cable television regulations until 1 October will cost
consumers more than US$250 million in overcharging,
alleges a congressman and consumer advocate who backed the
legislation.

The FCC estimates that most cable companies are
overcharging customers by around US$1 billion per year in
total.

Republican Edward Markey, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications subcommittee and Gene
Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America are
dismayed by the FCC's decision.

FCC Chairman James Quello says that the delay was due to
the lack of funding required to hire accountants and
attorneys to do the work demanded by the law.

"Going forward [with the legislation] at this time would
have resulted in mountains of complaints and certification
requests piling up at the commission, leading to chaos and
confusion among subscribers, cable operators and
franchising authorities, and resulting in numerous legal
challenges," said Quello.

MURDOCH MAKES BID FOR HK COMPANY

Rupert Murdoch has announced intent to purchase a 22
percent stake in the world's leading producer of Chinese
language television fare.

News Corp. has agreed to buy the stake of Television
Broadcasts Limited, although the deal is subject to
regulatory approval.  Sources say that the stake is worth
around US$237 million.

Foreign companies may not own more than 10 percent of a
Hong Kong television company without approval being
granted by the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority, and a
stake of more than 15 percent cannot be held without full
government approval.

An application for approval has been received by the Hong
Kong government, and a decision is likely to take several
weeks.

A News Corp. spokesman, quoted in an article in the South
China Post, says that the company is confident of winning
government approval, yet it is prepared to fight if
necessary.

SPECIAL REPORT: CABLE IN THE HEARTLANDS
Satnews looks at the inroads cable television and
telephony has made into the Midlands region of the UK

Cable services across the Midlands are as diverse in style
and nature as the region itself. The heartland of Britain
is a centre of major development and innovation in the
cable business.

Twenty-three of the UK's cable franchises are located in
the Midlands. Not all are operating, but the region as a
whole is currently at the forefront in terms of cable
construction with seven major developments each having
more than 2,500 connections. Coventry Cable, which began
in 1985, is now one of Britain's few completely-built
systems (another is in Aberdeen, also owned by the Devanha
Group).

The Midlands region comprises three distinct conurbations
or groups of cities. Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, each
with active cable systems, form the backbone of the East
Midlands; to the West current cable activity centres on
the Birmingham/ Black Country conurbation and Coventry,
while development has yet to begin in the Potteries.
Annual cable investment in the region is currently
approaching GBP100m, with a total capital spend which will
eventually reach about GBP750m.

Many aspects of the cable business nationwide are
concentrated in the region: from telephony to specialist
programme services. Nearly a third of the Birmingham
system's subscribers use cable for their telephones, for
instance, and about half of the cabled homes in one
district of the city subscribe to TV Asia at GBP7.95 a
month.

The region, although large, in practice has cable
operators who are mostly independent from each other in
ownership. The only joint effort is the advertising sales
co-operative between Midlands Cable and Birmingham Cable.
Between them they could command a million homes - the two
largest franchises in the country.

The geographical diversity is complemented by a wide range
of potential subscribers from a notably multi-ethnic
audience. A quarter of the population of Leicester, for
instance, is of Asian origin. Fourteen per cent of people
living in Birmingham have Asian backgrounds, rising to 50
per cent in the Small Heath area. The next programming
opportunity in Birmingham is for its considerable Irish
population, though its 40,000 members are more
widely-spread than those of Asian origin.

Satellite receivers have taken their share of the
potential business of course, but Ted Campbell, Managing
Director of Birmingham Cable Limited, does not see them
outliving the arrival of cable services in an area: once,
that is, people have had dishes for a year or more and the
pain of paying for them has been blunted by time.

Sidney Bernstein was said to have chosen the North-West to
start Granada Television because he thought it was always
raining and people would stay indoors to watch television.
Ted Campbell says there are not all that many
opportunities for the mass of the scattered Midlands
population to find entertainment outside the home as might
be the case with the London entertainment circuit.

Subscribers are also responding well to the offer of
residential and business telephone lines, coupling a state
of the art network and locally based service with lower
tariffs. Birmingham Cable is now installing Northern
Telecom DMS 100 switches costing more than GBP5 million,
with a capacity of 73,000 lines. The company already has
almost 27,000 residential telephone connections, a third
of 3,000 potential business lines installed and about
2,000 telephone-only subscribers.

Eighty-three per cent of calls in Birmingham are local.
According to Ted Campbell, city-based operators find it
more profitable to use their own local lines instead of
those of BT or Mercury. In smaller towns, the proportion
of local to long-distance calls would be lower, thus
diminishing the benefits of self-drive telephony.

The other major franchise holder in the central Midlands
conurbation is based in Dudley. Midlands Cable, currently
completing a partnership agreement with Cox
Communications, covers Wolverhampton and the Black
Country, and by the end of March had passed 63,000 of the
potential 470,000 homes. It had made 11,917 connect ions -
a penetration of 19 per cent. Midlands' second franchise
is based on Telford with a potential 55,000 homes, 18,000
of them so far passed.

In the East Midlands, Gary Davis, Managing Director of
Nottingham-based Diamond Cable, thinks the region is so
cable-active because 'the Midlands has seemed to me very
progressive: ready to accept change and try new products.'

Diamond, owned by Alabama-based businessman Allan J
McDonald, has seven franchises which together represent
about 519,000 homes. Six of these are in the East
Midlands. Gary Davis was a communications lawyer in the US
who migrated into cable development. His wife Sandy Davis
is Customer Services Manager at Diamond Cable.

Telephony is the spearhead of Diamond's marketing. In
mid-April Diamond had 3,000 cable television subscribers,
4,400 residential telephone subscribers and 100 business
telephone subscribers. The company was the first in the UK
to have its own telephone exchange. Diamond Cable's 42
programme services include two text-based local services,
one of which is produced in association with Radio Trent,
the local independent station.

Martin Beard became General Manager at Coventry Cable
Television in January 1992 - three months after the
Devanha Group took over. Coventry were early starters in
cable, and the franchise area covers about 119,000 homes.
The company does not currently offer telephony, but
discussions are in hand about its development. Coventry
offers 29 channels, including its popular COLT (Coventry
Local Television) channel. This is still expanding its
output and plans to put out ten hours a week of
substantially local programmes during this summer

On the city's place in the cable market, Martin Beard
comments: 'Coventry is a good prospect for cable. It has
long traditions at the forefront of innovation.' With new
credit control policies in place, Coventry Cable is
looking for growth this year and believes it is on a good
footing to make that happen. It is marketing a positive
image, an increased level of customer satisfaction and
better programme product.

Alan Chaney became Chief Executive at Leicester
Communications Ltd in March, when SaskTel took over
control, although he had been associated with the
Leicester, Loughborough and Shepshed franchises since
1988. Although it is a minority share, Leicester
Communications remains the only UK cable company to have
local authority investment.

Construction was halted about a year after the start of
building, but is now resuming. The company has pushed up
its penetration rate in recent months to 27 per cent and
Alan Chaney predicts that it could rise to between 30 and
40 per cent.

It is now launching telephony in Leicester and hopes to be
offering it to some 3,000 homes by autumn. Chaney feels
that the telecommunications development will greatly
increase the system's marketing potential.

Leicester currently offers 34 channels, although the
system has potential for 55. Cable 7, Leicester's licensed
local channel, was launched last summer.   The Community
Channel Manager, Jenny Ludlam, now has about 100
volunteers providing ideas and programme input. The
channel transmits eight hours of local programming a week,
ranging from the care of pets and finding homes for them
to religion and reports of Leicester City Council
meetings.

One proud achievement of Derbyshire Cablevision, according
to General Manager Keith Tonge, is that in 18 months of
building more than 80 miles of cable, the company had
received only 12 complaints. 'Derby is one of the best
cable franchises to have. It has the benefits of being a
concentrated area to build in, but the city itself has not
suffered many of the inner urban social problems which
have been a feature of other cities,' said Keith Tonge.

Derby has a text channel giving out local information, but
the company's Community Liaison Officer, Rachel Turner,
has also been developing an interesting local project with
schools. Six Derby schools - three of which are already
cabled - are producing videos on environmental issues in
their areas. Derbyshire Cablevision plans to screen a
compilation tape when they are complete.

The outer edges of the Midlands region also have some of
the country's most interesting cable developments:
Northampton, with a massive 56 per cent of homes connected
from those passed, is involved in a transition from
narrowband to broadband; Milton Keynes, where virtually
everyone is connected to one of the oldest of the
industry's networks, is also being upgraded; and Swindon,
the first UK cable franchise which, by the end of March,
had risen to one of the country's highest ratios of homes
connected at 32.7 per cent.

As the man said, you have to speculate to accumulate. The
diversity of the Midlands has attracted many different
aspects of speculation. And accumulation - of both
connections and services - is now firmly in the category
of the pipeline rather than the pipe dream.

NEWS IN BRIEF

Following the announcement by US President Clinton that
the US was going to develop a modular space system derived
from the original "Freedom" concept, the director-general
of the European Space Agency, Mr Jean-Marie Luton, has
affirmed his satisfaction at the news and confirmed that
ESA will work together with NASA on development work for
the station.

NTL has won the Peter Wayne award for design and
innovation at the Montreux television symposium (ITS) for
its System 2000 video compression equipment.  The annual
award is presented in recognition of good design, quality,
technical excellence, value for money and innovation.
System 2000 enables four or more digital TV channels to be
transmitted on a carrier that would usually support one
analogue signal.

The Second European Space Agency Electronic Components
Conference was recently held at ESTEC in Noordwijk, the
Netherlands, and attended by over 300 specialists from 20
countries. The conference concluded that the market for
high reliability space components is rapidly changing,
that the complexity of electronic components used in space
programmes is increasing, that programmable integrated
circuits are needed in space programmes and that the
exchange of data and information regarding components in
space applications is necessary.

Satellite television equipment dealers Electrotech in the
UK have introduced a new GBP16 flat price service repair
charge for equipment returned, guaranteeing the goods to
be repaired and returned and replaced within 72 hours.
The offer applies to equipment produced by Maspro,
Echostar, Palcom, PACE, Amstrad, Panasonic, Nokia, Hitachi
and JVC.

Cambridge Cable Limited, the cable television franchise
operator in the UK, is now offering free installation of
telephone service even if customers do not subscribe to
its cable television service.  The company hopes to
attract customers who do not require extra television
channels but wish to make considerable call savings over
BT and Mercury Communications.

Muzak has signed a multi-year contract worth US$2 million
with Antex Electronics Corp. for a new satellite
downloadable message system.  The digital system allows
the recording and playback of digitized audio messages and
schedules for use within retail shopping organisations.

Funding for BBC World Service Television should be taken
out of the hands of the UK government's Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, said shadow Heritage Secretary Ann
Clwyd at a recent lobby aimed at defending broadcasting
institutions.  WS is likely to make severe cuts after
being advised of budget cutbacks by the FCO.  Clwyd said
that the WS was one of the UK's best ambassadors and that
it should not face such financial restrictions.  BBC WSTV
is not affected by the planned cutbacks.

Hughes Communications Inc. and IDB Broadcast have signed a
long-term transponder lease aboard Galaxy 1R.   IDB will
market digitally compressed transmission services aboard
the transponder, and it already has its first customer
with Action Pay-Per-View, a 24-hour programmer of action
and adventure movies.  The C-band service will be aimed
primarily at cable network operators.

Digital Cable Radio in the US has expanded its service to
offer 57 channels of music programming.  One new channel
includes a news and information service as well as a
background music service aimed at businesses.  DCR is also
continuing to provide digital audio simulcasts of basic
cable TV channels such as HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, VH-1 and
MTV.  DCR has also signed an agreement with Time Warner
Cable to roll the service out to around 825,000
subscribers this summer.

A strike by television language dubbers in Spain is likely
to leave viewers lost for words.  Spanish viewers tune in
avidly to dubbed foreign programming, but a strike by
around 1100 dubbers seeking a uniform pay scale since 24
May means that TV operators have run out of dubbed
programmes in Spanish and Catalan.  Non-union dubbers are
being drafted in to ease the situation, but many
programmes are still not being dubbed.  The union is
urging viewers to complain to the TV networks.

There have been reports of interference caused by Astra 1C
to Eutelsat II F3 (16 degrees east longitude) on receive
dishes less than 90cm.  Although the Astra 1C satellite
has yet to complete testing and enter service, some
interference has been noted on 'common' transponders.  SES
and Eutelsat are actively monitoring the situation.

Hughes Communications Inc. and General Communications Inc.
have signed an agreement to extend GCI's long-term
transponder lease on Hughes' SBS 5 satellite until the end
of its life, presently estimated to be late 1999.   The
Ku-band transponder will be used to continue the provision
of network services through VSAT terminals.

IDB Communications's IDB Mobile Communications subsidiary
has signed a two-year Inmarsat-A service distribution
agreement with Sea Link Limited, whereby Sea Link will
coordinate mobile satellite voice, fax and data
communications services to Canadian and other
international users.  The global service will be provided
through IDB earth stations in California and New York, US
and Gnangara, Australia.

The European Commission is reviewing plans by Itochu
Corp., Mitsui & Co., Sumitomo Corp. and Nissho Iwai Corp.
to set up a joint venture in Europe to market satellite
communications equipment.   The EC has until the end of
June to review the proposal and to decide whether it will
have an impact on the existing marketplace.  If approved,
the companies plan to merge their business interests into
a new company called Newco.

A study by the University of Pennsylvania's Anneberg
School of Communications says that US television remains
largely white, male, middle-class and not middle age.
George Gerbner, dean emeritus of Annenberg, said that the
School studied 10 years of prime time television shows,
nine years of Saturday morning programming, various cable
shows, a week of daytime television and game shows and a
week of TV news.  Gerbner said that the average US home
watches TV for around seven hours daily and television
'seems to be frozen in a time-warp of obsolete and
damaging representations.'

Countdown has began for the launch of Arianespace flight
57, which will see the launch of Galaxy IV into a
geostationary orbit.  The launch, from the Kourou space
centre in French Guiana, is set for early  24 June.  At
the time of going to press there were no delays on the
launch schedule.

Telecommunications Inc., the largest cable television
company in the US, says that over half the television
stations on its systems have agreed not to charge it fees
to retransmit its programming, an action brought around by
the new Federal Cable Law.  Many operators are working
with TCI to create new ventures and regional activities by
means of complimentary recompense.

IDB Communications Group Inc. is planning to offer US$150
million of convertible subordinated notes due in 2003 in a
bid to raise additional funds, said a registration
statement filed to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Jean-Claude Jumel, a soundman for the French TF1
television station has been killed by a sniper while
covering the fighting in Mogadishu. A driver for France-2,
a rival station for TF1, was killed the previous day in a
similar incident.

The Taiwanese Economics Ministry has signed a letter of
intent to participate in the US$4 billion Iridium global
satellite communications project headed by Motorola Inc.
The Ministry filed the letter of intent on behalf of
Pacific Electric Wire and Cable, who plans to invest US$80
million into the venture.

An executive of one of the Italian media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi's companies has been arrested on suspicion of
corruption. The arrest follows a large purge of corruption
in Italian government and business society.  Aldo
Brancher, assistant for special projects at Fininvest
Comunicazioni has been held on alleged suspicion of
channelling funds to political parties.  Berlusconi has
already been interviewed as part of the investigation.

Cable television operators in India will have to
retransmit oat least one Doordarshan (state-owned)
television channel of their choice and conform to
programme and advertisement transmission codes under new
lows formulated by the Indian government.

Preparations are underway at the Indian Space Research
Organisation for the launch of the Indian-developed Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) in the second week of
August.

SES are to interrupt transmissions to the Astra satellites
for half an hour on 23 July and 22 October for routine
maintenance purposes.  The outages will take place from
0315-0345 UTC on the two occasions.

Inmarsat has finalised the running order for its Second
International Conference and Exhibition on Mobile
Satellite Communications, set to be held in Paris, France
during October 1993.  Over 140 speakers from around the
world will participate in the conference.

Nickelodeon, the new BSkyB/Viacom backed children's
entertainment channel destined for life on Astra 1C will
commence transmissions with Videocrypt encoding on 1
September says the company.

ESPN, the US sports network, is planning to launch a
second channel on 2 November. ESPN2 will carry coverage of
college basketball, NHL, autoracing and US football.  ESPN
is also looking at transmitting the signal
internationally, and are holding talks with prospective
international partners.
 `
Sources say that National Cash Registers (NCR) is looking
to introduce a European-wide business television network
that will supplement its existing video conferencing
links. NCR is a large user of business television
resources in the US.

Intelsat has appointed Donald Wear Jr as General Counsel,
the principal legal officer for the organisation.  Wear
has an extensive media legal background and currently has
his own practice.

Steven Cooper has been appointed as Sales Manager for
Europe of Echosphere International.  Cooper worked for a
number of communications-related companies for some time
before joining the company as a regional sales executive.

Hong Kong-based Star TV has signed a distribution and
operating agreement to serve households in Malaysia,
Thailand and Egypt, as well as opening eight regional
offices in Asia. An operating agreement for Sri Lanka will
shortly be signed.

Northern Telecom Europe has received a multi-million pound
contract for the provision of Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy (SDH) equipment by Encom, a UK cable TV
operator, which will be used to provide advanced network
communications services to customers and the company at
large.

A US federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit claiming that
television stations repeatedly aired a 90-second video of
Rodney King's beating by LA police without permission from
the original videographer.  The judge ruled that George
Holliday did not have sole rights to the home video as
other networks had the right to air it because of its
social impact.

Rohde & Schwarz has introduced its SWVF TV Network
Analyzer which can be used as a network analyzer,
intermodulation analyzer, spectrum analyzer and sync and
pulse test signal generator. The product is available from
R&S stockists.

A US television programme featuring nude bible readings
was pulled off a public access cable system in Thurston
County, USA.    The programme was not pulled off the air
because of its content, but because police asked for a
temporary suspension to the programme because of a death
threat against the preacher.

According to reports from the Russian Space Ministry, A
Russian communications satellite has been lost in a low
orbit after the booster rocket apparently ran out of fuel.
The Horizont satellite, launched from Kazakhstan, is
effectively useless because of the failing of the Proton
rocket.

The European Commission has rejected the first of Norway's
membership demands [to the EC] after it wanted to ban
cable television networks from advertising for alcohol.
The EC believes that its existing regulations are already
quite stringent.

Speculation is mounting over ASDA, a UK national food
retailer, following claims that it is dropping the use of
In Store Radio Limited, a Norsat subsidiary, for Radio
Retailing.  A Norsat source says that the move will be
made on 1 July.

Turner Broadcasting has confired that it will develop two

NORTH AMERICAN SIGHTINGS
By Robert Smathers

The Galaxy 4 launch scheduled for June 9 was delayed.  The
cause  of the delay was a possible electronic abnormality
in the launch  vehicle.  As of this submission, no new
date for the launch has  been set, but the launch was
expected to be tried again in one to  two weeks.

The Caribbean Super Station has moved transponders
recently.  They used to be seen on Galaxy 6/22, but now
they are on Galaxy  7/22.  CSS is a occasional video
service, usually seen in the  evenings a few days a week.

NHK Japan has moved transponders on Galaxy 6.  They used
to be on  Galaxy 6/18 but now they are on Galaxy 6/22.
This NHK Japan  channel is the circuit from New York to
Tokyo.

The CBS Television Network Contract Channel on Galaxy 6/7
has  appeared more often as of late.  Usually only feeds
to the network have appeared, but recently there has been
a slate announcing G6/7 as CBS TV and that slate has been
up quite often.  It is expected that the CBS Television
Network will occupy Galaxy  6 and then "hot-switch" onto
Galaxy 4 when G4 is launched and  becomes operational.

SATELLITE TV EVENT OF THE WEEK:  The main event this week
was the  United States military action in Mogadishu,
Somalia.  The  military bombed and destroyed some
strategic targets of a warlord.  Coverage was found on the
newsfeeds of the networks as  well as an occasional feed
on Telstar 301, Telstar 302, Galaxy 6,  or Galaxy 7.  I
assume the majority of the coverage of this  military
action was found on the Atlantic satellites where all  the
major networks have their contract channels on an Intelsat
to  carry coverage from Europe/Africa back to the United
States.

UK:  CANADIANS BATTLE FOR YORK

Bell Canada may take over the unstarted 90,000-home franchise of York
and Harrogate from Yorcan if agreement can be reached on price and
management control.  Bell would want Jones Cable, in which it has a 30
per cent stake, to manage the franchise.  Yorcan, which should have
passed 60,000 homes by end-1993, was seeking investors to take 80 per
